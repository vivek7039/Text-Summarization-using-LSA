4 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Bakkavor is the leading provider of FPF in the UK and has a 
growing international presence in the US and China. Our 19,000 
employees operate from 39 locations, including 24 factory sites, 
three distribution centres and a head office in the UK, three 
factories in the US and eight in China, to develop and produce 
innovative fresh prepared food for a wide variety of occasions  
and budgets.
In the UK and the US, the Group works with leading grocery 
retailers, focusing on their own label brands, to support them  
in differentiating their product offering. In China, the Group 
supplies international and local foodservice operators.
In partnership with its customers, Bakkavor has led the way in 
developing the fresh prepared food market in the UK, one of the 
largest and most dynamic fresh prepared food markets in the world. 
The Group has used this expertise to grow and develop its 
presence in the US and China, with both these markets showing 
strong growth in the high-quality, fresh, convenience food sector.
Bakkavor’s proven business model, combined with the  
Group’s extensive insight into consumer trends and its ability  
to turn this insight into creative commercial product offerings, 
gives the Company a clear competitive advantage in this  
growing market.
The Group reports its business performance under two segments: 
United Kingdom and International.
UK
Bakkavor employs approximately 17,000 people in the UK and  
is the number one producer by market share in each of the four 
UK FPF categories: meals; salads; desserts; and pizza & bread.
Customers include all the well-known UK grocery retailers,  
who sell Bakkavor products under their respective brands. 
In 2017, over 500 new products were developed in the UK in 
conjunction with customers.
We operate a complex operating model and sites are operational 
24 hours a day, 364 days a year. Given the short shelf-life of 
products, sites receive orders ‘on-the-day, for-the-day.’ In order 
to fulfil orders on time and in full, labour and materials are 
ordered in advance which requires a skilled planning process. 
Bakkavor’s success in this area is evidenced by more than 99%  
of orders being completed on time, ahead of the industry 
benchmark of 98.5%.
Strategic positioning
• Operating in attractive markets
• Leadership position across all four product categories
• Strong insight, innovation and new product development focus
• Expanding customer base

International
The International business comprises the FPF market in the  
US and the international and local foodservice market in China. 
Bakkavor employs over 550 people in the US and around 1,600  
in China, having operated in both countries for over 10 years. 
The Group believes it is well-placed to influence and develop  
these markets, leveraging its UK expertise. Both markets  
have demonstrated a growing demand for fresh, high-quality, 
healthy and convenient food options.
Strategic positioning
• Strong understanding of markets and long established 
presence
• Leverage UK expertise and insight for competitive advantage
• Significant opportunities for growth
• Increased purchasing power for raw materials

5 STRATEGIC REPORT
I am delighted to report, in our first set of results 
as a public company, a year of good progress in 
line with our plans.
Group revenue from continuing operations increased by  
4.6%
1
 to £1,814.8 million, adjusted EBITDA
2
 increased by 4.2%
  
to £152.6 million and operating profit increased by 5.1% to  
£96.2 million.
In the UK, our business is based on strong, long-term customer 
relationships and this has helped us to manage the impact of 
inflation which, together with good volumes, has resulted in 
revenue growth of 4.6
 
%
1
. Innovation is at the heart of these 
relationships and during the year we launched over 500 new 
products for our customers, such as the UK’s first ever range  
of charcoal-base pizzas to create further differentiation in  
the market.
Our International business is much smaller, but growing in line 
with our plans. We have seen this particularly in China, where  
our customers are expanding rapidly and extending their fresh 
offering. In the US, we are steadily pushing out our boundaries, 
both geographically and in terms of range, as the market develops 
its taste for fresh prepared products. The new dedicated factory to 
service a significant customer in Texas is on track and expected to 
be operational in the second half of 2018.
Although we continue our investment in both new facilities and the 
upgrade of existing factories, cash generation in the year was 
strong, and this, combined with the benefits from the March 
refinancing and the listing proceeds received, resulted in net debt 
being just 1.8 times adjusted EBITDA
2
 at the end of December.
Looking ahead, whilst we see the widely reported risks to the  
UK economy from inflation and some general uncertainty around 
the Brexit process, we believe that Bakkavor is well-placed for 
continuing profitable growth in a segment of the food market 
which is still showing strong dynamics. We continue to take a 
long-term perspective of our business and any passing turbulence 
will not deflect us from the strategy we are working to. Growth 
prospects in our international markets remain very positive and 
we will capitalise on these in the coming years.
We are very proud to have become a listed company in November 
and I would like to welcome the many new shareholders who have 
joined us at that time and since. 
In October 2017, I succeeded Lydur Gudmundsson as  
Chairman. Lydur is the co-founder of Bakkavor and, along  
with Agust, takes credit for building the business into what it  
is today. His experience and knowledge remain invaluable to  
us and I am delighted that he will continue to be part of the  
Group Board. Meanwhile I welcome Sue Clark, who joined us  
in November, and I am also delighted that Denis Hennequin  
has become our Senior Independent Director. Jane Lodge  
also joined us as an independent Non-executive Director on  
3 April 2018 andI welcome her too.
Bakkavor employs more than 19,000 people across the Group, 
including 17,000 in the UK. They all work at the highest standards 
to make great tasting food consistently and safely. Many are 
potentially impacted by the Brexit process and we have been 
working to support them at a time of significant personal 
uncertainty. I would like to thank them for their contribution,  
on which these results have been built.
As set out in the public listing prospectus, no dividend will be 
declared in respect of the 2017 financial year. The Group has 
confirmed its intention that a dividend equivalent to 40% of 
adjusted profit after tax for the financial year 2018 will be paid, 
with an interim payment in September 2018 of approximately one 
third of the expected total for the year.

CREATE 
VALUE
INSIGHT AND INNOVATION
We use insights gained through our 
investment and analysis of consumer 
research and data, as well as our  
knowledge of food trends sourced  
from around the world, to gain a good 
understanding of what consumers want.

8 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report OUR PURPOSE 
is to develop and produce innovative, commercially successful food 
that offers choice, quality, convenience and freshness
PROCURING AND PLANNING 
Our procurement teams work with 
selected growers and suppliers to source 
raw materials in the right quantities at  
the right price. They buy from over  
50 countries with no single supplier 
accounting for more than 3% of orders. 
Our planning experts ensure we can  
meet the daily orders of our customers by 
analysing product demand and planning 
production accordingly. As well as raw 
material planning, this also involves 
efficient staff planning and a mix of both 
permanent employees and agency workers 
to meet seasonal demand.
COMPLEX MANUFACTURING
Our factories are operational 24/7, 364 
days a year, providing over 2,000 different 
short shelf-life products to customers 
every day.
We operate a ‘just-in-time’ model, using 
fresh raw materials to produce only what 
is required to meet our daily orders and we 
have a proven ability to deliver high-quality 
products to customers. 
Essential to the success of our ‘just-in-
time’ model is our logistics expertise in 
managing our inbound and outbound 
supply chain. Raw materials are supplied to 
our factories and finished products are 
delivered on time through our distribution 
centres into customers’ depots.
FOOD SAFETY EXCELLENCE
We manufacture food that is not  
only great tasting for consumers,  
but also meets the highest standards  
of safety. 
Sites are audited regularly, often on  
an unannounced basis, by internal  
food safety experts, customers and 
independent bodies for compliance  
with food safety standards. 
We employ more than 500 food  
safety professionals and conduct  
over 2,000 in-house microbiology  
and chemistry tests every day.

9 STRATEGIC REPORT
MARKET OVERVIEW
Whilst the Group operates in three very different geographical 
markets, the overarching trends that drive demand in these 
markets are shared. It is our ability to anticipate and translate 
these trends into commercially successful products that helps 
drive our performance and long-term growth.
Consumers are changing the way they shop for food, looking for 
convenient products and solutions that meet specific occasions  
or needs to support their lifestyle.
Trends such as the rise in single person households and fewer 
shared meal occasions have driven a shift towards convenience as 
shoppers buy fewer single ingredients to make their own meals. 
Fresh prepared food has proven popular with the over-45s who 
have grown accustomed to the convenience it offers and, as life 
expectancy increases, demand for these types of products is set 
to continue.
The amount of time spent cooking has approximately halved  
in the last 30 years, with people opting to make quick, quality 
meals to fit around their busy lifestyles.
THE LONG-TERM TRENDS DRIVING THE UK FRESH PREPARED FOOD MARKET 
Consumer tastes are changing, with an increased desire  
for healthy, fresh and nutritious products and snacks that  
are hard to replicate at home and expensive to make from 
scratch. Demand for more of this type of food can be  
seen through increased health-focused ranges such as low 
calorie, vegan, high protein and gluten-free or free-from  
products or meals.
In addition, the frequency of shopping trips has increased,  
with more individuals choosing meals at the last minute,  
impulse buying and trying new products. Major grocery retailers 
have responded through further investment in the convenience 
store format, increasing their commitment to fresh prepared  
food and using the category to differentiate their own brands.  
In addition, consumers are increasingly confident about ordering 
fresh prepared food online, which is further supported through 
delivery options such as ‘click and collect’.

10 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report We specialise in fresh prepared food which, by its nature, involves sourcing many 
types of fresh fruit and vegetables in the creation of thousands of different recipes.
For instance, we use around 80 different salad leaves and herbs such as wild rocket,  
baby spinach and flat leaf parsley, and over 100 different vegetables from Charlotte 
potatoes to Chantenay carrots.
Our ability to source the best ingredients originates from our fresh produce heritage,  
a partnership approach with our growers and having our own agronomy and procurement 
experts who ensure we have a consistent, high-quality supply.
“We have worked with Bakkavor for 22 years and have a long 
history of growing and developing together.”

blog.bakkavor.com STRATEGIC REPORT
1. LEVERAGING NUMBER  
ONE POSITION
†
 IN THE UK
Bakkavor’s strategy in the UK is to leverage its number one 
position in the fast-growing FPF market. 
Our strategy centres on the following key areas:
• Strengthening partnership arrangements with  
existing customers
• Exploiting insight, innovation and breadth of capability
• Pursuing strategic investments to accelerate growth
We seek to deliver these strategic priorities and enhance 
our number one position through our dedicated customer 
teams, our commitment to operational excellence and our 
ongoing capital investment programme.
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR 2018
We continuously invest in new insights through our dedicated 
team, which is hugely valuable in evaluating evolving consumer 
trends. We have already seen growth in such areas as gluten-free 
products, which have delivered incremental sales and, in the 
coming year, we will be developing further our ‘free-from’ 
proposition, capitalising on these trends where we identify 
long-term potential.
We continue to closely monitor developments in the wider  
market, responding to changes in category dynamics. As 
previously mentioned, in response to ongoing consolidation  
in the desserts category, we are making a material investment  
in our desserts business, which will come online during 2018  
and provide the necessary additional capacity to support our 
growth plans.
STRATEGY IN ACTION
Bakkavor has long-standing relationships of over 30 years with  
its four largest customers. During the year, we continued to 
develop these relationships with several significant business  
wins, commercial launches delivered to plan and category 
innovation that builds the pipeline for 2018.
2017 was a particularly successful year for innovating our  
offering and broadening our categories. We have seen good 
volume growth within our core business, working with  
customers on product and packaging innovation to create  
further differentiation in this market.
Our ongoing investment programme of around £50 million per 
annum ensures we have capacity in place for medium-term 
growth across all categories. However, expected demand in  
our desserts business requires more substantial expansion.  
To address this, the Group has approved a multi-million pound 
investment in its Newark desserts site. The investment will add 
capacity across desserts and also provide market-leading 
innovation capabilities. 
STRATEGY IN ACTION 
In our International markets of the US and China, we benefited 
from strong market growth as the uptake of fresh prepared food 
continued to accelerate. We remain active in strengthening and 
developing partnerships with retailers and food service operators 
in our key categories. 
In the US, the Group focused on developing its positions in 
attractive key categories  — dips, soups and sauces and ready 
meals. We continue to see growth in these categories and will 
invest to further enhance capacity and capability. 
2. ACCELERATING GROWTH IN HIGH-
POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
Bakkavor has developed a strong presence in the attractive 
markets of the US and China, where the Group has 
operated for over 10 years. Our international strategy will 
leverage our expertise in the UK to further support the 
strong foundations now in place. 
To accelerate growth internationally, we are focused on:
• Developing strong customer partnerships 
• Establishing leading positions in key categories  
with a view to achieving nationwide supply 
OUR STRATEGY
DELIVERING LONG-TERM  
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
The Group’s core strategy of delivering long-term sustainable growth is focused on developing  
its businesses in the UK and internationally, while continuing to improve operational efficiency.
This strategy is underpinned by a continued focus on customer needs and service, selective  
partnerships and strong financial disciplines.
† OC&C Strategy Consultants' analysis of multiple sources.
12 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report In addition, in the US, we extended our relationship with  
a customer beyond our existing partnership with one of its 
subsidiaries, and as a result, we are now producing ready meals 
for a second major subsidiary.
Bakkavor has also partnered with a significant new US customer, 
and as a sign of the strength of the relationship, we are currently 
investing circa $31 million in a new facility in San Antonio, Texas, 
to support the large scale roll-out of fresh prepared food to its 
stores in Texas. 
In China, we have benefited from the rapid rate at which our 
customers are expanding their store and restaurant portfolios.  
We continue to invest in these partnerships and support their 
plans for growth through increasing our capacity and extending 
our geographic reach.
We continue to focus on the foodservice market and will also  
seek further opportunities in the retail convenience sector. For 
example, we have initiated trials for replicating the successful 
fresh soups business that has been established in both the UK 
and the US. In China, we also continued to test the convenience 
market with our ‘Fresh Kitchen’ range of prepared meals where 
initial consumer response has been very positive. 
Alongside these developments, we remain committed to investing 
in our infrastructure to build strong platforms for growth and have 
expanded our teams in the areas of marketing, insights, technical, 
HR and finance, which increased our costs for the year, and 
positions us well for the future. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR 2018
Our continued international growth rests on our ability to keep 
pace with our existing customers’ growing requirements. To that 
end, we are making large scale investments in capacity in both  
the US and China, much of which will come online during 2018. 
In the US, a key focus is the development of our close partnership 
with a significant customer, including the opening of the new 
dedicated facility, expected in the second half of 2018. In China,  
we will be completing the construction of a state-of-the-art 
factory, located just outside Shanghai in Haimen, giving us 
increased capacity to access the affluent east of the country.  
This facility is also due to open later in 2018.
We are also expanding our category presence internationally, 
bringing our expertise in chilled bread to both markets in 2018 
with the opening of new bakeries. As always, we will embed 
dedicated resource from our UK operations as additional  
support to ensure successful launches within this new category.
3. IMPROVING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
Bakkavor continues to invest in operational efficiencies 
across the Group to support its strategy. These investments 
are underpinned by Bakkavor’s operational finance team, 
created by bringing some of the Group’s manufacturing  
and finance leaders together to work across the Group  
as a whole.
STRATEGY IN ACTION
The operational finance team uses benchmarking, knowledge  
of cross-business activity and shared improvement projects to 
identify instances of operational excellence that can be replicated 
elsewhere within the business. 
This team is also instrumental in evaluating and prioritising the 
Group’s productivity improvement plans. We have improved our 
operating efficiency with selected investments, including in the 
areas of leaf processing and packaging automation. In many 
cases, we see scope to roll these initiatives out across multiple 
sites, in support of our long-term pursuit of margin improvement. 
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR 2018
We have set ourselves the goal of delivering further EBITDA 
margin improvement over the medium-term, which we expect  
to achieve by means of continued intervention in areas of 
underperformance, and improvement where we believe that we 
can do things more efficiently. In the coming year, we expect to 
identify further opportunities for efficiency gains, and will continue 
to invest accordingly. We will also extend the implementation of 
performance improvements we have already made in specific 
sites where there is scope to do so.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
This has been an historic year, culminating with 
November’s admission to the premium segment 
of the London Stock Exchange, which saw us 
welcome our new shareholders to the Company.
My brother Lydur and I founded Bakkavor over  
30 years ago and it is now a business which 
employs around 19,000 people across 39 sites in 
the UK, US and China and, this year, generated 
revenue of over £1.8 billion. 
A YEAR OF GOOD PROGRESS
I am pleased to report that the past twelve months have seen us 
leverage our scale, innovation credentials and passion for food to 
make further good progress across the Group.

Operating profit increased by 5.1% from £91.5 million to £96.2 
million in 2017. This was a good performance given the 
unprecedented inflationary pressures seen in the year.
In the UK, we worked closely with our key customers to  
mitigate much of the impact of raw material inflation and the 
increase in labour costs, with our strong focus on efficiencies  
and cost control. Internationally, we saw further growth, 
particularly in China, as both businesses benefited from the 
transfer of our UK expertise to these regions and continued 
investment in our infrastructure.
FOCUSED INVESTMENT
We believe there is significant potential to develop our category 
presence across the business and during 2017 we continued to 
invest in selective scalable capacity and new capabilities. This 
included investment in automation and factory site expansions. 
The Group’s listing on the London Stock Exchange included  
a primary issue of £100 million which will enable us to  
accelerate our investment programme, creating further value 
for investors and stakeholders, and bring more great tasting  
food to consumers. 
A COMMITTED WORKFORCE 
Our success is driven by the passion, dedication and commitment 
of all the people we employ across the Group. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank each of those colleagues for their 
efforts and the contribution they have made in getting Bakkavor  
to where it is today. 
In the UK, we employ approximately 17,000 people and a 
significant number may potentially be impacted by Brexit. 
Although the outcome remains unclear, we have taken steps in 
the year to support many of our employees with information on 
developments and related guidance and we continue to review  
the business impact of potential changes. 
CORPORATE STRUCTURE
This year has been an exciting year but, nonetheless, a disruptive 
one, with significant management time taken up by the public 
listing. I am particularly impressed by the focus and commitment 
shown by our teams to ensure our customers remained 
unaffected by this corporate activity. 
Ahead of the public listing we took steps to strengthen our Board 
and I look forward to working with our new Board and benefiting 
from their experience as we take the Group forward in the next 
stage of its development.
A CONFIDENT OUTLOOK
The second half of 2017 saw volume growth impacted as UK 
consumers reacted to significant inflationary pressure. As 
expected, this trend has continued into 2018 and is likely to 
remain until inflation eases. Later in the year, we expect our 
volume growth to benefit from improved market conditions and 
new business. 
Despite these industry-wide challenges, we are confident that  
our scale, track record of innovation and focus on operational 
efficiencies ensures we are well placed to deliver ongoing 
profitable growth, both from existing business and our  
long-term investment strategy.
DELIVERING THE BEST FOR OUR 
PEOPLE AND OUR CUSTOMERS  
IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR 
FUTURE SUCCESS
14 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report Innovation is one of our core values and we are extremely proud of our capabilities  
and expertise, always challenging ourselves to think of great ideas that our 
customers and consumers love.
By collaborating across our sites, we bring together different competencies including 
allergen management, delicate fruit preparation and technical yoghurt processing.
These capabilities, combined with our consumer insight expertise, enabled us to create 
and launch a range of fresh breakfast compotes, including a pomegranate bircher 
muesli, to appeal to consumers looking for ‘ready to eat’ healthy breakfast ‘on the move’.
Pomegranate seeds have become increasingly popular  
due to their health benefits — they also make a great topping 
on our breakfast pots.

blog.bakkavor.com STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Producing innovative, commercially successful food that offers 
choice, quality, convenience and freshness for consumers 
remains the foundation of our success and is what drives 
growth in the UK.
The Group has a proven operating model for a challenging 
operational environment, producing over 2,000 short shelf-life 
products at scale. This level of complexity gives us a unique 
competitive advantage in the UK segment, which contributed 
around 90% to total Group revenue in 2017.
During the past year, we have reinforced our leading position in 
each of the four FPF categories of meals, salads, desserts and 
pizza & bread, continuing to work collaboratively with key 
customers to support their growth plans through investments 
and innovation. 
Our close partnerships with our customers, our track record in 
food safety, combined with our proven ability to generate cash 
for reinvestment in the business for efficiencies, maintenance 
and growth, position us well to deliver on our UK strategy.
UK PERFORMANCE 
The UK business generated £1,636.3 million in revenue from 
continuing operations in 2017, up 4.6%
1
 compared to the prior 
year on a 52 week basis. Like-for-like revenue
2
 was £1,621.3 
million, which is 4.9% up on 2016.
Revenue growth in 2017 was partly driven by price increases 
agreed with customers in response to the significant raw material 
inflation in the year. Volume growth was strong in the first half of 
the year, supported by a number of significant business gains in 
the second half of the previous year; a testament to the Group’s 
innovation capabilities, product quality and market-leading 
technical standards. However, as expected, revenue growth 
slowed later in the year as higher retail pricing impacted volumes. 
Adjusted EBITDA
2
 for the year was £145.2 million compared with 
£137.7 million in 2016. As anticipated, margins remained under 
pressure throughout the year due to inflationary impacts. 
However, the business performed well to limit these impacts and, 
when combined with the volume benefits and tight cost control, 
the year saw an increase in the Adjusted EBITDA
2
 margin to 8.9%, 
20 basis points above the prior year. 
At an operational level, we remained focused on managing our 
capacity and investing when necessary to support our customers’ 
growth plans.
MANAGING INFLATIONARY IMPACTS
During 2017, we were impacted by a combination of 
unprecedented raw material inflation, largely driven by  
volatility in the dairy market and the impact of the weakness  
in Sterling, together with rising labour costs following further 
increases in the National Living Wage. Working closely with  
our customers, we successfully mitigated much of this  
inflation through a combination of pricing, product design  
and operational performance.
Our significant expertise in growing, planning and buying was 
critical during this past year of volatile input pricing. No more  
so than in the salads category, when, in the early part of the  
year, unforeseen weather conditions markedly affected leaf 
availability. The experience of the procurement team and the 
strong relationships Bakkavor has with suppliers, particularly 
those in Europe and the US, enabled the Group to maintain 
supplies during this very challenging period.
The rising labour costs experienced following further increases  
to the National Living Wage were largely offset by performance 
improvements through efficiency, capital expenditure projects  
and operational improvement plans in place across the business. 
These improvement plans, supported by the operational finance 
team, were targeted to maximise performance and opportunities 
for efficiency gains across the UK operations.

16 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report STRENGTHENING CUSTOMER PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH 
INSIGHT AND INNOVATION
We continued to focus during the year on strengthening our 
partnerships in the UK. Bakkavor has relationships with all the 
major UK grocery retailers, although around 86% of revenues  
are generated from its four biggest customers: Tesco; M&S; 
Sainsbury’s; and Waitrose. We continue to work closely with  
these strategic customers through dedicated teams to protect  
and enhance our partnerships; each team has a differentiated 
plan and a clear understanding of that customer’s fresh prepared 
food needs. 
Bakkavor’s extensive knowledge of key food trends and 
experience in creating innovative and great tasting food is  
widely recognised by its customers. Around 230 colleagues are 
dedicated to the development of high-quality products and in  
the year we created and launched approximately 500 new and 
improved products for customers. For example, in November 
2017, we launched a number of award-winning dessert ranges  
for Christmas, including a chocolate ‘dome’ which gained 
considerable positive press coverage. We also launched the UK’s 
first charcoal-base pizza range, which proved very popular with 
consumers and again attracted favourable media reviews. 
We also won a number of awards during 2017, including 
Innovation winner for the Prepared Salads Category and  
Innovative Product of the Year at the Grocer Own Label Food  
& Drink Awards 2017.
INVESTING FOR GROWTH
During 2017, the Group continued its UK capital programme, 
investing behind its facilities to support customer plans and 
maximise efficiencies and capabilities. 
In the year we have seen a number of new investments to enhance 
capacity and capability following business wins. Good examples of 
these include investments in our Holbeach pizza factory and our 
Crewe bread factory.
Towards the end of the year, we started work on a major 
£35 million expansion of our desserts facility in Newark. This 
investment will provide increased capacity following recent 
supplier consolidation in the category as well as market-leading 
innovation and state-of-the-art automation to support efficiency.
17 STRATEGIC REPORT
Bakkavor’s strategy to accelerate its performance in China and 
the US is borne from over 10 years of operating in these regions, 
where we have developed a strong understanding of these 
markets and their potential for high growth. 
The FPF markets in the US and China are significantly 
underserved when compared with the UK. Bakkavor has 
established itself as a pioneer in leveraging its UK expertise to 
drive the FPF proposition in the US, and in supplying international 
and local foodservice chains in China, with high standards of food 
safety and quality. 
Our international businesses in the US and China continue to 
grow as consumer preferences increasingly shift towards fresh 
prepared food. 
INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
Our International business, whilst still only representing around 
10% of the Group, has continued to grow. This business generated 
£178.5 million in revenue from continuing operations compared 
with £173.7 million in the prior year. On a like-for-like
2
 basis, 
which excludes the impact of foreign currency movements and 
the sale of the Group’s Belgian business NV Vaco BV on 1 August 
2016, revenues increased by 10.0% in the year to £179.0 million.
Adjusted EBITDA
2
 for the International segment was £7.4 million 
for the year, compared with £8.7 million in 2016. Whilst the 
business in China has profited from strong volume growth, 
inflationary pressures have partly offset this benefit. We also 
increased investment in our technical and commercial 
capabilities, particularly in the US, to ensure we have the 
appropriate infrastructure for future growth. 
FAVOURABLE MARKET TRENDS IN BOTH REGIONS
The US and China represent highly attractive opportunities for 
growth, and our target markets in these countries are forecast  
to grow by at least 10% per annum going forward.
Our US business saw further growth in demand for fresh  
prepared food during the year, with consumers switching away 
from frozen and long-life products and increasingly showing a 
preference for fresh ‘better for you’ food, such as clean label  
and organic products. 
The Group has continued to develop its US relationships with  
key strategic customers, extending its category portfolio with a 
successful new range of burritos, and introducing a new range  
of ready-to-cook meals with a major customer.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
In China, we saw strong growth as we continued to develop our 
presence in the international and local foodservice markets, 
fuelled by the rapid rate at which key customers are expanding 
their store and restaurant portfolios. This provides Bakkavor with 
a solid base for expansion. In addition, our investment in our new 
product development capabilities has broadened our offering to 
major customers, including for example the introduction of fresh 
soups, salads and breakfast products.
ACCELERATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH INVESTMENT
The relationship with a key customer in Texas has significantly 
strengthened during the year as we announced plans to invest 
$31 million in a dedicated new factory in San Antonio. Working in 
close partnership with our customer, the facility will supply a wide 
range of meals and is scheduled to start production later in 2018.
Whilst the Group already has an established presence in the  
US in the meals, dips and soups & sauces categories, the chilled 
bread market represents an exciting new growth area where  
we can capitalise on our UK expertise as market leader in this 
category. Following a period of market testing, we have now 
started work on a new bakery facility in Charlotte, which will  
also be operational later in 2018. 
In China, the Group is investing around £20 million in a new 
state-of-the-art factory just outside Shanghai in Haimen,  
East China, which again is due to start production in 2018  
and will provide additional capacity in this high-growth market.  
We have also committed £3 million of investment into a new 
high-quality bread facility near Shanghai, which has recently 
started production, as we again have the opportunity to capitalise 
on our UK expertise in this category.

-18.7m +25.5%
-6.4% +5.1%
The increase in 2017, on a comparable 52 week 
basis, was due to UK underlying volumes benefiting 
from the full-year effect of recent business wins and 
price increases agreed with customers in response 
to the significant raw material inflation in the year. 
The International business saw growth, particularly 
in China as customers expanded their businesses. 
The further improvement in the year was due to 
benefits from the significant volume increases in the 
first half of the year and the continued focus on cost 
control and productivity improvements. 
Revenue growth at a constant currency (and 
excluding the impact of Melrow Salads that was 
closed in November 2017 and NV Vaco BV that was 
sold in August 2016] was strong for the year as we 
benefited from good volumes across the business. 
This increase reflects the improvement in 
underlying trading in the year. Basic earnings  
per share has decreased from 8.8p in 2016 to 5.8p  
in 2017 due to the impact of refinancing costs and 
exceptional items in the year. 
This was lower than 2016, primarily due to the 
impact of refinancing costs of £16.3 million in the 
year and £10.0 million of exceptional payments for 
the public listing in November 2017. 
Leverage ratio (net debt / adjusted 
EBITDA
2
)
As a result of strong cash generation in 2017 and 
the cash benefit from the primary proceeds from 
the public listing during the year, debt levels have 
reduced significantly which has lowered this ratio.
The Group continued to actively promote safety 
awareness and accident prevention during the year, 
resulting in a 6.4% improvement when compared 
with 2016.

within 24 hours. 
To successfully fulfil orders 364 days a year requires great agility due to the complex 
nature of manufacturing short shelf-life products at scale. 
For example, ingredients such as baby leaf lettuce are prepared, packed and despatched 
within 24 hours of picking from the field.
In our meals category, it is our ability to quickly and safely transition from one product 
line to the next that enables us to produce around 250 different product lines at a single 
factory site every day.
Our quick turnaround capability enables us to receive  
orders for our customers ‘on-the-day, for-the-day.’

blog.bakkavor.com RISK MANAGEMENT
Bakkavor’s risk management process is designed to help the 
Group deliver against its strategy, while protecting the interests  
of key stakeholders and safeguarding assets including its people, 
finances and reputation.
The Group Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the 
effective identification and management of key strategic and 
emerging risks, and for the review and approval of the ongoing 
risk management process, including the determination of clear 
policies as to what can be considered an acceptable level of risk.
During 2017, Bakkavor undertook a review of its risk identification 
and management process and put in place a formal Risk Register, 
which has been in place up to the date of this Annual Report.  
The Risk Register identifies the principal risks faced by the  
Group and the key mitigating actions used to address them.
The Audit and Risk Committee, delegated by the Group Board, 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
process and internal control system and receives regular  
reports from management and Internal and External Auditors. 
These detail the risks that are relevant to business activity,  
the effectiveness of internal controls in dealing with these risks  
and any required remedial action, together with an update on  
their implementation.
The Audit and Risk Committee reports to the Group Board on the 
effectiveness of the risk management process.
Day-to-day risk management is led by Senior Management with 
ownership for individual risks, as identified in the Risk Register, 
assigned to a member of the Senior Management team. 
Management of risk is embedded in daily working practices and 
underpinned by Bakkavor’s policies and Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics.
Where risks are identified, action plans are developed to mitigate 
the risk with clear allocation of responsibilities and timescales  
for completion. Progress towards implementing these plans is 
monitored and reported back to the Group Board through the 
Audit and Risk Committee as part of a structured business review.
DESIGNED TO HELP  
US DELIVER AGAINST  
OUR STRATEGY
Risk management process
1 The process begins with the evaluation of the most 
significant strategic risks for Bakkavor.
2 Senior Management must regularly assess risks for 
potential impact.
3 Action plans for mitigating significant risks are developed 
and implemented.

Board, is responsible for the independent review of the

Internal control system
The internal control system provides Senior Management with  
an ongoing process for risk management. The system can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance, as it is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate all risks.
Examples of the Bakkavor internal control system are:
Health and safety — The Group promotes a proactive safety and 
accident awareness culture and has in place health and safety 
teams that define standards and monitor compliance with the 
Group’s systems for ensuring workplace safety.
Food safety — The Group strives to deliver food products with the 
highest levels of safety and integrity to its customers. Bakkavor 
applies food safety procedures when designing and managing all 
of its sites, including rigorous testing and Hazard Analysis and 
Critical Control Point management systems.
Food quality — The Group maintains strict controls regarding  
the authenticity and quality of the products it manufactures and 
supplies. Bakkavor is subject to regular inspection by food safety 
and other authorities for compliance with applicable food laws.
IT systems — The Group has a Disaster Recovery Programme  
in place and strict policies to ensure its IT infrastructure and 
equipment are sufficiently protected. In addition, Bakkavor has  
in place a continuous IT Risk and Security Programme.
Treasury — The Group has a treasury policy in place with its  
main objectives to ensure that appropriate capital resources are 
available for the maintenance and development of the Group’s 
businesses, and to ensure that the financial risk relating to the 
Group’s currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure 
is understood, measured and managed appropriately.
Risk appetite
The Group’s approach is to minimise exposure to reputational, 
financial and operational risk, while accepting a risk/reward 
trade-off in achieving its strategic objectives. As a food producing 
business, food safety and integrity is of paramount importance 
and all reasonable efforts are made to mitigate risk in this area.
The business takes a measured approach to overseas investment 
to minimise risk exposure. Whilst significant capital expenditure  
is planned for 2018 in the US and China, these are markets within 
which Bakkavor has operated for many years. Therefore, whilst 
there is an element of risk in all investments, we believe the 
Company is well placed to make a measured approach and 
minimise exposure in these two key markets.
2018 Plan
Following the implementation of a formal Risk Register during 
2017, the Group intends to further improve its operational risk 
management capabilities. In addition, the Group is now subject  
to increased regulation as a listed company and will continue  
to put in place relevant internal controls during 2018 to  
ensure compliance.

Food safety and 
integrity
 Millions of people eat our 
products every day. We have a 
duty to make food that is safe 
and is clearly and correctly 
labelled.
Consumer safety and confidence 
are vital to our business; any 
issue that breaches that trust 
could result in loss or reduction 
of customer business and also 
impact our credibility and 
reputation. 
 Stringent food safety policies in place 
throughout the organisation and use of 
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
(“HACCP”) principles to identify and 
control food safety risks.
Employees trained against  
documented procedures.
Food safety controls regularly audited 
by internal and external parties. 
Emerging risks monitored by working 
with industry and regulatory bodies.

performance to the Group Board  
and immediate reporting of significant 
issues.
 Continued to ensure  
Bakkavor met all legal and 
customer standards and is 
HACCP compliant.
New UK Technical  
Director joined the team  
to ensure standards are 
continually reviewed.
Improved approach to  
internal audits.
Raw material 
costs
 The Group’s cost base and 
margin are vulnerable to 
fluctuations in the price and 
availability of raw materials, 
packaging materials and freight.
Ability to pass on any increases 
in these costs to customers 
within a reasonable timeframe is 
a challenge and failure to do so 
could impact the Group’s 
profitability and hence its ability 
to continue to invest in the 
business. 
 Central procurement team focused on 
achieving a balance between price, 
quality, availability and service levels.
Forward purchasing agreed and price 
variations passed on where possible. 
Agreements in place with some 
customers on recovery of raw material 
cost impacts.
Continued focus on cost reduction and 
productivity enhancements.
 Continued to extend  
number of cost models in  
place with customers through  
inflationary period.
Continued to work more 
collaboratively with customers 
regarding purchasing 
strategies.
Further strengthened supplier 
base, particularly in the US  
and Europe.
Customer 
concentration
 We work with four of the largest 
food retailers in the UK and a 
significant proportion of our 
revenue is from these 
customers.
Any major customer loss would 
have a significant negative 
impact on our business.
 Partnership model in place with 
customers. In the UK, customer 
specific champions and teams manage 
strategic customer relationships.

four largest customers to 
develop deep relationships  
and arrangements.
Built more strategic 
relationships with smaller, 
emerging customers.
Continued to evaluate 
opportunities outside 
mainstream grocery retailer 
base.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Risk area Risk description Mitigating controls Developments in 2017
Labour scarcity 
and costs 
 Higher labour costs and the 
scarcity of labour could affect 
the Group’s business and  
future profitability. The  
Group competes with other 
manufacturers for good and 
dependable employees. The 
supply of such employees is 
limited and competition to hire 
and retain them may result in 
higher labour costs.
Additionally, for the Group’s UK 
operations, Brexit presents a 
risk as historically the Group has 
employed a material number of 
citizens from the European 
Union.
 Specific campaigns and focus groups  
in place targeting recruitment of future 
employees and building attractiveness 
of careers in food industry.
Initiatives in place to enhance and 
upgrade factory site facilities to help 
attract and retain employees.
Central staff dedicated to recruitment 
and management of staff costs.
Initiatives in place to support employees 
with Brexit-related concerns.
 Centralised resource function 
to support recruitment process.
Focused on talent development 
including apprenticeship 
schemes to build future talent.
Introduced Brexit retention 
programme to offer advice and 
support to employees.
IT systems Unauthorised access of the 
Company’s Information 
Technology (“IT”) systems  
could lead to breaches of data 
protection and release of market 
sensitive information.
Any breakdown or failure in  
the Group’s IT infrastructure  
or the Group’s communication 
networks, including malicious 
cyber-attacks by third parties, 
could delay or otherwise impact 
the Group’s day-to-day business.
 Group Information Systems (“IS”) 
manage access to business data 
through strong password protection, 
role-based access to business systems 
and policies to ensure appropriate use.
The Group IS department has delivered 
Disaster Recovery (“DR”) for critical 
systems and is working towards 
delivering DR for important systems.
Group IS has strict policies and  
actively ensures IS infrastructure and 
equipment are sufficiently protected 
against malicious cyber attacks.
 Business as usual continual 
improvements supported by a 
continuous Risk and Security 
programme.
DR delivery programme will 
continue through to the end  
of 2018.
Focus areas included 
improvements to patching 
regimes and a number of 
upgrade projects to ensure 
services remain on supported 
platforms.
The Risk and Security 
programme continued to 
support the delivery of 
enhancements in these areas.
Health and 
safety and the 
environment
 We understand our duty of care 
to secure and protect the health 
and safety (“H&S”) of our 
employees and to reduce the 
environmental impact of our 
operations. Failure to maintain 
the H&S of employees could 
have a significant reputational 
impact and also have serious 
legal consequences.
 H&S and environmental impacts are 
managed by the Group’s in-house 
experts who embed and monitor 
practices.
Stringent processes are implemented 
for identifying and managing H&S and 
environmental risks.
Regular reporting of H&S Key 
Performance Indicators to the Group 
Board and immediate reporting of 
significant issues.
Culture of employee engagement 
around accident prevention across  
the Group.
 Increased central resource.
Changed approach to Internal 
Audit, increasing frequency and 
moving to an unannounced 
format.
Improved data capture process 
to record environmental 
performance.

Loss of key 
employees
 We have a highly experienced 
Senior Management team who 
are passionate about our 
business and who are integral  
to our continued growth and 
success as a market leader.  
The loss of any of these 
personnel or the Group’s 
inability to recruit new personnel 
would have an adverse impact 
on the Group.
We risk being unable to achieve 
our strategic growth objectives 
without the recruitment, 
development and retention of 
talented and committed people 
who understand and respect  
our values.
 Company values used to recruit, 
appraise, reward and develop 
employees.
Ongoing succession planning, 
commitment to training and bonus 
schemes in place to retain key 
personnel and manage staff turnover.
 Post the public listing, 
management retention 
initiatives devised for early  
2018 implementation.
Exchange rate 
 
 In the multi-currency trading 
environment in which the  
Group operates, there are 
inherent risks associated with 
fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates.
 Treasury function operates within 
framework of strict Group Board-
approved policies and procedures.
Active foreign exchange hedging 
programme maintained.
Active policy of hedging known 
non-Sterling denominated expenditure 
both for specific projects and on a 
rolling basis for material purchases.
 Continued review of exposures 
and subsequent hedging, with 
regular reporting back to the 
Group Hedging Committee and 
Audit and Risk Committee.
Assessment of financial 
instruments available for 
hedging.
Liquidity and 
covenant 
compliance
 
 To achieve our growth 
objectives, we require a strong 
financial platform.
The Group has significant 
facilities governed by financing 
agreements under which we are 
subject to various financial 
covenants and undertakings.
Breaching any covenant would 
impair our ability to maintain 
existing financing and secure 
future financing, thereby 
destabilising the business.
 Financial results, projections and 
covenant performance reviewed 
regularly.
Open and regular dialogue with  
our lenders and an active investor 
engagement programme.
 New financing arrangements 
entered into in 2017 with 
extended maturity and reduced 
interest costs. Public bonds 
redeemed.
Overall net debt and leverage 
reduced through trading profit

25 STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group typically presents its annual results covering a 52 week 
period. However, every six years an additional week is included in 
the Group’s reporting period to ensure that its end-of-year date is 
near the end of December. Consequently, the Group’s results for 
2016 are based on a 53 week trading period as compared to 
financial year 2017 which is a 52 week trading period. To assist 
with comparability, revenue, cost of sales and gross profit for  
2016 are discussed below on a 52 week basis in addition to the  
53 week comparison.
REVENUE
Revenue from continuing operations increased by £51.2 million, or 
2.9% from £1,763.6 million in 2016 (53 weeks), to £1,814.8 million 
in 2017.
On a 52 week basis, revenue from continuing operations increased 
by £79.4 million, or 4.6%, from £1,735.4 million in 2016 to 
£1,814.8 million in 2017.
Like-for-like revenue
2
 grew by 5.4%, from £1,708.5 million in  
2016, to £1,800.3 million in 2017. This increase was primarily  
due to strong growth in the Group’s operating segments, as 
described below.
SEGMENTAL BREAKDOWN
In the UK segment, revenue from continuing operations increased 
by £46.4 million, or 2.9%, from £1,589.9 million in 2016 (53 weeks) 
to £1,636.3 million in 2017.
On a 52 week basis, revenue from continuing operations in the UK 
segment increased by £72.6 million, or 4.6%, from £1,563.7 million 
in 2016 to £1,636.3 million in 2017.
Like-for-like revenue
2
, which excludes our Melrow Salads 
business that was closed in November 2017, grew by 4.9%, from 
£1,545.8 million in 2016, to £1,621.3 million in 2017. Melrow Salads 
contributed revenues of £15.0 million in 2017 for the period up to 
its closure.
This increase in revenue was primarily due to strong growth 
across all key customers, with underlying volumes benefiting 
from the full-year effect of recent business wins. In addition, 
revenues increased as a result of price increases agreed with 
customers in response to the significant raw material inflation 
seen through the year.
In the International segment, revenue from continuing operations 
increased by £4.8 million, or 2.8%, to £178.5 million in 2017 from 
£173.7 million in 2016 (53 weeks).
On a 52 week basis, revenue from continuing operations in  
the International segment increased by £6.8 million, or 4.0%,  
to £178.5 million in 2017 from £171.7 million in 2016. Revenue 
growth in 2017 was impacted by the sale of the Group’s Belgian 
business NV Vaco BV on 1 August 2016, which had contributed 
revenue of £17.0 million in 2016. This loss of revenue was partly 
offset by favourable foreign currency movements.
Like-for-like revenue
2 
grew by 10.0%, from £162.7 million in 2016, 
to £179.0 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to strong 
growth in our business in China, where sales volumes increased 
with all key customers.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales from continuing operations increased by  
£53.2 million, or 4.2%, from £1,275.9 million in 2016 (53 weeks)  
to £1,329.1 million in 2017.
On a 52 week basis, cost of sales from continuing operations 
increased by £75.8 million, or 6.0%, from £1,253.3 million in 2016 
to £1,329.1 million in 2017.
This increase was largely due to a combination of an increase in 
raw materials and direct labour costs supporting the sales volume 
growth in the year. Costs also increased due to the high level of 
raw material inflation in 2017 across most ingredients, but 
particularly those that were dairy related, and the continued 
impact of further increases in the National Living Wage on labour 
costs in the UK.
GROSS PROFIT
Gross profit reduced by £2.0 million, or 0.4%, from £487.7 million 
in 2016 (53 weeks) to £485.7 million in 2017.
On a 52 week basis, gross profit increased by £3.6 million, or 0.7%, 
from £482.1 million in 2016 to £485.7 million in 2017.
This increase was primarily due to the benefits from the sales 
volume increases more than offsetting the increase in raw 
material and direct labour costs.
DISTRIBUTION COSTS
Distribution costs were marginally lower at £77.2 million in 2017, 
a £0.8 million, or 1.0%, decrease from £78.0 million for 2016. The 
reduction was due to 2016 including an additional trading week.
OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS
Administrative costs decreased by £6.1 million, or 1.9%, from 
£319.0 million in 2016 to £312.9 million in 2017.
Administrative costs for underlying activities excluding exceptional 
items and impairment of assets reduced by £5.3 million, or 1.8%, 
from £302.8 million in 2016 to £297.5 million in 2017.
This decrease was primarily due to the Group’s tight control  
over costs and 2016 included £4.3 million of costs in respect  
of NV Vaco BV, which was sold on 1 August 2016. Excluding the 
impact of the sale of NV Vaco BV, total administrative costs were 
broadly flat.

Adjusted EBITDA
2
 increased by £6.2 million, or 4.2%,  
from £146.4 million in 2016 to £152.6 million in 2017.
This increase was primarily due to the benefits from a  
significant increase in sales volumes in the first half of  
2017 and the Group’s continued focus on cost control and 
productivity improvements.
OTHER ITEMS
Included within administrative costs are other items as follows:
     
 £ million 2017 2016 
 Exceptional items   
 Public listing costs 10.4 –  
 Transaction costs – 5.2  
 Restructuring costs 3.1 1.3 
 Legal cases 0.6 1.5 
 New site costs 1.3 – 
  15.4 8.0 
 Impairment   
 Property, plant and equipment – 8.2  
  15.4 16.2  
     
Exceptional items
The Group has incurred £10.4 million of costs in 2017 in 
connection with the public listing in November 2017. The 
restructuring costs of £3.1 million in the year relate to the cost  
of closing a site in the UK and moving related operations to other 
sites. The remaining exceptional costs relate to the Group’s US 
business, of which £1.3 million is in respect of initial start-up 
costs for a new factory and the remaining £0.6 million due to 
ongoing employment litigation.
In 2016, the Group incurred exceptional costs of £8.0 million,  
of which £5.2 million relate to the fees incurred that year in 
connection with the transactions that resulted in  
Bakk AL Holdings Limited owning 100% of the Company and 
becoming the parent company of the Group; £1.3 million relate  
to redundancy costs following the loss of some business at one  
of the Group’s UK operations; and £1.5 million relate to legal  
and other costs in respect of an intellectual property dispute  
that has now been concluded.
Impairment
The Group is required to assess the appropriateness of its 
goodwill, intangible and tangible asset carrying values on an 
annual basis by comparing the carrying values with future cash 
flows expected to be generated from those assets. There were  
no impairment charges in 2017 but in 2016 the review resulted  
in an impairment charge of £8.2 million for UK property, plant  
and equipment.
SHARE OF RESULTS OF ASSOCIATES AFTER TAX
Share of results of associates after tax decreased by  
£0.1 million, or 14.3%, from £0.7 million in 2016 to £0.6 million  
in 2017. This decrease was due to an increase in the cost base  
for the Group’s associate La Rose Noire Limited as it continues  
to expand its operations.
OPERATING PROFIT
Statutory operating profit increased by £4.7 million, or 5.1%,  
from £91.5 million in 2016 to £96.2 million in 2017 with margins 
increasing by 10 basis points to 5.3%. This increase was primarily 
due to benefits from the increase in sales volumes and the 
productivity improvements across the business. The statutory 
operating profit for the UK segment increased by £8.1 million  
in the year from £86.8 million in 2016 to £94.9 million. For the 
International segment, statutory operating profit decreased by 
£3.4 million from £4.7 million in 2016 to £1.3 million. Before 
exceptional items and impairment of assets, the operating 
margins for 2017 were in line with 2016 at 6.1%.
FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs decreased by £3.8 million, or 9.8%, from  
£38.8 million in 2016 to £35.0 million in 2017.
In 2017 these include payment of a call premium of £9.9 million  
in respect of the early redemption of the 2020 Senior Secured 
Notes as part of a refinancing of the Group’s lending facilities in 
March 2017. In addition, accelerated amortisation of refinancing 
fees in relation to the previous debt facilities necessitated a 
charge of £3.3 million. In 2016, the Group incurred a call premium 
of £1.5 million and accelerated amortisation of £0.7 million in 
refinancing fees in connection with the early redemption of £75 
million of the 2018 Senior Secured Notes. Excluding these costs  
in both years, finance costs decreased by £14.8 million in 2017, 
which reflects the benefits of lower debt levels and the reduction 
in the cost of debt to circa 3.5% per annum.
OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES
Other gains and losses moved by £32.5 million, from a gain of 
£10.3 million in 2016, to a loss of £22.2 million in 2017. This 
change was primarily due to a £17.2 million non-cash loss in 2017, 
reversing previous gains on the fair value of the call option within 
the 2020 Senior Secured Notes following redemption of the Notes 
in March 2017. The Group also incurred mark to market losses of 
£2.1 million on its financial derivatives in 2017 compared to a gain 
of £4.6 million for 2016.
TAX
The tax charge for the year decreased by £4.3 million, or 35.0%, 
from £12.3 million in 2016 to £8.0 million in 2017, largely due to  
an increase in the deferred tax asset recognised for US trading 
losses, giving an effective rate of 20.5% for 2017. Excluding the 
impact of exceptional costs in the year of £15.4 million, the 
effective tax rate is 15.4%. This is higher than originally expected 
due to the impact of the enacting in December 2017 of a lower US 
corporate tax rate of 21% compared to the previous rate of 35% 
which reduced the value of the increase in the deferred tax asset 
recognised in 2017 for the historic US trading losses. This is 
considered to be a one-off impact for 2017 and we expect the  
2018 effective rate to be between 14% and 15%.

‘adjusted’ and ‘underlying’ are used as a guide to performance.

27 STRATEGIC REPORT
PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD
As a result of the foregoing, profit for the period decreased by 
£20.3 million, or 39.6%, from £51.3 million in 2016 to £31.0 million 
in 2017. Excluding the impact of exceptional items and refinancing 
costs in 2016 and 2017, the underlying profit for the year has 
increased by £9.3 million to £70.5 million.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share has decreased from 8.8p for 2016  
to 5.8p in 2017, reflecting exceptional and refinancing costs 
incurred in the year. However, adjusted earnings per share
2
 has 
increased from 10.6p for 2016 to 13.3p in 2017 which reflects the 
improvement in underlying trading for the business in the year. 
The weighted average number of shares for 2017 was 530,738,162 
and for 2016 was 578,645,254, after adjusting for the 1 for 5  
share split that took place in November 2017 in advance of the 
public listing.
CASH FLOW
Free cash flow
2
 for the year of £71.1 million was £12.6 million 
higher than the previous year. This was largely due to expenditure 
on core capital (excluding development projects) being £11.3 
million lower than 2016 as a number of projects were rephased 
from the latter half of 2017 and into 2018. Our effective 
management of working capital delivered a further benefit of  
£8.6 million for the year and interest payments were £15.1 million 
lower this year following the refinancing in March 2017. The free 
cash generated was partly offset by refinancing fees of £16.3 
million, which included payment of a call premium of £9.9 million 
for the early redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due to 
mature in 2020.
CAPITAL, DEBT AND LEVERAGE
On 23 March 2017, the Group completed a refinancing of its debt 
facilities, putting in place a new £485 million corporate loan facility 
comprising a revolving credit facility of £200 million maturing in 
June 2021, and term loans totalling £285 million, of which £210 
million mature in June 2021 with the balance maturing in June 
2024. The funds from the refinancing were used to repay in full 
existing bank debt, redeem all outstanding Senior Secured Notes 
maturing in 2018 and 2020 and pay associated fees. The Group’s  
new debt funding structure provides the Group with a significant 
reduction in interest costs while extending the maturity of the 
funding commitments. In November 2017 the Group repaid  
£37.5 million of the term loans.
On 16 November 2017 the Group successfully completed a public 
listing on the London Stock Exchange, raising gross primary 
proceeds of £100 million from the issue of 55,555,555 ordinary 
shares of £0.02 each at £1.80 per share. The total transaction 
costs amounted to £13.8 million, of which £3.4 million related 
directly to the primary issue and have been offset against the 
gross proceeds within the share premium account and the 
balance of £10.4 million has been charged to exceptional items. 
The proceeds raised will be used to fund the Group’s development 
projects over the next two years.
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
As a result of the strong free cash generation and cash raised 
through the public listing, operational net debt has reduced  
by £112.6 million to £270.5 million. Leverage (the ratio of 
operational net debt to adjusted EBITDA) was 1.8 times at  
the end of 2017, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2016 and  
within the Group’s target range of 1.5 – 2.0 times. The Group’s 
liquidity position remains strong with good headroom against  
all financial covenants.
RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL
2
The increase in operating profit in 2017 has driven a further 
improvement in the Group’s Return on Invested Capital
2
 (“ROIC”) 
which has increased from 11.7% in 2016 to 12.2% in 2017. Going 
forward, the Group plans to spend circa 3.5% of revenues on 
capital investment, and in addition will use the proceeds from the 
primary issue to fund certain key development projects to deliver 
further improvements in returns.
PENSIONS
Under the IAS 19 valuation principles that are required to be  
used for accounting purposes the Group recognised a surplus  
of £5.2 million for the UK defined benefit scheme as at  
30 December 2017 (2016: deficit of £10.0 million). The surplus  
has been recognised under IFRIC 14 as the scheme's terms  
and conditions allow the Group to have an unconditional right  
to a refund of contributions when economic benefits are available. 
The movement from a deficit in the prior year to a surplus is 
largely due to an increase in the fair value of the scheme’s assets 
and the effective liability hedging in place.
The Group and the Trustee agreed in April 2017 the triennial 
valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme as at  
31 March 2016. This resulted in a funding shortfall which 
continues to be paid over an agreed eight-year recovery period 
ending on 31 March 2024. The recovery contributions over that 
period amount to £22.5 million with £4.5 million payable for  
the year ending 31 March 2018.
DIVIDEND
As set out in the public listing prospectus, no dividend will be 
declared in respect of the financial year 2017. The Group has 
confirmed its intention that a dividend equivalent to 40% of 
adjusted profit after tax for the financial year 2018, will be paid, 
with an interim payment in September 2018 of approximately one 
third of the expected total for the full year.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
At Bakkavor, we recognise and take seriously  
the significant trust placed in us by our 
stakeholders. As we continue to grow and  
develop, Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) is an 
integral part of our strategy and is crucial to  
how we drive growth, productivity and enhance  
and protect our reputation.
Building a sustainable business is in the long-term interests  
of our stakeholders, including customers, investors, suppliers, 
our people and all the consumers that have access to and  
choose our food products.
OUR APPROACH
In November 2017, we listed on the London Stock Exchange, 
providing us with a platform from which to further develop our  
CR activities, not just in the UK, where we have the majority of our 
operations and factories, but also internationally, where we are 
expanding our presence.
Whilst we already undertake a large number of CR-related 
initiatives across our factories in the UK, we have begun the 
process of centralising our CR efforts at Group level with a  
more focused CR programme. During the year, we put in place  
a flexible framework to guide and support our developments in  
CR and our commitment to furthering this agenda at Bakkavor  
in the years ahead. The framework reflects the responsibility and 
duty of care we have for our colleagues, the communities which 
we operate within, our customers and all those who consume  
our products every day. 
Our CR framework covers four key areas of Food safety and 
integrity, Environment, Workplace and Community.
GOVERNANCE OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Corporate Responsibility is monitored by the Senior Management 
team and reported to the Group Board. The Group Board reviews 
progress in these areas against the priorities set for the year. 
Currently the Group sets priorities in the areas of Food safety and 
integrity, Workplace health and safety and Workplace recruitment, 
retention and development.
During the year, the Group introduced the Bakkavor Code of 
Conduct to support good governance of behaviours.
This Code replaces a number of separate codes and policies and 
sets out the ethics and principles which are upheld by our people. 
Its launch was supported by a mandatory questionnaire to ensure 
understanding of the Code across the Group. The Code includes  
a number of policies and procedures that govern the way we do 
business. These cover areas including anti-bribery and business 
ethics, IT usage policy and further statements to support our 
commitment to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity.
Bakkavor is committed to the highest standards of ethics and 
integrity. Slavery, forced or trafficked labour will not be tolerated 
within our business or our supply chain. This is an issue on which 
we have no complacency and we are steadfast in ensuring that 
Bakkavor remains a fair and rewarding place to work. A copy of 
our Modern Slavery Statement is available on our website.
Our focus on safety is fundamental. Food safety and workplace 
health and safety are not a business choice, nor are they 
responsibilities that we can part-achieve. They are integral to the 
way we work every day and embedded in our culture and values.
In the UK, CR initiatives are organised at a local level across all  
24 factory sites and are often co-ordinated or communicated 
through each site’s ‘Site Employee Forum’ (“SEF”). The SEF feeds 
into a Group Employee Forum (“GEF”) which offers a platform to 
share ideas and best practice and which also recognises all the 
good work going on across the business via our annual Group 
Responsibility Awards.
Bakkavor recognises that the majority of its CR data is currently 
limited to its UK factory site operations. During the year, the 
Group undertook a review of its data capture process and put  
in place measures to begin the collection of CR data from its 
International business. The Group also put in place more robust 
and efficient mechanisms to measure environmental waste data 
both in the UK and across its International business.

30 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report FOOD SAFETY AND INTEGRITY
Our passion for food is core to our business and that passion is 
only realisable if our customers and consumers trust our food.
Bakkavor manufactures food that is not only great tasting for 
consumers, but which also meets the highest standards of  
safety. In addition to customer requirements, the Group is  
subject to extensive food safety regulations and, where required, 
governmental monitoring in each of the countries in which  
it operates.
The Group uses HACCP principles to identify any potential  
food safety risks and to ensure these risks are robustly  
controlled. To deliver these controls consistently, the Group 
adheres to documented food safety procedures when developing 
and manufacturing its products. These procedures form the 
backbone of Bakkavor Quality Management Systems and 
Standards. To ensure they are designed and implemented 
effectively Bakkavor employs more than 500 food safety 
professionals. 
Bakkavor ensures it has effective food safety systems through 
vigorous inspection, testing and reporting procedures. Sites are 
audited regularly, often on an unannounced basis, by internal food 
safety experts, customers and independent bodies for compliance 
with food safety standards. 
The effectiveness of Bakkavor HACCP plans is also verified 
through a regular testing programme. For example, in the UK,  
the Group conducts over 2,000 in-house microbiology and 
chemistry tests every day.
21 of the Group’s UK manufacturing sites also hold certification  
at ‘A’ grade against the British Retail Consortium Global Standard 
 — Food Safety.
As a food producer we recognise the significant part we can  
play in shaping food habits and behaviours. We support the 
growing trend for healthy convenient food, and through our  
insight and innovation capabilities, we do our utmost to provide 
consumers with nutritious and fresh food choices that help 
support a healthy lifestyle.
In the year, we continued to collaborate with our customers to 
respond to healthy eating trends and to review the salt, sugar  
and saturated fat levels in our food and introduced a number  
of healthy food ranges.
We source over 5,000 different ingredients from around the world. 
We recognise our responsibility to ensure the traceability of our 
food through all stages of production, processing and distribution.
We visit and audit suppliers around the world and use multiple 
suppliers for certain ingredients to ensure year round supply.
Ensuring the integrity of these ingredients is a vital part of our 
business and Bakkavor adopts a risk-assessed approach to  
cover all aspects of food safety, ethical requirements and 
environmental responsibility.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
ENVIRONMENT
Bakkavor is committed to addressing the effects of  
climate change and undertakes many practical activities  
and initiatives across the Group to reduce its overall carbon 
footprint and protect the environment.
As a responsible business, Bakkavor recognises that its 
operations have both direct and indirect impacts on the 
environment. The Group encourages environmental efficiency 
through a Group-wide focus on the four main areas of waste, 
water, energy efficiency and packaging. 
Bakkavor has this year put in place a data capture process across 
the Group to record its waste management performance and 
further processes to capture its carbon emissions in its US and 
China factories. The Group aims to improve its environmental 
performance through a number of sustainability initiatives.
In 2017, Bakkavor sent less than 1% of its UK waste to landfill  
and in addition managed surplus food through its staff shop and 
local food charities, including ‘Company Shop’, ‘Community Shop’ 
and FareShare. 
Bakkavor’s Caledonian Produce site was awarded the 'Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle Award' at the 2017 National CSR Awards for its 
‘Sustainability in Action’ campaign. The campaign transformed  
the factory’s approach to waste management and the business 
achieved zero waste to landfill.
During the year, Bakkavor continued to invest in its water 
efficiency programmes. In the UK, we were awarded ‘Most 
Innovative Water Scheme in Europe’ by Water Reuse Europe  
trade association for our new waste water facility, developed in 
conjunction with Aquabio, in Lincolnshire, UK. The investment 
demonstrates Bakkavor’s commitment to environmental 
efficiency with over 80% of the water used in the facility being 
recycled. The initiative also won the 'Environmental Leadership 
Award' at the M&S ‘Plan A’ Awards.
In China, the Group continued to invest in cost effective upgrades 
to its sites to maximise environmental efficiency. In Beijing, 
Bakkavor is currently developing a new waste water treatment 
facility expected to be operational in the first half of 2018.
Greenhouse gas emission statement
Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for the year ended 30 
December 2017 have been measured and reported as required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013, following the UK Government 
Environmental Reporting Guidelines (June 2013).
The total gross GHG emissions reported include all Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions for the Bakkavor Group in the UK. This covers 
UK factory sites where Bakkavor has full operational control. Data 
has not been collected for sites owned by Bakkavor but leased to 
tenants as Bakkavor does not have oversight or control of this 
energy usage and emissions data.
Bakkavor’s International business put in place a data  
capture process to collect carbon emissions data from  
1 January 2018 onwards.
Scope 1 emissions are those that directly release GHGs and 
include fuel consumed by our manufacturing facilities, offices, 
warehouses and our vehicle fleet, and releases of fluorinated 
gases from our refrigeration plant. Scope 2 emissions are 
released indirectly from our consumption of energy sources 
(electricity and cooling streams). As this is the first year for the 
Group to present this information, no comparative data from the 
previous year is available. 
Bakkavor has used the WRI/GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting standard and emission factors from Defra’s UK 
Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting to 
calculate the GHG emissions where they are not separately 
provided by a supplier.
The Group’s environmental management system is based on 
ISO 14001.

The vast majority of our GHG emissions arise from our factory 
sites’ heating and cooling operations. We have a programme  
of activities across the sites to reduce energy use and hence  
GHG emissions. During 2017, we also moved to a renewable 
electricity supply contract across our sites to support our energy 
reduction programme.
32 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report Each factory site has a Climate Change Agreement (“CCA”) and, 
as part of this, has energy efficiency targets to meet by 2020 
compared to a 2008 base year. The average target is a 22% 
efficiency improvement and Bakkavor regularly monitors and 
reports progress internally. Bakkavor is currently in the process 
of translating these energy efficiency targets into GHG reduction 
targets. These targets and related performance will be disclosed 
in the 2018 Annual Report.
WORKPLACE
We are committed to providing a workplace environment where 
people are safe, engaged and motivated.
Diversity and equal opportunities
Bakkavor is committed to equal opportunities in all its 
employment practices, policies and procedures from recruitment 
and selection, through training and development, appraisal  
and promotion.
The Group will do all that it can to make sure that everyone has  
an equal chance to apply and be selected for jobs at Bakkavor and 
an equal chance to be trained and promoted when they work for 
the Group. 
In the UK in 2017, Bakkavor refreshed its approach to diversity 
training, and all managers now attend a one day ‘inclusion 
culture’ workshop, and all other employees receive a shorter 
training session as part of their induction process.
Training and development
Bakkavor has a long history of investing in its innovative 
recruitment programmes.
The Bakkavor Youth Strategy Programme targets the next 
generation of potential Bakkavor employees and helps raise 
awareness of the Group amongst young people attending schools 
located near Bakkavor UK factories. In 2017, the Group invested  
in ten strategic partnerships with schools to support industry 
talent growth through the Institute of Grocery Distribution (“IGD”) 
‘Feeding Britain’s Future’ programme.
In addition, over 200 people in the UK are currently part of  
our Apprenticeship Programme which covers a broad range  
of training specialisms including Engineering, Manufacturing  
and Product Development. During the year, we expanded this 
programme with additional areas of specialism and increased  
the number of places available. 
Bakkavor also continued to work closely with the National Skills 
Academy during the year to develop new training standards and  
to increase its network of training providers. The Group’s 
commitment to training and development was recognised with  
the award of ‘Training Programme of the Year’, won in conjunction 
with CQM Training & Consultancy at the Food Manufacturing 
Excellence Awards.
Our long-running Graduate Programme provides the opportunity 
to learn and develop in a wide range of roles across the Group and 
the programme continues to give Bakkavor a vital talent pipeline 
for its future leaders. A number of our Senior Management 
originally joined the Group through this scheme and in 2017 the 
Group welcomed a further 18 graduates to the UK programme. 
Bakkavor also continued to develop its relationship with the 
University of Lincoln which supports the programme through 
innovation workshops and projects.
Bakkavor currently has 13 graduates on its Graduate Programme 
to develop our business in China. The programme, which has 
been running successfully for several years, is a three-year 
programme which includes the first year in the UK to develop  
a strong understanding of the business, operations and best 
practice standards.
The Group is committed to providing appropriate training to 
ensure that its employees have the skills necessary to do their job. 
The in-house Bakkavor Training System (“BTS”) enables Bakkavor 
to monitor compliance and plan and record training for factory 
site-based colleagues in the UK. In 2017, BTS was enhanced to 
allow Bakkavor to conduct real time assessments to improve the 
reliability of these results.
The Group also piloted its first e-learning module which provided 
online learning of the performance management process for 
salaried colleagues. The system will be developed further in  
2018 to bring online an effective process for booking training 
courses. Bakkavor is very proud of its tiered approach to 
management and leadership training and development. The 
Group’s personal development programme for senior business 
leaders ‘Leading for Success’ was extended to approximately  
35 colleagues across the Group during the year. In addition, the 
Group’s ‘Recipes for Success’ programme continued to run for 
functional managers and was enhanced during the year with 
further online support resources. 
Bakkavor continues to support its people through local initiatives 
and launched a UK-wide Employee Assistance Programme 
(“EAP”) in 2017. The system provides support in a range of ways 
including webinars and access to articles, promotional campaigns 
and tools on topics such as financial budgeting, wellbeing 
assessments and confidential counselling services.
33 STRATEGIC REPORT
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Employee engagement
Employee engagement is important to our operations and the  
way we do business. 
We measure our engagement levels through a Group-wide 
Employee Engagement Survey conducted every two years.  
In the intervening year, Bakkavor holds a Pulse Survey, which 
represents the views of around 20% of employees selected  
at random. 
In 2017, the Employment Engagement score from the Pulse 
Survey improved from 29% to 31%. The Group recognises that 
whilst this is a small improvement versus the prior year,  
Bakkavor will continue to actively review factory site based 
initiatives targeted at improving workplace engagement. 
Workplace recruitment, retention and development 
priorities for 2018 are: 
• To increase awareness of apprenticeship programmes in 
the UK and internationally
• To continue to develop internal talent and succession 
plans to support business growth
• To further develop a centralised resourcing model to 
support business growth
Employee health and safety 
Bakkavor promotes a proactive safety awareness and accident 
prevention culture by empowering employees to do the right  
thing, to raise risk awareness and to actively support solutions 
to improve the Group’s health and safety performance. 
The Group’s health and safety culture is based on strong 
governance processes and is driven from the Group Board. 
Bakkavor has health and safety teams in place that define 
standards and monitor compliance with the Group’s systems  
for ensuring workplace health and safety. These systems are 
risk-based and are implemented through the Group’s Health  
and Safety Management System to ensure compliance with 
relevant legal responsibilities. 
Systems include comprehensive compliance audits carried  
out by qualified experts, performance monitoring and reporting, 
and a well-established process for capturing and sharing good 
practice and learnings.
Bakkavor recognises excellence in safe ways of working through 
Group-wide award and recognition programmes. During the year, 
the Group hosted its annual GEF and part of the event’s agenda 
was dedicated to communicating safety messages and sharing 
best practice initiatives. The GEF also included the Bakkavor 
Group Responsibility Awards ceremony which recognised health 
and safety activities and initiatives carried out across sites in the 
UK during the year. The main award this year was to our fresh  
cut salads site at Bourne for the design and implementation of  
a conveyor feed system to reduce handling and improve 
maintenance processes. 
Our commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for 
everyone on our sites was recognised with four awards from  
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in 2017.
Particular focus during the year was given to reducing risk 
associated with workplace transport, raising awareness of 
machinery safety and further supporting and communicating  
the Group’s accident prevention culture across factory sites.
For example, the Group focused on areas where moving vehicles 
are present and helped prevent related accidents in yards by 
segregating areas and prohibiting access. Bakkavor also 
reinforced its site rules and management processes around 
visiting drivers and driver standards.
To help prevent machinery accidents, 248 employees undertook 
Machinery Safety Workshops in the year.
In 2017, the total number of accidents in the UK business was 
1,864, a 9% improvement on the prior year. The total number of 
accidents resulting in more than seven days of lost time was 66, 
an improvement of 4% versus the prior year. 
The number of major accidents recorded in the UK business was 
seven, the same as the prior year, and a 77% outperformance 
against the HSE industry average.
Workplace health and safety priorities for 2018 are:
• To continue to drive our governance process to identify 
risks and risk reduction
• To foster and embed a positive approach to workplace 
health and safety across the Group
• To further develop training and risk awareness packages 
across factory sites

of 22.7%, representing an increase of 5.1% versus 2016. This 
is in line with average levels in the UK manufacturing sector.
Turnover includes voluntary and involuntary leavers and  
excludes employees on fixed term contracts and those  
affected by redundancy. In 2017, the average length of service  
of employees in production was six years, while that of employees 
in management and administration was eight years.
35 STRATEGIC REPORT
Supporting local causes
As part of being a responsible business, the Group encourages 
employees at its factory sites to select and support the local 
causes and initiatives that matter most to them. This process  
is initiated via local SEFs and supported via the annual GEF  
which celebrates the actions local teams have undertaken  
during the year. 
Initiatives included the annual ‘Bakkavor Fun Weekend’ held  
in Spalding in July. This year, over £30,000 was donated to local 
charities including Lincolnshire and Nottingham Air Ambulance, 
Spalding Air Cadets, Spalding Town Husbands and Action  
Medical Research. 
Other local community events and fundraisings include Sutton 
Bridge site’s Christmas present wrapping event, a healthy eating 
school jamboree at Tilmanstone site, and Caledonian site’s 
support of the Bo’ness Fair Festival.
In addition, the Bakkavor bread team supported its local 
community as lead sponsor of the Whitchurch Food & Drink 
Festival and the Live Cookery Theatre in Cheshire. As part of their 
involvement in the community event, they also raised funds for the 
Wingate Special Children’s Trust in Crewe through proceeds from 
their bakery stand.
In the US, Bakkavor has donated surplus food to the Lives 
Transformed Mission for the past six years. Approximately 100 
pounds of food per week is donated, which is distributed to various 
local organisations including a women’s shelter, a half-way house 
for men, Open Arms Ministry, the Community Kitchen and Meals 
on Wheels. A team from the Charlotte factory site also donated 
toys for a local family shelter in the Charlotte area.
COMMUNITY
We aim to support the communities in which we work, giving 
opportunities to support those causes and projects that are 
important to our people.
The Group’s chosen charities for the year were The Prince’s Trust 
and The Prince’s Countryside Fund.
2017 was the third year of our partnership with The Prince’s Trust. 
Our investment and commitment have enabled the Trust to 
support many young people. For example, through the ‘World of 
Work’ tours, we have helped raise the skill levels and aspirations 
of many young lives. In addition, a team of Bakkavor employees 
completed the ‘Palace to Palace’ bike ride during the year to raise 
funds for The Prince’s Trust.
During the year, colleagues on the Bakkavor Graduate 
Programme raised funds for The Prince’s Countryside Fund 
through an ‘Art of Food’ photography competition and art auction 
and participation in the Three Peaks 24-mile challenge.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
36 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report DEAR SHAREHOLDER
In our first Annual Report as a public company,  
I am delighted to take the opportunity to  
make a statement on Bakkavor’s approach  
to corporate governance.
The Group Board is committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance, and recognises that good governance is 
critical in building a successful business that is sustainable for the 
longer term. 2017 was a progressive year for Bakkavor in terms of 
its governance structures, as it transitioned to public ownership. 
In preparation for Bakkavor’s IPO and Admission to the London 
Stock Exchange, the Group Board established a Nomination 
Committee and a Remuneration Committee and took steps to 
develop and enhance its existing Audit Committee. These steps 
were intended to ensure Bakkavor is in line with established best 
practice for Listed Companies, as set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Governance Code”), published in April 
2016 by the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”).
In anticipation of the IPO, a new legal entity, Bakkavor Group plc, 
was established as the overall parent company of the Group. 
Agust Gudmundsson (Chief Executive Officer) and Robert Berlin 
(Non-executive Director) became Directors of Bakkavor Group plc 
on 28 September 2017, and the following became Directors on  
20 October 2017:
• I was appointed as Independent Non-executive Chairman
• Peter Gates was appointed as Chief Financial Officer and 
Director
• Lydur Gudmundsson was appointed as Non-executive Director
• Todd Krasnow was appointed as Independent Non-executive 
Director
• Denis Hennequin was appointed as Independent Non-executive 
Director
• Sue Clark was appointed as Independent Non-executive 
Director
The Governance Code recommends that at least half the board  
of directors of a UK listed company, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise Non-executive Directors determined by the 
Board to be independent. I am delighted that Jane Lodge, an 
Independent Non-executive Director, was appointed to the Group 
Board with effect from 3 April 2018, and so Bakkavor is now fully 
compliant with this Governance Code provision.
As part of the preparation for the IPO, we worked with our 
professional advisers to review Bakkavor’s governance policies 
and formalise its arrangements for the division of responsibilities 
between Agust Gudmundsson as Chief Executive Officer and 
myself as Chairman. We refreshed the matters reserved for  
the decision of the Group Board and adopted additional 
governance policies covering such areas as share dealing 
restrictions for Directors and Senior Executives, and the 
treatment of Inside Information.
The report on Corporate Governance sets out the processes  
which ensure that we comply with all applicable laws and 
regulations. It also outlines how we will create the necessary 
internal culture to enable us to meet the requirements of our 
shareholders and wider stakeholders to deliver long-term 
sustainable growth. The Group Board is committed to maintaining 
an open dialogue with shareholders and welcomes the opportunity 
to meet with those who are able to attend our Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) on 23 May 2018. 
The Group Board believes the culture within which the business 
operates is an important part of its success and has a significant 
impact on the success of our governance arrangements. 
It has been an evolutionary year and we have made good progress 
enhancing Bakkavor’s governance. I am sure this will help 
continue to drive performance and enable us to stay aligned with 
best practice over the coming years.
I greatly value the diverse and complementary range of skills  
and experience of my fellow Board members. Our discussion  
and debate takes place within an environment of openness, 
mutual trust and respect, and I would like to extend my thanks  
to all Board members for their valuable support and commitment.
I look forward to reporting to you next year on how our governance 
arrangements have continued to evolve.

MANAGEMENT BOARD
GOVERNANCE
40 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
This report describes Bakkavor’s 
corporate governance structures and 
procedures and the work of the Group 
Board, its Committees and the 
Management Board, and how Bakkavor 
has applied the main principles of the 
Governance Code following its IPO. 
The principal corporate governance  
rules applying to Bakkavor (as a UK 
company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange (“LSE”)) for the year ended  
30 December 2017 are contained in the  
UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
Listing Rules, and the Governance Code  
as updated and published by the FRC in 
April 2016. 
A copy of the Governance Code can  
be downloaded from the corporate 
governance pages of the FRC’s  
website (https://www.frc.org.uk/directors/
corporate-governance-and-stewardship/
uk-corporate-governance-code).
The Group Board considers that  
Bakkavor has been compliant with  
the Governance Code provisions except  
as noted opposite:
Provision Explanation
B.1.2 — at least half the  
Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise 
Non-executive Directors 
determined by the Board  
to be independent.
 Bakkavor’s IPO was completed in November 2017  
and the Group was unable to achieve full compliance 
at this time. Jane Lodge, an independent Non-
executive Director, was appointed to the Group  
Board with effect from 3 April 2018, and the Group 
Board is now fully compliant with this Governance 
Code provision. 
B.4.2 — the review of Non-
executive Directors’ training 
development requirements.
 Given the short period between Bakkavor’s IPO and 
the financial year end, the Chairman did not consider 
it appropriate to review and agree with each Director 
their training and development needs. The Chairman, 
with the support of the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, will ensure the development and ongoing 
training needs of the Group Board are reviewed and 
agreed at least annually.
B.6.1 and B.6.3 — the Board  
has not carried out a 
performance evaluation and 
the Non-executive Directors, 
led by the Senior Independent 
Director, have not carried out  
a performance evaluation of 
the Chairman.
 Given the short period between Bakkavor’s IPO  
and the financial year end, the Group Board did not 
consider it appropriate to carry out a performance 
evaluation process prior to the publication of the 
Annual Report. The Group Board believes that a 
meaningful evaluation can only take place after it  
has been working together for a reasonable time,  
and therefore an agreed approach to evaluation will 
be developed and implemented before the end of the 
financial year 2018 and annually thereafter. This will 
include an externally facilitated evaluation process at 
least every three years.
C.3.1 — in smaller companies, 
the Company Chairman may 
be a member of, but not chair, 
the Audit and Risk Committee 
in addition to the Independent 
Non-executive Directors, 
provided he or she was 
considered independent on 
appointment as Chairman.
 Bakkavor’s IPO was completed in November 2017  
and the Group was unable to meet this requirement 
at that time. The Audit and Risk Committee was 
chaired by the Company Chairman, Simon Burke.  
To ensure full compliance with this Governance  
Code provision, Jane Lodge, an independent Non-
executive Director was appointed to the Group Board 
with effect from 3 April 2018 and will assume the 
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. At the same 
time, Simon Burke will step down from the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
41 GOVERNANCE
LEADERSHIP
“Every company should be headed by an effective Board  
which is collectively responsible for the long-term success  
of the company.”
The role of the Group Board and Management Board
The Group Board provides guidance and entrepreneurial 
leadership of Bakkavor by setting the strategic direction of  
the Group and overseeing management’s implementation  
of the strategy. 
It is collectively responsible for the long-term success of  
the Group through the creation and delivery of sustainable 
shareholder value. In exercising this responsibility, the Group 
Board takes into account the needs of all relevant stakeholders. 
It is accountable for ensuring that, as a collective body, it has  
the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience to perform  
its role effectively. The Group Board is provided with timely  
and comprehensive information to enable it to discharge its 
responsibilities, to encourage strategic debate and to facilitate 
robust, informed and timely decision-making.
The Group Board is supported by the Management Board, which 
implements the strategic objectives set by the Group Board, and 
determines investment policies, agrees on performance criteria 
and delegates to Senior Management the detailed planning and 
implementation of those objectives and policies in accordance 
with appropriate risk parameters. 
In anticipation of Bakkavor’s IPO, the Schedule of Matters 
Reserved for the Group Board was reviewed and updated along 
with the delegated authority framework to ensure that unusual  
or material transactions are brought to the Group Board for 
approval. Decisions reserved for the Group Board include 
approval of strategic plans and annual budgets, acquisitions, 
audited accounts and the appointment of additional Directors. 
The Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Group Board is 
available for review on the Company’s website:
https://www.bakkavor.com/~/media/Files/B/Bakkavor-V3/PDF/
corporate-governance/schedule-of-matters-reserved-for-the-
board.pdf
Group Board composition
The Group Board currently comprises a Non-executive Chairman 
who was independent on appointment, two Executive Directors, 
two Non-independent Non-executive Directors and four 
Independent Non-executive Directors, supported by the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and the Management Board. 
The Group Board operates a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
Chairman
The Chairman, Simon Burke, is responsible for leading the Group 
Board and creating the right conditions, including its membership 
and that of its Committees, to ensure the Group Board’s 
effectiveness in all aspects of its role.
The Chairman sets the Group Board’s agenda, in consultation with 
the Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, taking full account of Group Board members’ issues 
and concerns and the need to allow sufficient time for robust  
and constructive discussion and challenge. He is responsible for 
encouraging and facilitating active engagement by all Directors, 
drawing on their skills, knowledge and experience.
The Chairman is also responsible for promoting effective 
communication between the Group Board, Senior Management, 
shareholders and other major stakeholders.
The Chairman has a close working relationship with the  
Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary to ensure that the strategies and actions agreed by the 
Group Board are effectively implemented. At least annually, the 
Chairman meets with the Non-executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present to discuss, amongst other matters, 
the Executive Directors, the Group Board as a whole, the 
Committees and the interaction between the Executive and 
Non-executive Directors.
Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer, Agust Gudmundsson, has specific 
responsibility for recommending the Group’s strategy to the 
Group Board and for implementing agreed strategy once 
approved. In undertaking such responsibilities, the Chief Executive 
Officer takes advice from and is provided with support by the 
Management Board and Group Board colleagues and his Senior 
Management team.
Together with the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive 
Officer monitors the Group’s operating and financial results and 
directs the day-to-day business of the Group. The Chief Executive 
Officer is also responsible for recruitment and development of the 
Group’s Senior Management team below Group Board level.
Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer, Peter Gates, is responsible for the 
financial reporting of the Group, for monitoring the Group’s 
operating and financial results and for management of the 
Group’s internal financial risk management and financial control 
systems. He supports the Chief Executive Officer in implementing 
the Group’s strategy and in relation to the financial and 
operational performance of the Group.
Management Board
The Management Board implements the strategic objectives  
set by the Group Board and agrees on performance criteria,  
and delegates to management the detailed planning and 
implementation of those objectives and policies, in accordance 
with appropriate risk parameters. It monitors compliance with 
policies and achievement against objectives by holding 
management accountable for its activities through monthly  
and quarterly performance reporting and budget updates. The 
Management Board receives regular presentations from heads  
of key Group functions, enabling it to explore specific issues and 
developments in greater detail.
The responsibilities delegated to the Management Board cover 
the following areas: 
• Preparing strategic proposals, corporate plans, and budgets 
• Executing the strategy agreed upon by the Group Board 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
42 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report • Executing actions in relation to key Group Board decisions  
such as investments, mergers, and acquisitions
• Opening bank accounts and authorising financial payments 
• Signing of contracts 
• Signing of regulatory documents 
• External communication 
• Staff recruitment and remuneration 
• Establishing a system of internal control and risk management 
• Monitoring performance and evaluation of health and safety 
Non-executive Directors
The role of the Non-executive Directors is to offer guidance and 
advice to the Group Board as a whole and the Executive Directors 
in particular, drawing on their wide experience across many 
industries. They also provide scrutiny, constructive challenge  
and oversight of the Executive Directors and Senior Management.
Senior Independent Director
Denis Hennequin is the Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director and in this capacity he acts as a sounding board for  
the Chairman. He serves as a trusted intermediary for the other 
Directors when necessary. He is also available to shareholders if 
they are unable to resolve their concerns through communication 
with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other Executive 
Directors, or when shareholders prefer to speak directly to him. 
He is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chairman 
on behalf of the other Directors.
General Counsel and Company Secretary
The General Counsel and Company Secretary, Simon Witham, 
supports and works closely with the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Group Board Committee Chairs in 
setting agendas for meetings of the Group Board and its 
Committees. He supports the accurate, timely and clear 
information flow to and from the Group Board and the Group 
Board Committees, and between Directors and Senior 
Management. The General Counsel and Company Secretary also 
advises the Group Board on corporate governance issues and 
Group Board procedures and is responsible for administering 
Bakkavor’s Share Dealing Code and the AGM.
How the Group Board operates
Prior to the IPO, Bakkavor Group Limited was the parent company 
of the Group. During the year, the Board of Bakkavor Group 
Limited met four times as scheduled, and then a further three 
times to discuss important ad hoc emerging issues. The 
Management Board of Bakkavor Group Limited met 10 times. 
In preparation for the IPO, Bakkavor’s corporate structure was 
reorganised. Bakkavor Group Limited was re-named Bakkavor 
Holdings Limited, and a new legal entity, Bakkavor Group plc,  
was established as the parent company of the Group. The first 
Group Board meeting of Bakkavor Group plc was held on 20 
October 2017, and following the IPO, the Group Board met again 
on 29 November 2017.
In 2018, the Group Board plans to hold eight regular meetings 
including an annual strategy day to review strategic options open 
to the Group in the context of the economic and regulatory 
environment. The Management Board members below Group 
Board level will attend meetings as required to present and 
discuss matters relating to their business areas and functions, 
and the Management Board will also meet separately throughout 
the year on a regular basis. 
The Group Board will additionally meet when necessary between 
scheduled Group Board meetings to discuss important ad hoc 
emerging issues that require consideration. 
Each Director commits to dedicating an appropriate amount  
of time to their duties during the financial year, and it is  
expected that the Non-executive Directors will meet the  
time commitment reasonably expected of them, pursuant to  
their letters of appointment.
Where Directors are unable to attend meetings, they are 
encouraged to give the Chairman their views in advance on the 
matters to be discussed.
Attendance at Board meetings
The number of full scheduled Group Board meetings attended by 
each Director during the year, including the Group Board strategy 
day, is set out below:

44 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report EFFECTIVENESS
“The Board and its committees should have the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of 
the company to enable them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively.”
Group Board composition
It is a core feature of good corporate governance that the Group 
Board and its Committees have an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge to enable the effective 
discharge of their duties and responsibilities. Part of the role of 
the Chairman and the Nomination Committee is to keep the 
balance of skills and expertise on the Group Board and its 
Committees under review and make recommendations to the 
Group Board where changes are appropriate to maintain that 
balance. The Group Board considers that the range of skills, 
experience and background of each of the Directors is sufficiently 
relevant and complementary to allow appropriate oversight, 
challenge and review of Bakkavor’s progress in achieving its 
corporate goals. 
A summary of the experience and background of each Director  
is set out on pages 38 to 39.
It is Bakkavor’s policy, in line with the Governance Code, that 
proposed appointments to the Group Board follow an open and 
transparent recruitment process and that candidates are 
assessed on merit against objective criteria.
Diversity
The Directors recognise the importance of diversity and 
understand the significant benefits that come with having a 
diverse Group Board. More information on this and the Group’s 
diversity statement can be found in the report of the Nomination 
Committee on page 47.
Director independence
There is an appropriate combination of Executive Directors and 
Non-executive Directors such that no individual or small group  
of individuals can dominate the Group Board’s decision-making. 
Jane Lodge, an Independent Non-executive Director, was 
appointed to the Group Board with effect from 3 April 2018. 
Following Jane’s appointment, the Group Board is now fully 
compliant with this Governance Code, which requires that at  
least half of the Group Board, excluding the Chairman, should 
comprise Non-executive Directors who are determined by the 
Group Board to be independent.
The independence of the Non-executive Directors will be 
considered by the Group Board and reviewed on an annual  
basis, as part of the Group Board effectiveness review. In 
determining whether they remain independent, the Group Board 
will consider factors such as length of tenure and relationships  
or circumstances which are likely to affect or appear to affect  
the Director’s judgement. As part of the IPO process, the Group 
Board reviewed and reaffirmed that it considers each of the 
independent Non-executive Directors to be independent in 
character and judgement and that there are no relationships  
that might prejudice this independence.
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Group Board. Directors are 
required to disclose both the nature and extent of any potential or 
actual conflicts with the interests of the Company.
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s 
Articles of Association allow the Group Board to authorise 
potential conflicts that may arise, and to impose such conditions 
or limitations as it sees fit. During the year, any potential conflicts 
were considered and assessed by the Group Board and approved 
where appropriate.
Inside information and securities dealings
As part of the IPO process, Bakkavor adopted a formal Inside 
Information Disclosure Policy, a Group Securities Dealing Code, 
and a Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities (“PDMR”) 
Securities Dealing Code setting out dealing restrictions and 
procedures to ensure PDMRs and other relevant Senior Managers 
seek clearance for dealing in Bakkavor shares. 
Succession planning and appointments to the Group Board
Succession planning will ensure that Executives with the 
necessary skills, knowledge and expertise are in place to deliver 
Bakkavor’s strategy, and that the Group Board has the right 
balance of individuals to be able to discharge its responsibilities. 
The Group Board will regularly review its composition.
Induction
Following appointment, each Director will receive a 
comprehensive and formal induction to familiarise them with  
their duties and Bakkavor’s business operations, risk and 
governance arrangements. The induction programme, which  
is co-ordinated by the Group HR Director, includes briefings on 
industry and regulatory matters relating to Bakkavor, as well as 
meetings with Senior Management in key areas of the business.
Ongoing professional development
In order to facilitate greater awareness and understanding  
of Bakkavor’s business and the environment in which it  
operates, all Directors are given regular updates on changes  
and developments in the business. Directors will continually 
update and refresh their skills and knowledge, and  
independent professional advice is provided when required,  
at Bakkavor’s expense.
In preparation for the IPO, the Directors received advice from 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP on their duties as Directors 
of a listed company, and their ongoing obligations under the FCA’s 
Listing Rules and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
Annual re-election of the Group Board
In compliance with the Governance Code, all Directors will  
retire and offer themselves for re-election or re-appointment  
as appropriate at each year’s AGM. At our first AGM, to be  
held on 23 May 2018, each Director, regardless of their date of 
appointment or length of service, will offer himself or herself for 
re-election as a Director.
Group Board evaluation
It is intended that an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group 
Board will be conducted in 2018.
45 GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
ACCOUNTABILITY
“The Board should present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the company’s position and prospects.”
Financial and business reporting
The Strategic Report from page 4 describes the business model 
and strategy and how Bakkavor generates and preserves value 
over the long term and delivers its strategic objectives.
A Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the 
Financial Statements is set out on page 75 and a statement 
regarding the use of the going concern basis in preparing  
these Financial Statements is provided in the Directors’ Report  
on page 74.
Risk management and internal control
The Group Board has responsibility for ensuring the maintenance 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and 
reviewing them annually. 
The framework under which risk is managed in the business is 
supported by a system of internal controls designed to embed the 
effective management of the key business risks throughout the 
Group. The risk management and internal controls systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Through reports from the Audit and Risk Committee, the  
Group Board regularly reviews and monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls systems and the effectiveness 
with which it manages the principal risks faced by the Group.
The Directors confirm that the Group Board has carried out a 
robust assessment of the key risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. The risks to which the Group is exposed and 
the framework under which risk is managed, and its system of 
internal controls, is outlined in the ‘Risk Management’ section  
on pages 21 to 25 and in the ‘Viability Statement’ on page 74.
Internal controls over financial reporting
The Group’s financial reporting process has been designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the 
financial reporting and preparation of Financial Statements, 
including Consolidated Financial Statements, for external 
purposes in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”). The annual review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls included reviews of systems 
and controls relating to the financial reporting process.
Internal controls over financial reporting include procedures and 
policies that:
• Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Group
• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit the preparation of Financial Statements 
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and respective 
Directors
• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal of 
Group assets that could have a material effect on the Group’s 
financial and operational controls and compliance with laws 
and regulations
Remuneration
The responsibility for determining remuneration arrangements 
for the Chairman and Executive Directors has been delegated to 
the Remuneration Committee. Information on the Remuneration 
Committee and the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 53 to 70. 
Engagement with shareholders
It is the role of the Group Board to promote the long-term  
success of the Company and to ensure that its obligations to its 
shareholders and other stakeholders are met. Therefore, the 
Group gives priority to effective dialogue with shareholders and 
ensuring active shareholder engagement.
Throughout the year, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer and Head of External Affairs met with institutional and 
major shareholders.
The Group Board recognises the importance of maintaining  
good and constructive communication with the Company’s 
shareholders, and has in place a comprehensive programme  
to facilitate this each year.
The Annual Report is an important medium for communicating 
with shareholders, setting out detailed reviews of the business 
and its future developments in the Strategic Report section.
In order to ensure that the members of the Group Board  
develop an understanding of the views of shareholders, there is 
regular dialogue with institutional investors and shareholders, 
presentations by management and investor roadshows around  
the time of the Group’s year-end and half-year results 
announcements. Bakkavor also responds to ad hoc requests  
from shareholders on a regular basis.
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, in his capacity 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and the Executive 
Directors will hold meetings with Bakkavor’s largest 
institutional shareholders and market analysts to discuss 
governance developments (including the Remuneration Policy), 
business strategy and financial performance.
AGM
Bakkavor’s AGM provides the Group Board with the opportunity 
to communicate with private and institutional investors. The 
Chairman aims to ensure that all the Directors, including the 
Group Board Committee Chairs, are available at the AGM 
to answer questions. Bakkavor’s first AGM will be held on 
23 May 2018.
46 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE Role of the Nomination Committee
The principal role and responsibilities of the Committee include:

• Ensuring that there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors
• Identifying and nominating for approval by the Group Board 
suitable candidates to fill Group Board vacancies as and when 
they arise

governance
Diversity statement
As a business, we are committed to maintaining a diverse 
workforce at all levels across the Company, and how we do this  
is set out in our equal opportunity policy and Code of Conduct. 
The Directors recognise the importance of diversity and understand 
the significant benefits that come with having a diverse Board. The 
Group Board believes that diversity is a wider issue than gender, 
and includes variations in experience, skills, personal attributes 
and background. We have recently published our first gender pay 
report which identifies the areas that we will focus on. 
Given the short period between Bakkavor’s IPO and the financial 
year end, the Group has yet to formalise its diversity policy.  
Work on this is ongoing, and the diversity policy is expected to  
be in place in 2018.
We will continue to appoint on merit, based on the skills and 
experience required for membership of the Group Board, while 
giving consideration to gender and other forms of diversity when 
the Committee reviews the Group Board’s composition. For 
appointments to the Group Board, Bakkavor uses executive 
search firms who have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct 
setting out the key principles of best practice in the recruitment 
process. These principles include a recommendation that search 
firms should consider gender diversity and Bakkavor insists on 
having both male and female candidates when drawing up 
longlists and shortlists of candidates.
Nomination Committee evaluation
It is intended that an evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
Nomination Committee will be conducted in 2018.

in anticipation of the IPO, and its first meeting was on 28 March 
2018. It is intended that in the coming year, the Committee will 
monitor the balance of the Group Board to ensure that there 
remains an appropriate range of skills, experience and diversity 
and will ensure succession plans for Directors and Senior 
Executives are relevant and up to date.

Chairman’s overview
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit and Risk 
Committee for the year ended 30 December 2017. This report 
describes the Committee’s responsibilities and key activities  
over the year.
In 2017, for the period prior to the IPO, the Bakkavor Holdings 
Limited (formerly Bakkavor Group Limited) Audit Committee 
members were Simon Burke, Robert Berlin and Todd Krasnow.
In advance of Bakkavor’s IPO, a new Audit and Risk Committee 
was set up for Bakkavor Group plc comprised only of Independent 
Non-executive Directors. Its first meeting took place on  
11 December 2017, at which the Committee considered the 
results of assurance and Internal Audit work carried out in the 
year, discussed strengthening Bakkavor’s risk function, and 
considered the proposed External Audit tender. 
The Audit and Risk Committee met again on 20 February 2018 and 
29 March 2018 to review and discuss the progress of the audit of 
the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 December 2017, 
approve the Internal Audit plan for 2018 and consider in detail the 
Group’s IT systems and its exposure to risks such as cyber attack 
and system failure. The Committee met privately with the External 
Auditors on each occasion to discuss any matters they wished to 
make the Committee aware of.

of scheduled meetings during the year, the agendas of which 
include risk management processes, the programme of Internal 
Audit and assurance work, deep dives on key financial and other 
risk areas, and work related to events in the financial calendar  
of the Company.

Lodge, an Independent Non-executive Director, was appointed to 
the Group Board with effect from 3 April 2018 and will shortly 
assume the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and, at the 
same time, I will step down from the Committee.
The Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and representatives from the 
External Auditors and the Internal Auditors attend the Committee 
meetings by standing invitation. Members of Senior Management 
from various areas of the business attend the Committee 
meetings by invitation as necessary.
The Committee has four scheduled meetings a year and will 
additionally meet if and when required.

49 GOVERNANCE
Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
The Group is required to ensure  
that its external reporting is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
At the request of the Group Board, the Committee 
assessed, via discussion with and challenge of 
management, whether disclosures in the Group’s 
published Financial Statements were fair, balanced 
and understandable. It received papers on key 
judgemental areas setting out management’s 
accounting treatment and also sought and obtained 
confirmation from the Chief Financial Officer and his 
team that they considered the disclosures to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and discussed this 
evaluation with the External Auditors, who took this  
into account when conducting their audit. It also 
established via reports from management that there 
were no indications of fraud relating to financial 
reporting matters.
Having assessed all of the available 
information and the assurances provided 
by management, the Committee concluded 
that the processes underlying the 
preparation of the Group’s published 
Financial Statements were appropriate in 
ensuring that those statements were fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Risk Management and internal control
The Committee is required to  
assist the Group Board in the  
annual review of the effectiveness  
of the Company’s Risk Management 
process and internal control 
systems.
The Committee received a report and assessment  
of those risks that might threaten the Group’s 
business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. It considered and challenged management 
on the overall effectiveness of the Risk Management 
process and internal control systems. The  
Committee reviewed the relevant disclosures  
within the Accountability section of the Corporate 
Governance Report within the Annual Report.
The Committee agreed to recommend  
to the Group Board the Annual Report 
statements relating to the effectiveness  
of the Risk Management process and 
internal control systems.
Internal Audit
  
The Committee is required to 
oversee the performance, 
resourcing and effectiveness of  
the Internal Audit function.
The Company has an Internal Audit function,  
which currently comprises professionals from  
an external provider, RSM, who have the skills  
and experience required to carry out Internal Audit  
reviews across the Company’s operational business 
units. The Committee reviewed the effectiveness  
of the Group’s Internal Audit function in the overall 
context of the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems.
It reviewed and assessed the risk-based Internal 
Audit plan.
It reviewed and monitored management’s 
responsiveness to the findings and recommendations 
of the Internal Audit function.
The Committee received all Internal Audit reports 
and, in addition, received summary reports on the 
results of the work of the Internal Audit function on  
a periodic basis. 
In addition to the Internal Audit function, the 
completion of comprehensive internal control 
questionnaires is required from financial controllers 
within each business unit. These self-assessment 
representations are designed to ensure that any 
material control breakdowns are highlighted.
The Committee reviewed the effective-
ness of the Internal Audit function and 
approved the risk-based audit plan.  
The Committee is actively engaged in 
strengthening the Internal Audit function 
and scope during 2018.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE CONTINUED
50 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Whistleblowing and bribery  
The Committee considers the adequacy  
of the Group’s arrangements by which 
employees may in confidence raise 
concerns about improprieties in matters  
of financial reporting or other matters.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy and anti-bribery  
and business ethics policy which were 
updated as part of the pre IPO work on 
governance and controls.
The Committee concluded that whistleblowing 
and anti-bribery processes were operating 
effectively.
Oversight of External Auditors  
The Committee is required to oversee  
the work and performance of Deloitte  
as External Auditors, including the 
maintenance of audit quality during  
the period.
The Committee met with the key  
members of the Deloitte audit team to 
discuss the 2017 audit plan and agree 
areas of focus.
It assessed regular reports from Deloitte 
on the progress of the 2017 audit and any 
material issues identified. It debated the 
draft audit opinion for the 2017 year end. 
The Committee was also briefed by 
Deloitte on critical accounting estimates, 
where significant judgement is needed.
The Committee approved the audit plan  
and the main areas of focus, including 
valuation of customer deduction accruals  
and impairment reviews for goodwill and 
intangible assets. The Committee reviewed 
and discussed with Deloitte their Audit and 
Risk Committee report on the 2017 Financial 
Statements which highlighted any issues  
from the audit work undertaken by the 
External Auditors.
Audit and audit-related fees
Audit and audit-related fees include  
the statutory audit of the Group and  
its subsidiaries.
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
and approved a recommendation from 
management on the Company’s audit  
and audit-related fees.
The Committee considers the 2017 audit  
fees to be in line with those expected given the 
complexities of the business and the external 
reporting requirements of a listed company.
Non-audit fees   
To safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the External Auditors  
from becoming compromised, the 
Committee has a formal policy governing 
the engagement of the External Auditors  
to provide non-audit services. The policy is 
reviewed on an annual basis and this year 
the Committee reviewed the Group’s policy 
governing non-audit work against details  
of new regulations on the statutory audit of 
public interest entities which the Group is 
required to comply with since its public 
listing in November 2017.
The Group has updated its internal process 
on the engagement of auditors and review 
of non-audit services to ensure that its 
policy is in line with new regulation.
The Committee reviewed and approved  
all arrangements for non-audit fees.  
The Committee ensured that firms other  
than the External Auditors had been  
considered, following a competitive  
tender process, for the provision of a  
wide range of services. The Committee 
ensured there were no exceptions to  
fee limits and approval process per the  
policy during the year.
During the year, non-audit fees of £1.2 million 
were paid to Deloitte as discussed in Note 6  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
These principally related to Bakkavor's IPO.  
All non-audit services for the year were 
provided prior to the public listing. 
The Committee continues to follow the 
statutory guidance to seek to reduce the 
reliance on the External Auditors for non- 
audit work. The Committee approved the 
rationalisation of non-audit work among 
service providers by the Group.
51 GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
External Auditor 
Deloitte was appointed as the External Auditor of Bakkavor in 
2005. The current lead audit Partner, William Smith, was 
appointed in September 2016.
External Audit tender process
Following the IPO, and after Bakkavor became a constituent of  
the FTSE 250 at the end of February 2018, Bakkavor became a 
Public Interest Entity (“PIE”) as defined under the Companies  
Act 2006. As a PIE, and in accordance with the Governance Code 
and EU legislation, Bakkavor is required to comply with all 
requirements regarding auditor tendering every 10 years and 
rotation after 20 years.
Bakkavor has not run a competitive audit tender process in the 
last 10 years and is therefore required to carry one out for its  
first audit after it became a PIE. 
In compliance with the Competition and Markets Authority’s  
final Order on mandatory tendering and audit committee 
responsibilities for FTSE 350 companies, the Audit and Risk 
Committee plans to carry out a full and competitive audit tender 
during 2018 with the External Auditor’s appointment being 
effective for the audit of the 2018 financial year.
Audit and Risk Committee evaluation
It is intended that an evaluation of the effectiveness of the  
Audit and Risk Committee will be conducted in 2018.

Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Greenhouse gas emission  
(“GHG”) data
GHG emissions for the year ended  
30 December 2017 were measured  
and reported as required.
The Committee reviewed the GHG  
emissions reported as required under  
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, 
following the UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines June 2013.
The Committee is satisfied that the judgements 
made by management are reasonable, and that 
appropriate disclosures have been included in 
the Annual Report.
Significant issues
The items noted below reflect those  
issues which were considered most 
significant in preparing the Annual Report 
Financial Statements: 
  
Impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets
The Group had significant amounts of 
goodwill and intangible assets as at 30 
December 2017 that are subject to an 
annual impairment review under IFRS. 
The Committee reviewed a paper prepared 
by management that set out the basis and 
assumptions for the annual impairment 
review. The paper set out the determination  
of cash-generating units (“CGUs”), the  
budget information used and the discount 
rate to be applied for the purpose of the 
value-in-use calculation.
The impairment review indicated that no 
impairment provisions were required for the 
year ended 30 December 2017. The Committee 
noted that there was lower headroom for the 
US CGU but that this was in their view to be 
expected at this stage of the development of the 
US business.
Customer deduction accruals
The Group has arrangements in place  
with its customers to provide volume-
related rebates and is required to make 
estimates in determining the value and 
timing of accruals for these customer 
deductions due in respect of sales.
The Committee reviewed a paper prepared  
by management that set out the rationale  
for the calculation and timing of the  
accruals held at 30 December 2017 under 
these arrangements. The paper included a 
summary of the key agreements in place 
and the level of accruals held across the 
business.
The Committee challenged management on  
the logic that had been applied to determine 
the level of accruals held at 30 December 2017 
under these arrangements. The Committee 
acknowledged that this was a highly subjective 
area that required a significant level of 
estimates to be made but concurred with the 
rationale applied by management to determine 
the value of these accruals. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE CONTINUED
52 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Chairman’s overview
As the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased  
to present, on behalf of the Group Board, our first Directors’ 
Remuneration Report since our listing on the Main Market of  
the London Stock Exchange on 16 November 2017.
In line with the UK reporting regulations, this report is split into 
three sections:
• This Annual Statement summarising the work of the Committee 
and our approach to remuneration;
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which details Bakkavor’s 
Remuneration Policy and how it links to strategy; and
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out the 
remuneration arrangements and incentive outcomes for the 
year under review and how the Committee intends to 
implement the new Remuneration Policy in 2018.
As this is the first financial year since coming to market, there will 
be two remuneration related resolutions at the May 2018 Annual 
General Meeting, being a binding vote on the Remuneration Policy 
and an advisory vote on the rest of the Remuneration Report. 
The work of the Remuneration Committee
The year ended 30 December 2017 was a major milestone in the 
Company’s history as it completed a successful listing on the 
London market. Earlier in the year, in anticipation of the IPO,  
the Remuneration Committee undertook a comprehensive  
review of the existing senior executive remuneration structure  
and considered how best to transition to a model which meets  
the expectations of institutional investors and is in line with good 
corporate governance. 
In doing so, the Committee took into account the significant 
shareholding held by the founder Directors both before and  
after listing and the existing remuneration structure which  
was weighted towards fixed pay and included a relatively modest 
annual bonus as the only form of performance related pay.  
The post-IPO Remuneration Policy has been developed with the 
assistance of our independent remuneration consultants and 
provides for greater balance in terms of the fixed to variable pay 
mix. Through participation in a new Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”) and with part of the bonus deferred for three years, the 
Committee believes there is strong alignment with shareholders’ 
interests and the Committee’s objective of ensuring remuneration 
supports the long-term success of the Company. The policy also 
includes the good practice principles prevalent in UK companies 
such as annual bonus deferral, LTIP holding periods, share 
ownership guidelines and recovery and withholding provisions.
The Remuneration Policy aims to provide a competitive package 
that enables us to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior 
management and supports the delivery of the Group’s strategic 
objectives and continued success. 
A summary of the post-listing remuneration arrangements  
was provided in the IPO prospectus. The Remuneration Policy 
contained in this report is consistent with what was disclosed 
previously and simply provides greater transparency and 
information for shareholders, as is required by the remuneration 
reporting regulations.
The Committee is aware of the corporate governance reforms  
that will be finalised by the FRC and Government this year and  
will come into force in 2019. As a Committee, we are regularly 
informed of developments and the evolving views of shareholders 
and shareholder voting bodies. The Committee takes a keen 
interest in governance and will seek to comply with good practice 
principles going forward.
Remuneration in 2017
While the Company was in private ownership, senior executive 
packages comprised the following elements:
• Fixed pay made up of a base salary, ancillary benefits and a 
contribution towards pension, and 
• A performance related cash bonus based on targets set at the 
start of the year.
The 2017 bonus opportunities for the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer were 67% and 59% of base salary, 
respectively. Our financial performance resulted in an annual 
bonus payout of 22.7% and 29.4% of salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. In line with the 
terms of the bonus plan, these bonuses will be paid in cash.
ANNUAL STATEMENT
53 GOVERNANCE
As a quid pro quo for the absence of any long-term incentive 
opportunity, the Company operated a structure which included,  
in some cases, annual retention bonuses in addition to the 
performance related bonus set out above. As disclosed in the 
prospectus and in accordance with an arrangement entered into 
whilst Bakkavor was a private company, the Chief Financial Officer 
was eligible to receive a retention bonus of £200,000, subject to 
continued employment, which he received in January 2018.  
As part of the transition towards a more standard plc package 
that is aligned with good practice, such retention bonuses do not 
form part of the post-listing Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors. Further information is provided below.
Prior to Admission, Peter Gates and other selected Bakkavor 
employees were granted share option awards on a one-off basis. 
Peter’s award was over 1,222,515 shares which have an exercise 
price of 76.4 pence. These options will vest in 2020 subject to 
continued employment and the achievement of an EBITDA 
condition. No awards were made at or immediately after the IPO.
Application of Remuneration policy in 2018
As part of the review, the Committee undertook a thorough  
review of salaries to consider market positioning and the 
relationship between fixed and variable pay. The Committee 
determined that the Executive Directors’ salaries, which were  
set on 1 January 2017, were competitive and therefore remained 
unchanged post Admission. The Chief Executive Officer‘s salary  
is £750,000 and the Chief Financial Officer’s is £467,000. There  
will be no change in 2018 and salaries will next be reviewed in 
January 2019. The Committee’s default policy is to consider 
whether a salary increase is warranted, and in such cases to 
increase salaries by no more than the increase across the  
wider workforce.
As outlined in the prospectus, the annual bonus opportunity  
in 2018 will be 80% of salary for Agust Gudmundsson and 125%  
of salary for Peter Gates. Payment of the annual bonus will be 
subject to the achievement of challenging financial targets with 
50% based on adjusted EBITDA, 25% on revenue and 25% on  
Free Cash Flow. Two-thirds of any bonus that might become 
payable will be paid in cash and the remaining one-third will be 
deferred for three years. The deferral will be in the form of cash 
for the Chief Executive Officer reflecting his existing shareholding 
and in shares for the Chief Financial Officer. 
As a result of the Chief Executive Officer‘s significant 
shareholding, Agust Gudmundsson will not participate in the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Committee intends to make an 
Long-Term Incentive Plan award to Peter Gates with a face value 
of 150% of salary in 2018. This award will be subject to a relative 
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measure and an earnings per 
share condition, each with an equal weighting measured over  
a three year period. A two year post-vesting holding period will 
apply on any vested awards.
Conclusion
The Committee recognised that senior executive salaries were 
positioned at competitive levels prior to IPO and therefore took  
the view that there should be no change to fixed pay levels post 
listing or in 2018. Reflecting the The Chief Executive Officer‘s 
existing interests as a co-founder of the Group, his variable pay 
participation has been limited to the annual bonus. The Chief 
Financial Officer’s new package now has a more typical balance 
between fixed and variable pay and no longer includes a retention 
bonus. We believe the remuneration policy is appropriate for a 
FTSE 250 company and is one that can assist with retaining and 
attracting high calibre talent in a competitive industry to ensure 
our continued success. The packages also include the good 
practice elements that feature in UK plc practice.
The Committee recognises the importance of developing a  
close relationship with shareholders in facilitating the work of  
the Committee in developing the remuneration policy and how  
we operate it. Therefore, if you have any comments or feedback  
on this report, then please let me know through the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary. I look forward to receiving your 
support at the 2018 AGM.

REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
Remuneration Policy (“the Policy”) for the Group and has been 
prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 and the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules. 
The Policy was developed taking into account the principles  
of the Governance Code and the voting guidelines of major  
UK institutional investor bodies. 
The following Policy will be put forward for approval by 
shareholders in a binding vote at the forthcoming 2018 AGM.  
If approved, it is intended that the Policy will take effect from  
the date of approval and last for three years. 
Key considerations when determining the  
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee designed the Policy with  
the following aims in mind. The Policy should:
• attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management 
and focus them on the delivery of the Group’s strategic and 
business objectives
• be competitive against appropriate market benchmarks  
with the ability to earn above market rewards for strong 
performance
• be simple and understandable, both internally and externally
• achieve consistency of approach across the Senior 
Management population to the extent appropriate and
• take due account of good governance and promote the 
long-term success of the Group
In seeking to achieve the above objectives, the Committee is 
mindful of the views of a broad range of stakeholders in the 
business and accordingly takes account of a number of factors 
when setting remuneration including market conditions, pay  
and benefits in relevant comparator organisations, terms and 
conditions of employment across the Group, the Group’s risk 
appetite, the expectations of institutional shareholders and 
feedback from shareholders and other stakeholders.
Shareholder views
The Group Board is committed to open dialogue with 
shareholders and intends to engage directly with them and  
their representative bodies when considering any significant 
changes to our remuneration arrangements. The Remuneration 
Committee will consider shareholder feedback received following 
the AGM, as well as any additional feedback and guidance 
received from time to time. This feedback will be considered  
by the Committee as it develops the Company’s remuneration 
framework and practices going forward. Assisted by its 
independent adviser, the Remuneration Committee also  
actively monitors developments in the expectations of  
institutional investors and their representative bodies.
Employment conditions
The Committee is regularly updated throughout the year on  
pay and conditions applying to Group employees including any 
significant changes to employment conditions. 
Whilst the Committee does not currently consult directly with 
employees regarding its policy for Directors, the Committee  
will consider the proposals being introduced as part of the  
FRC’s updated UK Corporate Governance Code in 2018 and will 
determine accordingly the best method of bringing the employee 
voice to the boardroom. 
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, which is set  
out over the following pages, supports the business needs of  
the Company, ensuring it promotes long-term success whilst 
enabling it to attract, retain and motivate senior executives of a 
high calibre. The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration 
policy supports the Company’s strategy of growing long-term 
shareholder value and appropriately balances fixed and variable 
remuneration. With a high proportion of reward delivered in the 
form of equity (for executives other than the current Chief 
Executive Officer), this ensures that executives have a strong 
alignment with shareholders through the Company’s share price.

Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary      
To recruit and retain 
executives of the 
highest calibre who  
are capable of 
delivering the Group’s 
strategic objectives, 
reflecting the 
individual’s experience 
and role within the 
Group.
Base salary is  
designed to provide  
an appropriate level of 
fixed income to avoid  
an over-reliance on 
variable pay elements 
that could encourage 
excessive risk taking.
 Salaries are normally reviewed annually  
and changes are generally effective from  
the start of the financial year.
The annual salary review of Executive 
Directors takes a number of factors into 
consideration, including:
• business performance
• salary increases awarded to the overall 
employee population
• skills and experience of the individual 
over time
• scope of the individual’s responsibilities;
• changes in the size and complexity of 
the Group
• market competitiveness assessed by 
periodic benchmarking
• the underlying rate of inflation
 Whilst there is no prescribed  
formulaic maximum, any increases  
will take into account prevailing market 
and economic conditions and the 
approach to employee pay throughout 
the organisation.
Base salary increases are awarded  
at the discretion of the Committee; 
however, salary increases will normally 
be no greater than the general increase 
awarded to the wider workforce, in 
percentage of salary terms.
Percentage increases beyond those 
granted to the wider workforce may  
be awarded in certain circumstances 
such as when there is a change in the 
individual’s role or responsibility or 
where there has been a fundamental 
change in the scale or nature of the 
Company.
In addition, a higher increase may be 
made where an individual had been 
appointed to a new role at below market 
salary while gaining experience. 
Subsequent demonstration of strong 
performance may result in a salary 
increase that is higher than for the wider 
workforce.
 Executive Directors’ 
performance is a 
factor considered 
when determining 
salaries.
No recovery or 
withholding 
provisions apply.
Benefits      
Benefits in kind offered 
to Executive Directors 
are provided to assist 
with retention and 
recruitment.
 The Company aims to offer benefits that  
are in line with typical market practice.
The main benefits currently provided  
include:
• family private medical insurance
• life assurance 
• income protection 
• health screening 
• company car/car allowance
• travel insurance
Under certain circumstances the Group may 
offer relocation allowances or assistance. 
Expatriate benefits may be offered where 
required.
Travel and any reasonable business-related 
expenses (including tax thereon) may be 
reimbursed on a gross of tax basis.
Executive Directors may become eligible for 
other benefits which are introduced for the 
wider workforce on broadly similar terms.
 The value of each benefit is not 
predetermined and is typically based 
upon the cost to the Group.
 Not performance-
related.
No recovery  
or withholding 
provisions apply other 
than if relocation 
costs are provided.  
A proportion of any 
relocation costs may 
be recovered where  
a Director leaves the 
employment of the 
Group within a 
specified time period 
after appointment or 
date of relocation.
REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE
The table below sets out, for each element of pay, a summary of how remuneration is structured after listing and how it supports  
the Company’s strategy.

Pensions      
The Group aims to 
provide a contribution 
towards life in 
retirement.
 Directors are eligible to receive 
employer contributions to the 
Company’s pension plan (which  
is a defined contribution plan)  
or a salary supplement in lieu  
of pension benefits or a mixture  
of both.
 Up to 15% of base salary per 
annum for the current Chief 
Executive Officer and 20% of 
base salary per annum for the 
current Chief Financial Officer 
contribution.
A maximum 15% of salary 
contribution applies to new 
directors.
 Not performance-related.
No recovery or withholding  
provisions apply.
Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP or annual bonus)    
The annual bonus 
scheme rewards the 
achievement of 
stretching objectives 
that support the 
Group’s corporate  
goals and delivery of  
the business strategy.
Delivery of a proportion 
in deferred bonus 
shares provides a 
retention element  
and alignment with 
shareholders.
 Bonuses are determined based  
on measures and targets that are 
agreed by the Committee at the 
start of each financial year.
Two-thirds of the annual bonus 
will be payable in cash, typically  
in March following the end of the 
financial year
Up to one-third of the bonus is 
compulsorily deferred in shares 
(or cash in the case of the current 
Chief Executive Officer) for three 
years under the Deferred Annual 
Bonus Plan. At the discretion of 
the Committee, participants may 
also be entitled to receive the 
value of dividends paid between 
grant and vesting on vested 
shares. The payment may be in 
cash or shares and may assume 
dividend reinvestment.
 The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 150% of salary  
for Executive Directors.
The current Chief Executive 
Officer’s bonus opportunity is 
lower, at 80% of his base salary.
The normal maximum for  
the current Chief Financial 
Officer is 125% of salary 
although this may be increased 
in line with the maximum  
150% of salary limit.
 Performance measures are determined 
by the Committee each year and may 
vary to ensure that they promote the 
Company’s long-term business strategy 
and shareholder value.
The majority of the annual bonus 
outcome will be based on financial 
measures. This may be a single 
measure such as profit or a mix of 
measures as determined by the 
Committee. 
Personal objectives and/or strategic 
KPIs may also be chosen. 
Where a sliding scale of targets applies, 
up to 20% of that element may be 
payable for threshold performance.
The bonus measures are reviewed 
annually and the Committee has the 
discretion to vary the mix of measures 
or to introduce new measures taking 
into account the strategic focus of the 
Company at the time.
The Committee may alter the bonus 
outcome if it considers that the pay out 
is inconsistent with the Company’s 
overall performance taking account of 
any factors it considers relevant. This 
will help ensure that the pay out reflects 
overall Company performance during 
the period. The Committee will consult 
with leading investors if appropriate 
before any exercise of its discretion to 
increase the bonus outcome. 
Bonus payments, including deferred 
bonus awards, are subject to recovery 
and withholding provisions (see 
‘Recovery and withholding’ in the  
‘Notes to the policy table’ below for 
further detail).

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)     
The LTIP is designed  
to incentivise the 
successful execution  
of business strategy 
over the longer term 
and provide long-term 
retention.
Facilitates share 
ownership to provide 
further alignment with 
shareholders.
 Awards will typically be granted 
annually to Executive Directors  
in the form of nil or nominal cost 
options that vest according to 
performance conditions normally 
measured over three financial 
years.
Awards are subject to an 
additional post-vesting holding 
period which requires awards  
to be retained for a period of  
two years from the end of the 
vesting period, except for shares 
sold to pay personal tax upon 
vesting/exercise.
At the discretion of the 
Committee, participants may also 
be entitled to receive the value of 
dividends paid between grant and 
vesting (or, if applicable, between 
grant and the earlier to occur of 
the expiry of any holding period 
and the exercise of an award) on 
vested shares. The payment may 
be in cash or shares and may 
assume dividend reinvestment
The current Chief Executive 
Officer will not participate in  
the LTIP.
 The individual plan limit is  
200% of base salary in any 
financial year.
The award policy for the current 
Chief Financial Officer is set at 
150% of base salary, although 
the Committee has the 
discretion to make an award  
of up to 200% of base salary.
 Performance is normally measured 
over no less than three financial years.
Awards will be subject to the 
achievement of stretching targets 
designed to incentivise performance  
in support of the Group’s strategy and 
business objectives.
The first set of LTIP awards will be 
subject to relative TSR and earnings  
per share growth targets. However,  
the Committee has the flexibility to vary 
the mix of measures or to introduce 
new measures for each subsequent 
award taking into account business 
priorities at the time of grant.
For TSR and financial measures, no 
more than 25% of each element may 
vest for threshold performance. 
The Committee may alter the vesting 
outcome if it considers that the level of 
vesting is inconsistent with the 
Company’s overall performance taking 
account of any factors it considers 
relevant. This will help ensure that 
vesting reflects overall Company 
performance during the period. The 
Committee would seek to consult with 
leading investors if appropriate before 
any exercise of its discretion to increase 
the vesting outcome.
Awards are subject to recovery and 
withholding provisions (see ‘Recovery 
and withholding’ in the ‘Notes to the 
policy table’ below for further detail).
All-employee share schemes    
Encourages employee 
share ownership and 
therefore increases 
alignment with 
shareholders.
 The Company may, from time to 
time, operate tax-approved share 
plans (such as HMRC-approved 
Save As You Earn Option Plan and 
Share Incentive Plan) for which 
Executive Directors could be 
eligible.
 The schemes are subject to  
the limits set by HMRC from 
time to time.

Share ownership guidelines
Encourages  
Executive Directors  
to build a meaningful 
shareholding in the 
Group so as to further 
align interests with 
shareholders.
 Executive Directors are required to 
retain at least half of any share awards 
vesting as shares (after the sale of any 
shares to settle tax due) until they have 
reached the required level of holding.
Only shares owned outright by the 
Executive Director or a connected 
person are included. Shares or  
share options which are subject to a 
performance condition are not included. 
Deferred shares and options which  
are vested but unexercised are also  
not included.
 Executive Directors are  
required to build and retain a 
shareholding in Bakkavor 
equivalent to at least 200% of 
their base salary.
 Not performance related.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ fees    
To attract Non-
executive Directors  
who have a broad  
range of experience  
and skills to provide 
independent  
judgement on issues of 
strategy, performance, 
resources and 
standards of conduct.
 Non-executive Directors may receive 
fees paid monthly in cash which consist 
of an annual basic fee and they may 
receive additional fees for additional 
responsibilities. 
The Chairman’s fee is reviewed  
annually by the Committee (without  
the Chairman present).
Fee levels for the Non-executive 
Directors are determined by the 
Company Chairman and Executive 
Directors.
In exceptional circumstances, if there is 
a temporary yet material increase in the 
time commitments for Non-executive 
Directors, the Board may pay extra fees 
to recognise that additional workload.
Non-executives ordinarily do not 
participate in any pension, bonus  
or share incentive plans. Travel, 
accommodation and other business-
related expenses incurred in carrying 
out the role will be paid by the Company 
including, if relevant, any gross-up  
for tax. 
As was disclosed in the prospectus 
prepared on Admission, Lydur 
Gudmundsson is currently employed  
to provide consulting services to the 
Group for an annual fee. He receives 
medical cover for the benefit of his 
family in the UK.
Robert Berlin does not receive any fees 
from the Group in respect of his role as 
Non-executive Director. 
 When reviewing fee levels, 
account is taken of market 
movements in the fees of 
Non-executive Directors,  
Group Board Committee 
responsibilities and ongoing 
time commitments.
Actual fee levels are disclosed  
in the Annual Remuneration 
Report for the relevant financial 
year.

59 GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Notes to the policy table
Recovery and withholding
Awards under the Annual Bonus Plan, the Deferred Annual  
Bonus Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan are subject to 
recovery and withholding provisions which permit the Committee, 
in its discretion, to reduce the size of any future bonus or share 
award granted to the employee, to reduce the size of any granted 
but unvested share award held by the employee, or to require  
the employee to make a cash payment to the Company. The 
circumstances in which the Company may apply the recovery  
and withholding provisions are the discovery of a material 
misstatement of financial results, a miscalculation or error in 
assessing any condition (including any performance condition) 
applying to the award, or in the event of serious misconduct 
committed by the employee.
In respect of cash bonus payments under the Annual Bonus Plan, 
the recovery and withholding provisions apply for one year from 
the date of payment of the bonus (or, if later, the date of 
publication of the Company’s financial results for the year 
following the relevant year over which the bonus was earned). 
In respect of share awards under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 
and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the recovery and withholding 
provisions apply up until the third anniversary of the date on which 
the relevant award vests, although the Committee may extend this 
period for a further two years if there is an ongoing investigation 
into the circumstances of any event that, if determined to have 
occurred, would permit the Committee to operate the recovery 
and withholding provisions. 
Performance conditions
The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual  
bonus scheme reflect the Committee’s belief that any incentive 
compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to 
both the delivery of key financial targets and individual and/or 
strategic performance measures intended to ensure that 
Executive Directors are incentivised to deliver across a range of 
objectives for which they are accountable. The Committee has 
retained some flexibility on the specific measures which will be 
used to ensure that any measures are fully aligned with the 
strategic imperatives prevailing at the time they are set. 
The targets for the bonus scheme for the forthcoming year will  
be set out in general terms, subject to limitations with regards  
to commercial sensitivity. The full details of the targets will be 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report when they are  
in the public domain, usually following the end of the relevant 
financial year. 
The choice of the performance conditions applicable to the  
LTIP awards will be aligned with the Company’s objective of 
delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.  
The Committee has retained flexibility on the measures which will 
be used for future award cycles to ensure that the measures are 
fully aligned with the strategy prevailing at the time the awards 
are granted. Notwithstanding this, the Committee would, if 
appropriate, seek to consult with major shareholders in advance 
of any material change to the choice or weighting of the LTIP 
performance measures. 
The Committee will review the calibration of targets applicable  
to the annual bonus and the LTIP annually to ensure they remain 
appropriate and sufficiently challenging, taking into account the 
Company’s strategic objectives and the interests of shareholders.
Differences in Remuneration Policy between Executive Directors 
and other employees
The overall approach to reward for employees across the 
workforce is a key reference point when setting the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors. When reviewing the salaries of the 
Executive Directors, the Committee pays close attention to pay 
and employment conditions across the wider workforce and in 
normal circumstances the increase for Executive Directors will  
be no higher than the average increase for the general workforce.
The key difference between the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and that of our other employees is that, overall, at 
senior levels, remuneration is increasingly long term, and ‘at risk’ 
with an emphasis on performance-related pay linked to business 
performance and share-based remuneration. This ensures that 
remuneration at senior levels will increase or decrease in line 
with business performance and provides alignment between the 
interests of Executive Directors and shareholders. In particular, 
long-term incentives are provided only to the most senior 
executives as they are reserved for those considered to have the 
greatest potential to influence overall levels of performance.
Committee discretion in operation of variable pay schemes
The Committee operates under the powers it has been delegated 
by the Group Board. In addition, it complies with rules that are 
either subject to shareholder approval (Long-Term Incentive Plan 
and Deferred Share Bonus Plan) or by approval of the Group 
Board (annual performance bonus scheme). These rules provide 
the Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure that 
the implementation of the Remuneration Policy is fair, both to the 
individual Director and to the shareholders. The Committee also 
has discretion to set components of remuneration within a range, 
from time to time. The extent of such discretion is set out in the 
relevant rules, the maximum opportunity or the performance 
metrics section of the policy table above. To ensure the efficient 
administration of the variable incentive plans outlined above, the 
Committee will apply certain operational discretions.
60 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report These include the following:
• selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis
• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payments
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within 
the limits set out in the policy table
• determining the choice of (and adjustment of) performance 
measures and targets for each incentive plan in accordance 
with the policy set out above and the rules of each plan
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment 
of performance and discretion relating to measurement of 
performance in certain events such as a change of control  
or reconstruction
• whether malus and clawback shall be applied to any award  
in the relevant circumstances and, if so, the extent to which it 
shall be applied
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances, for instance for changes in capital structure
• determining ‘good leaver’ status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 
other incentive schemes, where applicable, from year to year
If an event occurs which results in the Annual Bonus Plan or  
LTIP performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no 
longer appropriate (e.g. material acquisition or divestment), the 
Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the 
measures and/or targets and alter weightings, provided that the 
revised conditions are not materially less challenging than the 
original conditions. Any use of the above discretion would, where 
relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and 
may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the 
Company’s major shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee may approve  
payments to satisfy commitments agreed prior to the listing of 
 the Company in November 2017 that have either been disclosed 
to shareholders in the prospectus or formed part of the pre-IPO 
remuneration policy. The Committee may also approve payments 
outside this Remuneration Policy in order to satisfy legacy 
arrangements made to an employee prior to (and not in 
contemplation of) promotion to the Group Board.
All historic awards that were granted in connection with or prior  
to listing but which remain outstanding, remain eligible to vest 
based on their original award terms.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors
The charts below show an estimate of the 2018 remuneration 
package for each Executive Director under three assumed 
performance scenarios. These scenarios are based upon the 
Remuneration Policy set out above. 
The scenarios in the graphs below are defined as follows:
Below target (comprising fixed pay only):
• Base salary as at 1 January 2018
• Benefits: estimated value provided under the policy
• Pension: 15% of salary contribution for the Chief Executive 
Officer, 20% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer
Target:
• Fixed pay as set out above
• Assumes bonus pay out of 50% of 2018 maximum bonus 
opportunity levels
• Assumes 25% of the LTIP vests (note: the Chief Executive 
Officer does not participate in the LTIP)
Maximum:
• Fixed pay as set out above
• Assumes 100% of maximum bonus pay out (80% of salary for 
CEO and 125% of salary for Chief Financial Officer)
• Assumes 100% of the LTIP vests (assuming a 150% of salary 
grant for the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Executive Officer 
does not participate in the LTIP) 
No share price growth has been factored in to the chart, and all 
amounts have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.

Other remuneration policies
Remuneration for new appointments
Where it is necessary to appoint or replace an Executive Director, the Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration 
arrangements in the recruitment of a new Executive Director is to take account of the calibre, expertise and responsibilities of the 
individual, his or her remuneration package in their prior role and market rates. Remuneration will be in line with our policy and the 
Committee will not pay more than is necessary to facilitate recruitment.
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director will be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. Further details are provided below:
Salary The Committee will set a base salary appropriate to the calibre, experience and responsibilities of the new 
appointee. In arriving at a salary, the Committee may take into account, amongst other things, the market  
rate for the role and internal relativities. 
The Committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a lower level initially, with  
a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the desired 
positioning, subject to individual performance.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has the ability to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a 
rate higher than the market level to reflect the criticality of the role and the experience and performance of 
the individual.
Benefits Benefits will be consistent with the principles of the policy set out on page 56. The Company may award 
certain additional benefits and other allowances including, but not limited to, those to assist with relocation 
support, temporary living and transportation expenses, educational costs for children and tax equalisation to 
allow flexibility in employing an overseas national.
Pension benefits A maximum pension contribution of 15% of salary may be payable for external appointments. 
For an internal appointment, his or her existing pension arrangements may continue to operate.
Any new Executive Director based outside the UK will be eligible to participate in pension or pension 
allowance, insurance and other benefit programmes in line with local practice.
Annual bonus  The maximum bonus oppxortunity is 150% of base salary.
Long-Term  
Incentive Plan
 The maximum opportunity is 200% of base salary which may be used on recruitment and on an ongoing basis, 
if appropriate.
Replacement awards In addition to the above, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements in order to 
‘buy-out’ remuneration relinquished on leaving a former employer.
In the event that such a buy-out is necessary to secure the services of an Executive Director then the structure 
of any award or payment will mirror, as far as is possible, the arrangements in place at the incoming 
Executive Director’s previous employer. 
Any share awards made in this regard may have no performance conditions, or different performance 
conditions, or a shorter vesting period compared to the Company’s existing plans, as appropriate.
Shareholders will be informed of any buy-out arrangements at the time of the Executive Director’s 
appointment.
Notice periods Notice periods shall be up to 12 months.
Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment, it may be necessary to set different annual bonus/LTIP performance 
measures and targets as applicable to other Executive Directors.
The terms of appointment for a Non-executive Director would be in accordance with the remuneration policy for Non-executive 
Directors as set out in the policy table.

The Group’s policy on remuneration for Executive Directors who 
leave the Group is consistent with general market practice and is 
set out below. The Committee will exercise its discretion when 
determining amounts that should be paid to leavers, taking into 
account the facts and circumstances of each case. 
It is the Company’s policy that the period of notice for Executive 
Directors will not normally exceed 12 months and, accordingly, 
the employment contracts of the Executive Directors are 
terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. In the event of  
an Executive Director’s departure, a payment in lieu of notice  
may be payable. The Company may pay the value of the Executive 
Director’s base salary together with accrued holiday entitlement. 
The Company is unequivocally against rewards for failure;  
the circumstances of any departure, including the individual’s 
performance, would be taken into account in every case. Statutory 
redundancy payments may be made, as appropriate. Service 
agreements may be terminated without notice and without 
payment in lieu of notice in certain circumstances, such as gross 
misconduct. The Company may require the Executive Director  
to work during their notice period or may choose to place the 
individual on garden leave, for example, to ensure the protection 
of the Company’s and shareholders’ interests where the Executive 
Director has access to commercially sensitive information.
Except in the case of gross misconduct or resignation,  
the Company may at its absolute discretion reimburse for 
reasonable professional fees relating to the termination of 
employment and, where an Executive Director has been required 
to re-locate, to pay reasonable repatriation costs, including 
possible tax exposure costs.
Ordinarily, Executive Directors have no entitlement to a  
bonus payment in the event that they cease to be employed  
by the Group or are under notice of termination of employment 
at the date that their bonus would otherwise be paid. However, 
they may be considered for a bonus payment by the Committee  
in “good leaver” circumstances (i.e. death, injury, disability, 
retirement, their employing company or the business for  
which they work being sold out of the Group or in other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration  
Committee). Any such bonus payment would ordinarily be  
subject to a pro-rata reduction based on period worked in the 
relevant year, and there would be no requirement for any portion 
of such bonus payment to be deferred into an award over shares 
under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan.
In the event of an Executive Director’s departure, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the plan rules 
as follows:
Plan Treatment on cessation
Deferred Annual 
Bonus Plan (DABP)
 As a general rule, a DABP award will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or ceasing to be a 
Director within the Group (where relevant). 
In the event of a participant’s death, injury, disability, retirement, their employing company or the business for 
which they work being sold out of the Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, awards will not be forfeited but will instead normally vest in full on the original vesting date (or on 
the date of cessation if the Remuneration Committee so determines) to such extent (which may include the 
full extent of the award) as the Remuneration Committee determines appropriate.
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may allow the awards to vest on cessation of the 
participant’s employment.
Long-Term  
Incentive Plan
 As a general rule, an LTIP award will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or ceasing to be a 
Director within the Group (where relevant). 
However, if the participant ceases to be an employee or a Director within the Group because of their death, 
injury, disability, retirement, their employing company or the business for which they work being sold out of 
the Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, then their award will 
vest on the date when it would have vested if they had not so ceased. 
The extent to which an award will vest in these situations will depend upon two factors: 
i) the extent to which the performance conditions (if any) have been satisfied at that time and
ii) the pro-rating of the award by reference to the period of time served in employment during the normal 
vesting period, although the Remuneration Committee can decide to reduce or eliminate the pro-
rating of an award if it regards it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances
Alternatively, if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the Group for one of the ‘good leaver’ 
reasons specified above (or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee), the 
Remuneration Committee can decide that their award will vest on cessation, subject to: 
i) the performance conditions measured at that time and 
ii) pro-rating by reference to the time of cessation as described above 
Such treatment shall also apply in the case of death.

Board. Neither Executive Director currently holds any outside directorships.
Non-executive Directors’ terms of engagement
Each of the Non-executive Directors is engaged under a market standard Non-executive Director appointment letter, which states that 
the appointment will continue for a renewable three-year term provided that the appointment must not continue for more than nine 
years in total. In any event, each appointment is terminable by either party on one month’s written notice. All Non-executive Directors 
are subject to annual re-election at each AGM.

Independent advisers
The Committee takes account of information from both  
internal and independent sources, including New Bridge Street 
(“NBS”) (Aon plc’s executive remuneration consultancy) who  
act as the Committee’s adviser. NBS advised on remuneration 
arrangements in advance of the listing and continues to advise  
the Committee on all aspects of senior executive remuneration. 
Since listing, NBS has assisted with the drafting of the 
Remuneration Policy and has kept the Committee up to date on 
remuneration trends and corporate governance best practice. 
NBS is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group and complies with its Code of Conduct, which sets out 
guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and free of 
undue influence. The Committee reviews the performance and 
independence of its advisers on an annual basis. During the period 
since listing, Bakkavor incurred fees of £18,000 from NBS relating 
to Remuneration Committee advice.

Notes to the remuneration table
1 Agust Gudmundsson’s base salary was set at £750,000 on 1 January 2017. Agust was eligible for Director fees, pension and life assurance in Iceland in 2017 and 
the value of this is shown in the ‘Other’ column. These arrangements ceased as of 30 December 2017.
2 Peter Gates’s base salary was set at £467,000 on 1 January 2017. Prior to Admission, according to an arrangement entered into on 16 March 2017, the Chief 
Financial Officer was eligible to receive a retention bonus of £200,000 in January 2018 subject to continued employment. This type of arrangement does not form 
part of the new remuneration policy and will not continue in 2018. He was appointed to the Board on 20 October 2017 but he was the Group CFO for the whole of 
2017 and therefore the amounts in the above table represent his remuneration for 2017.
3 Simon Burke joined the Group in December 2016 and became a Non-executive Director in February 2017 and his fee was set at £70,000. On 20 October 2017 
Simon Burke was appointed Chairman and his fee was increased to £200,000 p.a. The above reflects his fees for the whole of 2017.
4 Lydur Gudmundsson’s fee was £40,000 until 19 October 2017 and then was increased to £70,000 p.a. with effect from 20 October 2017. In addition, given his  
unique expertise and insight into the Company’s business as a founder of the Bakkavor Group, pursuant to an agreement between Lydur Gudmundsson and 
Bakkavor Iberica S.L., and a service agreement between Bakkavor Iberica S.L. and Bakkavor Holdings Limited, Lydur Gudmundsson will continue to be  
employed to provide consulting services to the Group for a fee of €230,000 per annum. The exchange rate used to convert to GBP for the above table is £1:€1.1408. 
Lydur Gudmundsson is also entitled to medical coverage in the UK for the benefit of his family. Lydur was eligible for Director fees, pension and life assurance  
in Iceland in 2017 disclosed in the ‘other’ column. These arrangements ceased as of 30 December 2017. 
5 Pursuant to a pre-existing commitment with Bakkavor Holdings Limited, on 9 October 2017, Todd Krasnow was granted a cash bonus award in the amount of 
£500,000 payable immediately prior to Admission in recognition of his past services as a Non-executive Director of the Group since January 2016. Todd Krasnow 
has advised the Company that he intends to use the net cash amount (after taking account of any applicable tax and other charges) to purchase the Company’s 
shares following Admission through open market purchases. 
6 Robert Berlin receives no fee for his services.
7 Denis Hennequin joined the Group in November 2016 and became a Non-executive Director in February 2017 and his fee was set at £70,000. The above reflects his 
fees for the whole of 2017.
8 Sue Clark joined the Board on 20 October 2017 and her fee is £70,000 p.a.
9 For Executive Directors, taxable benefits include car allowance and private medical cover.

Activity in the period
The Committee’s principal function is to support Bakkavor’s strategy by ensuring that those individuals responsible for delivering the 
strategy are appropriately incentivised and rewarded through the operation of Bakkavor’s Remuneration Policy. In determining the 
Group’s policy, and in constructing the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and senior employees, the Group Board, 
advised by the Committee, aims to provide remuneration packages that are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and senior employees of the highest calibre. 
The Committee considered the following items during the period:
• setting a Remuneration Policy that is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company;
• ensuring that the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives reflects both their individual performance and 
their contribution to the overall Group results;
• determining the terms of employment and remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives, including recruitment and 
retention terms;
• approving the design and performance targets of any annual incentive schemes that include the Executive Directors and senior executives;
• agreeing the design and performance targets of all share incentive plans;
• assessing the appropriateness and subsequent achievement of the performance targets related incentive plans; and
• recommending to the Board the fees to be paid to the Chairman. The Chairman is excluded from this process.
The Committee is formally constituted and operates on written terms of reference, which are modelled on the Governance Code and 
are available on Bakkavor’s website, www.bakkavor.com.
66 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report 2017 Annual bonus (audited)
In 2017, employees were eligible for an annual discretionary cash bonus, whereby performance objectives were established  
at the beginning of the financial period by reference to suitably challenging corporate goals over the 12 month period. 
The Committee has consistently set stretching corporate goals, which for 2017 comprised Group EBITDA and revenue for  
the Chief Executive Officer, and Group adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, revenue growth and working capital for the  
Chief Financial Officer. 
In 2017 the annual bonus performance-related outcomes were as follows:

early 2018. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Awards with performance periods ending in the year (audited)
There were no long-term incentive awards capable of vesting in relation to performance in the year.
Awards granted in the year
The Company granted a number of share options to employees since July 2017 prior to Admission, as set out in the prospectus.  
This included an award to Peter Gates under the Bakkavor Group Limited 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan. These options were granted 
in anticipation of the IPO and therefore the face value of the options at that time are not available. Further details are set out below.

Peter Gates 3 July 2017 1,222,515 £0.764 April 2020 July 2027
The awards will vest following the publication of the Company’s audited financial results for the 2019 financial year, subject to continued 
service and the satisfaction of the two conditions as set out below:
1. 50% vests in April 2020 provided a liquidity event (i.e. IPO or company sale) has occurred since the date of grant.
2. Provided that condition 1 above has been met a further 25% vests in April 2020 if EBITDA for financial year 2019 is at least  
£175 million and a further 25% vests on a sliding scale for EBITDA of between £175 million and £190 million.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The awards were granted prior to IPO and do not form part of  
the future Remuneration Policy to be approved at the 2018 AGM. 
However, these awards will be able to vest on their original terms 
as agreed prior to policy approval.
Payments to former Directors and for loss of office (audited)
No payments were made to former Directors of the Company  
or in relation to loss of office during the year.
External directorships
None of the Executive Directors currently hold Non-executive 
Directorships at any other companies outside the  
Bakkavor Group.
Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share  
interests (audited)
The share interests of each Director as at 30 December 2017 
(together with interests held by his or her connected persons) are 
set out in the table below. As a direct link between executive 
remuneration and the interests of shareholders, the Committee 
has implemented shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors 
and key senior employees. The guidelines require that Executive 
Directors build up and maintain an interest in the ordinary shares 
of the Company that is 200% of their annual base salary, and 
retain half of any vested deferred bonus and Long-Term Incentive 
Plan awards (net of any taxes due) until this guideline is met. 
Shareholdings for Directors who have held office during the period 
ended 30 December 2017 are set out as a percentage of salary or 
fees in the table below. During the period from 30 December 2017 
to the publication of this report, there have been no changes in the 
Directors’ share interests. None of the Directors hold any loans 
against their shares or otherwise use their shares as collateral.

REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2018
Annual base salary
The Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ base salaries  
on an annual basis, with any increases taking effect from  
1 January each year. Salaries were set at IPO and no increase  
is proposed for 2018. Base salaries effective from 1 January 2018 
are set out below.

Base salary 
2018
Executive Directors  
Agust Gudmundsson £750,000 £750,000
Peter Gates £467,000 £467,000
Benefits and pension
No changes are proposed to the provision of pension and benefits 
for 2018. Executive Directors will continue to receive benefits that 
include family private medical insurance, life assurance, income 
protection, health screening and company car/car allowances. 
The Executive Directors will continue to receive a cash allowance 
in lieu of pension equal to 15% per annum for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 20% of base salary per annum for the Chief Financial 
Officer, in line with the policy.
Bonus
The 2018 annual bonus maximum as a percentage of base salary 
is as follows:
 
Maximum 
2018
Executive Directors 
Agust Gudmundsson 80% of salary
Peter Gates 125% of salary
For 2018, the annual bonus for the Executive Directors will 
comprise three elements as set out below which are all key 
performance indicators of the business.
• Adjusted EBITDA (50%)
• Revenue (25%)
• Free Cash Flow excl. development projects (25%)
It is not possible to disclose specific targets in advance as this 
would give a clear indication of the Group’s business objectives, 
which are commercially sensitive. However, full details of the 
targets and performance against them will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report.
Awards will be subject to an underlying performance override 
enabling them to be scaled back to reflect the Group’s underlying 
performance as well as malus and clawback.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, one-third of any bonus 
earned will be deferred for three years, conditional upon 
continued employment. Deferral for the Chief Executive Officer 
will be in cash (given his current shareholding), whereas the  
Chief Financial Officer’s deferral will be in shares.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Committee intends to grant awards of nil cost options  
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan to the Chief Financial Officer, 
in line with the policy set out in this report. Reflecting his founder 
status and his current shareholding, the current Chief Executive 
Officer does not participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The awards granted to the Chief Financial Officer will have a  
face value of 150% of salary, with the exact number of shares  
to be granted to be determined with reference to the prevailing 
share price around the date of grant.
Vesting of the 2018 awards will be contingent on the  
following performance measures (each measure applies  
to 50% of an award):
Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS):
Percentage of vesting of relevant 
portion of award* Adjusted EPS In 2020
0% Less than 16.5 pence

69 GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The Remuneration Committee considered carefully an appropriate peer group for these awards. It was felt that a pan-sector group 
such as the FTSE 250 was not appropriate given the different types of companies in the index and that a group formed of pure UK food 
producers was too small. Therefore, a hybrid group has been chosen which includes food producers, beverage companies, food and 
drug retailers and a selection of restaurant and bar companies. The 2018 comparator group comprises: 
Associated British 
Foods
Cranswick Fuller, Smith & 
Turner
McColl’s Retail 
Group
Restaurant Group Unilever
Barr (A G) Dairy Crest Group Greencore Group Mitchells & Butlers Sainsbury (J) Wetherspoon (JD)
Booker Group Devro Greene King Morrison (Wm) 
Supermarkets
SSP Group Whitbread
Britvic Diageo Greggs Ocado Group Stock Spirits Group DP Eurasia
Coca-Cola HBC AG Domino’s Pizza 
Group
Hilton Food Group Premier Foods Tate & Lyle
Compass Group E.I. Group Marston’s PureCircle Tesco
Awards are subject to a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period as well as malus and clawback. In 
addition, before an award vests the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying performance of the Group is satisfactory. The 
Committee believes that having a performance override is an important feature of the plan as it mitigates the risk of unwarranted 
vesting outcomes.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
Non-executive and Chairman fees for 2018 remain unchanged 
since Admission, and are as follows:
 Fee
Chairman £200,000

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED

The interests of the Directors at 30 December 2017 and as at the date of the publication of this report were:
30 December 2017 Date of publication of Annual Report
 Name Number of shares % of voting rights Number of shares % of voting rights
Simon Burke 50,000 0.009% 50,000 0.009%
Agust Gudmundsson 145,333,130 25.1% 145,333,130 25.1%
Lydur Gudmundsson 145,333,130 25.1% 145,333,130 25.1%
Directors’ insurance and indemnities
Bakkavor has made qualifying third party provisions (as defined  
in the Companies Act 2006) for the benefit of its Directors.  
These provisions remain in force at the date of this Annual Report. 
In accordance with the Articles, and to the extent permitted by 
law, Bakkavor may indemnify its Directors out of its own funds  
to cover liabilities arising as a result of their office. Bakkavor  
holds Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance cover for any 
claim brought against Directors or officers for wrongful acts in 
connection with their positions, but the cover does not extend to 
claims arising from dishonesty or fraud. 
Appointment and retirement of Directors
The rules governing the appointment and replacement of 
Directors are set out in the Articles and governed by the 
Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. 
At the AGM, all Directors will offer themselves for election to the 
Group Board. Biographical details of all Directors are set out on 
pages 38 to 39. Subject to applicable law, the Articles and any 
directions given by special resolution, the business of the Group 
will be managed by the Group Board which may exercise all power 
of the Group. 
Share capital and capital structure
The Company’s issued share capital as at the date of publication 
of the Annual Report is 579,425,585 ordinary shares of £0.02 each. 
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are also shown in 
Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carries  
no right to fixed income. Each share is non-redeemable and 
carries equal voting rights and ranks for dividends and capital 
distributions, whether on a winding up or otherwise. 
Details of employee share schemes are set out in Note 36 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on 
the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles and prevailing legislation, other than as 
set out in the sections on controlling shareholders and lock-up 
arrangements below. 
Under the Company’s Articles, the Group Board has general  
and unconditional authority for each prescribed period to exercise 
all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company  
or to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company in accordance with section 551 of the 
Companies Act 2006. A renewal of this authority will be proposed 
at the AGM on 23 May 2018. The Company will also seek authority 
to purchase its own shares within certain limits and as permitted 
by the Articles, at the AGM on 23 May 2018.
Significant agreements and change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as 
commercial contracts, property lease arrangements and 
employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the 
Group as a whole.
The agreement which governs the Company’s Term Loan and 
Revolving Credit Facilities (“Facilities Agreement”) provides that, 
on a change of control, any lender may on notice cancel its 
commitments under the Facilities Agreement. In the event of  
a takeover, the exercise by the lenders under the Facilities 
Agreement of the right to cancel could have a significant impact 
on the business of the Group, as the outstanding amounts 
thereunder would become due and payable.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between the 
Company and its Directors or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid. 
Controlling shareholders
Shortly prior to the IPO, Bakk AL Holdings Limited (an entity in 
which Agust Gudmundsson and Lydur Gudmundsson each held  
a 50% interest) owned 59.5% and BP-PE5 L.L.C. (“BP-PE5”), an 
entity managed indirectly by the Baupost Group, owned 40.5% of 
the issued share capital of Bakkavor Holdings Limited (formerly 
Bakkavor Group Limited).
In anticipation of and following the IPO, the Group completed  
a reorganisation of its corporate structure. The reorganisation, 
which was contemplated in the prospectus published by the  
Group on 10 November 2017 in relation to its IPO, involved the 
transfer of the shares held by Bakk AL Holdings Ltd. first to  
Milu Trading Inc. (the common investment vehicle of Agust and 
Lydur Gudmundsson), and then to the separate corporate holding 
structures of each of Agust Gudmundsson (with the relevant 
shares in Bakkavor Group plc being held by Carrion Enterprises 
Limited) and Lydur Gudmundsson (with the relevant shares in 
Bakkavor Group plc being held by Umbriel Ventures Limited). 
Following the IPO, Agust and Lydur Gudmundsson each indirectly 
held 25.1% of the issued share capital in Bakkavor Group plc  
and BP-PE5 held 24.8% of the issued share capital of Bakkavor 
Group plc.

Employees with disabilities
Applications for employment by prospective employees with 
disabilities are always fully considered. On occasions where 
existing employees develop a disability, every effort is made to 
ensure that their employment with the Group continues, and any 
reasonable adjustments are made and appropriate training is 
provided. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career 
development and promotion of employees with disabilities should, 
as far as possible, be the same as that of our other employees.
Employee consultation 
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees, and has continued to keep them informed on matters 
affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the Group. It does this through a formal 
process of SEFs where representatives meet annually with the 
Chief Executive Officer to review business performance. The 
Group also works closely with Union representatives on 
recognised sites. Employee feedback is sought on a regular  
basis via the ‘all Employee Engagement Survey’ and this is used  
to develop site specific action plans. Formal briefing processes 
occur at each location and are supported by the Company 
magazine, which includes highlights of the Group’s latest 
published financial results.
Lock-up arrangements
The Group has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions,  
during the period of 180 days from the date of the IPO, it would 
not, without the prior written consent of the Joint Global Co-
ordinators and Peel Hunt, issue, offer, sell or contract to sell, or 
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce an offer  
of any shares (or any interest therein or in respect thereof) or 
enter into any transaction with the same economic effect as any  
of the foregoing.
Bakkavor’s Selling Shareholders (Bakk AL Holdings Limited  
and BP-PE5) and its Directors agreed that, subject to certain 
exceptions, during the period of 180 days in respect of the Selling 
Shareholders, and 365 days in respect of the Directors, in each 
case from the date of the IPO, they will not, without the prior 
written consent of the Joint Global Coordinators and Peel Hunt, 
offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or 
indirectly, or announce an offer of any shares (or any interest 
therein in respect thereof) or enter into any transaction with the 
same economic effect as any of the foregoing.
Relations with shareholders
The Group Board supports the aims of the Governance Code and 
the UK Stewardship Code to promote engagement and interaction 
between listed companies and their major shareholders.
The Group Board welcomes the opportunity for investors and 
shareholders to engage directly with the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director in addition to the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer. An appropriate range of investor relations 
events around the publication of the full-year and half-year results 
has been scheduled in 2018, and the Head of External Affairs will 
manage this process, including updates to the Group Board.
AGM
The AGM will be held on 23 May 2018 and is an opportunity  
for shareholders to vote on aspects of the business in person. 
The Group Board values the AGM as an opportunity to meet  
with shareholders and to take their questions. Full details of the 
resolutions to be proposed at the AGM, shareholders’ rights with 
respect to attendance, participation in the meeting and the 
process for submission of proxy votes in advance of the meeting 
will be set out in the Notice of AGM.

73 GOVERNANCE
Charitable donations
Bakkavor supports a number of national and local causes with  
the chosen charities for 2017 being The Prince’s Trust and The 
Prince’s Countryside Fund. In addition, our employees raise 
money at each factory site for local causes of their choice.
Bakkavor aims to promote economic and social wellbeing around 
all of our locations and is active in supporting local community 
projects and initiatives, including supporting a number of local 
schools and investing in young talent. 
Political donations
No political donations were made during the financial year.
Going concern
Bakkavor’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position, are set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 36. The financial position of the 
Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, 
as well as the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing capital, are described on pages 26 to 28 and in Note 30. 
Financial risk management objectives, and exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk are described in Note 30. The Directors 
consider that the Company’s business activities and financial 
resources ensure that it is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
The Directors are satisfied that:
• The Company’s activities are sustainable for the foreseeable 
future, and that the business is a going concern
• It is appropriate to continue to adopt a going concern basis in 
the preparation of the Financial Statements
Viability statement
In line with Provision C.2.2 of the Governance Code, the Directors 
have carried out a rigorous review of the prospects of the current 
business, and its ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the medium term. Whilst the Group has a longer-term financing 
structure in place with the first debt maturity being June 2021,  
the business operates in a fast-moving sector with a high level  
of products introduced each year. The Group has to adapt to  
meet the changing needs of customers and consumers,  
therefore the Directors concluded that a three-year time frame  
is an appropriate period for this assessment, as this is the period 
over which the Directors can realistically set the strategic plan  
for the Group.
The Directors assessed the principal risks to the business as  
set out in the ‘Risk Management’ section on pages 21 to 25 of  
the Annual Report, and the key mitigating actions used to  
address them.
As a food producing business, food safety and integrity are of 
paramount importance, and while each of the principal risks and 
uncertainties could have an impact on the Group’s performance,  
it was considered that risks such as the vulnerability of the 
Group’s cost base and margin to fluctuations in the price and 
availability of raw materials, the impact of higher labour costs, 
and scarcity of labour, and any breakdown or failure in the 
Group’s information technology systems would most likely 
threaten the Group’s longer-term viability.
For each of the principal risks, action plans have been developed 
to mitigate the risk with a clear allocation of responsibilities for 
mitigation and the timescales for completion. Based on the 
results of this analysis, the Directors have concluded that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of their assessment.
Directors’ statement as to the disclosure of information  
to the Auditor
So far as each person who was a Director at the date of approving 
this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being 
information needed by the Auditor in connection with preparing 
their report, of which the Auditor is unaware. Each Director has 
taken all the steps that he or she is obliged to take as a Director  
in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information, and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware 
of that information. This confirmation is given pursuant to section 
418 of the Companies Act 2006 and should be interpreted in 
accordance with and subject to these provisions.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Simon Witham
General Counsel and Company Secretary
9 April 2018
74 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with the Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company, and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. 
In preparing the Company Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
• State whether the Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial 
Statements
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
• Prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance
• Make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions, and to disclose with reasonable  
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply  
with the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company, and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and  
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Group and the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole 
• The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the  
Group and the Company and the undertakings included in  
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face
• The Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group 
and Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

75 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AUDITOR’S REPORT 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BAKKAVOR GROUP PLC
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
30 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the period  
then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
We have audited the Financial Statements of Bakkavor Group plc 
(the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which 
comprise:
• the Consolidated income statement;
• the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 
expense;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company statements of financial 
position;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes 
in equity;
• the Consolidated cash flow statement; and
• the related Notes 1 to 41 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and notes 1 to 9 of the Parent Company Financial 
Statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Parent Company Financial Statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in Note 2 to the Financial Statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and 
Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the Financial Statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
 We confirm that we have nothing 
material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these 
matters.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in 
the current period were:
• valuation of the Group’s accruals for 
volume related rebates; and
• the risk of impairment of tangible and 
intangible assets in the US.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the 
current period was £4.5m, which was 
determined on the basis of adjusted profit 
before tax.
Scoping Our Group audit scope has been designed 
to focus on the risks identified across the 
Group with audit procedures covering 
83% of adjusted profit before tax, 87% of 
net assets and 72% of revenue. Our work 
has included visiting 10 out of 39 locations 
across the Group.
76 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether they were 
consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the 
knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether 
we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 21-25 that describe the principal risks and explain how they  
are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 74 that they have carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the Directors’ explanation on page 74 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to the prospects of 
the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledgde 
obtained in the audit. 
 We confirm that we have  
nothing material to report, add  
or draw attention to in respect of 
these matters.
 
Valuation of the Group’s accruals for volume related rebates
Key audit matter description The Group provides incentives to customers in the form of volume related rebates, 
marketing and promotional funding, discounts or lump sum incentives (“customer 
deductions”). As described in the accounting policies these are treated as a reduction 
in revenue. The customer deduction arrangements with customers are accounted for 
at both site and at Group level. The site level arrangements have limited complexity 
and do not require significant judgement. However, Group level accruals for volume 
related rebate arrangements that cover multiple sites and product categories are 
more complex. Accruals are made under these arrangements based on how likely  
it is that the criteria set out in the arrangement will be met and may rise as a 
proportion of sales as higher quantities are sold. 
There is complexity in the accruals for volume related rebates that gives rise  
to management judgement and scope for fraud and error in the accounting for  
these balances. 
Judgement is required in estimating the expected level of rebates for the rebate 
year, driven by the forecast sales volumes and ongoing negotiations with the Group’s 
customers. There is judgement over the contractual relationships that the Group has 
with its customers.
Further details are included in the Audit Committee report on page 48 (as they are 
considered a significant judgement) and the Accounting Policies in Notes 2 and 3 to 
the Financial Statements. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial 
Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
77 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit matter
 The following procedures have been designed and performed in order to respond to the 
key matter outlined above:
• we assessed the design and implementation of controls over the customer deduction 
process, including the process for matching amounts accrued with amounts claimed  
by the customer; 
• we reviewed correspondence with the customers and minutes of meetings held;
• we assessed the adequacy of the accruals made in the current period by reviewing the 
agreements with customers and determining whether the accrual has been calculated 
using the terms and conditions of the relevant arrangements or latest status of customer 
negotiations;
• we assessed the appropriateness of forecasts made by management which underpin  
the calculation of the accruals;
• we retrospectively reviewed the historical accuracy of the accruals made and compared  
to amounts subsequently settled; and
• we assessed the disclosures of these arrangements in the Financial Statements. 
Key observations Whilst we identified some prudence in the Group’s estimation methodology for amounts to 
be accrued, we concurred with management that the revenue recognition approach in the 
Financial Statements was appropriate.
The risk of impairment of tangible and intangible assets in the US
Key audit matter description The Group has goodwill of £647.2m, as set out in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.  
The Group has one cash-generating unit (“CGU”), the US, where reasonably possible  
changes in financial performance could result in impairment. At 30 December 2017, the 
Group recognised goodwill and intangibles of £48.3m and tangible assets of £14.9m in 
relation to this CGU.
The US CGU has a relatively low level of headroom and the highest sensitivity to the 
underlying assumptions. Further details are included in Note 15.
The key audit matter identified is in respect of management’s judgements in relation to the 
value in use calculation for the cash-generating unit to which the assets relate. Specifically, 
the key audit matter is focused on the underlying assumptions used in determining the 
recoverable value of the assets such as discount rates, growth rates and longer-term 
financial performance. 
These items are all subjective and could lead to an impairment charge if incorrect. Due to the 
judgemental nature of the assumptions, a fraud risk has been identified due to the risk of bias 
within assumptions adopted.
This matter has been identified by management within the Audit and Risk Committee  
report on page 48 and disclosed as a critical accounting judgement within Note 3 to the 
Financial Statements.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit matter
 The following procedures have been designed and performed in order to assess the 
reasonableness of the key assumptions and the estimates of future cash flows for the 
underlying business:
• we assessed the design and implementation of controls over the intangible and tangible 
fixed asset impairment review process;
• we compared the actual results to forecast to assess historical forecasting accuracy;
• we considered whether the implied earnings multiple indicates bias within management’s 
forecasts;
• we used internal valuation experts to determine whether management’s discount rate is 
appropriate;
• we performed sensitivity analysis by reducing cash inflows and increasing the discount 
rate; and
• we assessed the disclosures relating to the impairment review in the Financial Statements.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BAKKAVOR GROUP PLC CONTINUED
78 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report Key observations From our work on this key audit matter we have noted that:
• the discount rate used by management to estimate the recoverable value of the CGU  
falls within our expected range based on the independent analysis completed; and
• the earnings multiples inferred from the cash flow forecasts fall within the range of 
comparative peer group entities operating within the same market.
We have gained sufficient assurance that the underlying assumptions for the US CGU  
are reasonable and supportable at the assessment date. 
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in  
the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 
£0.23m, as well as differences below that threshold that, in  
our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of 
the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope has been designed to focus on the  
risks identified across the Group with audit procedures covering 
83% of adjusted profit before tax, 87% of net assets and 72% of 
revenue. Our work has included visiting 10 locations out of 39 
across the Group using component materiality of up to £2.0m. 
Nine of these locations were in the UK and we determined that 
four of these sites were significant.
Our audit work has included the use of a component auditor, 
which forms part of the Deloitte member firm network. We 
planned and reviewed the component auditor’s work, issuing 
instructions to them and evaluating the results of the work 
performed; this included a visit to the component during the 
period. The parent company materiality was £4.3m, determined 
on the basis of 2% of net assets and capped at 95% of group 
materiality. The parent company is non-trading and acts as a 
holding company.
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at 10 locations.
At the Group’s head office we tested the consolidation  
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our  
assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the remaining components not subject to  
audit or review procedures.
Group materiality £4.5m
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of adjusted profit before tax.
Adjusted profit before tax is 
defined as profit before tax 
adjusted for financing costs and 
other gains and losses (arising 
from the financing structure prior 
to the March 2017 refinancing) 
and exceptional items.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We consider that a profit 
benchmark is appropriate  
in determining materiality  
given investor focus on the 
performance of the business. We 
have used adjusted profit before 
tax which reflects the underlying 
performance of the business and 
reduces the risk of volatility.
79 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report including the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report, other than the 
Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial 
Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there  
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy,  
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit and Risk Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing  
Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate  
Governance Code. 
 We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
The Parent Company was incorporated on 28 September 2017 
and on 10 November 2017 acquired the Group headed by 
Bakkavor Holdings Limited (formerly Bakkavor Group Limited). 
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial 
Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as 
applicable matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend 
to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  
of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
As the Parent Company was not a business at the time of  
the acquisition, merger accounting has been applied and the  
results presented by the Group are for the 52 weeks ended  
30 December 2017.
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  
on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

86 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
52 WEEKS ENDED 30 DECEMBER 2017 
87 
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
The Company was incorporated as a public limited company on 28 September 2017. On 9 October 2017 the Company’s name was changed from 
Diamond Newco plc to Bakkavor Group plc. 
The Company acquired, by way of share for share exchange, the entire issued share capital of Bakkavor Holdings Limited on 10 No vember 2017. 
Under IFRS, the Group reconstruction is treated as a common control transaction, for which there is no specific accounting guid ance. 
Consequently, the Board of Directors have ha d regard to the guidance in IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estim ates and Errors’ 
on the selection of accounting policies. The integration of the Company has been accounted for using merger accounting principl es. The policy, 
which does not conflict with IFRS, reflects the economic substance of the transaction. 
The adoption of merger accounting presents the Company as if it had always been the parent undertaking of the Group. As the Com pany was not 
incorporated until 28 September 2017, the consolidated results and details of the financial position prior to this date reflect those presented 
previously as the results and financial position of Bakkavor Holdings Limited, the former parent of the Group. 
The Company became listed on the London Stock Exchange on 16 No vember 2017 as part of an Initial Public Offering (also referred to as public 
listing in these Financial Statements). The Company’s subsidiaries, both direct and indirect, at this date are listed in Note 5 to the Company only 
Financial Statements.  
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ’Group’) comprise the preparation and marketing of fresh prep ared food and the 
marketing and distribution of fresh produce. These activities are undertaken in the UK, US and China and products are primarily sold through high-
street supermarkets.  
In the current period, the Group has adopted the following Standards and Interpretations with no material impact on the Financi al Statements  
of the Group. 
Amendments:  
IAS 7 Disclosure initiative  
IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses  
At the date of authorisation of these Fina ncial Statements, the following Standards an d Interpretations relevant to the Group w hich have not been 
applied in these Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the E U): 
New or revised standards:  
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
IFRS 16 Leases  
Amendments:  
IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions  
IFRS 15 Clarifications to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’  
IFRIC 22  Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration  
Various Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 cycle  
Various IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities, Applying the Consolidation Exception  
With the exception of IFRS 9 and IFRS 16, the Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations wil l have  
no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group.  
The adoption of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ will impact both the recognition and disclosure of the Group’s financial instrum ents but at this time it 
is not practical to quantify the future impact as further work is required to be conducted to complete the review and complete the assessment. 
Management’s preliminary assessment is that the adoption of IFRS 15 will have no material impact on the current revenue recogni tion under IAS 18 
‘Revenue’. The principal reason for this is that the Group only has an enforceable right to bill once the product is delivered to the customer. Further 
work is still required to complete the assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 on the Group and to put in place processes to captur e the additional 
disclosures required under IFRS 15.  
The implementation of IFRS 16 will require the recognition of the Group’s operating leases (with the exception of short-term an d immaterial leases) 
in the statement of financial position. Furthermore, it is expected that operating profit will increase alongside an increase i n finance costs resulting 
from the unwind of the lease liability. Initial assessments of the impact of IFRS 16 are ongoing and therefore it is not practi cable to provide a 
quantification of the impact on the Financial Statements. Details of the Group’s operating lease arrangements are included in N ote 35.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Basis of accounting 
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Financial Statements have al so been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the Eur opean Union.  
These Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group 
operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the foreign currency policy set out below. 
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments ( which are stated at 
fair value) and the valuation of the retirement benefit asset/obligation. The deferred tax liability as at 31 December 2016 has been grossed up to 
show the deferred tax asset of £1.6 million on the face of the statement of financial position in order to comply with the curr ent period presentation. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Directors have reviewed the historical trading performance of the Group and the forecasts through to April 2019.  
The Directors, in their detailed consideration of going concern, have reviewed the Group’s future revenue projections and cash requirements, which 
they believe are based on prudent interpretations of market data and past experience. The Directors have also considered the Gr oup’s level of 
available liquidity under its financing arrangements and consider that adequate headroom is available based on the forecasted c ash requirements 
of the business. 
Consequently, the Directors consider that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in prep aring the Financial Statements. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the parent undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings, tog ether with the 
Group’s share of the results of associated undertakings comprising a 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday nearest to 31 December. Where 
the fiscal year 2017 is quoted in these Financial Statements this relates to the 52-week period ended 30 December 2017. The fis cal year 2016 relates 
to the 53-week period ended 31 December 2016. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group Financial Statem ents from the date on which control is achieved, and cease to be consolidated  
from the date on which control is transferre d out of the Group. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, t o variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Gro up reassesses whether 
or not it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements of c ontrol.  
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether 
or not it has power over the investee to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.  
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interests of non-contr olling shareholders are 
measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Sub sequent to acquisition, 
the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests, even if this results in th e non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance.  
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactio ns. The carrying amount  
of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in t he subsidiaries.  
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling in terests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration p aid or received is 
recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Group. 
Business combinations  
Business acquisitions from third parties are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measure d at the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liab ilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by th e Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions fo r recognition under IFRS 3 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cos t of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after the 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liab ilities exceeds the cost  
of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
When the consideration in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arran gement, the 
contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred. Changes in the fair  
value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measuremen t period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresp onding 
adjustments against goodwill. The subsequent accounting for change s in fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as 
measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is 
not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates. Contingent consider ation that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasu red at subsequent 
reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37, as appropriate. 
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are re-measure d to fair value  
at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the income statement. 
88 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report  
89 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above in the ‘Business combinations’ note.  
Goodwill is assumed to have an indefinite life as the acquired business is expected to trade for the foreseeable future and the refore goodwill is not 
amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to eac h of  
the cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synerg ies of the combination. CGUs or groups of CGUs to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.  
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying am ount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to re duce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the ot her assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amo unt of each asset in the 
unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.  
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in th e determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
The Group’s policy for goodwill on the acquisition of an associate is described in the ‘Investments in associates’ note below. 
Investments in associates 
An investment in an associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, through par ticipation in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operatin g policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.  
The results, assets and liabilities of asso ciates are incorporated in these Financial Statements using the equity method of acc ounting. Investments 
in associates are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter by the Group’s sh are of the profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. 
On acquisition of the investment, goodwill is the excess of cost of the investment over the Grou p’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. The entire carrying amount of the inves tment is tested for 
impairment, as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised form s part of the 
carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. 
Where a Group company transacts wi th an associate of the Group, profits and losses are only recognised in the Financial Stateme nts to the extent 
of interests in the associate that are not related to the Group.  
Discontinued operations 
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and rep resents a separate 
major line of business or geographical area of operation. A di scontinued operation is presented as a single amount and is shown separately from 
continuing operations in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income. For details of discontinued operations see Note 13. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods p rovided in the 
normal course of business, net of customer deductions and disc ounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. The Group sells fresh p repared foods and 
fresh produce. Revenue from the sale of these goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied: 
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; 
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to th e degree usually associated with ownership nor effective contr ol over the  
goods sold; 
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; 
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the entity and  
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. 
As a result, revenue for the sale of these goods is generally recognised upon delivery to the customer. 
Customer deductions 
Consistent with standard industry practice, the Group has arrangements with its customers providing volume-related rebates, mar keting and 
promotional funding contributions, discounts or lump sum incentives. These costs are recognised as a reduction to revenue as th ey are considered 
to be an adjustment to the se lling price for the Group’s products. Sometimes the payment of this support is subject to the Grou p’s customers 
performing specified actions or satisfying certain performance cond itions associated with the purchase of products from the Gro up. These include 
achieving agreed purchase volume targets and providing promotional marketing materials/activities. Whilst there is no standard definition, these 
amounts payable to customers are generally termed as “customer deductions”.  
The Group recognises these costs as a deduction from revenue based upon the terms of the relevant arrangement in place. Amounts payable 
relating to customer deduction arrangements are recognised within accruals except in cases where the Group has a legal right of set-off and 
intends to offset against amounts due from that customer.

90 | Bakkavor Group plc 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of own ership to the lessee.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Finance leases 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value o f the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position  
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned be tween finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement  
over the lease period. 
Operating leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Bene fits received and 
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Foreign currency  
The individual Financial Statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are 
expressed in Pounds Sterling, being the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the Consolidated F inancial Statements. 
In preparing the Financial Statements of the individual companie s, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functiona l currency (foreign 
currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial p osition date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at t he date when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in te rms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslat ed. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in t he income 
statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income 
statement for the period.  
For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations a re translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date. Income and expense items are translated at the annual av erage rate, unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in wh ich case the exchange rates at the dates of transactions are us ed. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the Group’s translation reserve.  
On the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the accumulated ex change differences in respect of that operation attributable t o the Group are 
reclassified to the income statement. However, a partial disposal of a foreign operation where the Group does not lose control results in  
the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences being re-attributed to non-controlling interests and is not recogni sed in the  
income statement.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Research and development 
Research and development costs comprise all directly attributable costs necessary to create and produce new and updated product s. Expenditure 
on research and development, where development costs do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38, is recognised as an expens e in the period in 
which it is incurred. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those that, in management’s judgement, should be disclosed by virtue of their nature or amount. Exception al items will 
typically include major restructuring programmes, legal cases, co rporate transaction costs and pre-commissioning and start-up costs for new 
manufacturing facilities.  
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging exceptional items, impa irment of assets, profit/loss on the disposal of subsidiaries and associates and 
share of results of associates bu t before investment revenue, finance costs and other gains and losses. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
Defined contribution pension plans  
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Gr oup pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, which then invests the 
contributions to buy annuities for the pension liabilities as they become due based on the value of the fund and hence the Grou p has no legal or 
constructive obligations to pay further contributions. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an 
expense in the income statement as employee service is received. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund 
or a reduction in future payments is available. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as pay ments to defined 
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement  
benefit scheme. 
Defined benefit pension plans 
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an empl oyee will receive on retirement, usually dependent  
on factors such as age, year s of service and compensation. 
90 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report  
91 
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuaria l valuations being 
carried out at each statement of financial position date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of c hanges to the asset 
ceiling (if applicable) and the return on pl an assets (excluding interest), are recogn ised outside of the income statement and presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Defined benefit cost are categorised as follows: 
• Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements); 
• Net interest expense or income; and 
• Remeasurement 
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: 
• The date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and 
• The date that the Group recogn ises restructuring-related costs or termination benefits 
The Group recognises the first two components of defined benefit costs in the income statement.  
The retirement benefit recognised in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit ob ligation as reduced by 
the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the scheme. 
Share-based payments 
An expense is to be recognised for goods or services acquired in a share based transaction when the goods are obtained or the service received. 
The credit will be booked as either a liability or eq uity depending on the type of share-based payment. 
Equity- settled share-based payment transactions are transactions where Group shares are issued as consideration for goods or services. They are 
measured in the income statement at the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the date of grant with the corresponding amount booked to 
equity. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value calculation should reflect market bas ed performance 
conditions. The total expense will be reduced by estimates of options that will not vest (due to leavers or not meeting non-mar ket based 
performance criteria). Estimates of non-vesting are to be recalculated at each measurement date. For grants of equity instrumen ts with market 
conditions, the entity shall recognise the goods and services from a counterparty who satisfies other vesting conditions, regar dless of whether that 
market condition is satisfied. 
When options are exercised the share-based payment charge recognised in equity is transferred to share capital or share premium on the issue of 
new shares or if the shares are purchased from the market to retained earnings to the extent it exceeds the cash paid. 
Cash-settled share-based payment transactions arise where the Group pays a cash amount calculated by reference to the price of Group shares as 
consideration. The fair value of cash-settled options are calculated in line with the equity settled guidance but are revalued at each reporting date 
until the liability is settled. Any changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss for the period. The liability is ext inguished on exercise.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the peri od. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement  
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items th at are never taxable  
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enac ted by the statement of 
financial position date. 
Tax returns are prepared to adhere to tax rules and regulations and with all transactions being fully disclosed to the tax auth orities. However, the 
complex nature of tax sometimes means that the legislation is open to interpretation. In such cases, judgement is required to quantify the tax 
liability to be reflected in the Financial Statements. If there is a reasonable possibility that tax authorities may take a dif ferent view from the position 
taken in the filed returns then th is will be reflected in the Financial Statements in the form of a tax provision. In such case s, this provision will 
represent the full amount of any potential liability until the matter is agreed with the tax authorities. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabili ties in the Financial 
Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible tempor ary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities a re not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affect s neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates , except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not rev erse in the foreseeable 
future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be avai lable to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it re lates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensiv e income, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt wi th in other comprehensive income.  
 
 
91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
92 | Bakkavor Group plc 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities  
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax asse ts and liabilities  
on a net basis. 
Where current and deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the 
business combination. 
Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is stated in the statement of financial position at cost less any subsequent accumulated depr eciation and 
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.  
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuatio n of assets, other than land an d properties under construction, over their estimated 
useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: 
Buildings – maximum period of 50 years 
Plant and machinery – 1 to 20 years 
Fixtures and equipment – 3 to 5 years 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where s horter, over  
the term of the relevant lease. 
Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual valu es of individual productive assets are performed annually, tak ing account  
of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. All items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds an d the carrying  
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. 
Capitalised borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs incurred in financing the construction of qualifyi ng assets such as property, pl ant and equipment are capitalised up to the date at 
which the relevant asset is substantially complete. Borrowing cost s are calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of b orrowing during the 
period of capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incu rred. 
Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets, none of which are internally generated, have finite useful lives over which the assets are amortised on a st raight-line basis.  
The amortisation charge for customer relationships and customer contracts is recognised as an expense over 10 years and is char ged to Other 
administrative costs in the income statement. 
Impairment  
The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined based on a review of a combination of factors including the asset ownership rights  
and the nature of the over all product life cycle.  
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.  
Examples of such triggering events include significant planned re structuring, a major change in market conditions or technology , expectations  
of future operating losses, or a sign ificant reduction in cash flows.  
An impairment loss is recognised, in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset  
or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted 
average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. 
Financial assets 
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose  
terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measu red at fair value,  
plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classifi ed as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initial ly measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at ‘fair value through profit or loss ’ (FVTPL), and ‘loans  
and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and pu rpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as other financial liabilities at amortised cost and derivatives at FVTP L. 
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables and other receivables that have fixed or determin able payments that are not quoted in an active market are cl assified as ‘loans  
and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortise d cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment . Interest income  
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except fo r short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
92 Bakkavor Group plc — 2017 Annual Report  
93 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially me asured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financ ial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective y ield basis.  
Effective interest method 
Finance costs are recognised on an effectiv e interest basis for debt instruments othe r than those financial liabilities designa ted as at FVTPL. The 
effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt in strument and of allocating finance costs over the relevant period.  
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, 
where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset/liability is either held for tra ding or is designated  
as at FVTPL. 
A financial asset/liability is classified as held for trading if: 
• it has been acquired/incurred principally for the pu rpose of selling/disposal in the near term; or 
• it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term  
profit-taking; or 
• it is a derivative that is not designat ed and effective as a hedging instrument. 
A financial asset/liability other than a financial asset/liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or 
• the financial asset/liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accord ance with the Group’s documented risk mana gement or investment strategy, and informat ion about  
the Group is provided internally on that basis; or 
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ 
permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL. 
Financial assets/liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statem ent. The net gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and interest paid on the financial liability.  
Fair value measurement 
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which 
fair value is observable: 
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or lia bilities; 
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observa ble for the asset 
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for in dications of impairment at each statement of financial position date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial r ecognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have been affected. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include: 
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or 
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or 
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation. 
For certain categories of financial assets such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include th e Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit perio d, as well as 
observable changes in national and local economic conditions that correlate with defa ult on receivables. For financial assets c arried at amortised 
cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.  
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the excepti on of trade receivables, 
where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectab le, it is written  
off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously wr itten off are credited against the allowance account. Changes  
in the carrying amount of the allowance acco unt are recognised in the income statement. If in a subsequent period, the amount o f the impairment 
loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previ ously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through the income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the im pairment is 
reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transf ers the financial asset 
and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when the 
Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Derivative financial instruments  
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risk s of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest ra tes. The Group uses 
foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate cap contract s to manage these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivati ves is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Boar d of Directors, which 
provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments a re recognised in the 
income statement as they arise. 
Embedded derivatives 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk s and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host co ntracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses r eported in the income 
statement. Embedded derivatives are not presented separately from the host in the statement of financial position, the assessment regarding 
classification as current or non-current is based on the cash flows of the whole hybrid arrangement as the embedded derivatives cannot be settled 
separately from the host contract. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is pr obable that the Group  
will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the statement of  
financial position date, taking into account the risks and unc ertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measu red using the cash  
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic 
benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recove red from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually  
certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raise d a valid expectation 
in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by st arting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.  
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the di rect expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are th ose amounts that  
are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity. 
Present obligations arising from onerous contacts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where 
the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic be nefits expected to 
be received under it. 
Contingent liabilities 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence  
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not who lly within the control of the Gr oup or the amount of the obliga tion cannot be 
measured reliably. A contingent liability is disclosed in the no tes to the Financial Statements and is not recognised when the obligation is not  
probable. When an outflow becomes probable, it is recognised as a provision. 
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 
The following are areas of particular significance to the Group’ s Financial Statements and include the application of judgement , which is 
fundamental to the compilation of a set of Financial Statements: 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
There are no critical judgements to be disclosed. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Pensions 
The Group maintains a defined benefit pension plan for which it has recorded a pension asset/liability. The pension asset/liability is based on an 
actuarial valuation that requires a number of assumptions including discount rate, mort ality rates and actual return on plan as sets that may 
necessitate material adjustments to this asset/liability in the future. The assumptions used by the Group are the best estimate s based on historical 
trends and the composition of the work force. Details of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the recognised asset/liability for the 
defined benefit plan are given in Note 37. 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
The recoverable amount of CGUs or groups of CGUs are determined based on the higher of net realisable value and value in use ca lculations, which 
require the use of estimates. The key estimates that can impact the value in use calculations are changes to the growth rates a pplied to derive a 
five-year forecast, or a movement in the di scount rate applied to the future cash fl ows. These are key estimates as they are su bjective in nature and 
significant assumptions are required and an y changes to assumptions may lead to impa irment charges being recognised. The Group has 
considered the impact of the assumptions used in the International CGU calculations and has conducted sensitivity analysis on t he impairment test 
of the International CGU carrying value. See Notes 15 and 16 for further details.

Customer deductions 
Management is required to make estimates in determining the amount and timing of recognition of customer deductions due in resp ect of sales to 
its customers. In determining the amount of customer deductions due for volume-related allowances in any period, management est imate whether 
customers will meet the purchase target volumes by the end of the arrangement, based on historical and forecast performance, an d recognises 
this cost as a deduction from revenue over the period of the relevant arrangement. Where there are ongoing negotiations with cu stomers over the 
level of deduction, the Group ma kes its best estimate of the outcome based on a range of factors, including the latest negotiat ion positon, past 
history and economic factors such as price inflation or deflation.  
4. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION

7. OTHER ITEMS 
The Group’s financial performance is analysed in two ways; underlying performance (which does not include other items), and oth er items. 
Underlying performance is used by management to monitor financial performance as it is considered to aid comparability of the financial 
performance of the Group from year to year and it excludes items that are considered not to arise directly from trading activit ies. 
Other items include exceptional items, impairment of assets, profit or loss on the disposal of subsidiaries, expenses relating to the refinancing of 
debts and fair value adjustments relating to items, which are considered significant in nature and are important to users in un derstanding the 
business. Further information on the profit on disposal of subsidiaries in the prior year can be found in Note 32. Further info rmation on the 
refinancing expenses included within other items can be found in Notes 10 and 11.  
Included within Other administrative costs ar e exceptional items and impairment of assets. 
Other administrative costs 
Other administrative costs include items that, in management’s judg ement, should be disclosed by virtue of their nature or amou nt. Exceptional 
items will typically include major restructuring programmes, legal cases, corporate transaction costs and pre-commissioning and start-up costs 
for new manufacturing facilities. Exceptional items includ ed within other administrative costs are as follows: 
£ million 2017 2016
Continuing operations  
Public listing costs 10.4 –
Transaction costs – 5.2
Restructuring costs 3.1 1.3
Legal cases 0.6 1.5
New site costs 1.3 –
 15.4 8.0
2017 
The Group has incurred exceptional costs of £15.4 million, of wh ich £10.4 million relates to costs incurred for the public list ing in the year and £3.1 
million relates to the cost of closing a site in the UK and moving related operations to other sites. The remaining exceptional costs relate to the 
Group’s International segment of which £1.3 million are in respect of initial start-up costs for the opening of a new site in t he US with the remaining 
costs of £0.6 million due to on-going employment litigation in the US.  
2016 
In 2016 the Group incurred exceptional costs of £8.0 million, of which £5.2 million relate to the fees incurred in that year in connection with the 
transactions that resulted in Bakk AL Ho ldings Limited owning 100% of the Company an d becoming the parent company of the Group. Costs of £1.3 
million were attributable to redundancy costs arising from business losses in one of the Group’s UK operations. The remaining £ 1.5 million related 
to legal and other costs in respect of an in tellectual property dispute, at another UK business, that has now been concluded.  
Impairment of assets 
The charge for the impairment of assets has also been included in other administrative costs as follows: 
£ million 2017 2016
Continuing operations  
Impairment of property, plant and equipment – 8.2
 – 8.2
The annual impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets has resulted in no impairment charge being recognised within 
the Group (2016: £nil).  
During the period, the Group has made no im pairment (2016: £8.2 million within the UK segment) of property, plant and equipment . Impairment in 
the prior period followed a review which highlighted a number of assets whose carrying values were greater than their recoverab le amounts.

mark-to-market asset held at 31 December 2016 in respect of th e call option for the 2020 Senior Secured Notes, following the re demption of those 
Notes in March 2017. This loss in 2017 and gain in 2016 have been classified as other items in the consolidated income statemen t due to the fact 
that this related to the previous financing structure.

Tax charge for the period 8.0 12.3
Corporation tax is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20%) of the estima ted assessable profit for the period. Taxation for other juris dictions is calculated at 
the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.  
The overall tax charge in 2017 was £8.0 million (2016: £12.3 million) which, on a profit of £39.0 million, represented an effec tive rate of 20.5%. (2016: 
19.6%) As the statutory UK corporation tax rate for the period was 19.25%, one would expect a tax charge of £7.5 million.  
There were several reasons for the actual charge being £0.5 mill ion higher than the expected ch arge. The most significant item was the unusually 
high level of costs incurred in 2017 which were disallowed for tax purposes. These primarily related to the costs of the Initia l Public Offering. The tax 
effect of these permanent differences was an overcharge of £1.8 million. On the other hand, this year we have recognised more U S tax losses as 
deferred tax assets. This amounted to an undercharge of £1.6 million. Other reconciling items are shown in the table below.  
Overseas tax rates which are different from the UK rate do not ha ve a material impact on the tax charge and it is expected that this will continue to 
be the case in future. This is particularly so now that the US federal rate is 21%, which is clos e to the UK statutory rate of 19%. 
Note 7 refers to exceptional costs of £15.4 million. Had these not been incurred, the tax charge would have been £8.4 million, representing an 
effective rate of 15.4%. As the UK statutory rate was 19.25%, th is would indicate a charge of £10.5 million. The primary reason for the undercharge 
of £2.1 million was the recognition of the US tax losses amounting to £1.6 million.

Tax charge and effective tax rate for the period 8.0 20.5 12.3 19.5
In 2017 the tax risk provision was £nil (2016: £0.4 million) beca use it is considered unlikely that the tax authorities will ta ke a different approach to 
any material calculations of tax liability. There are currently no open disputes with any tax authorities in any of the countri es in which we operate. 
It is anticipated that the effective tax ra te in the medium term will be lower than the UK corporation tax rate of 19%. This is mainly because of the 
increasing recognition of tax losses together with a lower level of expected costs that will be disallowed for tax.  
In recent years there has been a concerted effort, led by the OECD, to reduce tax avoidance by multinational companies. Such av oidance has been 
thought possible on an international scale mainly because countri es have different tax rates and differing rules as to what is (or is not) subject to tax 
in their jurisdiction. Multinational companies have, arguably, been able to benefit from such inconsistencies. The OECD compile d a list of fifteen 
actions to combat such tax avoidance. This is known as the "BEPS" (Base Erosion / Profit Shifting) Project. Anti-avoidance prin ciples are first agreed 
internationally by the OECD members and then each country incorporates those principles into its domestic legislation.  
None of the fifteen BEPS actions is expected to have any material effect on Bakkavor.  
Significant changes were made to US tax legislation in December 2017. The US federal tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% with effect from  
1 January 2018. For 2017 this meant that our tax charge was £2.5 mill ion higher than it would have been had the rate not been r educed. This is 
because our US tax losses, accounted for as assets, would be used at 21% in the future and were therefore recognised at this lower rate. However, 
in future years the lower US tax rate should reduce our tax charge. There were several other tax measures introduced in that le gislation. These 
included limits to the deductions allowed for interest payments and restrictions on the use of trading losses. None of these ot her measures is 
expected to have a material impact on our future tax charge. 
In addition to the amount charged to the consolidated income statement, a £2.1 million charge (2016: £1.4 million credit) relat ing to tax on the 
defined benefit pension scheme actuarial surp lus has been recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Also, a deferred t ax credit of £0.2 
million (2016: £nil) has been recognised in equity in relation to share schemes under IFRS 2. 
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 Ap ril 2017. In accordance with the Finance Act 2016, the UK corporat ion tax rate will 
reduce to 17% in 2020. 
Deferred tax has been calculated at the tax rate applicable for the period in which the temporary differences are expected to r everse. 
13. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
2017 
There were no discontinued operations in the period. 
2016 
In July 2016, the Group received a further £0.5 million cash consid eration in relation to its French and Spanish businesses tha t were sold in April 
2013. This has been disclosed in the consolidated income statemen t within discontinued operations as these businesses were clas sed as 
discontinued in 2013.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs or group of CGUs that are expected to ben efit from that 
business combination. The carrying value of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groupings as follows:

International 45.7 50.0

The International CGU relates to the US business. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs or groups of CGUs are determined based on value in use calculations.  
There was no impairment recognised during the period (2016: £nil). 
The key assumptions used in the impairment reviews were as follows: 
• Discount rates: Management uses pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
CGUs. The present value of the future cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that ranges from 8.3% to 9.7% (201 6: 9.1% to 10.8%). 
• Growth rates. The revenue growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Ch anges in selling prices and direct costs are based on past 
practices and expectations of fu ture changes in the market. The Group has prepared cash flow forecasts derived from the most re cent financial 
budget approved by management for next ye ar as determined by the business units, and extrapolated cash flows for the following four years based 
on an estimated growth rate, to provide a five-year forecast. Cash flows are then extrapolated using a perpetuity growth rate o f 1.7% (2016: 2.0%).  
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value. The assumptions used, and t he impact of 
sensitivities on these assumptions, are shown below: 
£ million UK International
Headroom of impairment test based on management assumptions 802.7 13.3
The pre-tax discount rate ranges from 8.3% to 9.7%. If the pre- tax discount rate in certain pa rts of the International CGU were to be increased by 0.5% 
from 9.7% to 10.2% then there would be no impairment charge. An increase to the pre-tax discount rate from 9.7% to 11.0% would result in no 
headroom. The perpetuity growth ra te included in future cash flows is 1.7%. A decrease to the perpetuity growth rate to 0.4% wo uld result in no 
headroom.

The carrying value of the Group’s plant and machinery includes an amount of £3.7 million (2016: £4 .6 million) in respect of assets held under  
finance leases.  
At 30 December 2017, the Group had entered into contractual comm itments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment am ounting to  
£7.6 million (2016: £2.6 million). 
The carrying value of the Group’s property, plant and equipment in cludes an amount of £23.1 million (2016: £nil) in respect of assets under the 
course of construction. 
During 2017, the Group has made no impairme nt of land and buildings (2016: £0.6 milli on), £nil (2016: £7.4 million) of plant an d machinery and £nil  
(2016: £0.2 million) of fixtures and equipment. These impairments are recognised within ‘Other administrative costs’ in the con solidated income 
statement in the ‘Other items’ column. The impairments were all in the UK sector and arose from site restructurings which resulted in redundant 
assets. The impairments were determined by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their recoverable amount i.e. the h igher of the asset’s 
fair value less costs of disposal and its va lue in use. The recoverable amount in the case of each asset was its fair value les s costs of disposal. 
18. SUBSIDIARIES

The Group has a £50 million (2016: £50 million) receivables securiti sation facility which it can draw against, up to a maximum of 72% of the net 
eligible receivables balance for certain UK customers. As at 30 December 2017 the Group had not drawn against this facility (20 16: £nil). The 
collection risk on these receivables remain s with the Group until final settlement and therefore the Group continues to recogni se these receivables 
until payment is received from the customer. The Group also uses non-recourse invoice discounting facilities. 
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 23 days (2016: 32 days). An allowance has been made for estimated irrecove rable amounts 
from the sale of goods of £1.5 million (2016: £1.1 million). A llowances against receivables are made on a specific basis based on objective evidence 
and previous default experience. Receivables are therefore deemed past due but not impaired when the contractual obligation to pay has been 
exceeded, but as yet no objective evidence or previous default experience indicates this debt will be irrecoverable.  
The Directors consider that the carrying amo unt of trade and other receivables from cu stomers approximates to their fair value due to their  
short-term nature.  
The Other receivables amount mainly relates to non-specif ic amounts, the largest of which is recoverable VAT.

There was no impact from trade receivables renegotiated in 2017 th at would otherwise have been pa st due or impaired (2016: no i mpact). 
The major customers of the Group, representing 77.5% (2016: 77.5%) of the Group’s revenue from continuing operations hold favou rable credit 
ratings. On this basis the Group does not see any need to charge interest, seek collateral or credit enhancements to secure any of its trade 
receivables due to their short-term nature. The Group does not consider that it is exposed to any significant credit risk and t herefore the carrying 
amount of trade receivables represents the expected recoverable amount and there is no further credit risk exposure.

Refinancing of debt facilities 
On 23 March 2017, the Group completed a refinancing of its existing debt facilities with a new £485 million corporate loan faci lity. The agreement 
comprises revolving credit facilities of £200 million maturing in June 2021, and term loans totalling £285 million, of which £2 10 million will mature in 
June 2021 with the balance maturing in June 2024. The Group has us ed the funds from the refinancing to repay in full previous b ank debt, redeem 
all outstanding Senior Secured Notes maturing in 2018 and 2020 and pay associated fees. This new funding structure provides the Group with a 
significant reduction in interest costs whilst extending the maturity of the funding commitments. 
Bakkavor Group bank facilities 
The Group’s total banking facilities amount to £447.5 million (2016: £205 million) comprising (i) a £247.5 million term loan (2 016: £135 million term 
loan), split £210 million and £37.5 million maturing in June 2021 and June 2024 respectively and (ii) £200 million Revolving Cr edit Facilities (‘RCF’) 
(2016: £70 million RCF), which includes an overdraft and money market facility of £16.5 million (2016: £16.5 million) and furth er ancillary facilities of 
£8.7 million (2016: £12.4 million).  
Following the public listing, the Group has repaid £37.5 millio n of the term loan as at 30 December 2017 and therefore the bala nce owing at that 
date was £247.5 million. At 30 December 2017 the Group had drawn £40 million under the RCF and overdraft facilities (2016: £nil ) and £5.4 million 
(2016: £4.6 million) of the ancillary facilities. 
The interest rate payable on the term loan at 30 December 2017 wa s Libor plus a margin of 2.25% for the £210 million maturing i n June 2021 and 
Libor plus a margin of 4.25% for the £37.5 million matu ring in June 2024 (2016: Libor plus a margin of 2.50%). 
The bank facilities are unsecured following the public listing.  
Bakkavor Group receivables securitisation facility 
The Group had a £50 million (2016: £50 million) receivables securi tisation facility that matured in February 2018 and has not b een renewed. The 
maximum drawing of the facility depends on the size of the Group’s receivable book fo r certain UK customers and the Group’s abi lity to deliver 
against performance triggers. The Group can draw a maximum of 72% of net eligible receivables. Net eligible receivables, in its simplest form, is 
the Group’s UK receivables for the relevant customers aged no greater than 60 days, less accruals for customer deductions.  
The maximum drawdown period under this facili ty is one month provided that the amount drawn is less than 72% of net eligible re ceivables  
at any reporting date. The interest rate incurred by the Group for amounts drawn against the receivables facility is Libor plus a margin of 2.85%  
(2016: Libor plus a margin of 2.85%). As at 30 December 2017, the Group had no drawings under this facility (2016: £nil). The f acility is subject to  
a non-utilisation fee of 1.4% (2016: 1.4%). The facility was secured by floating charges over the assets of Bakkavor Central Fi nance Limited until the 
facility expired in February 2018. 
Bakkavor Group Senior Secured Notes 
8.25% Senior Secured Notes 
In the prior year, the Group had outstanding £117 million of 8. 25% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 following the early repayment of £75 million of 
the Notes in February 2016. The Notes and associated fees we re repaid as part of the refinancing on 23 March 2017.

The Group had an interest rate swap of £63.2 million in place which matured in September 2016. This was replaced by a £75 milli on  
notional principal interest rate cap that matures in October 2019. Interest on the Group’s term loan, receivables securitisatio n and other borrowings 
are at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

Fair value of the Group’s borrowings 287.5 413.8
The 2018 and 2020 Senior Secured Notes were listed on the Irish Stock Exchange until March 2017 and were actively traded. The b est indication, 
therefore, of the fair value of these debt instruments is considered to be the list price at the relevant period end. The remai ning debt is regularly 
refinanced with interest rates that are in-line with the market rate for similar debt instruments and as a result of this the D irectors estimate that 
the carrying value of this debt approximates its fair value. 
The 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due in 2020 contained a call option from 15 June 2016 that under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ should be accounted for as an embedded derivative an d is required to be separately accounted for at fair value wit h the issued bond 
value carried at amortised cost. As at 31 December 2016 the fair value of the call option amounted to an asset of £17.2 million with a gain of £6.5 
million recognised in the period in Other gains and (losses) in the income statement. Following the repayment of the 8.75% Seni or Secured Notes 
on 23 March 2017 a loss of £17.2 million was presented as an ‘other item’ in Other gains and (losses) in the consolidated income statement in 2017.

30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of borrowings, as disclosed in  
Note 24, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to ow ners of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and ret ained earnings.  
The Group manages its capital by collating timely and reliable information to pr oduce various internal reports such as capital expenditure and 
weekly net debt reports, which enable the Board of Directors to assess the Group’s capital, and manage that capital effectively and in line with the 
Group’s objectives. The gearing of the Group is constantly monito red and managed to ensure that the ratio between debt and equity is at an 
acceptable level and enables the Group to operate as a going concer n and maximise stakeholders return.

The fair value of loans and receivables appr oximates to their carrying value due to the short-term nature of the receivables. F air values for the  
derivative financial instruments, other payables and the call option on the Senior Secured Notes due 2020 have been determined as level 2 under 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. Quoted prices are not available for the derivative financial instruments and so va luation models are 
used to estimate fair value. The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then di scount these values 
back to a present value. These models use as their basis independently sourced market parameters including, for example, interest rate yield 
curves and currency rates. The call option fair value used an estimate of the Company’s credit spread at the valuation date wit h the main valuation 
input being the GBP Interest rate swap curve. 
The fair value of other financial liabilities at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value. The trade and other payab les approximate to their 
fair value due to the short-term nature of the payables. The finance lease fair value approximates to the carrying value based on discounted future 
cash flows. 
There have been no changes to fair values as a result of a change in credit risk of the Group or th e Group’s customers.

30. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) 
Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to a number of financial risks such as access to and cost of funding, interest rate exposure, currency exp osure and working 
capital management. The Group seeks to minimise and mitigate agai nst these risks where possible and does this by constantly mon itoring and 
using a range of measures including derivative financial instrume nts. Use of financial instruments is governed by Group policie s which are approved 
by the Board. The treasury function does not operate as a profit centre, makes no speculative transactions and only enters into or trades financial 
instruments to manage specific exposures. 
Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risk s of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest ra tes. The Group enters  
into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including : 
• Interest rate caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. 
• Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on revenues and purchases in foreign currencies. 
Market risk exposures are supplemented by sensitivity analysis. There has been no change in the Group’s exposure to market risk s or the manner  
in which it manages and measures the risk. 
Foreign currency risk management 
Foreign currency risk management occurs at a transactional leve l on revenues and purchases in foreign currencies and at a trans lational level in 
relation to the translation of overseas op erations. All transactional risks, cash flow forecasts and related hedges are reviewe d by the Group Hedging 
Committee and Group Treasury, at least quarterly, to monitor foreign exchange rates and confirm the appropriateness of the Grou p’s hedged cover. 
The Group’s main foreign exchange risk is to the Euro and US dollar.  
During the 52 week period to 30 December 2017, the Euro strengthen ed against Sterling by 4.0%, with the closing rate at €1.1249 compared to 
€1.1715 at the prior period end. The average rate for the 52 week period to 30 December 2017 was €1.1408, a 6.8% strengthening of the Euro versus 
the prior period.  
In the same period the US dollar weakened against Sterling by 9.4%, with the closing rate at $1.3522 compared to $1.2357 at the prior period end. 
The average rate for the period to 30 December 2017 was $1.2896, a 4.7% strengthening of the US dollar versus the prior period.  
The net foreign exchange impact on profit from transactions is a loss of £2.9 million (2016: loss of £0.8 million).  
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the financial assets and liabilities to a sensitivity of 10% increase/decrease in the exchange rates. A 
10% increase/decrease has been used, as it represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exch ange rates. 
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a  
10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis in cludes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations w ithin the Group where 
the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the cu rrency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below in dicates an increase 
in profit/equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.

Interest rate risk management 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings. The risk is managed by ma intaining an appropriate mix between fixed a nd floating rate 
borrowings and by the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps to minimise the risk associa ted with variable 
interest rates. At the period end 26.1% (2016: 18.7%) of the Grou p’s borrowings were covered by an interest rate cap. During th e period, the Group 
has repaid the 8.25% and 8.75% fixed rate Senior Secured Notes th at had balances outstanding in the prior year (see Note 24). U se of interest rate 
derivatives is governed by Group polici es which are approved by the Board.  
Interest rate sensitivity analysis  
Interest rate sensitivity analysis has been performed on the financial assets and liabilities to illustrate the impact on Group profits and equity  
if interest rates increased/decreased. This analysis assumes the liabilities outstanding at the period end were outstanding for the whole period.  
A 100 basis points increase or decrease has been used, as these ar e management’s assessment of reasonably possible changes in i nterest rates.

Interest rate risk management (continued) 
Interest rate cap 
The Group entered into an interest rate cap agreement. This is to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the outstanding variable rate 
borrowings. The fair value of the interest rate cap at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows us ing the yield curves at 
the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.

The interest rate cap settles on a quarterly basis. The Group will receive payment if the three-month Libor rate exceeds the ag reed cap of 0.75%. 
Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk of financ ial loss to the Group if a counterparty defa ults on its contractual obligations of the loans and receivables at 
amortised cost held in the statement of financial position. 
The Group’s main credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables. The Group’s top four customers, all leading UK retailers , continue to represent 
more than 77% (2016: 77%) of the Group’s revenue from continuing operations. These customers have favourable credit ratings and consequently 
reduce the credit risk for the Group’s overall trade receivables.  
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instru ments is limited because the counterparties are banks with good credit ratings  
assigned by international credit rating agencies. Group policy dictates that Group deposits are shared between banks to spread the risk.  
Currently Group deposits are shared between banks that are count erparties in the Group’s secured committed bank facilities. The Group’s  
current bank credit limit consists of a £247.5 million term lo an (2016: £135 million) and a £200 million RCF facility (2016: £7 0 million), through  
a bank syndicate. Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. is the syndicate ag ent of this facility and they manage the syndicate and particip ation with other 
counterparties.  
Processes are in place to manage receivable s and overdue debt and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to resolve issues on a timely basis. 
Credit control operating procedures are in place to review all new customers. Existing customers are reviewed as management bec ome aware of 
changes of circumstances for specific custom ers. The amounts presented in the statement of financial position are net of approp riate allowance for 
doubtful trade receivables, specific customer risk and assessment of the current economic enviro nment. The carrying amount of f inancial assets 
recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk .  
Commodity risk management 
The Group acquires substantial quantities of raw materials for its operations. The Group is therefore exposed to commodity pric e and supply risks 
for these raw materials. The Group takes action to reduce overa ll material costs and exposure to price fluctuations by sourcing raw materials from 
suppliers all over the world, thereby decreasing geographic risk and it also frequently tenders to benchmark market prices. In general 
requirements are managed using contracts for periods of between th ree to twelve months forward. The Group also manages any loca l currency 
exposure in line with agreed contracts. 
Liquidity risk management 
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not be able to fund the day to day running of the Group. The Group manages liquidity risk  
by monitoring actual and forecast cash flo ws to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the maturity profiles of fi nancial liabilities.  
The Group also monitors the drawdown of borrowings against the available banking facilities and reviews the level of reserves. Liquidity risk 
management ensures sufficient borrowings funding is available for the Group’s day to day needs. Group policy is to maintain rea sonable headroom 
of unused committed bank facilities in a range of matu rities at least 12 months beyond the period end.

As a result of merger accounting, it is necessary to present share capital as if merger accounting had been in place at 31 Dece mber 2016. The 
104,774,006 shares (with a nominal value of £0.01) in Bakkavor Hold ings Limited held by Bakk AL Holdings Limited were exchanged for 104,774,006 
Ordinary shares (with a nominal value of £0.10) in Bakkavor Group plc. Prior to the public listing these shares were split into 523,870,030 Ordinary 
shares with a £0.02 nominal value. As part of the public list ing transaction 55,555,555 new shares were issued and made availab le to the public to 
purchase. 
The cash proceeds from the issue of new shares as part of the public listing was £100.0 million as the 55,555,555 shares were s ubscribed for at 
£1.80 per share. Fees of £3.4 million were paid from these proceeds giving a net cash flow from the share issue of £96.6 millio n. These fees have 
been charged against share premium.  
All Ordinary shares of £0.02 (2016: £0.01) each are non-redeemable and carry equal voti ng rights and rank for dividends and cap ital distributions, 
whether on a winding up or otherwise. 
No dividends have been declared in the period ended 30 December 2017 (2016: £nil).

accounted for using the principles of merger accounting.  
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve represents foreign exchange rate differences arising on the consolidation of the Group’s foreign operat ions. The assets  
and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial pos ition date. Income

36. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Company has a share option scheme for selected employees of the Group. Options granted under the scheme are exercisable at a discount to 
the estimated price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of 
grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if th e employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The options outstanding at 30 December 2017 had a weighted average exercise price of £0.68, and a weighted average remaining co ntractual life of 
9.4 years. In 2017, options were granted on 3 July 2017 and 20 October 2017. The options granted on 3 July 2017 have two perfor mance conditions  
for vesting: 
1. 50% vest provided that the individual is an employee in April 2020 and a liquidity event i.e. a public listing or company sale has occurred 
by that date. 
2. Provided that the first condition is met, a further 25% vest if Group Adjusted EBITDA for the 2019 financial year is £175 million with up to 
a further 25% vesting on a sliding scale if Group Adjusted EBITDA is between £175 million and £190 million for that year.

The Group has used the binomial model to value its share awards. 
The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during the period. It is typ ically calculated based 
on statistical analysis of daily share pric es over the length of the award period. Du e to the recent listing of Bakkavor Group plc, this information is 
not available. Instead it has been based on the volatility of an average of companies of a similar size that operate in a simil ar market.  
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.8 million (2016: £nil) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the period. 
37. RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES  
The Group operates a number of pension schemes in the UK and overseas. These schemes are either trust- or contract-based and ha ve been set 
up in accordance with appropriate legislation. The assets of each of the pension schemes are held separately from the assets of the Company. 
In the UK, the two main schemes are a defined contribution scheme which is open to all UK employees joining the Group (full or part time) and the 
other is the Bakkavor Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit sc heme which provides benefits on a final salary basis and was c losed to future 
accrual in March 2011.  
Pension costs charged in arriving at profit on ordinary activities before taxation were: 
£ million 2017 2016
UK defined contribution scheme net charge 6.1 6.2
Overseas defined contribution scheme net charge – 0.1
UK defined benefit scheme net charge 1.0 1.1
Total charge 7.1 7.4
Defined contribution schemes 
The total cost charged to income of £6.1 million (2016: £6.3 mi llion) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
advised by the Group to all employees, subject to the minimum requ irements set out in legislation. Included in accruals was £1. 0 million  at the 
period end for the defined contribu tion schemes (2016: £1.0 million). 
Defined benefit schemes 
An actuarial valuation of Scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation for funding purposes was carrie d out as at 31 March 
2016. The results were updated for IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ purposes to 30 December 2017 by a qu alified independent actuary with Willis Towers 
Watson. The projected unit cost method was used to value the liabilities.  
The major assumptions used in this IAS 19 valuation were: 
 
30 December 
2017
31 December 
2016
Future pension increases (majority of liabilities) 3.05% 3.10%
Discount rate applied to Scheme liabilities  2.40% 2.55%

The mortality table is based on scheme-spe cific postcode-fitted SAPS 2 tables with a 96% multiplier for male members and a 95% multiplier for 
female members. Future improvements are in line with the CMIB core 2015 improvements model with a 1.0% p.a. long-term trend fro m 2007 
onwards, giving life expectancies as follows: 
 
Males’ expected

The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:  
Assumption Change in assumption Approximate impact on scheme liabilities 
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 1.0% Decrease £49.3 million/increase £66.0 million 
Rate of inflation Increase/decrease by 0.5% Increase £21.4 million/decrease £20.1 million 
Life expectancy Members assumed to be one year younger than their actual age Increase £10.3 million 
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 
£ million 2017 2016
Net interest on net defined benefit asset/liability 0.2 0.1
Administration costs incurred during the period 0.8 1.0
Total charge 1.0 1.1
All of the charges for each period presented have been included in total administrative expenses. The actuarial gain of £12.3 m illion (2016: £7.6 
million loss) has been reported in other comprehensive income.  
The actual return on Scheme assets was an increase of £23.5 million (2016: £55.4 million increase). 
The amount included in the statement of financial position arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of its defined benef it retirement benefit 
schemes is as follows: 
£ million

 4.3 (8.3)
The assumptions used are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not 
necessarily be borne out in practice. 
The Scheme surplus has been recognised in accordance with IF RIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Fund ing 
Requirements and their interaction’ as the Scheme’s terms and conditions allow the Group to have an unconditional right to a re fund of 
contributions when economic benefits are available.

Structured UK equity 6.6 6.0
Overseas equity 38.1 32.9

Index linked government bonds 134.1 118.8
Cash 29.8 13.1
Other 25.5 15.3
 265.8 252.6
The fair values of the majority of the equity and bonds have been determined as level 2 instruments under IFRS 7 ‘Financial Ins truments: 
Disclosures’, except for most of the Index linked government bond s which have quoted prices in active markets and are classed a s level 1.  
Structured UK equity provides exposure to UK equities but is a derivative based solution and not a direct investment in equitie s. A proportion of the 
Index linked government bonds are held as collateral against the Structured UK equity product. 
The scheme assets also include swaps to hedge liability inflation and interest rate risks. The swap value has been included in the value of the gilt 
securities used as collateral for the swaps. Corporate bonds and cash are also used as collateral for the swaps in place.  
The Scheme invests in three multi-asset funds which invest in a wide range of assets including alternative asset classes. In th e summary above, the 
multi-asset funds have been split into the relevant constituent asset classes. 
The Bakkavor Pension Scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustee on behalf of the members in accordance 
with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislatio n. The Scheme is subject to scheme specific funding requireme nts as outlined in 
UK legislation. The most recent scheme specific funding valuation at 31 March 2016 was finalised in April 2017.  
The Group and the Trustee work closely together in matters concerning the Bakkavor Pension Scheme. Regular meetings and corresp ondence on 
matters concerning the Scheme are shared in an open manner between both parties. 
The Bakkavor Pension Scheme’s current investment strategy adopts a policy of investing broadly 60% in growth-seeking assets and 40% in bonds, 
although the proportions can vary significantly in order to allow for advanced liability hedging techniques. A large proportion of both interest and 
inflation risk is hedged. The strategy is intended to reduce th e risk of significant changes to the funding level by hedging ke y risks, while retaining a 
proportion of return seeking assets to minimise long term costs by maximising return within an acceptable level of risk. The Sc heme’s assets are 
held separately from those of the Group. 
The weighted average duration of the Bakkavor Pension Scheme is approximately 22 years. 
The actual amount of employer contributions expected to be paid to the Scheme during 2018 is £3.8 million. Employer contributio ns, except for 
deficit reduction contributions, ceased in March 2011 when the Scheme closed to future accrual. Employee contributions also cea sed at this date. 
Following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual in March 2011, the Group and the Trustee agreed that members who were act ive members of 
the Scheme at the date of closure would remain entitled to access early retirement on preferential terms as long as they remain ed in employment 
within the Group. The value of members accessing these preferential terms is not included in the defined benefit obligation as this benefit is not 
funded for in advance. If members choose to access this benefit an employer contribution is made to the Scheme to reflect the i ncrease in expected 
future pension costs. In 2017 the total contributions made in respect of this benefit were £nil (2016: £nil). 
The current deficit reduction contributions were agreed between the Group and the Trustee as part of the 2016 triennial valuati on. The deficit 
contributions will be paid over an eight year recovery period ending on 31 March 2024. The recovery contributions are paid mont hly and the agreed 
rates are £2.0 million in the year ended 31 March 2017, £4.5 million in the year ending 31 March 2018, £3.5 million in the year ending 31 March 2019 
and £2.5 million per annum in subsequent years until 31 March 2024. £3.9 million was paid in the period to 30 December 2017.

39. EVENTS AFTER THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE 
On 27 March 2018 the Company completed a capital reduction which ha d been approved prior to the public listing and was set out in the public 
listing prospectus. This has resulted in th e transfer of £366.1 million from the shar e premium account to retained earnings.  
40. CONTROLLING PARTY 
These Financial Statements are the largest consolidated group financial statements in which the Company has been included. 
At 30 December 2017, Carrion Enterprises Limited and Umbriel Ve ntures Limited together held 290,666,260 Ordinary shares representing 50.2% of 
the total issued Ordinary share capital of Bakkavor Group plc. Two of the Company’s Directors, Agust Gudmundsson and Lydur Gudm undsson, 
through their beneficial ownership of Carrion Enterprises Limited and Umbriel Ventures Limited are treated as acting in concert and are therefore 
controlling shareholders of the Company. 
41. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
The Group uses various non-IFRS financial me asures to help evaluate growth trends, assess operational performance and monitor c ash 
performance. The Directors consider that these measures enable investors to understand the ongoing operations of the business a nd are used by 
management to monitor financial performance as it is considered to aid comparability of the financial performance of the Group from year to year 
and it excludes items that are considered not to arise directly from trading activities. 
Like-for-like (LFL) revenue 
The Group defines LFL revenue as revenue from continuing operatio ns adjusted for the share of revenue generated by associates, revenue 
generated from businesses closed or sold in the current and prior year, revenue generated from businesses acquired in the curre nt period, the 
effect of foreign currency movements and the extra week of trading in 2016. The Directors believe LFL revenue is a key metric of the Group’s 
revenue growth trend as it adjusts for the effects of any acqu isitions, disposals, closures, currency fluctuations and compares comparable period 
lengths thereby allowing for a more meaningful comparison of trends from period to period.

Adjusted EBITDA 
The Group manages the performance of its businesses through the use of ‘Adjusted EBITDA’ as this measure excludes the impact of items that 
hinder comparison of profitability year on year. EBITDA is gene rally defined as operating profit/(loss) before depreciation and amortisation. In 
calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we further exclude share of results of associates, restructuring costs, asset impairments, share s cheme charges  
and those additional charges or credits that ar e considered significant or one-off in nature.

shares in issue during the year. Adjusted earnings is calculated as profit attributable to equity holders of the Company adjust ed to exclude other 
items as presented in the consolidated income statement. The Directors use this measure as it tracks the underlying profitabili ty of the Group and 
enables comparison with the Group’s peer companies. The following table reconciles profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company to

Return on invested capital (ROIC) 
The Group defines ROIC as Adjusted operating profit after tax di vided by the average invested capital for the year. Adjusted op erating profit after tax 
is defined as operating profit from continuing operations excluding the impact of exceptional items, impairment of assets, and profit on disposal of 
subsidiaries less tax at the Group’s effective tax rate. Invested capital is defined as total assets less total liabilities exc luding net debt at the period 
end, pension assets and liabilities (net of deferred tax) and fair values for derivatives not designated in a hedging relations hip. The Group utilises 
ROIC to measure how effectively it uses invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by adding the invested capital at the beginning of the 
period to invested capital at the end of the period and dividing the result by two.  
The Directors believe that ROIC is a useful indicator of the amount returned as a percentage of shareholders’ invested capital. The Directors believe 
that ROIC can assist analysts, investors an d stakeholders to evaluate the Group’s profitability and the efficiency with which i ts invested capital is 
employed.
