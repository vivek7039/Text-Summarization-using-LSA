2BTGroup plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Our results for the 2005 ﬁnancial year were strong. New wave
revenues grew by 32% to £4.5 billion, and now represent
nearly a quarter of our business. Earnings per share have more
than doubled over the past three years and net debt is more
than £20 billion lower than in 2001.
Chairman’s message
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 3
Earnings per share in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, grew by 7%
to 18.1 pence. While continuing to invest for the future,
we generated free cash ﬂow of £2.3 billion, up 10%.
The news on dividends is positive. We are
recommending a full-year dividend of 10.4 pence per
share, a pay out ratio of 57% of earnings before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, compared to 50%
last year. We continue with our progressive dividend
policy. The dividend for the 2006 ﬁnancial year will be at
least 60% of underlying earnings: subject to the group’s
overall ﬁnancial position, we expect our pay out ratio to
rise to around two-thirds of underlying earnings by the
2008 ﬁnancial year.
We continued with our share buy back programme in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This is being funded from cash
generated over and above that required for servicing our
debt. We have reduced net debt to below £8 billion, a
level with which we are comfortable.
Business progress
In support of our strategy for transformation and growth,
your Board gave backing during the year for a targeted
series of acquisitions that will help to build our capabilities
as one of the world’s foremost global networked IT
services companies. These acquisitions offered value for
money, had a compelling strategic ﬁt and brought
capabilities to strengthen BT globally. In addition, passing
the ﬁve million mark for broadband connections in the UK
in early April was a key moment in the history of your
company.
Regulation
BT welcomed the Strategic Review of Telecommunications
by Ofcom. During the year we have worked to help inﬂuence
and shape their thinking and made a radical proposal for a
new regulatory landscape in the UK. We continued to argue
strongly that structural separation was not in shareholders’
or customers’ interests. We look forward to the published
outcome. Our position remains that a strategic and ﬂexible
regulatory regime, together with rapid deregulation
wherever possible, is vital to meeting customers’ developing
needs and creating the conditions in which we, and others,
can continue to invest with conﬁdence.
Board membership
There were a number of changes to your Board during the
2005 ﬁnancial year. I would like to welcome Hanif Lalani as
our new Group Finance Director. Ian Livingston, who had
occupied the ﬁnance role with distinction for three years,
was appointed Chief Executive BT Retail with effect from
February 2005. It is a testament to the strength of BT’s
management team generally that we were able to appoint
people from inside the company to such key roles. I would
also like to thank Pierre Danon, who left the Board in
February, for his signiﬁcant contribution as Chief Executive
of BT Retail for the last four years.
Wider responsibilities
It is increasingly important that companies such as BT
continue to be good corporate citizens, living up to our
responsibilities to the communities in which we operate
and to the environment. I’m proud to be able to report
that, for the fourth year in a row, BT was the highest
placed telecommunications company in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index. Our community programmes focus
on those issues where communications really can make
the difference; we have provided long-term support, for
example, for a drama-based education programme to help
develop young people’s communications skills, and for the
work of the children’s charity ChildLine.
Like so many other companies and individuals, we
wanted to respond to the devastating Asian tsunami in
December 2004. We made a donation of £500,000 to
the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) and we
provided a live call centre for the unprecedented number
of calls coming into the DEC. I’m particularly proud of the
fact that so many of our employees were involved in
fundraising activities and that 16 of our engineers
travelled to the affected area to help re-establish
communications.
Outlook
The process of transformation on which your company
embarked in 2001 is accelerating. That process is
increasingly reﬂected in your company’s results. We are well
set for further success in the years ahead.
I’d like to thank shareholders for the loyalty they’ve
shown. Your continued conﬁdence – coupled with the
loyalty of our customers and suppliers and the
imagination and commitment of our employees – is
fundamental to our transformation for growth.
Sir Christopher Bland
Chairman
18 May 2005 Today, BT is a very different company from the one that I joined
three years ago. As our customers’ needs have changed and
continue to change, so we have found and continue to ﬁnd new ways
of meeting those needs, investing in innovative products and
services which add value to our customers and to BT. That, after all,
is what being a service company means.
Chief Executive’s statement
4BTGroup plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005
In 2005, convergence is at the heart of BT’s strategy.
By convergence, we mean the ability to bring together
our capabilities and capacities in new ways to make life
better, simpler and cheaper for our customers. For our
business customers this means productivity
improvements; for consumers it’s about new, easier to
use services. For customers of all kinds it means a more
joined-up communications experience.
So, for example, we offer our major corporate
customers around the world a unique marriage of our
networking experience and infrastructure with IT services.
These used to be separate offerings, often supplied by
different companies, but we’re bringing them together in
one place. This means that however much their
operations are dispersed around the globe, our customers
can communicate and operate as one, anytime,
anywhere, and at lower cost.
What we’re doing in the mobile market is similarly
about convergence – we aim to offer customers a
converged combination of ‘the best of ﬁxed and the best
of mobile’. Ultimately, our customers shouldn’t have to
worry about ﬁxed or mobile when what they really want is
freedom and ﬂexibility. This means that we have to ﬁnd
ways of helping them communicate, wherever they are,
using whatever device they choose, at the right price.
And convergence is also what our twenty-ﬁrst century
network (21CN) programme is all about. What our
customers need to know is that the 21CN can support a
range of technologies and services that will enable them
to do the things they want to do – faster, more seamlessly
and more cost efﬁciently. And because this new network
will support a wide range of innovative services which are
currently run on separate networks, it will be much more
cost efﬁcient for BT.
Global networked IT services
We have raised our global proﬁle through targeted
acquisitions, including Infonet and Radianz, and by
increasing our holding in Albacom to 100%.
We continued to play to our strengths in the
networked IT services market. A few years ago, our
position in this market was aspirational; today, we are
competing with the best – and winning. The BT brand is
now a powerful presence in the global networked IT
services market. It’s a brand that stands for excellent
networking skills and a genuine commitment to ﬁnding
innovative ways of delivering what our customers want,
end to end, leaving them free to do what they’re good at:
running their businesses.
Our ICT (information and communications technology)
revenues were £3 billion in the year and the major
contracts we’ve won indicate the conﬁdence that our
customers are prepared to put in us. We now have a track
record of meeting the needs of public and private sector
customers in, for example, the ﬁnancial services and
government arenas.
Our networked IT services order intake for the year was
over £7 billion.
Broadband
Broadband has been an enormous success story, not just
for BT but for the UK as a whole, which now has the
highest levels of broadband access of any country in the
G7 group of nations. We hit our ﬁve million broadband
lines target a year early.
As broadband access becomes a fact of life for most
people in the UK, our focus is shifting further towards the
retail market where we have fantastic scope to drive
further growth.
Having got broadband, people now want to do more
and more with it. We are increasing speeds by up to four
times at no extra cost to our retail customers.
Convergent mobility services
The launch, in partnership with Vodafone, of our mobile
virtual network operator in both the business and
consumer markets is the key to building a mobility
customer base and a path to mobile convergence. We
now have over 372,000 contract connections.
Our strategy is to build a foundation for the delivery of
high-value, ﬁxed/mobile convergent solutions, for
consumers and businesses. An early example of this will
be Project Bluephone which will give customers the
convenience of a mobile phone with the quality and cost
advantage of ﬁxed-line services.
Twenty-ﬁrst century network
Our 21CN will help to make the UK one of the most
advanced telecommunications countries in the world,
transform our wholesale business and support the next
generation of ﬂexible, cost-efﬁcient services. At the end of
April 2005, we announced the eight preferred suppliers
who will help us to implement the 21CN.
The capital expenditure involved is signiﬁcant but the
21CN will lead to a radical simpliﬁcation of our networks
making it easier to offer compelling propositions to all our
customers. The real challenge is to ensure that we invest
in a way that meets customers’ needs.
Traditional business
We are experiencing major changes in our traditional
markets as a result of regulation, growing competition
and signiﬁcant shifts in our customers’ buying patterns,
as they discover the possibilities of technologies such as
instant messaging and voice over IP. Chief Executive’s statement BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 5
Fixed-voice telephone calls may no longer be the only way
to measure the success of a communications company,
but they remain fundamental to our business. We may
have lost some market share to competitors but we will
continue to compete aggressively by offering new and
better services, and improved customer value.
Cost efﬁciency
Taking a leadership position on costs is critical. Earnings
per share is a key measure, which means that we have to
continue to look at every cost line in the business and
challenge it. We’ve made excellent progress on improving
our cost efﬁciency in the past few years and in the 2005
ﬁnancial year, our cost efﬁciency programmes achieved
savings of around £400 million, and we aim to deliver at
least £300 million to £400 million of savings in each of
the next three years.
Relentless customer focus
Our 20 million customers are a wonderful asset and we
have to continue to show how much we value every one of
them.
A key target for us was driving down customer
dissatisfaction – we’ve reduced dissatisfaction levels by
23% on a compound annual basis over the past three
years. There is still more to be done and we must
continue this focus.
Our people
People bring strategies to life, people deliver world-class
customer experiences, people make convergence happen.
Two years ago, we introduced our new brand values –
trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart.
Since then, BT people have embraced these values,
and turned the business inside out and upside down to
deliver our strategy, ﬁnding innovative ways to reinvent
BT in our traditional markets at the same time as
establishing our BT brand in new markets, all the while
driving down customer dissatisfaction.
Iam constantly amazed by their commitment and by
what they have achieved.

Operating and ﬁnancial review
Business review
6BTGroup plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Introduction
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for an
integrated group of businesses, which together form one
of the world’s leading providers of communications
solutions serving customers in Europe, the Americas and
the Asia Paciﬁc region. British Telecommunications plc is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and holds
virtually all businesses and assets of the BT group.
Our aim is to increase shareholder value through
service excellence, an effective brand, our large-scale
networks and our existing customer base, and also
through innovation in products, services and solutions.
Our principal activities include networked IT services;
local, national and international telecommunications
services; and higher-value broadband and internet
products and services.
In the UK
BT is the UK’s largest communications service provider,
by market share, to the residential and business markets,
supplying over 20 million customers with a wide range of
communications products and services, including voice,
data, internet and multimedia services, and offering a
comprehensive range of managed and packaged
communications solutions.
Our core portfolio covers traditional telephony
products such as calls, analogue/digital lines and private
circuits. New wave revenue generation is focused on
networked IT services, broadband and mobility.
In the UK wholesale market, we provide network
services and solutions to over 600 communications
companies, including ﬁxed and mobile network operators,
ISPs (internet service providers) and other service
providers. We interconnect with more than 180 other
operators, as well as carrying transit trafﬁc between
telecommunications operators.
Our aim in these markets is to continue to increase
proﬁtable revenues from data and advanced broadband
and internet services, further reducing our dependence on
revenues and proﬁt generated by traditional ﬁxed-line
voice services.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, 91% of our revenues were
derived from operations within the UK.
Globally
We supply managed services and solutions to multi-site
organisations worldwide – our core target market is
10,000 multi-site organisations including major
companies with signiﬁcant global requirements, together
with large organisations in target local markets. We
provide them with global reach and a complete range of
networked IT services.
Our extensive global communications network and
strong partnerships enable us to serve customers in the
key commercial centres of Europe, North America and the
Asia Paciﬁc region. We own operations in the Americas,
Africa, the Asia Paciﬁc region, Belgium, France, Germany,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Scandinavia,
Switzerland and Central and Eastern Europe. In a small
number of countries we use a combination of direct sales
and services capabilities and strategic partners to deliver
the services our customers want. We currently have
employees in 12 countries in Asia Paciﬁc, and operate
multiple sales ofﬁces in the Americas.
Our global communications services portfolio includes:
desktop and network equipment and software; transport
and connectivity; managed LAN (local area network),
WAN (wide area network) and IPVPN (internet protocol
virtual private network) services; managed mobility;
applications hosting; storage and security services; and
business transformation and change management
services.
Governance
BT’s policy is to achieve best practice in our standards of
business integrity in all our operations, in line with our
published statement of business practice – The Way We
Work. This includes a commitment to maintaining the
highest standards of corporate governance throughout
the group (see Corporate governance).
Corporate social responsibility
We are committed to enhancing our positive impact on
society through leadership in CSR (corporate social
responsibility). In our view, a well managed CSR
programme supports the delivery of strategy and is in the
best interests of customers, shareholders, employees and
the community (see Our commitment to society).
Ofcom’s Strategic Review of Telecommunications
Shortly after assuming its regulatory functions in
December 2003, the Ofﬁce of Communications (Ofcom)
began conducting a Strategic Review of
Telecommunications, the aim of which is to consider the
scope for the further development of effective
competition in the telecommunications sector.
The Review has found that although the UK
telecommunications market has delivered signiﬁcant
beneﬁts for consumers and businesses, the current
market situation is not acceptable or desirable going
forward. Consequently, Ofcom’s second consultation put
forward three options:
& withdrawal from regulation in favour of reliance on
competition law;
& a market investigation reference to the Competition
Commission under the Enterprise Act; or
& the delivery by BT to other industry participants of
‘real equality of access’.
BT supports the concept of a settlement based on
equality of access which would, in our view, be an ideal
opportunity to focus regulation on economic bottlenecks
and reduce it elsewhere; sweep away the ‘regulatory
mesh’ that has grown up since 1984; and deliver
regulatory stability and certainty, promoting the
conﬁdence that market participants need if they are to
invest and innovate. Consequently, in our response to
Ofcom’s second consultation we put forward a package of
proposals under which BT would make signiﬁcant
organisational and other changes to address issues of
market conﬁdence and transparency. We stressed that as
part of this package, we would need Ofcom to take
certain measures, notably to make a commitment to rapid
and signiﬁcant deregulation.
Ofcom is currently involved in discussions with BT and
others aimed at assessing whether a settlement based on
equality of access would be feasible. If it concludes it is
not, it will consider adopting the second of the three
options outlined above, ie an Enterprise Act reference.
See Regulation, competition and prices for more
information on Ofcom’s proposals and BT’s response.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 7 Group structure
Background
British Telecommunications plc, the successor to the
statutory corporation British Telecommunications, was
incorporated in England and Wales as a public limited
company, wholly owned by the UK Government, as a
result of the Telecommunications Act 1984. Between
November 1984 and July 1993, the UK Government sold
all of its shareholding in three public offerings.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year, BT undertook a radical
restructuring, including the UK’s largest-ever rights issue
(raising £5.9 billion), the demerger of O2 (comprising
BT’s wholly-owned mobile assets in Europe), the disposal
of signiﬁcant non-core businesses and assets, the unwind
of Concert (BT’s joint venture with AT&T) and the
creation of customer-focused lines of business.
Acquisitions and disposals prior to the 2005
ﬁnancial year
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we completed the sale of our
26% stake in Cegetel Groupe SA, the leading alternative
ﬁxed-line operator in France, for £2.6 billion in cash. In
addition, we disposed of a number of non-core
investments, including our stakes in BSkyB, Mediaset, Blu
and SmarTone.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year we sold our stake in
Inmarsat, a global mobile satellite communications
services company, and monetised our shareholding in LG
Telecom, a wireless telecommunications service provider
in the Republic of Korea. We also acquired the UK
operations of NSB Retail Systems, a supplier of software
products and services, and Transcomm, a provider of
data-only wireless services in the UK.
Acquisitions and disposals in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
In February 2005, we completed the acquisition of
Infonet, one of the world’s leading providers of
international managed voice and data network services,
for £520 million, including acquisition costs. Excluding
Infonet’s net cash balance, the net value of the deal was
£315 million.
The acquisition of Infonet, re-branded BT Infonet, is a
signiﬁcant step forward in our strategy of addressing the
networked IT services needs of multi-site organisations. It
will signiﬁcantly extend our global reach and will deepen
our presence in North America and the Asia Paciﬁc
region. BT Infonet has local operations and/or distributors
in 70 countries, remote network access in approximately
180 countries and strong sales and support partnerships
around the world.
Also in February 2005, we acquired the 74% of
Albacom that we did not already own from our three joint
venture partners – ENI, BNL and Mediaset – for a
minimum of £80 million. Including acquisition costs, and
settlement of BT’s share of Albacom’s bank loan, the total
acquisition cost was £131 million. BT has been active in
the Italian business communications market since 1995
and Albacom provides data transmission, voice and
internet services to more than 170,000 customers in that
market. We also signed outsourcing contracts with our
former joint venture partners.
In October 2004, there was an IPO (initial public
offering) of the Singapore telecommunications and media
company, StarHub, in which BT held an 11.9% stake. By
November 2004, we had disposed of our entire holding,
through the IPO, for £78 million in cash.
Also in October 2004, we acquired BIC Systems Group
Limited for a cash consideration of £17 million,
consolidating our position in the networked IT services
sector in Northern Ireland.
In December 2004, we completed the sale of our
15.8% stake in Eutelsat to GS Capital Partners – an
investment partnership afﬁliated with Goldman Sachs –
for £357 million in cash. In January 2005, we completed
the sale of our 4% stake in Intelsat to a consortium of
private equity investors for £65 million in cash. This
followed the sale in June 2004 of our 4.8% stake in
New Skies Satellites for £24 million in cash.
In July 2004, we disposed of our 27.7% stake in
PayPoint Limited, a bill payment collection network
operator, to various institutional investors for £34 million
in cash.
Post balance sheet acquisitions
In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of Radianz,
the leading ﬁnancial services extranet provider, from
Reuters for a cash consideration of £107 million. The
purchase of Radianz is another vital step in our
transformation into a global provider of networked IT
services. Radianz will continue to provide high-quality
extranet services for Reuters and the global ﬁnancial
services market.
How BT operates
BT consists principally of three lines of business: BT Retail,
BT Wholesale and BT Global Services.
BT Retail and BT Wholesale operate almost entirely
within the UK, addressing the consumer, business and
wholesale markets, and offer a broad spectrum of
communications products and services.
BT Global Services addresses the networked IT services
needs of multi-site organisations including major
companies with signiﬁcant global requirements and large
organisations in target local markets.

Consumer customers
As at 31 March 2005, BT had approximately 19 million
UK consumer customers with around 20 million
residential customer lines (exchange line connections). In
the 2005 ﬁnancial year, consumer revenues declined by
6% to £5,637 million, primarily reﬂecting the impact of
CPS (carrier pre-selection) and regulatory price reductions
to mobile termination rates.
8BTGroup plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review Our strategy in the consumer market is to defend
traditional revenues and market share vigorously through
innovative service offerings backed by innovative
marketing and excellent quality of service. At the same
time, we are driving for new wave revenues, particularly in
the areas of broadband and mobility.
In the consumer market, new wave revenues grew by
85% from £223 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year to £412
million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, driven principally by
broadband and mobility. Residential broadband
customers increased by 96% in the year to more than
1.3 million and mobility connections increased to
187,000 as at 31 March 2005.
Major corporate and business customers
As at 31 March 2005, we had around 1.5 million business
customers worldwide, with nine million exchange lines in
the UK.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, major corporate revenues
increased by 4% to £6,101 million. The increase in new
wave turnover of 19% to £2,926 million was driven by
networked IT services, broadband and by mobility, not
only in the UK but also globally.
Our strategy in the major corporate market is to
continue to migrate from traditional voice-only services to
networked IT services. This enables us to build closer,
more integrated, long-term, high-value relationships with
our customers, enabling them to manage their
communications spend more effectively and gain
competitive advantage in their markets. Such
relationships will, we believe, deliver long-term,
sustainable, predictable and proﬁtable revenues, more
than offsetting the decline in our traditional business
revenues. As at 31 March 2005, new wave turnover
accounted for 48% of our total turnover in the major
corporate market.
In the SME market (typically companies with up to 500
employees), our strategy is to provide business customers
with tailored communications products and services that
enable them to manage their businesses more simply and
efﬁciently. Overall, in the SME market during the 2005
ﬁnancial year, revenues reduced by 5% to £2,464 million
primarily reﬂecting the impact of CPS and WLR (wholesale
line rental).
Wholesale customers
Our strategy in the UK wholesale market is to continue to
generate proﬁtable revenues from our core market and
from new wave products in broadband, networked IT
services and mobility.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, turnover from our wholesale
activities increased by 9% to £4,396 million.
In the UK, external turnover from BT’s wholesale
activities was £3,812 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
compared with £3,473 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
New wave revenues were £664 million, up 84% on the
2004 ﬁnancial year. This increase was driven by the
success of broadband as well as a strong emphasis on
customers as we aim to build innovative solutions that
help our wholesale customers grow their businesses.
In our global carrier business, revenues were
£584 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, compared with
£557 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Our global carrier
business customers include other ﬁxed-line
telecommunications operators, mobile operators and
selected ISPs.
Report structure
For the purposes of this Business review,we are
reporting on each of our strategic imperatives.
For ﬁnancial reporting purposes, we continue to report
by line of business (see Financial review).
Group strategy
Our strategy is to build long-term partnerships with our
customers. With their support, we aim to maximise the
potential of our traditional business – through a
combination of enhanced quality of service, creative
marketing, innovative pricing and cost efﬁciency – while
pursuing proﬁtable growth by migrating our customers to
new wave products and services such as networked IT
services, broadband, mobility and managed services.
We are also exploring new ways of doing business and
have, for example, set up a number of ventures to deliver
new revenue streams by taking an innovative and
entrepreneurial approach to our core business.
We have eight strategic imperatives, ﬁve of which are
focused on generating new wave revenues, defending
revenue in traditional markets and operating with
maximum efﬁciency:
& build on our networked IT services capability
& deliver on broadband
& create convergent mobility solutions
& defend our traditional business vigorously
& drive for cost leadership.
These are underpinned by three further imperatives:
& keep a relentless focus on improving customer
satisfaction
& transform our network for the twenty-ﬁrst century
& motivate our people and live the BT values.
Build on our networked IT services capability
Our strategy in the networked IT services market is to
reinforce BT’s position as a global player capable of
competing with the world’s best in selected growth
markets. Our portfolio of services covers a number of key
areas including IP infrastructure, CRM (customer
relationship management), security, applications,
managed mobility, hosting, and outsourcing.
Networked IT services for major corporate customers
As business applications are increasingly being networked,
networks are seen as increasingly vital to productivity and
competitive advantage.
ICT revenues for the 2005 ﬁnancial year were £2,753
million, a rise of 18% on the 2004 ﬁnancial year. We aim
to deliver networked IT services globally to large business
customers and other organisations (including the public
and government sectors), giving them the
communications tools they need for productivity and/or
business improvement.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we secured networked IT
services orders worth more than £7 billion. Major
contracts included:
& Our highest proﬁle success in the global market came
in March 2005 when it was announced that BT will be
Reuters’ supplier of network services under a contract
expected to be worth up to £1.5 billion over eight and
a half years. BT will provide and manage secure data
networks for Reuters’ products and services worldwide.
& We also signed a new voice and data communications
deal with Barclays plc to provide enhanced
communications infrastructure services for Barclays’
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 9 UK operations. The value of these services, including
existing business, is expected to be in excess of £500
million over the seven-year term.
& A number of contract wins during the 2005 ﬁnancial
year helped to conﬁrm BT’s European credentials and
capability. For example, we signed an outsourcing
contract with French company THALES Group, an
international electronics and systems group serving the
defence, aeronautics, security and services markets.
The ﬁve-year contract covers the management of
ﬁxed-voice and data network services for THALES and
its subsidiaries in up to 42 countries.
& We signed a multi-year managed services agreement
with Bristol-Myers Squibb to manage its LAN and WAN
infrastructure globally. As part of the agreement, BT
will migrate these services to a state-of-the-art, high-
speed, IP-based global MPLS (multi-protocol label
switching) infrastructure.
& We were awarded a global network outsourcing
contract with South Korea-based CyberLogitec, the IT
subsidiary of Hanjin Shipping. With a sales order value
of £18 million, this is one of the largest contracts won
by BT in the Asia Paciﬁc region.
& National Air Trafﬁc Service awarded us a £32 million
contract to provide a system to carry all
communications between its radar, communication
and air trafﬁc control centre sites and its IT network.
& In addition to the range of large deals, we secured
more than 300 networked IT services contracts each
worth between £1 million and £5 million during the
2005 ﬁnancial year.
& In April 2005, we won an extension to 2012 of a
contract to deliver essential telecommunications
services to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the UK’s
armed forces. Between April 2005 and July 2012, the
Defence Fixed Telecommunications Systems public/
private partnership contract between the MoD and BT
will be worth up to £1.5 billion, bringing the total value
of the contract to more than £2.7 billion.
& We underlined our position as a global networked IT
services company with the launch of a major
business-to-business advertising and marketing
campaign in September 2004. The campaign ran in
multiple languages in international and local media
across Europe, the Americas and the Asia Paciﬁc
region.
Networked IT services for wholesale customers
We believe that the convergence of IT and
communications technologies creates commercial
opportunities for communications providers, and our
strategy is to enable these providers to take full
advantage of such opportunities.
We have a long and successful tradition of delivering
network-based connectivity to the carrier and
intermediate telecommunications markets throughout the
UK, and have developed value-enhancing services and
solutions. We have a number of agreements with service
providers and mobile operators to upgrade their IP
capability. In addition, we have used our expertise and
geographic reach to provide ubiquitous, bespoke data
housing solutions.
Our plans for our twenty-ﬁrst century network (21CN)
will enable the delivery of further integrated network and
communications solutions to our customers and their
end-user customers.
Deliver on broadband
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we continued our drive to
enhance the awareness, availability and attractiveness of
broadband and we are on target to bring broadband to
exchanges serving 99.6% of UK homes and businesses by
the summer of 2005. The UK now has the most extensive
broadband network of all the countries in the G7 Group,
according to telecommunications analyst Ovum.
We believe that the key issues in today’s broadband
markets are speed and price, but that, going forward,
applications will increasingly prove to be a competitive
differentiator.
Broadband for wholesale customers
In early April 2005, we reached our target of ﬁve million
broadband lines, one year ahead of schedule. Since we
ﬁrst announced the target, take-up has continued to
accelerate – whereas it took a year to reach our ﬁrst
million, the ﬁfth million took just four months. Since
September 2004, we have been connecting someone to
broadband every ten seconds of every day. In total, 4,419
exchanges had been upgraded by the end of the 2005
ﬁnancial year, reaching almost 97% of the UK’s homes
and businesses. Broadband is now one of the fastest
growing consumer products of all time.

BT Wholesale DSL broadband connections (thousands)
& In February 2005, Northern Ireland became the ﬁrst
UK region outside London to have all its exchanges
enabled for broadband. As at 1 March 2005 – as a
result of a £10 million partnership between BT and
One Northeast, the regional development agency for
northeast England – all 181 exchanges in the region
had been upgraded. In April 2005, we won the £16.5
million public tender with the Scottish Executive to
bring broadband to the most remote communities in
the UK. We will enable 378 exchanges to deliver
broadband to 51,000 households and 5,400
businesses.
& During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we removed the
distance-related limits on our most popular broadband
services, bringing around one million more UK homes
and businesses within reach of broadband.
& As the broadband market has matured, new
applications, including video and music downloads and
videoconferencing, have driven a demand for
increasing speed. Since April 2005, we have been
testing speeds of between 2Mbit/s and 8Mbit/s with a
10 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review view to launching higher-speed wholesale services in
the second half of 2005. In addition, we are trialling a
variant of ADSL (asynchronous digital subscriber line)
broadband, known as ADSL2+, which may support
speeds of more than 20Mbit/s.
& With effect from April 2005, we reduced the wholesale
cost to service providers of our BT IPStream and BT
DataStream ADSL products by an average of 8% in
areas of high demand.
& We also announced details of the next 500 exchanges
to be upgraded to provide SDSL (synchronous digital
subscriber line) services. SDSL offers the same rate
upstream and downstream and is particularly suitable
for the SME market. By April 2006, we aim to SDSL-
enable 1,300 exchanges, covering more than two
thirds of UK businesses.
& During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we redesigned and
reduced the price for our LLU (local loop unbundling)
product (see Regulation, competition and prices –
Local Loop Unbundling)byupto 70% in a phased
series of price cuts which will, we believe, make it
easier for LLU operators to invest in broadband
infrastructure with conﬁdence. As at 31 March 2005,
LLU operators were providing service to 40,000 lines
from more than 600 exchanges, many of which were
multi-operator sites.
Broadband for consumers
As at 31 March 2005, in the highly competitive retail
market, our share of consumer and business DSL
broadband connections in the UK was 36% (1.75 million
connections).
BT is the UK’s leading service provider of broadband,
offering a family of broadband packages designed to meet
the diverse needs of our customers. Key packages include
BT Broadband Basic and BT Broadband which offer rapid,
always-on internet access; BT Yahoo! Broadband which
also provides a fuller range of beneﬁts, including multiple
email addresses, virus protection, personalised music,
parental controls, protection against unsolicited email and
evolving applications and content; and BT Communicator
with Yahoo! Messenger.
& We transformed our retail broadband offering, by
announcing the transfer of our customers to a new
super-fast standard, beginning in February 2005. Most
consumer and business customers will have their
broadband speed increased to up to 2Mbit/s – up to
four times faster than previous speeds – at no extra
cost. The introduction of 2Mbit/s as standard will
enable customers to get more from their broadband
link and paves the way for a range of new services.
& BT will also use broadband to make new services, such
as video on demand and interactive TV, available to
customers.
& In July 2004, we launched BT Communicator with
Yahoo! Messenger. This integrated software package,
downloadable from the internet, gives customers a
truly convergent, multi-media communications
experience, enabling them to manage all their home
communications – phone calls, emails, texts, instant
messaging and webcam – together in one place on
their PC.
Broadband for business customers
We believe that the introduction of 2Mbit/s ADSL
broadband as standard will help business customers
maximise the major opportunities offered by online
trading and teleworking.
BT Business Broadband remained the leading ISP for
SMEs in the UK. At the end of the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we
had over 340,000 BT Business Broadband customers and
were adding 250 a day. More than half opt for such value-
added services as the Internet Security Pack and the
Internet Business Pack.
& In January 2005, we created an online payments
business by bringing together BT Click&Buy and our
online card payment service, BT Buynet, which
currently process almost 17 million transactions a year
between them. The new business will offer an
extensive range of payment solutions to the rapidly
growing online retail market.
& BT Business Broadband Voice, launched in November
2004, gives small businesses throughout the UK access
to VOIP (voice over IP) services and enables them to
use their broadband connections to reduce costs for
multiple business lines. On average, BT Broadband
Voice offers customers savings of more than 60%
compared with second line rental.
Create convergent mobility solutions
In a convergent world, individuals and businesses
increasingly need to connect and communicate whenever
and wherever they happen to be, using whatever devices
they choose.
Our aim is to offer all our customers the right
combination of the quality, reliability, cost advantages
and bandwidth associated with ﬁxed-line communications,
and the convenience, personalisation and mobility
associated with mobile communications.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we launched BT Mobile as
an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) running over
the Vodafone network. Becoming an MVNO is
fundamental to building our mobility customer base,
driving the wireless broadband market and developing
and delivering compelling convergence propositions and
one converged customer experience.
Project Bluephone is a converged mobile service,
enabling customers to use a single device that can switch
seamlessly between ﬁxed and mobile networks. This will
provide customers with the convenience of mobile
combined with the cost and quality advantages of a ﬁxed-
line phone. We plan to launch Project Bluephone shortly.
We believe that a partnership strategy is fundamental
to our success and we are working hard through the
FMCA (Fixed Mobile Convergence Alliance) to develop
open industry standards and through the WBA (Wireless
Broadband Alliance) to drive Wi-Fi (public wireless
broadband) hotspot proliferation, global roaming and user
satisfaction.
Revenue in the mobility market in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year was £205 million, an increase of 107% on the 2004
ﬁnancial year.
As at 31 March 2005, BT Mobile had over 372,000
business and consumer connections.
Mobility for consumers
In the consumer mobility market our strategy is to build a
foundation for the delivery of added-value, ﬁxed/mobile
convergent solutions.
& In January 2005, we launched BT Mobile as an MVNO
with Vodafone in the consumer market. BT Mobile is
cost-effective for families, offering up to ﬁve additional
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 11 handsets. Other beneﬁts include free short calls from a
BT Mobile phone to a designated home number and a
single consolidated mobile bill.
Mobility for business customers
BT is a service provider in the business mobility market
with more than 185,000 business connections at 31 March
2005. We provide a range of managed mobile services to
UK and global customers who either outsource their
mobile communications entirely or rely on BT to provide
speciﬁc managed services.
& In November 2004, we launched our BT Mobile MVNO
business in the SME and corporate market, offering a
range of mobile services including a mobile VPN
service (BT Business Circle) and mobile conferencing.
& We are a leading UK provider of Wi-Fi services. BT
Openzone offers customers a high-speed, wireless
broadband connection over which they can access the
internet, send and receive emails with attachments
and connect to a corporate network. As at 31 March
2005, our customers had access to more than 7,500
hotspots throughout the UK and more than 20,000
globally.
Mobility for wholesale customers
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we continued to implement our
strategy in the UK wholesale mobile arena – to maximise
the volume and value of wireless trafﬁc by developing and
launching innovative products and services.
& For example, we launched Fixed Line Text – a fully
managed service that enables the exchange of SMS
messages between ﬁxed line and ﬁxed line, ﬁxed line
and mobile and mobile and ﬁxed line.
& In March 2005 we launched a mobile managed bulk
SMS, which enables customers to send and receive
multiple text messages via the internet to and from
their customers’ mobile telephones.
Defend our traditional business vigorously
We face continued challenges in our traditional markets
as a result of regulatory intervention, competition and a
shift in our customers’ buying patterns, as we provide
them with higher-speciﬁcation, high-value, new wave
products.
Total ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice call minutes in the UK market
as a whole declined by 3% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This
was driven by customers making use of alternatives such
as mobile calls, email, instant messaging, corporate
IPVPNs and VOIP.
However, the measurement of call minutes is less
important to BT as customer take-up of pricing packages
continues and we actively encourage the migration of
customers to new wave services such as broadband.
Traditional services for consumers
& On 1 July 2004, we abolished the standard rate and
switched all existing standard rate customers to BT
Together Option 1, offering them better value for
money and making it easier for them to compare our
prices with those of our competitors. We also reduced
the price of Option 1 by £1 a month, offering savings
to the ﬁve million customers who were already on this
option.
& BT Together Option 2, which offers free UK evening
and weekend calls, and BT Together Option 3, which
offers free UK daytime, evening and weekend calls,
were also signiﬁcant elements in our revenue defence
strategy in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
& In September 2004, we introduced CallMobile, a
discount package offering customers up to 40%
savings on all ﬁxed-to-mobile calls.
& During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we developed two new
products to help customers protect themselves against
internet dialler problems. BT Modem Protection is a
free software download, which will prevent a
customer’s computer dialling high-cost, premium rate
or international numbers. We have also developed an
early warning alert – in the form of a text or voice
message to their mobile or ﬁxed-line phone – for
customers whose bill rises signiﬁcantly above the usual
daily pattern. We can then put in place an immediate
premium rate bar on the line and/or suggest other
barring options. As at 31 March 2005, around one
million BT customers had signed up for one or more of
these barring services.
& We manage around 87,000 public payphones,
including more than 1,300 multimedia kiosks and
more than 1,400 textphones throughout the UK.
Although we remain committed to ensuring that public
payphones are available in communities throughout
the UK, future growth opportunities will focus on
maximising returns from existing sites and capabilities,
including e-kiosks and content services, as well as
hosting CCTV (closed circuit TV) facilities and mobile
antennae.
& Following our re-entry into the printed classiﬁed
directory market, the Phone Book continued to be
successful in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, with all 171
editions now including a new classiﬁed section. A new
milestone will be reached in mid-June 2005, from
which date all editions will include classiﬁed advertising
in colour.
Traditional services for business customers
& In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we made a number of
enhancements to our BT Business Plan. In May 2004,
in response to EU enlargement, we extended the
beneﬁts of BT Business Plan by including ten new
entrant countries in the 20 pence cap on calls to
Europe lasting less than one hour. In August 2004, we
extended BT Business Plan to cover all business
customers, irrespective of size or spend. And from
September 2004, we cut the cost of ﬁxed-to-mobile
calls by 25% to 30% and offered BT Business Plan
customers the chance to opt for a 30 pence cap on all
ﬁxed-to-mobile calls lasting less than one hour. At
31 March 2005, BT Business Plan had over 440,000
locations, up 67% on the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
& Our BT Local Business initiative helped to secure BT’s
position as a key player in the SME market. At the end
of the 2005 ﬁnancial year, BT Local Business was
active in 83 locations around the country, managing
£1.2 billion of annual billed turnover.
Traditional services for wholesale customers
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, despite average price
reductions of 7% and growing competitive pressure in the
UK market, wholesale revenues from traditional activities
in the UK grew by 1% overall. We continued to invest in
improvements to our processes and systems, reducing
both provision and repair times.
12 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review & We continued to develop our capability as a supplier of
network facilities management. For example, we are
providing maintenance support to the physical ﬁeld
and core switching elements of O2’s 3G network.
& As at 31 March 2005, our wholesale line rental product
had over one million end users, with revenues up
£51 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
& We have also enhanced our data connectivity portfolio
with the launch of a range of Ethernet (LAN) products
and higher bandwidth circuits. This has enabled us to
grow revenues from the provision of infrastructure to
other network providers.
& Product launches in the 2005 ﬁnancial year included
Wholesale Extension Service – a high-speed, point-to-
point data circuit providing a secure link between a
third party customer site and a communication
provider’s networks – and BT Enterprise Ethernet – a
low bandwidth variant of the MegaStream Ethernet
product, offering many of the characteristics of a
traditional private circuit, but with the added beneﬁt of
low-cost Ethernet interface.
Drive for cost leadership
We remain focused on ﬁnancial discipline and our cost
efﬁciency programmes achieved savings of around £400
million in the year. This has enabled us to invest in
growing our new wave activities. We aim to deliver at
least £300 million to £400 million of savings in each of
the next three years.
We aim to deliver this by focusing on the cost of
failure, complexity and duplication and by working
smarter. For example, at 31 March 2005 we had 6.2
million on-line relationships with customers through
bt.com and almost two million customers receiving e-bills.
We continue to benchmark ourselves against the best in
the industry and set targets accordingly.
Keep a relentless focus on improving customer
satisfaction
Reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25% a year over
three years, on a compound annual basis, to the 2005
ﬁnancial year was a key target in our drive to deliver the
highest levels of customer satisfaction. In the 2005
ﬁnancial year, for the third year in a row, all lines of
business reduced customer dissatisfaction levels. This
result is based on quantitative customer research
conducted by independent external agencies and
represents a group-wide reduction of 23% on a compound
annual basis over the past three years.
The quality of service we provide to our customers is
key to improving customer satisfaction. Much of our
training and development activity remains focused on
removing any barriers to the delivery of excellent
customer service and a high-quality customer experience.
Our core people engagement initiative is the my customer
programme, which aims to enable all BT people to deliver
great customer service through teamwork. Over 3,000
issues have been identiﬁed and resolved. More than
4,000 people are members of teams tasked with making
further improvements as part of the 2005 my customer
Challenge Cup.
Transform our network for the twenty-ﬁrst century
Our UK network today
BT has the most comprehensive communications network
in the UK, with 684 local and 135 trunk processor units,
more than 121 million kilometres of copper wire and more
than seven million kilometres of optical ﬁbre, and we have
the most extensive IP backbone network in the UK. The
network services we provide include Frame Relay, ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode) and IPVPN.
Our global reach
BT has one of the broadest IP-enabled networks in Europe
and our network-based services extend to and across
North and South America and the Asia Paciﬁc region, and
are delivered locally through interconnect and supply
agreements with regional carriers.
As at 31 March 2005, our ﬂagship MPLS product
provided coverage and support to 72 countries from over
1,000 points of presence. MPLS revenues grew by 48%
during the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Global customer service is provided via service and
network management centres around the world, 24 hours
a day, seven days a week.
Transforming our networks, systems and services for
the twenty-ﬁrst century
Our 21CN programme will lead to the simpliﬁcation of
BT’s complex multiple networks, making it easier for us,
and other operators who interconnect with BT’s network,
to deliver compelling converged services.
The 21CN programme has three broad goals:
& to enhance the service experience, ﬂexibility and value
we provide to all our customers;
& to accelerate the delivery of innovative new products
and services to market; and
& to reduce costs radically.
Technical trials began in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. For
example, we launched a voice transformation trial,
moving voice trafﬁc from the traditional PSTN (public
switched telecommunications network) onto an IP
network.
We made signiﬁcant progress towards completing the
detailed technical and architectural designs to support the
implementation of 21CN.
In April 2005, we announced the preferred suppliers
that we expect will help to build and implement the
21CN. This was the culmination of two years of
discussions and negotiations with over 300 potential
technology suppliers and is one of the largest
procurement programmes ever undertaken in the
communications industry. The eight preferred suppliers
chosen are: Alcatel, Ciena, Cisco, Ericsson, Fujitsu,
Huawei, Lucent and Siemens. We expect to conclude
contractual discussions with these preferred suppliers in
summer 2005.
A programme of industry consultation – Consult21 –
was launched in the 2005 ﬁnancial year to promote a
shared understanding with industry of the 21CN vision
and the progress we are making, giving our wholesale
customers an opportunity to input and inﬂuence its
development.
Motivate our people and live the BT values
Our customers have a right to expect that we will
understand their needs and live our brand values. This
presents the 102,100 people employed by BT at 31 March
2005 with opportunities to develop innovative solutions,
generate new business, drive efﬁciencies, and experience
personal growth.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 13 Our vision is of high-performing, engaged and motivated
people who can make a difference for customers,
shareholders, the company and themselves. Only by living
our values – trustworthy, helpful, straightforward,
inspiring and heart – will we deliver our strategy, keep our
promises to our customers, seize new opportunities in
new markets and re-invent our traditional business.
Developing leaders
The quality of leadership in the company is key to the
successful delivery of our strategy for transformation and
growth and we have updated and reﬁned our approach to
using selection agencies for key posts, while the core
leadership development programme, introduced in 2003,
continues to drive our management development
initiatives.
Engaging and motivating our people
Our annual employee attitude survey was conducted most
recently in February 2005.
Among the key results were that 89% of our people
have a clear understanding of how their work contributes
to BT’s success, and seven out of ten employees are
willing to try new ways of doing things.
The survey generates around 5,000 feedback reports
for managers and their teams across the business, helping
to promote effective team working.
Employees are kept informed about our business
through a wide range of communications channels,
including our online news service, monthly newspaper,
regular email bulletins and senior management web chats
and web cast brieﬁngs.
In the UK, two main trade unions are recognised by
the company. In continental Europe, we work closely with
the works councils, both on an operational basis and as
strategic stakeholders.
Rewarding and recognising achievement
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we introduced a new reward
framework for our managers. Salary ranges are now
aligned with the going rate for equivalent jobs across a
range of comparable organisations, geographies and skill
sets. This ensures we remain competitive, and are able to
recruit and retain the people we need.
We also continued to provide our employees with
opportunities to acquire a stake in the company. Under
the BT Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP), BT can
provide free shares to employees and, in addition,
employees can purchase shares in the company from their
pre-tax salaries. In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, £11 million
was allocated to provide free shares to employees under
the ESIP. Employees outside the UK receive a cash
payment equivalent to the value of the shares. This
allocation of proﬁts was linked to the achievement of
corporate performance measures determined by the
Board. In addition, employees can buy shares at a
discount under our savings-related share option plans.
Over 98% of eligible employees participate in one or
more of these plans.
Pensions
Most of our employees are members of the BT Pension
Scheme or the BT Retirement Plan, both of which are
controlled by independent trustees. The BT Pension
Scheme was closed to new members on 31 March 2001.
The majority of new employees are eligible to join the BT
Retirement Plan.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people is of paramount
importance. We have a zero tolerance of workplace
accidents, and have reduced the number of reportable
employee accidents from 146 cases per 10,000
employees in the 2001 ﬁnancial year to 61 cases per
10,000 employees in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we launched the Health and
Wellbeing Forum to promote ways of working that help
people balance the demands of their work and personal
lives, as well as focusing on speciﬁc healthcare issues. We
also developed an in-house process to help BT people
manage stress.
Learning now and for the future
Our successful company-wide re-accreditation to Investors
in People in February 2005, ﬁrst achieved in 1998,
demonstrates our continuing commitment to the effective
alignment of our communications, training and
development with our business strategy.
To improve the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our
training delivery, we conducted a strategic review of our
training suppliers in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, reducing
them to a core group of 36. This will contribute to year-
on-year savings of at least £3.4 million.
The development opportunities available to our people
range from one-to-one coaching, using a combination of
internal and external professional coaches, to the BT-
sponsored MBA programme, which has produced 54
graduates in the past three years.
Embedding ﬂexibility and diversity
The changing nature of the markets in which we operate,
our focus on cost leadership and our investment in new
services have impacted the shape of our permanent
workforce.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, 3,903 (2004 – 2,287)
people joined BT, natural attrition was running at 2.6%
(2004 – 2.4%) and, in the UK, 2,685 (2004 – 4,814)
people left BT under our voluntary paid leaver package.
We are committed to helping our people optimise their
work/life balance. At the end of March 2005, for example,
more than 8,900 people were working mainly from home.
We continue to create a working environment that
actively supports all our employees – regardless of gender,
race, sexual orientation, disability or age.
Research and development and IT support
Through our IT division, BT Exact, we offer the services of
thousands of IT professionals with knowledge of leading-
edge network design and IT systems and application
development, together with skills in innovation, change
management and IT operations.
Over the last year, we have transformed our approach
to internal and external systems development through the
establishment of 90-day design, development and delivery
cycles, accelerating our ability to deliver systems which
support product development and all our customers to
much tighter timescales and much higher levels of ‘right
ﬁrst time’ delivery. We are also developing new high-
quality online ways for customers to deal with us, in an
intuitive and comprehensive manner.
14 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review The GCTO (Group Chief Technology Ofﬁce) sets and
drives the innovation and technology strategy for BT.
GCTO includes a global technology intelligence scouting
unit, teams focused on innovative new wave service
opportunities, an innovation design and media team,
strategic technology analysis units, a network and systems
architecture team and world-class research and venturing
facilities in Adastral Park (England) and Malaysia.
The work undertaken by GCTO is part of BT’s £257
million investment in research and development in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. This compares with £334 million and
£380 million invested in the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial
years, respectively. We continue to focus our innovation
work on key areas which support our business and
technology strategies, ﬁling 109 new patent applications
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year and maintaining a total patent
portfolio of 7,400 patents and applications. Among the
awards won by our technology research team was the
British Computing Society’s IT Developer of the Year.
BT is a limited partner in the independent corporate
venturing partnership, NVP Brightstar, which generates
value by launching key innovations as new high-
technology businesses.
Property
At 31 March 2005, BT occupied approximately 6,600
properties, located principally in the UK. Most of this
property portfolio is owned by Telereal Group, a 50/50
joint venture between Land Securities Trillium and William
Pears Group.
The majority of these properties are specialised
operational buildings. They mainly house exchange
equipment and are needed as part of BT’s continuing
activities. Other, general purpose, properties consist
chieﬂy of ofﬁces, depots and computer centres.
Our property strategy is to continue to reduce costs, at
the same time as increasing usage and income
generation.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we sublet an additional
21,000sqm of ofﬁce space, vacated 158,000sqm of space
ready for disposal and successfully disposed of Mondial
House in London for £51 million.
Regulation, competition and prices
The commercial environment in the UK and in the
countries in which BT operates is increasingly competitive
and dynamic. However, we remain subject to extensive
regulation, particularly in the UK, which can materially
affect the way in which we carry out our business. We also
use inputs, such as networks and services from other
regulated operators, largely outside the UK, and the
availability and price of these inputs may change from
time to time, which in turn affects our business.
Regulation in the UK
It is our policy to be fully compliant with the regulatory
framework in which we operate. During the 2005 ﬁnancial
year, we continued to strengthen our compliance
activities and, in addition, we have worked closely with
compliance professionals in the telecommunications and
other regulated industries in the UK to establish best
practice. We have been in contact with European
telecommunications companies with the intention of
sharing ideas and best practice and bringing
improvements to the UK market. Our compliance policy
remains focused on ensuring that we continue to meet
the obligations imposed by, or under, the UK’s
Communications Act 2003 (the Communications Act) and
the Competition Act 1998 (the Competition Act) while
competing fairly and vigorously within the rules. We
publish an annual compliance report which can be found
in our social and environment report at www.bt.com/

Ofcom
The UK regulatory environment changed materially in July
2003, when the Communications Act came into force,
bringing in a new regulator, the Ofﬁce of Communications
(Ofcom), and a new regulatory framework for electronic
communications networks and services.
Ofcom was set up as a result of the increasing
convergence between telecommunications, broadcasting
and radio, to provide a single, seamless approach to
regulation across the whole converging marketplace. It
amalgamated the roles of ﬁve former regulatory agencies:
the Director General of Telecommunications (Oftel), the
Independent Television Commission, the Broadcasting
Standards Commission, the Radio Authority and the
Radiocommunications Agency.
Ofcom is headed by a board consisting of a chairman,
executive and non-executive members. Currently, the
chairman is Lord Currie and the chief executive is Stephen
Carter.
Ofcom has a wide range of general and speciﬁc duties
laid down in the Communications Act. Below is a
summary of those duties and functions of particular
relevance to BT’s activities:
& the principal duty to further the interests of citizens in
relation to communications matters and, secondly, to
further the interests of consumers, where appropriate,
by promoting competition. In doing so, Ofcom must
secure, among other things, the availability of a wide
range of electronic communications services in the UK;
& the duty to have regard to the principles under which
its regulatory activities should be transparent,
accountable, proportionate, consistent and
appropriately targeted;
& the duty to review regulatory burdens on a regular
basis and ensure that they do not involve the
imposition or maintenance of unnecessary burdens;
and
& the functions of setting conditions of entitlement (see
Regulatory conditions), and enforcing those
conditions (see Enforcement). Ofcom’s decisions are
subject to appeal on the merits (see Appeals).
In carrying out its duties, Ofcom must consider
promoting competition and the use of effective
self-regulation, encouraging investment and innovation,
and encouraging the availability and use of high-speed
data services (including broadband).
Regulatory conditions
Under the new framework, based on 2003 EU Directives,
providers may no longer be required to obtain licences
before offering telecommunications services. Individual
licences, such as that granted to BT in 1984, no longer
exist. Instead, there is a general authorisation for the
provision of electronic communications networks and
services.
Regulation is applied through separate sets of
conditions made by Ofcom, of which some apply to all
relevant communications providers. Others are imposed
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 15 individually on particular providers which, following a
review of the relevant markets, are found to have
‘Signiﬁcant Market Power’ (SMP) or are designated as
‘Universal Service Providers’. Other general obligations
are set out in the Communications Act. The general and
speciﬁc obligations that form BT’s regulatory environment
are described below.
Conditions applying to all providers of electronic
communications networks or services
General conditions
The foundation of the new regulatory framework is the set
of general obligations referred to in the Communications
Act as ‘General Conditions’. These apply to all providers
of electronic communications networks or services,
including ‘systemless’ service providers and internet
service providers. These conditions are mainly concerned
with consumer protection, but also address matters such
as general access and interconnection obligations,
standards, emergency planning and numbering. In
addition, a separate condition has been set regulating the
provision of premium rate services.
Electronic Communications Code conditions
The Electronic Communications Code deals with powers
to carry out streetworks and similar activities for the
purposes of providing networks and its application is
subject to conditions made by the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry.
Other general obligations
Other obligations corresponding to former licence
conditions under the old framework now apply directly
through provisions of the Communications Act. These are:
& the payment of administrative charges (broadly the
equivalent of licence fees under the old framework);
and
& the provision of information to Ofcom when required
to do so.
Conditions applying to BT only
Universal Service Obligation conditions
BT has been designated as the supplier of Universal
Service for the UK excluding the Hull area, where
Kingston Communications is the designated provider. The
services covered by the Universal Service Obligation (USO)
are deﬁned in an Order issued by the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry. Our basic obligation is to provide
a single narrowband connection to the ﬁxed telephone
network, but additional USO conditions relate to issues
such as schemes for consumers with special social needs
and the provision of payphone services.
Ofcom is currently reviewing the USO. The review is
focused on delivering the current Universal Service
arrangements and is being carried out alongside Ofcom’s
Strategic Review of Telecommunications (see Other
signiﬁcant changes and issues – Strategic Review of
Telecommunications) which looks at longer-term
Universal Service issues.
Signiﬁcant Market Power conditions
The Communications Act, implementing the EU Directives
on which the regulatory framework is based, requires
Ofcom to deﬁne and analyse markets (‘market review’)
and to determine whether any communications provider
has SMP, which is aligned with the competition law
concept of dominance. Economic regulation can only be
imposed following a market review and ﬁnding of SMP.
In markets where Ofcom ﬁnds that a provider has
SMP, it must impose appropriate additional obligations in
the form of SMP conditions as speciﬁed in the
Communications Act. These may include obligations to
meet reasonable requests to supply certain services to
other communications providers, not to unduly
discriminate, and to notify price changes. In some cases,
additional obligations relating to, for example, price
control and regulatory accounting have also been
imposed.
The market reviews relevant to ﬁxed
telecommunications that Oftel and Ofcom have
conducted are listed below. For each review, the markets
in which BT has been determined to have SMP are shown.
All references to UK markets, except wholesale trunk
segments and broadband conveyance, exclude the Hull
area.
& Fixed narrowband retail markets in the UK:
residential analogue lines, residential ISDN2 lines,
business analogue lines, business ISDN2 lines, ISDN
30 lines, residential local calls, residential national
calls, residential calls to mobile, residential operator
assistance calls, residential international direct-dialled
calls, business local calls, business national calls,
business calls to mobile, business operator assistance
calls.
& Fixed narrowband wholesale markets in the UK:
residential analogue lines, residential ISDN2 lines,
business analogue lines, business ISDN2 lines, ISDN
30 lines, call origination, local-tandem conveyance and
transit, inter-tandem conveyance and transit, single
transit.
& Fixed geographic call termination markets in the UK:
ﬁxed geographic call termination provided by BT and
other members of the BT group of companies.
& Wholesale international services markets:
wholesale international services on 108 country routes.
& Wholesale unmetered narrowband internet termination
markets:
BT was not found to have SMP in any market
considered in this market review.
& Retail leased lines, symmetric broadband origination
and trunk segments markets:
retail traditional interface leased lines at speeds up to
and including 8Mbit/s; wholesale traditional interface
symmetric broadband origination at speeds up to and
including 8Mbit/s; wholesale traditional interface
symmetric broadband origination at speeds above
8Mbit/s and up to and including 155Mbit/s; wholesale
alternative interface symmetric broadband origination
at all bandwidths. Wholesale trunk segments at all
bandwidths.
& Wholesale broadband access markets in the UK:
asymmetric broadband origination; broadband
conveyance.
& Wholesale local access markets in the UK:
wholesale local access services.
The Communications Act allows Ofcom to review markets
for end-user apparatus and impose conditions on any
provider designated with SMP. The conditions which may be
imposed are limited to conditions relating to accounting
separation, cost accounting, and price control for hardwired
telephone rental charges. Ofcom has decided that BT’s price
controls in respect of rental of hardwired telephone
16 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review apparatus, brought forward from the old regulatory regime,
should be removed and replaced by written undertakings
rather than by SMP apparatus conditions.
The Act obliges Ofcom to carry out further analyses of
markets which have been reviewed at such intervals as it
considers appropriate. In the Phase 2 consultation
document in the Strategic Review of Telecommunications,
Ofcom has made proposals for a number of market
reviews over the coming years. Ofcom is currently
carrying out a review of the Number Translation Services
(NTS) Call Termination market.
Enforcement
The Communications Act sets out the enforcement
process to be followed in relation to breaches of
conditions. Where a breach is not remedied following
preliminary notiﬁcation by Ofcom, Ofcom may take
legally enforceable enforcement action and/or impose a
penalty of up to 10% of relevant turnover. In addition, a
person who suffers loss or damage as a result of a breach
may, with Ofcom’s consent, sue for damages, and, in the
case of serious and repeated contraventions, Ofcom may
restrict or suspend the provider’s entitlement to provide
electronic communications networks or services.
The Communications Act contains similar enforcement
procedures (though with much smaller penalties) for
matters such as non-compliance with a request for
information or non-payment of an administrative charge.
Appeals
One of the main features of the new regulatory framework
is that full appeals on the merits are now available against
regulatory decisions. Consequently, appeals can be made
against matters such as:
& the making of SMP, SMP apparatus and USO
determinations/designations;
& the setting, modiﬁcation and revocation of conditions;
& enforcement actions, including the imposition of a
penalty.
Any person affected by a decision may appeal to the
Competition Appeals Tribunal. However, the Tribunal
must refer any matters in any appeal relating to price
controls on to the Competition Commission for
determination.
In November 2003, Ofcom issued a notiﬁcation ﬁnding
that BT was acting in contravention of the General
Conditions by using customer-speciﬁc information
acquired from other communications providers in
connection with the provision of Carrier Pre-Selection
(CPS). In May 2004, Ofcom issued a second notiﬁcation
ﬁnding that BT was similarly contravening the General
Conditions in relation to Wholesale Line Rental (WLR). BT
appealed both notiﬁcations, and the Tribunal adjourned
the WLR appeal pending the outcome of the CPS appeal.
In December 2004, the Tribunal dismissed BT’s CPS
appeal and upheld that notiﬁcation (although this was
subject to a clariﬁcation of the deﬁnition of ‘marketing
activity’ as set out in the notiﬁcation). Subsequently,
Ofcom withdrew the contested WLR notiﬁcation,
indicating that it would issue a new notiﬁcation in light of
the CPS decision. The Tribunal has suspended the WLR
appeal pending the new notiﬁcation, which is expected
shortly.
Competition
The competitive environment
The UK telecommunications market is fully open and
highly competitive.
Although it is some years since the
Telecommunications Act 1984 abolished the monopoly of
the former statutory corporation, British
Telecommunications, obligations placed on BT, including
pricing regulation, network access, non-discrimination,
the provision of universal service and cost accounting/
accounting separation, are generally more onerous than
for other providers of electronic communications networks
and services.
Competition and the UK economy
The growth of mobile over the past decade has been a
major factor in shaping the UK’s telecommunications
landscape. Mobile now accounts for approximately 30% of
total UK voice minutes. BT’s market share of the total UK
voice market, including mobile, is estimated to have fallen
by about 4% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year to approximately
40%.
BT’s share of the residential ﬁxed-voice market, as
measured by the volume of ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice minutes,
declined to an estimated 64% for the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
compared with an estimated 70% and 74% for the 2004
and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively. CPS has been one
of the contributors to the loss of share in the ﬁxed-voice
market. We estimate that BT had 42% of the market for
business ﬁxed-voice calls in the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
compared with an estimated 44% and 47% in the 2004
and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Estimated market shares are based on our actual
minutes, market data provided by Ofcom and an
extrapolation of the historical market trends.
We also estimate that BT supplied approximately 79%
of exchange lines in the UK at the end of the 2005
ﬁnancial year, compared with 82% and 83% in the 2004
and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The growth in cable operators’ networks in the UK has
historically had an adverse effect on BT’s share of the
residential market. Current and future wholesale line
rental arrangements will allow BT’s ﬁxed-line customers to
move PSTN lines to other operators which are expected to
be the source of more competition in the future.
Since 2000, we have been required to provide other
operators with the use of the lines connecting BT’s local
exchanges to our customers and to other operators to
install equipment in our exchanges (see Local Loop
Unbundling).
Competition Law
In addition to telecommunications industry regulation, BT
is subject to general competition law including the
Competition Act in the UK and the competition law
provisions of the EC Treaty.
UK and European Union competition law both prohibit
anti-competitive agreements, concerted practices and the
abuse of a dominant market position. In the application of
UK and EU competition law to electronic communications,
Ofcom has concurrent investigatory and enforcement
powers with the Ofﬁce of Fair Trading (OFT). The EC has
jurisdiction to apply the EU rules. Breach of the relevant
prohibitions in the UK or EU rules could lead to ﬁnes of up
to 10% of worldwide turnover in a company’s previous
ﬁnancial year and/or result in claims for damages in
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 17 national courts. A company may also be ordered to cease
an infringing activity. There is an independent mechanism
for appeals to the Competition Appeal Tribunal against
decisions taken by Ofcom or the OFT and to the European
Court of First Instance against EC decisions.
In July 2005, the Tribunal is due to hear Wanadoo’s
appeal against Ofcom’s November 2003 ﬁnding that BT
had not infringed the prohibition on abuse of a dominant
position in relation to the pricing of BT Openworld’s
consumer broadband products. Separately, in August
2004, Ofcom claimed that BT had abused a dominant
position in relation to its pricing of consumer broadband
products. BT has responded, arguing that its pricing does
not amount to an abuse of dominance. Ofcom has
indicated that it will issue either a new statement of
objections or a decision of non-infringement in relation to
this case, in June 2005.
Enterprise Act
The Enterprise Act 2002 aims to give more independence
to the competition authorities, to reform insolvency and
bankruptcy laws and to tackle trading practices that harm
consumers.
The key provisions of the Enterprise Act, including the
new cartel offence and the section on director
disqualiﬁcation, entered into force on 20 June 2003. It is
now a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment or a
ﬁne, or both, to engage in cartel activity. In addition,
where companies infringe UK or EU competition law,
company directors can be disqualiﬁed from being
concerned in the management of a company for a
maximum period of 15 years. The Enterprise Act also
gives the OFT power to make a market investigation
reference to the UK’s Competition Commission where the
OFT has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any
feature of a market prevents, restricts or distorts
competition in the supply or acquisition of goods or
services in the UK. Once the OFT exercises its power to
make such a reference, the Competition Commission is
required to decide whether any feature of the market
prevents, restricts or distorts competition (‘adverse
effect’) and, if so, to take action to remedy the adverse
effects. Market investigations are intended to address
competition issues in markets as a whole and not merely
the behaviour of individual players. In relation to
electronic communications markets, Ofcom has
concurrent powers with the OFT to make a market
investigation reference.
Pricing regulation
Fixed network
We are subject to price controls on our ﬁxed network
services in the UK at two levels: retail and network. Fixed
network competitors are generally not subject to direct
price controls, although there are some controls on
mobile network operators.
Retail price controls
We are subject to two sets of UK retail price controls, one on
certain public-switched telephony call charges and
exchange line rentals, and one on certain private circuits.
Each price control is based on a formula calculated by
reference to the UK Retail Prices Index (RPI) and a factor, X.
For services covered by the controls, the weighted
average of base prices cannot increase in each year
beginning 1 August by more than the annual change in
RPI minus X. The current retail price control for public-
switched telephony, applying from August 2002 to July
2006, is RPI minus RPI (ie the value of X is RPI and prices
cannot increase). It is measured on services used by the
lowest 80% of our residential customers classiﬁed by bill
size. From August 2002, the services covered by the
control were extended to include BT’s share of the
revenue for calls to all four mobile networks, replacing the
previous separate control on BT for calls to Vodafone and
O2. The price control formula and our performance
against the formula are set out in the table below.
Under the price controls for private circuits that
applied from August 1997 to July 2001, prices for
domestic analogue and low-speed digital private circuits
could not increase by more than the change in the RPI in
any year. For all retail analogue private circuits and
8Mbit/s digital private circuits, BT has also given an
assurance to adhere to a RPI+0% price cap from 30 June
2003 until 30 June 2006.
As part of the review of price controls in 2002, BT was
required to provide a cost-based wholesale line rental
product to other service providers at a regulated price and
in a way that does not unduly discriminate between BT’s
retail business and service providers. This product,
Wholesale Access, has been available from BT since
1 September 2002. Further consultation by Ofcom
resulted in an enhanced wholesale access product being
available from 29 March 2004. When Ofcom notiﬁes BT
that it is satisﬁed in relation to the introduction and
provision of Wholesale Access, it may direct that the retail
price control be adjusted to RPI+0%.

18 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review Network Charge Control
We operate under interconnection agreements with most
other operators. Our charges for a range of interconnect
services are controlled by Ofcom, under the Network
Charge Control (NCC) regime. The current NCC period
began on 1 October 2001 and will last until 30 September
2005. The controls are designed to ensure that our
charges are reasonably derived from costs, plus an
appropriate return on capital employed. Depending on
the degree of competition for these services, charges are
cap-controlled each year by RPI minus X (where X ranges
from 7.5% to 13%) for services Ofcom considers unlikely
to become competitive in the near future and safeguard
cap-controlled (ie no increases above RPI during any
relevant year of the overall control period) for services
likely to become competitive. Those services considered
fully competitive are not subject to direct charge controls.
The main network price caps are listed below:

Safeguard cap 0 30 Sept 2005
Interconnect speciﬁc 8.25 30 Sept 2005
Local exchange FRIACO 7.5 30 Sept 2005
BT must publish a notiﬁcation to Ofcom and other
operators if we intend to amend existing charges or to
offer new services. Notice periods range from 28 to 90
days for regulated services, depending on the degree to
which they are judged to be competitive.
In 2004, Ofcom began a review of the NCC, to
determine the controls to apply from 1 October 2005. On
23 March 2005, Ofcom issued a consultation document
(‘Review of BT’s Network Charge Controls’) proposing a
further four-year NCC regime, with a review of BT’s
market power in two speciﬁc markets (deregulation being
proposed for one of these markets). Ofcom is also
proposing some re-deﬁnitions of basket services, and
consulting on a range of values of X for these services
(reﬂecting the fact that some of the relevant factors in
setting X are yet to be resolved). We will respond to
Ofcom’s proposals by 1 June; Ofcom is expected to
publish a statement by the end of July 2005.
The various services and proposed ranges of X within
Ofcom’s 23 March consultation document are listed
below:

Single tandem FRIACO 8.5 to 12.25
Inter-tandem conveyance / transit No control (propose

Number portability
The number portability charge control runs from 1 August
2002 until 31 July 2006. The charges are controlled by a
RPI minus X formula, with X set at 5%. This control is not
contained in an SMP condition, but in a non-binding
undertaking given by BT to Ofcom. Under the new
regime, General Condition 18 requires all providers to
offer number portability, among other things, on
reasonable terms and for charges to be cost-orientated.
Wholesale access charge control
The charges for wholesale access services (both analogue
and digital) are also subject to price control. The charges
for the line rental (residential and business products), line
transfer and new line installations have been set by Ofcom
and are subject to a price control of RPI minus 2%,
effective from 1 September 2002 for four years. The
control applies to the aggregate of all charges (rental,
transfer and installation) as well as to line transfers
separately. We are also under an obligation to notify
Ofcom and service providers if we intend to amend
existing charges or introduce new charges. Notice periods
range from 28 to 90 days, depending on the speciﬁc
service.
On 28 November 2003, Oftel published its statement
on the ﬁxed narrowband wholesale exchange line market.
This statement contained new obligations on BT to
provide Wholesale Business ISDN2 Line Rental with cost-
oriented prices and to provide residential ISDN2 and
ISDN30. We launched the required products but the price
level was referred to Ofcom as a dispute by Energis on
25 October 2004. On 2 February 2005, Ofcom
determined that BT’s price was set at too high a level and
that BT must refund Energis an amount for each line
rented during the period from 23 November 2003 to
30 September 2004.
Additionally, during the year a small-scale consultation
was carried out which aligned the price control formulae
for Wholesale Access, NCC and PPC (Partial Private
Circuits) but this did not affect the Wholesale Access
control in a material way.
Partial Private Circuit Charge Control
PPCs are leased lines that BT sells to other network
operators. On 1 October 2004, Ofcom introduced a PPC
charge control to replace the annual determinations
previously carried out by Oftel. The control arises from
regulation established in the Leased Lines Market Review
(LLMR) and deals with PPC terminating segments (the
‘access’ part of the leased line network).
The control is a four year RPI-X type control with three
separate baskets:
& Low Bandwidth Basket (RPI-4%);
& High Bandwidth Basket (RPI-6.5%); and
& Equipment Basket (RPI-8.9%).
Charges prior to the control were maintained as
starting charges and BT is required to make price
reductions each year which comply with the controls.
However, control formulae are constructed to allow BT
some discretion in the timing of the price changes and the
ability to meet the control by re-balancing different
elements of the PPC charges.
PPCs are also subject to obligations to notify operators
and Ofcom if we intend to revise charges or other
contractual conditions. The notiﬁcation periods range
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 19 from same day to 90 calendar days depending on the
nature of the change.
Non-UK regulation
BT must comply with the regulatory regimes in the
countries in which we operate or wish to operate. The
obligations placed on us and our suppliers continue to be
relevant to our business models and have cost
implications for our end-user services. These rules are
generally applied by national regulatory authorities
operating under a government mandate. The decisions of
these bodies can have a material impact on our business
models from time to time.
European Union
The degree to which the European Directives have been
implemented varies by country. The general move
towards the new regime continues in the original EU15
member states before enlargement, although in some of
these countries, the implementation of the directives is
progressing slowly. In most, but not all, of these EU15
member states, the primary legislation that will enable the
introduction of the new regulatory regime is going
through, or has been through, the legislative process. The
processes of identiﬁcation of operators with SMP and the
subsequent setting of regulatory obligations on those
operators are mostly in progress. The EU10 accession
member states are in the early stages of implementing
these directives.
BT will not have universal service obligations outside
the UK, although in certain member states we may be
required to contribute towards an industry fund to pay for
the cost of meeting universal service obligations in those
countries. Any ﬁndings that BT has SMP in any non-UK
market are not expected to have a material impact. We
are lobbying the European Commission and other EU
bodies with responsibility for electronic communications
for consistent and timely implementation of the new
directives and associated regulation.
The availability of cost-oriented access products from
regulated incumbents remains an important element of
our strategy around the world and we continue to press
these incumbents, their national regulatory authorities
and at the EU level for such access. Availability varies by
country.
The European Commission is formally investigating the
way the UK Government has set BT’s property rates and
those paid by Kingston Communications. The
Commission is examining whether the Government has
complied with EC Treaty rules on state aid in assessing
BT’s rates. BT’s rates were set by the Valuation Ofﬁce
after lengthy discussions based on well established
principles in a transparent process. In BT’s view, any
allegation of state aid is groundless and BT is conﬁdent
that the Government will demonstrate the fairness of the
UK ratings system. A ﬁnding against the UK Government
could result in BT having to repay any state aid it may be
determined to have received.
Rest of the world
The vast majority of the markets in which we operate
around the world are regulated, and in the majority of
these we have to obtain licences or other authorisations
and comply with applicable conditions. The degree to
which these markets are liberalised varies widely: while
many are fully open to competition, others place
restrictions on market entrants, such as the extent to
which foreign ownership is permitted, or restrictions on
the services which may be provided. The extent to which
the national incumbent operator is effectively regulated
also varies considerably. BT’s ability to compete fully in
some countries is therefore constrained.
Other signiﬁcant changes and issues
Strategic Review of Telecommunications
Ofcom is carrying out a Strategic Review of the UK
telecommunications sector (the ‘Strategic Review’). The
ﬁrst consultation document was published in April 2004
and the second in November 2004. The Strategic Review
is comprehensive and wide ranging. It aims to assess the
options for enhancing value and choice in the UK
telecommunications sector while having regard to
investment and innovation.
The ﬁrst consultation document focused on ﬁve
fundamental issues: the key attributes of a well-
functioning telecoms market for citizen-consumers; the
achievement of sustainable competition; the possibility of
a signiﬁcant reduction in regulation; incentivising efﬁcient
and timely investment in next-generation networks; and
the relevance of the issue of structural or operational
separation of BT.
The second consultation set out three options for the
outcome of the Strategic Review. These were as follows:
& Option 1 – full deregulation, with reliance on
competition law to address competition concerns;
& Option 2 – a market investigation reference to the
Competition Commission under the Enterprise Act to
determine whether any feature of the market prevents
or distorts competition in the supply of
communications services. One possible result of such
an investigation could be enforced separation of BT;
and
& Option 3 – delivery by BT to its competitors of ‘real
equality of access’ to its networks, with the onus on BT
to bring forward prompt and clear proposals.
Option 3, which was supported by most of the
respondents to Ofcom’s Phase 2 consultation, would
entail introducing more effective regulation focused on
enduring economic bottlenecks. Ofcom also proposed
that when BT had delivered equality of access in these
areas, it would withdraw many additional layers of
regulation from wholesale and retail markets. In our
response to the Phase 2 consultation, BT put forward
proposals for a package of measures which could form the
basis for a new regulatory settlement. Under these
proposals, we would:
& make signiﬁcant organisational changes that
demonstrated our commitment to transparency and
exemplary governance, including the creation within
BT of a new Access Services Division based on the
assets and people associated with the access network,
from the customer’s premises to the main distribution
frame in the local exchange;
& create an Equality of Access Board to monitor the
performance of the Access Services Division and to
oversee delivery of equality of access by BT;
& introduce equality of access in a phased and effective
manner;
& ensure that BT’s Wholesale Access product is
demonstrably ﬁt for purpose with effective operational
performance and an increased margin enabling rapid
consumer take-up;
20 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review & keep Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) at the heart of BT’s
wholesale broadband portfolio, building on the work
already done on industrialising LLU operations and
taking forward our previous commitment to cut the
price of fully unbundled loops;
& make sure the rest of BT’s broadband products keep
pace so that all service providers have a wide choice of
offerings to suit their business models;
& agree on the enduring economic bottlenecks (assets
that are not replicable in the medium term) and work
to ensure that regulation is focused around them; and
& set out the ground rules that underpin the
development of BT’s 21st Century Network.
Equally, as part of this package, BT would need Ofcom
to:
& commit to rapid, signiﬁcant and ongoing deregulation
in certain key markets;
& create a stable investment environment, with the
Strategic Review and the associated studies concluded
successfully, so that investors are able to invest with
certainty; and
& enable BT to compete on a level playing ﬁeld with
other operators in the market.
Cost of copper
Ofcom issued two consultation documents, in late 2004
and early 2005, concerning the valuation of the local
access network assets, with the intention of issuing a
statement in summer 2005. The review considered the
valuation of the copper local access circuits and the duct
through which these circuits pass. Ofcom considers the
local access network to be a ‘bottleneck’ (meaning that
other ﬁxed line telecommunications operators wishing to
serve the majority of UK customers need to use BT’s local
access network to do so), and wishes to ensure customers
continue to be charged fair prices for the use of these
assets. The regulator considered alternative ways of
valuing these assets, and Ofcom anticipated that it would
conclude that the assets should be revalued at a lower
level. Such an outcome would result in lower wholesale
charges for the use of local access network assets.
Cost of capital
During its review of the PPC price control, Ofcom
concluded that it should amend the allowed rate of return
it should use, based on an updated calculation of BT’s
overall cost of capital. The September 2004 statement
used an allowed rate of return of 13.0% (on a pre-tax,
nominal basis), speciﬁcally for PPC prices, compared with
the 13.5% rate that the regulator had previously allowed
in other price controls. In January 2005, Ofcom issued a
consultation document that examined various aspects of
risk and reward, including aspects of the allowed return
that should be used by Ofcom in setting regulated prices.
The consultation proposed to review the calculation of
BT’s overall cost of capital, and also considered whether
to allow different rates of return for different parts of BT.
The regulator proposed to reduce BT’s overall cost of
capital, from the general current rate of 13.5%, and also
suggested that the local access network was less risky
than the rest of BT, and BT should therefore be allowed a
lower rate of return in regulated prices. Such an outcome
would result in lower wholesale charges for local access
network services.
Radio base station backhaul circuits and wholesale
extension services
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we also launched two new
products in line with regulations contained in the Leased
Lines Market Review:
& RBS (radio base station backhaul circuits) – these are
circuits provided by BT to enable a mobile
communications provider to connect a radio base
station to its mobile switching centre; and
& WES (wholesale extension services) – these are circuits
provided over ﬁbre, typically using Ethernet
technology, to enable a telecoms operator to connect a
customer site to its own switching site.
Neither product is currently part of a price control but
Ofcom has imposed various regulatory conditions on the
products, including notiﬁcation and cost orientation
obligations.
Local Loop Unbundling
Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) enables operators to
connect directly to the consumer via BT’s copper local
loops and then add their own equipment to offer
broadband and other services. There are two types of
unbundled line:
& a fully unbundled line gives operators the exclusive use
of the copper line; and
& a shared access line only gives operators the use of the
high-frequency channel used for broadband and will
also be used by the customer’s ﬁxed-line voice
provider.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, Ofcom extensively
reviewed LLU regulation as it believed that development
of the LLU market, allowing operators to target
infrastructure investment and develop scale in the
creation of high-speed data services, would be critical in
ensuring a fully competitive and innovative telecoms
market for the long term. However, while LLU does offer
the potential for downstream service and price
competition in broadband, it also requires substantial
facilities and network investment by competitors.
Ofcom’s latest approach to regulating LLU focused on
process and price:
& in July 2004 Ofcom appointed the independent
Telecoms Adjudicator to handle process issues; and
& Ofcom completed its review of LLU prices in December
2004 as part of the wholesale local access market review.
On 16 December 2004, Ofcom announced ﬁnal
charges for most connection and rental prices for LLU
services. The charge reductions follow consultations
published on 13 May 2004 and 26 August 2004, and the
price ceilings came into effect from 1 January 2005.
Ofcom has published a full list of price ceilings at:
www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2004/12/nr_20041216
Funds for liabilities
Under conditions relating to the Electronic
Communications Code, an electronic communications
provider with apparatus on or in the public highway is
required to make ﬁnancial provision to cover any damage
suffered by highway or other relevant authorities,
resulting from works carried out by the communications
provider, and for the removal of its network, if necessary,
in the event of the liquidation or bankruptcy of the
company.
The conditions require the company to provide Ofcom
annually with a certiﬁcate that, in the company board’s
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 21 opinion, the company has fulﬁlled its obligations to
ensure the availability of the required funds. This has
been done by BT.
Relationship with HM Government
The UK Government, collectively, is our largest customer,
but the provision of services to any one department or
agency of the UK Government does not comprise a
material proportion of our revenues. Except as described
below, the commercial relationship between BT as a
supplier and the UK Government as customer has been on
a normal customer and supplier basis.
We can, however, be required by law to do certain
things and provide certain services for the UK
Government. General conditions made under the
Communications Act 2003 require all providers of public
telephone networks and/or publicly available telephone
services, including BT, on the request of and in
consultation with the authorities, to make, and if
necessary implement, plans for the provision or
restoration of services in connection with disasters.
Furthermore, the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, contains
provisions enabling obligations to be imposed on
providers of public electronic communications networks,
including BT, in connection with civil contingency
planning. In addition, the Secretary of State has statutory
powers to require us to take certain actions in the
interests of national security and international relations.
Legal proceedings
The company does not believe that there are any pending
legal proceedings which would have a material adverse
effect on the ﬁnancial position or operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21
defendants, including a former BT employee, in
connection with the Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in which
BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction
process. The hearings are continuing in Rome. If the
proceedings are successful, BT could be held liable, with
others, for any damages. The company has concluded
that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in
respect of any such potential claim.

Financial review
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 25 Introduction
The ﬁnancial results for the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years
reﬂect the continuing strong growth in new wave services
as we derive value from transforming the business. Our
results reﬂect the continuing transformation of our
business operations and markets in an environment where
the pace of change is accelerating. We are driving the
change by providing our customers with new technology
and services with greater capabilities and lower cost. The
focus on delivering the strategy continued and the
group’s performance beneﬁted from the growth in new
wave activities such as networked IT services, broadband,
mobility and managed services and continued cost
efﬁciency programmes. Our global networked IT services
business is growing strongly and our global capabilities
have been strengthened by the successful completion of
the acquisitions of Albacom and Infonet in the 2005
ﬁnancial year. Subsequent to the year end we also
completed the acquisition of Radianz.
The 2003 ﬁnancial year was characterised by a focus
on implementing and delivering the strategy announced
in April 2002 and further corporate transactions in the
continued restructuring of the group and reduction of net
debt. The corporate transactions included the unwind of
the Concert joint venture on 1 April 2002 and the disposal
of our interest in Cegetel for £2.6 billion.
In this Financial review the commentary is focused
principally on the trading results of BT Group before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. Goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, by virtue of their size
or nature, are excluded because they predominantly relate
to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities
of the group. This is also consistent with the way that
ﬁnancial performance is measured by management and
we believe allows a meaningful comparison to be made of
the trading results of the group during the period under
review.
The goodwill amortisation and exceptional items are
therefore analysed and discussed separately from the line
of business results in this Financial review because they
are considered to be a reﬂection of the corporate activity
rather than the trading activity of the lines of business.
The following table shows the summarised proﬁt and
loss account which includes a reconciliation of the key
performance measures before and after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items and is discussed
further in this Financial review. The operating results by
line of business are discussed in addition to the overall
group results as we believe the activities and markets they
serve are distinct and this analysis provides a greater
degree of insight to investors.

Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 27 Group results
Whilst driving the transformation of the business, the
group has continued to make progress in growing
earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items which at 18.1 pence was 7% ahead of
the 2004 ﬁnancial year and 26% ahead of the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
The pace of our transformation was demonstrated by
the 32% growth of new wave turnover to £4,471 million
compared to an increase of 30% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year. New wave turnover represented 24% of group
turnover in the 2005 ﬁnancial year compared to 18% and
14% in the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
New wave turnover is mainly generated from ICT
solutions, broadband, mobility and managed services.
 In the 2005 ﬁnancial year the growth in new wave
turnover of 32% more than offset the 7% decline in
traditional turnover. The continued decline in traditional
turnover reﬂects regulatory intervention, competition,
price reductions and also technological changes that we
are using to drive customers from traditional services to
new wave services, such as broadband and IPVPN.
Turnover of £123 million was generated from acquisitions
in the year.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year the growth in new wave
turnover of 30% was more than offset by a 6% decline in
turnover from the group’s traditional businesses.
In the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years mobile operators
were required to reduce their fees for terminating calls
and these regulatory reductions were passed on to BT
customers resulting in lower revenues but are proﬁt
neutral as payments to mobile operators were reduced by
the same amount. In the 2005 ﬁnancial year group
turnover was up 3% (2004 – maintained) after excluding
the £397 million (2004 – £219 million) impact of these
regulatory reductions to mobile termination rates.
The table below analyses the group turnover by
customer segment. Consumer includes the external
turnover of BT Retail from consumer customers. Business
includes the external turnover of BT Retail from SME
(smaller and medium sized enterprise) customers. Major
corporate includes the external turnover of BT Retail
major corporate customers, and the external turnover of
BT Global Services, excluding global carrier. Wholesale
includes the external turnover of BT Wholesale and BT
Global Services’ global carrier business.

Consumer turnover in the 2005 ﬁnancial year was 6% lower
(4% excluding the impact of regulatory reductions to mobile
termination rates) at £5,637 million. New wave consumer
turnover increased by 85% to £412 million, driven by the
continuing growth of broadband and mobility. Residential
broadband connections almost doubled to 1,330,000 at
31 March 2005 and mobility connections increased by
more than four fold to 187,000 at 31 March 2005. BT
has introduced several price cuts to its broadband
packages throughout the year to ensure it remains a key
player in this highly competitive market. In February 2005
we announced that our retail broadband customers would
be able to receive broadband at speeds of up to 2Mbit/s
(up to four times faster) at no extra cost. Traditional
consumer turnover declined by 9% reﬂecting the impact
of CPS (Carrier Pre Selection) and broadband
substitution. BT’s estimated residential market share, as
measured by the volume of ﬁxed to ﬁxed voice minutes,
declined by 6 percentage points to 64% compared to the
2004 ﬁnancial year. The estimated market share, as
measured by the volume of ﬁxed to ﬁxed voice minutes, is
based on our actual minutes, market data provided by
Ofcom and an extrapolation of the historical market
trends.
The proportion of contracted revenues has been
increasing, now approaching 63% (2004 – 58%) of total
revenues, with the success of the BT Together packages
and broadband. There are now 17.6 million BT Together
customers and the number of customers on the frequent
user packages continues to grow. The underlying 12
months rolling average revenue per customer household
(net of mobile termination charges) of £256 in the 2005
ﬁnancial year was 4% lower than the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Consumer turnover in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was 2%
lower (1% excluding the impact of regulatory reductions
to mobile termination rates) at £5,974 million when
compared to the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Turnover from smaller and medium sized enterprise
customers in the 2005 ﬁnancial year reduced by 5% to
£2,464 million compared to a reduction of 4% in the
previous year. This decline reﬂects the continued
penetration of CPS and the impact of customers switching
from traditional telephony services to new wave services,
including broadband. New wave turnover in this customer
segment increased by 34% year on year driven mainly by the
40% growth in Business Broadband customers to 347,000
at 31 March 2005. The expansion of the BT Business Plan
portfolio continued during the year with the number of
locations increasing by 67% against last year to 445,000.
This, together with our 83 BT Local Businesses, defended
against some of the decline in traditional turnover.
Major corporate (UK and international) turnover
increased by 4% to £6,101 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year (2% excluding the effect of acquisitions and the
impact of regulatory reductions to mobile termination
28 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review rates) with the growing new wave turnover more than
offsetting the decline in traditional services. This reﬂects
the continued migration from traditional voice only
services to managed ICT solutions contracts and an
increase in mobility and broadband turnover. New wave
turnover now represents almost half (48%) of all major
corporate turnover compared to 42% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year. ICT contract wins amounted to more than
£7 billion in both the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years. The
largest win in 2005 was a contract with Reuters expected
to be worth up to £1.5 billion over eight and a half years
and in 2004 the major wins were three NHS contracts
expected to be worth more than £2 billion and forming an
integral part of the National Programme for Information
Technology in the NHS.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year major corporate turnover
increased by 2% to £5,881 million. This reﬂects the
migration of traditional voice only services to managed
ICT solutions contracts from which turnover grew by 19%
to £2,546 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Wholesale (UK and global carrier) turnover in the 2005
ﬁnancial year increased by 9% (16% excluding the impact
of regulatory reductions to mobile termination rates) to
£4,396 million. New wave turnover in the UK wholesale
business increased by 84% driven by broadband and
managed services after growing by 54% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year. The global carrier business turnover
increased by 5% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year following a
decline of 5% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects the
increases in termination revenues in Europe partly offset
by the anticipated decline in AT&T revenues. In the 2004
ﬁnancial year Wholesale turnover fell by 2% (up 1%
excluding the impact of regulatory reductions to mobile
termination rates) to £4,030 million.
We reached 5 million broadband DSL connections in
early April 2005 which is a year ahead of our target and
represents an increase of 126% from 31 March 2004.
Group operating costs before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items increased by 1% to £15,930 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The operating costs from
acquisitions were £134 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Excluding acquisitions, group operating costs before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items were ﬂat.
Our cost efﬁciency programmes achieved savings of about
£400 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year which enabled us
to invest in growing our new wave activities. In the 2004
ﬁnancial year group operating costs before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items reduced by 2% to
£15,807 million when compared to the prior year.
Net staff costs in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, excluding
leaver costs of £166 million, increased by £27 million to
£3,563 million due to the additional staff required to
service ICT contracts. Net staff costs in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, excluding leaver costs of £202 million, increased by
£145 million to £3,536 million due to the impact of
increased pay and national insurance rates and the higher
SSAP 24 pension charge, offset by improved efﬁciency.
Payments to other telecommunications operators in the
2005 ﬁnancial year were £3,725 million, a decrease of
6% mainly reﬂecting the impact of mobile termination
rate reductions offset partly by higher volumes. In the
2004 ﬁnancial year payments to other
telecommunications operators were £3,963 million, an
increase of 1% on the 2003 ﬁnancial year as both UK and
overseas payments increased. Other operating costs
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in the
2005 ﬁnancial year increased by 9% to £5,636 million.
This reﬂects not only the cost of supporting new ICT
contracts, but also investment in new wave activities,
including strengthening our networked IT services delivery
capabilities outside the UK, higher marketing costs and
higher subscriber acquisition costs. Other operating costs
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
reduced by 6% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year largely due to
efﬁciency cost savings offset by the adverse impact of
currency movements.
Group operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items at £2,864 million for the 2005
ﬁnancial year was 1% lower than the prior year mainly
reﬂecting the cost of supporting new ICT contracts and
investment in new wave activities. Group operating proﬁt
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items at
£2,889 million for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was 3% higher
than the prior year. This reﬂected cost efﬁciencies
achieved during the year, the improved performance of
BT Global Services and a £74 million decrease in leaver
costs offset by the decline in turnover. Group operating
proﬁt margins before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items were relatively steady year on year at
15.4% and 15.6% in the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years,
respectively.
BT’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ operating
results before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
was £nil in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, compared to losses of
£8 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and a £181 million
proﬁt in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The 2003 ﬁnancial year
includes the results of our interest in Cegetel which was
sold in January 2003.
Net interest payable before exceptional items was
£801 million for the 2005 ﬁnancial year, an improvement
of £85 million against the 2004 ﬁnancial year following an
improvement of £260 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
This reﬂects the reduction in net debt in both years.
The above factors resulted in the group achieving a
proﬁt before taxation, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items of £2,085 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year, an increase of 4% compared to the 2004 ﬁnancial
year. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year the proﬁt before taxation,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of £2,013
million was £173 million higher than the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. The improvement in both years reﬂects the
underlying operating performance of the group and lower
net interest costs.
The taxation charge for the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
£539 million on the proﬁt before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, an effective rate of 25.9%
compared to 28.2% and 32.5% in the 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years, respectively. The improvement in the
effective tax rate reﬂects the tax efﬁcient investment of
surplus cash and continued improvement in the tax
efﬁciency within the group.
Basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items were 18.1 pence for the 2005
ﬁnancial year, an increase of 7% from 16.9 pence in the
2004 ﬁnancial year, and were 14.4 pence in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 29 Line of business results
In the following commentary, we discuss the operating
results of the group for the 2005, 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years in relation to the lines of business.
There is extensive trading between the lines of
business and their proﬁtability is dependent on the
transfer price levels. The intra-group trading
arrangements and operating assets are subject to review
and have changed in certain circumstances. Where that is
the case the comparative ﬁgures have been restated to
reﬂect those changes.
The table below analyses the trading relationships
between each of the lines of business for the 2005
ﬁnancial year. The majority of the internal trading is BT
Wholesale selling calls, access lines and other network
products to BT Retail. This trading relationship also
reﬂects the pass through of termination charges on other
telecom operator networks and the sale of wholesale
broadband ISP products. BT Retail also trades with BT
Wholesale, selling apparatus, operator assistance and
directory enquiries services and conferencing for onward
sale to other telecom operators. BT Global Services’
turnover with BT Retail mainly reﬂects the sales of BT
Global Services products in the UK. BT Global Services
trades with BT Wholesale mainly for use of the IP/ATM
network, International Direct Dial trafﬁc settlements and
certain dial IP revenue share arrangements. BT
Wholesale’s turnover with BT Global Services reﬂects the
use of the network infrastructure for BT Global Services’
products.

The line of business results are presented and discussed
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, for
the reasons set out above, to provide a meaningful
comparison of the trading results between the ﬁnancial
years under review. Goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items are discussed separately in a group context in this
Financial review.
In addition to measuring ﬁnancial performance of the
lines of business based on the operating proﬁt before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items,
management also measure the operating ﬁnancial
performance of the lines of business based upon the
EBITDA before exceptional items. EBITDA is deﬁned as
the group operating proﬁt (loss) before depreciation and
amortisation. This may not be directly comparable to the
EBITDA of other companies as they may deﬁne it
differently. EBITDA excludes depreciation and
amortisation, both being non cash items, from group
operating proﬁt and is a common measure, particularly in
the telecommunications sector, used by investors and
analysts in evaluating the operating ﬁnancial performance
of companies.
EBITDA before exceptional items is considered to be a
good measure of the operating performance because it
reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by
eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and excludes
non-recurring exceptional items that are predominantly
related to corporate transactions. EBITDA is not a direct
measure of the group’s liquidity, which is shown by the
group’s cash ﬂow statement and needs to be considered
in the context of the group’s ﬁnancial commitments. A
reconciliation of EBITDA before exceptional items to
group operating proﬁts (losses) by line of business and for
the group is provided in the table across the page above.
Trends in EBITDA before exceptional items are discussed
for each line of business in the following commentary.

Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
BT Retail’s results demonstrated a continued strategic
shift towards new wave products with growth in
networked IT services, broadband and mobility products.
Despite the substitution by new wave products,
traditional turnover was defended by changes in pricing
structure and packages to beneﬁt frequent users and
marketing campaigns focusing on key customer service
promises. In the consumer market BT changed the basic
voice offering on 1 July 2004 so that all standard
customers were placed onto BT Together option 1
thereby lowering call prices to approximately 9 million
customers. As at 31 March 2005, 17.6 million customers
were on BT Together packages. In the business market
the focus remains on placing customers on commitment
packages whereby lower call prices are received for annual
committed spend. By 31 March 2005 there were 445,000
Business Plan sites, up 67% in the year. Cost
transformation continues to successfully reduce the cost

Restated following adoption of UITF17 and UITF38 (see note 1 on page 81) base of the traditional business, allowing investment in
new wave products and services.
BT Retail’s turnover decreased by 3% in the 2005
ﬁnancial year to £12,562 million after declining by 2% in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The growth in new wave turnover
of 28% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year (2004 – 29%) was more
than offset by the decline in traditional turnover driven by
the impact of regulation and competition. After adjusting
for the regulatory impact of the reduction in mobile
termination rates, turnover declined by 2% in the 2005
ﬁnancial year (2004 – 1%). Turnover for the three years is
summarised as follows:
BT Retail turnover 2005 2004 2003

Voice services comprise calls made by customers on the
BT ﬁxed line network in the UK, analogue lines,
equipment sales, rentals and other business voice
products. Overall turnover from voice services was 10%
lower in the 2005 ﬁnancial year (8% excluding the impact
of regulatory reductions to mobile termination rates) after
a decrease of 7% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The
reduction includes the effect of continued migration to
broadband with a 25% fall in dial up minutes over the
year, a reduction in market share reﬂecting regulatory
and competitive pressure and a decline in the overall ﬁxed
to ﬁxed calls market.
Turnover from intermediate products in the 2005
ﬁnancial year of £1,728 million decreased by 7% after
decreasing by 6% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The
reduction was mainly driven by the continued decline in
private circuits and ISDN as customers migrate to new
wave products including broadband, and IPVPN. As a
result of regulatory changes, partial private circuits used
by UK ﬁxed network operators are no longer provided by
BT Retail, but are provided as a BT Wholesale product.
Private circuit revenues declined by £68 million in the
2005 ﬁnancial year and by £88 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year.
New wave turnover grew by 28% to £2,780 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year compared to growth of 29% in the
2004 ﬁnancial year. New wave turnover accounted for
22% of BT Retail’s turnover in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
compared to 17% and 13% in the 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years, respectively. ICT solutions are the main
component and increased by 14% in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year to £1,978 million after an increase of 15% in the
2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting the growth in new IP based
services and solutions contracts. Broadband turnover grew
by 76% to £541 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year after an
increase of 134% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The growth
of broadband continues to accelerate with 1,752,000
BT Retail connections at 31 March 2005, an increase of
81% over last year. BT Retail had net additions of
785,000 broadband customers in the year, a 29% share
of the broadband DSL market additions. Turnover from
mobility services increased by 119% in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year after doubling in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. BT Mobile
had over 372,000 contract mobile connections at 31
March 2005, an increase of 158% from 31 March 2004.
BT Openzone has grown signiﬁcantly this year with paid
minutes across the network almost four times higher and
the number of access sites is now over 20,000 worldwide.
Other new wave turnover has grown by 88% primarily
driven by revenues from BT Phone Books (now covering
171 different regions) increasing to £65 million.
The total number of BT Retail lines, which includes
voice, digital and broadband, were ﬂat at 30 million at
31 March 2005, reﬂecting the continued growth in
broadband offset by the declining PSTN lines.
The gross margin percentage decreased by 0.9
percentage points in the 2005 ﬁnancial year after a
decrease of 0.2 percentage points in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year. The decline primarily reﬂects the change in revenue
mix from traditional business to lower margin new wave
services. As the broadband and mobility customer base
grows, the additional subscriber acquisition costs are
written off as incurred. In addition, the creation and
development of new value added services resulted in
increased development costs.
Gross margin is turnover less costs directly attributable
to the provision of the products and services reﬂected in
turnover in the period. Selling, general and administration
costs are those costs that are ancillary to the business
processes of providing products and services and are the
general business operating costs. BT Retail analyses its
costs in this manner for management purposes in
common with other retail organisations and it has set
target savings for selling, general and administration
costs.
Cost transformation programmes in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year generated selling, general and administration cost
savings of £124 million before leaver costs in the
traditional business (£27 million net of new wave
investment). The savings in the year were driven by cost

in end to end processes, particularly through initiatives in
the customer contact centres. Additionally, sustainable
cost reduction programmes targeted the identiﬁcation
and removal of inefﬁciencies and duplication. The
majority of these initiatives were targeted at people
related costs, with signiﬁcant savings in billing, IT
operations and other support functions. In the 2004
ﬁnancial year savings of £228 million before leaver costs
were also driven by cost reduction programmes.
The number of employees in BT Retail at 31 March
2005 and 31 March 2004 was 39,500 and 41,500,
respectively.
BT Retail’s EBITDA before exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation declined by 10% to £1,249 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year after showing a decline in the
2004 ﬁnancial year of 2% to £1,394 million. The
increased rate of decline in the 2005 ﬁnancial year is due
to a 9% fall (compared to 7% in 2004 ﬁnancial year) in
traditional turnover coupled with increased investment in
new wave activities, particularly in mobility and
broadband, that laid the foundations for further growth in
new wave activities. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, cost
savings more than offset the decline in turnover and the
impact on margins of the product mix.
Capital expenditure for the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
£154 million, an increase of 31% from the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, mainly due to increased expenditure on software.

Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
BT Wholesale is the line of business within BT that
provides network services and solutions within the UK. Its
customers include communications companies, ﬁxed and
mobile network operators, internet and other service
providers. The customer base includes BT’s lines of
business, BT Retail and BT Global Services. The majority
of BT Wholesale’s turnover is internal (2005 – 58%, 2004
– 61%, 2003 – 62%) and mainly represents trading with
BT Retail. External turnover is derived from providing
wholesale products and solutions to other operators
interconnecting with BT’s UK ﬁxed network.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, turnover totalled £8,979
million, an increase of 1% over the 2004 ﬁnancial year,
after a reduction of 4% to £8,883 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year.
External turnover increased by 10% to £3,812 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year (an increase of 17% excluding
the impact of regulatory reductions to mobile termination
rates). This follows a decline of 1% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year to £3,473 million (an increase of 2% excluding the
impact of regulatory reductions to mobile termination
rates). The increase in the 2005 ﬁnancial year reﬂects
particularly strong growth in new wave revenues, mainly
broadband. The regulatory price reductions on mobile
termination rates have no impact on proﬁtability.
External turnover from traditional products increased
by 1% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year compared to a decline of
5% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Excluding the impact of
regulatory reductions to mobile termination rates turnover
was up 10% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year and down 2% in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The growth in traditional turnover
was mainly driven by growth in private circuits, wholesale
access and interconnect trafﬁc. Turnover from partial
private circuits of £191 million increased by 26% in the
2005 ﬁnancial year after an increase of 43% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year to £152 million. This reﬂects the continuing
trend of customers migrating from lower bandwidth
products to less expensive alternatives such as partial
private circuits and short haul data services. Substitution
to broadband has resulted in the continued declining
trend in Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination
revenues with turnover of £57 million in the 2005
ﬁnancial year (2004 – £78 million, 2003 – £84 million).
Wholesale access revenues have increased by £65 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year as a result of increased volumes
from other service providers. Conveyance and low margin
transit revenues of £2,014 million decreased by 2%
compared to the 2004 ﬁnancial year and at £2,054
million decreased by 1% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year with
the impact of regulatory price reductions being offset by
increased call volumes.
New wave turnover, including broadband and managed
services, at £664 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
showed strong growth of 84% following growth of 54% in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Broadband revenues grew by
158% year on year. Wholesale broadband DSL lines more
than doubled during the 2005 ﬁnancial year and reached
5 million DSL lines in the ﬁrst week of April 2005 which is
a year ahead of our target. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year
wholesale DSL lines grew by 177% to over 2.2 million
lines.
Internal turnover decreased by 4% to £5,167 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year after a decrease of 6% to
£5,410 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The reduction
reﬂects the impact of lower volumes of calls, lines and
private circuits, and lower regulatory prices being
reﬂected in internal charges.
Gross variable proﬁt of £6,817 million marginally
increased compared to £6,791 million for the 2004
ﬁnancial year after a decrease of 6% compared to the
2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting sales volume changes and
changes in sales mix.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, network and selling, general
and administration costs, excluding leaver costs,
decreased by £20 million, following a decrease of
£174 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Activity levels in
the network, driven by broadband volumes, have
increased in both the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years. The
ﬁnancial impact of this increased activity has been
mitigated by a series of cost reduction programmes
focusing on efﬁciency, discretionary cost management
and process improvements.
The number of employees in BT Wholesale at 31 March
2005 and 31 March 2004 was 28,300 and 27,800,
respectively.
EBITDA before exceptional items at £3,849 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year was 1% higher than in the 2004
ﬁnancial year following a reduction of 5% to £3,802
million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. EBITDA margins before
exceptional items were maintained at 43% across all three
ﬁnancial years. Leaver costs were £45 million in the 2005
ﬁnancial year (2004 – £46 million, 2003 – £131 million).
32 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review Depreciation costs were broadly ﬂat at £1,909 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year and £1,919 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year.
Operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items at £1,940 million increased by 3% in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This was after a reduction of 9%
to £1,883 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The
operating proﬁt margin, before exceptional items,
remained broadly ﬂat at 21.6% and 21.2% in the 2005
and 2004 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Capital expenditure on plant and equipment at
£1,973 million increased by 9% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
and follows an increase of 10% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
This reﬂects increased expenditure to support the rapid
growth in broadband and investment to support the
transformation of the group’s network.

BT Global Services supplies managed services and
solutions to multi-site organisations worldwide – our core
target market is 10,000 multi-site organisations including
major companies with signiﬁcant global requirements,
together with large organisations in target local markets.
We provide them with global reach and a complete range
of networked IT services.
Our extensive global communications network and
strong strategic partnerships enable us to serve customers
in the key commercial centres of Europe, North America
and the Asia Paciﬁc region.
Our global communications services portfolio includes:
desktop and network equipment and software; transport
and connectivity; managed LAN (local area network),
WAN (wide area network) and IPVPN (internet protocol
virtual private network) services; managed mobility;
applications hosting; storage and security services; and
business transformation and change management
services.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year BT Global Services’ turnover
was £6,381 million, including £111 million from the
Albacom and Infonet businesses acquired in the ﬁnal
quarter of the year. This represents an underlying increase
of 8% compared to the 2004 ﬁnancial year. BT Global
Solutions’ turnover grew by 17% in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year to £3,202 million, following growth of 14% in the
2004 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting the conversion of the
strong order book. BT Consulting & Systems Integration
performed strongly with turnover of £824 million in the
2005 ﬁnancial year, representing an increase of 14% over
the prior year (2004 – 16%). The growth includes the
impact of the NHS contracts won in 2004. In the 2005
and 2004 ﬁnancial years contract wins from managed ICT
solutions amounted to more than £7 billion. BT Global
Products’ turnover grew by 4% to £1,897 million in the
2005 ﬁnancial year (2004 – 9%) and continues to reﬂect
the growth of MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching). In
the 2005 ﬁnancial year BT Global Carrier turnover
increased by 2% to £981 million, reversing the decline of
1% seen in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The increase in 2005
reﬂects the increases in termination revenues in Europe
partly offset by the anticipated decline in AT&T revenues.
The increase in turnover, together with lower network
and selling, general and administration costs, helped
generate improvements in EBITDA before exceptional
items in the 2005 ﬁnancial year of 14% to £580 million,
following an improvement of 113% in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year. The 2005, 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years include
leaver costs of £33 million, £33 million and £65 million,
respectively. Headcount increased by 16% to 24,600 in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year which includes the expected
increase in resources associated with strengthening the
overseas network centric solutions delivery capabilities
and an increase in headcount to service the increased ICT
contract base. Headcount increased by 23% to 21,200 in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
The 2005 ﬁnancial year saw Global Services deliver its
ﬁrst ever full year operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, at £7 million, an
improvement of £112 million over the previous year. The
acquisitions contributed an operating loss of £10 million
since acquisition in the ﬁnal quarter of the 2005 ﬁnancial
year.
Capital expenditure for the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
£628 million, an increase of 31% from £479 million in the
2004 ﬁnancial year, mainly due to expenditure on the
NHS contracts won in 2004.
Other operating income
Other operating income for the group decreased by
£6 million to £171 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year and
by £38 million to £177 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Operating costs
Total operating costs increased by 1% in the 2005
ﬁnancial year to £16,005 million although they were ﬂat
year on year excluding the impact of acquisitions after
reducing by 3% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Our cost
efﬁciency programmes achieved savings of around
£400 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year which enabled
us to invest in growing our new wave activities.
The increase in total costs in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
reﬂects the cost of supporting new ICT contracts,
including strengthening our networked IT services delivery
capabilities outside the UK, higher marketing costs and
higher subscriber acquisition costs. As a percentage of
group turnover, operating costs, excluding goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, were 86% in the
2005 ﬁnancial year (2004 – 85%, 2003 – 86%). In all
three ﬁnancial years, net exceptional costs were incurred.
These amounted to £59 million, £7 million and
£198 million in the 2005, 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years,
respectively. These exceptional costs are considered
separately in the discussion which follows.

Staff costs increased by 1% to £4,451 million in the 2005
ﬁnancial year and by 4% to £4,415 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year. In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the number of
staff employed increased by 2,200 to 102,100 at
31 March 2005 after decreasing by 4,800 in the 2004
ﬁnancial year. The increase in the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
mainly due to the additional staff required to service ICT
contracts and the acquisitions of Albacom and Infonet.
The increase in headcount and pay rates was offset by
lower early leaver costs. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year
increased pay rates and national insurance and a
£141 million increase in the pension charge offset the
impact of the lower headcount and leaver costs.
The allocation for the employee proﬁt share scheme,
included within staff costs, was £11 million in the 2005
ﬁnancial year. The allocation for the 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years was £20 million and £36 million,
respectively.
Early leaver costs of £166 million were incurred in the
2005 ﬁnancial year, compared with £202 million and
£276 million in the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years,
respectively. This reﬂects BT’s continued focus on
improving operational efﬁciencies. Leaver costs include
the cost of enhanced pension beneﬁts provided to leavers
which amounted to £nil, £1 million and £60 million in the
2005, 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The depreciation charge decreased by 3% in the 2005
ﬁnancial year to £2,834 million after decreasing by 3% in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Goodwill amortisation in respect of subsidiaries and
businesses acquired and amortisation of other intangibles
totalled £22 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year compared
with £15 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and £24 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Payments to other telecommunications operators
decreased by 6% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year to
£3,725 million after increasing by 1% in the 2004
ﬁnancial year. The decrease in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
mainly reﬂects the impact of mobile termination rate
reductions offset by higher volumes.
Other operating costs before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items increased by 9% in the 2005
ﬁnancial year to £5,636 million after reducing by 6% in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects not only the cost of
supporting new ICT contracts, but also investment in new
wave activities, including strengthening our networked IT
services delivery capabilities outside the UK, higher
marketing costs and higher subscriber acquisition costs.
The decrease in the 2004 ﬁnancial year was largely due to
efﬁciency cost savings offset by the adverse impact of
currency movements. Other operating costs include the
maintenance and support of the networks,
accommodation and marketing costs, the cost of sales of
customer premises equipment and non pay related leaver
costs.
The exceptional items within operating costs for the
2005, 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years are shown in the
table below.

In the 2005 ﬁnancial year £59 million of exceptional
property rationalisation charges were recognised in
relation to the group’s provincial ofﬁce portfolio. This
rationalisation programme is expected to continue
through next year giving rise to further rationalisation
costs. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, net exceptional
operating costs included the rectiﬁcation costs relating to
a major incident offset by the £23 million release of the
surplus exceptional bad debt provisions made in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a property
rationalisation charge of £198 million was recognised in
relation to the group’s London ofﬁce estate.
Group operating proﬁt (loss)
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, group operating proﬁt before
goodwill amortisation and the exceptional items described
above, of £2,864 million was 1% lower than in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, which in turn was 3% higher than in the
2003 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects the increased operating
costs, described above, in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Total group operating proﬁt for the 2005 ﬁnancial year
was £2,789 million compared to a proﬁt of £2,870 million
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and a proﬁt of £2,576 million in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year.

In the 2004 ﬁnancial year the group’s share of associates’
and joint ventures’ turnover was £395 million, a decrease
of £1,060 million over the previous year due to the
disposal of the group’s interest in Cegetel in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
34 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review The principal contributors to turnover in the 2005
ﬁnancial year were LG Telecom in Korea (£251 million,
2004 – £196 million) and Albacom in Italy (£97 million,
2004 – £147 million). The principal contributors to
turnover in the 2003 ﬁnancial year were Cegetel in France
(£956 million) up to the date of disposal and LG Telecom
(£198 million). In February 2005 Albacom became a
wholly owned subsidiary of the group when the remaining
74% interest was acquired.
The group’s share of its ventures’ operating proﬁts
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was
£nil in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This compares to a loss of
£8 million and a proﬁt of £181 million in the 2004 and
2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The principal contributor to the group’s share of
operating proﬁts before goodwill amortisation and

(£198 million).

In the 2005 ﬁnancial year BT incurred an exceptional
impairment charge of £25 million, being BT’s share of a
write down of Albacom’s assets prior to Albacom
becoming a subsidiary. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year, BT
charged its share of an exceptional goodwill impairment
made by Albacom, amounting to £26 million.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year BT completed the exit from
its investment in Blu on more favourable terms than
anticipated and surplus exit cost provisions of £150 million
were released.
Goodwill amortisation was £nil in both the 2005 and
2004 ﬁnancial year, compared to £2 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
Total operating proﬁt (loss)
Total operating proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items for the 2005 ﬁnancial year of £2,864
million was 1% lower than in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
which in turn was 3% lower than the previous ﬁnancial
year. The movement in total operating proﬁt was due to
the factors explained above.
Total operating proﬁt for the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
£2,764 million, including BT’s share of the operating
results of its associates and joint ventures. This compared
to £2,836 million for the 2004 ﬁnancial year and
£2,905 million for the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The reduction
in total operating proﬁt reﬂects the reduction in
associates’ and joint ventures’ proﬁts offset by cost
efﬁciency savings, the strong performance of BT Global
Services and lower leaver costs.
Proﬁt on sale of group undertakings and ﬁxed
asset investments
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the net proceeds for
disposals totalled £560 million and the proﬁt before tax
from disposal of non-core investments totalled
£358 million. In January 2005 BT sold its 4% interest in
Intelsat for net proceeds of £64 million which resulted in a
proﬁt on disposal of £46 million. In December 2004 BT
sold its 15.8% interest in Eutelsat SA for net proceeds of
£356 million resulting in a proﬁt on disposal of £236
million. In November 2004 BT completed the sale of its
11.9% shareholding in StarHub Pte Ltd for net proceeds
of £77 million resulting in a proﬁt on disposal of £38
million.
In the 2004 ﬁnancial year the consideration for
disposals totalled £133 million and the proﬁt before tax
from disposals totalled £36 million. This was principally in
relation to the disposal of the group’s 7.8% interest in
Inmarsat which was sold for £67 million realising a proﬁt
on disposal of £32 million.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a number of non-core
investments were sold. The consideration for the disposals
totalled £3,028 million and the proﬁt before taxation from
disposals totalled £1,696 million. This was principally in
relation to the disposal of our 26% interest in Cegetel, a
French telecommunications operator, on 22 January
2003. The total proceeds were £2,603 million, received in
cash, and the proﬁt was £1,509 million before the
recognition of an exceptional interest charge of £293
million on closing out ﬁxed interest rate swaps following
receipt of the sale proceeds.
Interest charge
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the total net interest charge,
including BT’s share of its ventures’ charges, at £801
million was £140 million lower than in the preceding year,
which in turn was £498 million lower than in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. Of the total net charge, £787 million arises
in the group for the 2005 ﬁnancial year, compared with
£924 million and £1,420 million in the 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The reduction in the net interest charge in the 2005
ﬁnancial year reﬂects the continued reduction in the level
of net debt. In addition, there were no exceptional
interest charges or credits in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
compared to a net exceptional charge of £55 million in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The net exceptional charge in the
2004 ﬁnancial year represents the premium on buying
back E1.1 billion of 7.125% bonds due in 2011 and
US$195 million of the group’s US dollar bonds, partially
offset by a credit from the one off interest recognised on
full repayment of loan notes received as part of the
original consideration from the disposal of Yell.
The reduction in the net interest charge in the 2004
ﬁnancial year reﬂects the reduction in the level of net
debt and lower net exceptional charges in the 2004
ﬁnancial year.
The net interest charge in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
includes the £293 million exceptional cost of terminating
ﬁxed interest rate swaps as a consequence of the receipt
of the Cegetel sale proceeds.
Interest cover in the 2005 ﬁnancial year represented
3.6 times total operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, and compares with
interest cover of 3.3 in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and 2.6 in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The improvement in cover is due
to the reduction in the interest charge mainly arising from
the reduction in net debt.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 35 Proﬁt (loss) before taxation
The group’s proﬁt before taxation for the 2005 ﬁnancial
year was £2,343 million, compared with a proﬁt of
£1,945 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year and a proﬁt of
£3,173 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The proﬁt in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year included the exceptional proﬁts
from the sale of investments and businesses totalling
£1,696 million.
The group’s proﬁt before taxation, before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items for the 2005 ﬁnancial
year was £2,085 million, compared with £2,013 million in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year and £1,840 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. The improvement in the underlying proﬁt
was due to cost efﬁciency savings, the strong
performance of BT Global Services, lower leaver costs and
the lower interest charges explained above.
Taxation
The tax charge for the 2005 ﬁnancial year was
£523 million and comprises £539 million on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, offset by tax relief of £16 million on certain
exceptional charges. The tax charge on the proﬁt before
taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items is at
an effective rate of 25.9%. This reduction in the effective
rate from 28.2% in the 2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the
continued improvements in the tax efﬁciency of the
group.
The tax charge for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was
£539 million and comprises £568 million on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, offset by tax relief of £29 million on certain
exceptional charges.
The tax charge for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
£459 million and comprises £598 million on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, offset by tax relief of £139 million on certain
exceptional charges.
Earnings (loss) per share
The basic earnings per share of 21.4 pence per share for
the 2005 ﬁnancial year compares with 16.4 pence for the
2004 ﬁnancial year and 31.4 pence for the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. The following table illustrates the impact of
exceptional items and goodwill amortisation on the basic

year compare with an equivalent of 16.9 pence and 14.4
pence for the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were not materially different
in all three years.
Dividends
The board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 6.50 pence per
share to shareholders, amounting to £551 million. This
will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on
5 September 2005 to shareholders on the register on
5 August 2005. This takes the dividend for the full year to
10.4 pence per share, compared to 8.5 pence in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, an increase of 22%. This year’s dividend
pay out ratio is 57% of earnings before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items compared to 50% in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
We continue with our progressive dividend policy. The
dividend for the 2006 ﬁnancial year will be at least 60%
of underlying earnings: subject to the group’s overall
ﬁnancial position, we expect our pay out ratio to rise to
around two-thirds of underlying earnings by the 2008
ﬁnancial year.
The interim and ﬁnal dividend in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year was 3.2 pence per share and 5.3 pence per share,
respectively. This gave a full dividend for the year of
8.5 pence per share, amounting to £732 million.
The interim and ﬁnal dividend in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year was 2.25 pence per share and 4.25 pence per share,
respectively. This gave a full dividend for the year of
6.5 pence per share, amounting to £560 million.

consequently reducing the net cash inﬂow by these
amounts. The pension payments in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year include early payment of £380 million deﬁciency
contributions to the BT Pension Scheme, which represents
most of the deﬁciency contributions for the 2005 and
2006 ﬁnancial years.
The net cash outﬂow for returns on investments and
servicing of ﬁnance amounted to £878 million, £527
million and £1,506 million in the 2005, 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years, respectively. The increased outﬂow of
£351 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the receipt
of £420 million of funds on restructuring part of the
group’s swap portfolio in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This
effect was offset by lower interest payments due to
certain bonds maturing during the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The reduction in the 2004 ﬁnancial year outﬂow of £979
million includes the effect of the restructuring of the
group’s swap portfolio. In addition, the 2003 ﬁnancial
year included the payment of a £293 million premium on
closing out £2.6 billion of ﬁxed interest rate swaps,
following receipt of the Cegetel sale proceeds.
Tax paid in the 2005 ﬁnancial year totalled
£332 million compared with £317 million in the 2004
ﬁnancial year and £434 million paid in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. The lower tax paid in the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial
year reﬂects the lower current tax charge and the level of
payments made on account.
The net cash outﬂow of £2,408 million for capital
expenditure and ﬁnancial investment in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year included £3,056 million of capital expenditure on
property, plant and equipment, offset by £650 million
received on the sale of ﬁxed assets. In the 2004 ﬁnancial
year the net cash outﬂow of £2,477 million for capital
expenditure and ﬁnancial investment included £2,684
million of capital expenditure on property, plant and
equipment, offset by £208 million received on the sale of
ﬁxed assets. Capital expenditure is higher than the 2004
ﬁnancial year as a result of expenditure to support the
rapid growth in broadband and the transformation of the
group’s network. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year the net cash
outﬂow of £2,381 million for capital expenditure and
ﬁnancial investment included £2,580 million of capital
expenditure on plant and equipment, offset by £200
million received on the sale of ﬁxed assets.
The net cash outﬂow from acquisitions less disposals in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year totalled £418 million. The
principal cash outﬂow for acquisitions was mainly due to
the purchase of Infonet Services Corporation and Albacom
SpA. The net cash outﬂow from acquisitions less disposals
in the 2004 ﬁnancial year totalled £60 million. The
principal cash outﬂow for acquisitions was due to the
purchase of a controlling interest in BT Expedite Limited
(formerly NSB Retail plc) and Transcomm plc. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year the net cash inﬂow from disposals less
acquisitions totalled £2,842 million. Cash proceeds from
disposals amounted to £2,919 million and principally
comprised £2,603 million from the sale of the investment
in Cegetel.
Equity dividends paid in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
totalled £784 million whilst those paid in the 2004 and
2003 ﬁnancial years totalled £645 million and £367
million, respectively.
The resulting cash inﬂow for the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
before management of liquid resources and ﬁnancing, of
£1,080 million, together with inﬂows from current asset
investments, were mainly applied to long term borrowing
repayments of £1,297 million. The cash inﬂow for the
2004 ﬁnancial year of £1,366 million was mainly applied
in repaying long-term borrowings with total borrowings of
£3,627 million being repaid. In addition, the group issued
new loans of £1,326 million. The new loans included a
US$172 million 0.75% exchangeable bond due in 2008,
exchangeable into ordinary shares of LG Telecom, BT’s
Korean based associate and a sale and leaseback of circuit
switches which had no effect on net debt but increased
gross debt and cash by around £1 billion. The cash inﬂow
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year of £4,183 million was applied
in repaying short-term borrowings and investing in short-
term investments, with total borrowings of £2,535 million
being repaid.
The cash inﬂow for the 2005 ﬁnancial year resulted in
net debt reducing by a further £639 million to £7,786
million having reduced by £1,148 million to £8,425
million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year the group further
restructured some of its swaps portfolio to mitigate credit
risk to and with certain counterparties. As a result, the
group terminated £2.9 billion of cross-currency and
sterling interest rate swaps with some swaps being
replaced with new swaps which had the same economic
hedging effect. This resulted in the group paying £107
million in reducing gross debt and receiving a net £14
million of interest receipts. The group also restructured
some of its swap portfolio during the 2004 ﬁnancial year
to mitigate credit risk to certain counterparties. As a
result, the group terminated £7 billion of cross-currency
interest rate swaps and replaced these with new swaps
which had the same economic hedging effect. This
resulted in the group paying £445 million in reducing
gross debt and receiving £420 million of interest receipts.
The interest receipts and payments on restructuring for
the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years have been included
within deferred income and other debtors, respectively on
the balance sheet and will be amortised to the proﬁt and
loss account over the term of the underlying hedged debt.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year the share buyback
programme continued with the group repurchasing 101
million shares for consideration of £195 million. During
the 2004 ﬁnancial year the group repurchased 81 million
shares for consideration of £144 million.
Treasury policy
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose
primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment
and the group’s ﬁnancial risk, including risk from volatility
in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury operation is not a proﬁt centre and the
objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the treasury department’s policy and
its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate
with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments
under its management. Counterparty credit risk is closely
monitored and managed within controls set by the Board.
Derivative instruments, including forward foreign
exchange contracts, are entered into for hedging
purposes only.
We have set out further details on this topic and on
our capital resources and foreign currency exposure in
note 33 to the ﬁnancial statements in compliance with
FRS 13.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 37 Off-balance sheet arrangements
As disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements there are no off-
balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future material effect on the
group’s ﬁnancial condition, changes in ﬁnancial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditure or capital resources, with the
exception of the following:
Operating leases (note 27)
Capital commitments and guarantees (note 27)
Derivative contracts (note 33)
Capital resources
During the period under review the group has reduced its
level of borrowings so that its net debt was £7.8 billion at
31 March 2005 compared with £8.4 billion at 31 March
2004 and £9.6 billion at 31 March 2003. This is at a level
with which we are comfortable and we are no longer
targeting net debt of around £7 billion in the 2007
ﬁnancial year.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the
group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and therefore they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the ﬁnancial statements.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the ﬁnancial
or trading position of the group since 31 March 2005.
The following table sets out the group’s contractual
obligations and commitments as they fall due for
payment, as at 31 March 2005.

At 31 March 2005, the group had cash and short-term
investments of £4,803 million. At that date, £4,498
million of debt fell due for repayment in the 2006
ﬁnancial year. The group had unused short-term bank
facilities, amounting to approximately £145 million at
31 March 2005. These resources will allow the group to
settle its obligations as they fall due.
At 31 March 2004, the group had cash and short-term
investments of £5,272 million and unused short-term
bank facilities amounting to approximately £145 million.
Foreign currency and interest rate exposure
Most of the group’s current turnover is invoiced in pounds
sterling, and most of its operations and costs arise within
the UK. The group’s foreign currency borrowings, which
totalled £8.8 billion at 31 March 2005, are used to
ﬁnance its operations. These borrowings have been
predominantly swapped into sterling. Cross currency
swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been
entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on
the group’s operations and the group’s net assets. The
group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts
to hedge investment, interest expense and purchase and
sale commitments. The commitments hedged are
principally US dollar and euro denominated. As a result of
these policies, the group’s exposure to foreign currency
arises mainly on the residual currency exposure on its
non-UK investments in its subsidiaries and ventures and
on any imbalances between the value of outgoing and
incoming international calls.
A 10% strengthening in sterling against major
currencies would cause the group’s net assets at 31 March
2005 to fall by less than £150 million, with insigniﬁcant
effect on the group’s proﬁt. This compares with a fall of
less than £120 million and £100 million in the years
ended 31 March 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Foreign exchange contracts are entered into as a
hedge of sales and purchases, accordingly a change in the
fair value of the hedge is offset by a corresponding
change in the value of the underlying sale or purchase.
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings have
been, and are, subject to ﬁxed interest rates. The group
has entered into interest rate swap agreements with
commercial banks and other institutions to vary the
amounts and period for which interest rates are ﬁxed. At
31 March 2005, the group had outstanding interest rate
swap agreements with notional principal amounts
totalling £5,297 million compared to £5,210 million at
31 March 2004.
The long-term debt instruments which BT issued in
December 2000 and February 2001 both contained
covenants providing that if the BT group credit rating
were downgraded below A3 in the case of Moody’s or
below A minus in the case of Standard & Poor’s (S&P),
additional interest would accrue from the next interest
coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for
each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s credit rating to
Baa1, which increased BT’s annual interest charge by
approximately £32 million. BT’s credit rating from S&P is
A minus. Based upon the total amount of debt of
£9 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March
2005, BT’s annual interest charge would increase by
approximately £26 million if BT’s credit rating were to be
downgraded by one credit rating category by both
agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1/ A minus.
If BT’s credit rating with Moody’s was to be upgraded by
one credit rating category the annual interest charge
would be reduced by approximately £13 million.
Based upon the composition of net debt at 31 March
2005, a one percentage point increase in interest rates
would increase the group’s annual net interest expense by
less than £10 million. This compares with an increase of
less than £15 million and less than £10 million in the
years ended 31 March 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on plant, equipment and property
(excluding the movement on capital accruals) totalled
£3,011 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, compared with
£2,673 million and £2,445 million in the 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years, respectively. Capital expenditure is
expected to be just over £3 billion in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year as the group invests in its 21st century network
(21CN) programme and takes account of the additional
expenditure associated with the acquired businesses. The
acquired businesses incurred capital expenditure of
£12 million from their date of acquisition in the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
38 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review Of the capital expenditure, £114 million was in Europe,
outside the UK, in the 2005 ﬁnancial year compared to
£86 million in the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
Contracts placed for ongoing capital expenditure
totalled £735 million at 31 March 2005. 21CN is being
developed using stringent capital return criteria and a
rigorous approach to any investment in the narrowband
network. 21CN aims to deliver long term, structural cost
reduction, as we progressively migrate onto a simpler,
lower cost network architecture. BT expects that future
capital expenditure will be funded from net cash inﬂows
from operating activities, and, if required, by external
ﬁnancing.
Acquisitions
The total amount invested in acquisitions in the 2005
ﬁnancial year, including further funding of existing
ventures, was £453 million, being mainly the acquisitions
of Infonet and Albacom. In February 2005 the group
completed the acquisition of the 74% interest in Albacom
not already held, giving BT full ownership for total
consideration of £131 million. This gave rise to goodwill
of £9 million. In February 2005 the group also completed
the acquisition of Infonet for total consideration of £520
million, being £315 million net of cash balances. This
gave rise to goodwill of £264 million. In the period since
acquisition they have contributed £111 million to turnover
and an operating loss of £10 million. In April 2005, we
completed the acquisition of Radianz, the leading
ﬁnancial services extranet provider, from Reuters for
consideration of £107 million including the cash on the
balance sheet, subject to working capital adjustments, at
completion date. The total amount invested in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, including further funding of existing
ventures, was £61 million, lower than the £77 million
invested in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 March 2005 amounted to £3,851 million
compared to £3,066 million at 31 March 2004, with the
increase due to the retained proﬁts of £938 million offset
by the £195 million buyback of shares and currency
movements.
BT Group plc, the parent company, had reserves of
£9,096 million at 31 March 2005 and £9,585 million at
31 March 2004.
BT’s ﬁxed assets totalled £16,654 million at 31 March
2005 of which £15,916 million were tangible assets,
principally forming the UK ﬁxed network. At 31 March
2004 ﬁxed assets were £16,015 million and tangible
assets were £15,487 million.
Return on capital employed
The return before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items on the average capital employed (total assets,
excluding goodwill, less current liabilities, excluding
corporate taxes and dividends payable, and provisions
other than those for deferred taxation) was 16.0% for the
2005 ﬁnancial year. In the 2004 ﬁnancial year the group
made a return before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items of 15.3%.
Pensions
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation
of the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), BT’s main pension
fund, performed by the BTPS independent actuary for the
trustees of the scheme, was carried out as at 31 December
2002. This valuation showed the fund to be in deﬁcit to
an amount of £2.1 billion. Assets of the fund of
£22.8 billion at that date covered 92% of the fund’s
liabilities. The previous valuation was carried out as at
31 December 1999. The result of this valuation was that
the fund was in deﬁcit by £1.0 billion. Assets of the fund
of £29.7 billion at that date covered 97% of the fund’s
liabilities. The deterioration in the funding position was
principally the result of lower equity returns over the three
years and improved life expectancy of BTPS members and
was in spite of the additional deﬁciency funding payments
totalling £600 million that were paid over the previous
three years. The valuation under the prescribed Minimum
Funding Requirement approach showed the assets to
cover 101% of the liabilities at 31 December 2002. The
next triennial valuation will be performed as at
31 December 2005.
The group’s ordinary contribution rate increased to
12.2% of employees’ pensionable pay with effect from
April 2003. The contribution rate was 11.6% for the 2003
ﬁnancial year. In addition, the company agreed to make
annual deﬁciency contributions to the BTPS of
£232 million with effect from the 2004 ﬁnancial year. In
the 2005 ﬁnancial year no deﬁciency payments were
made. This was because in the 2004 ﬁnancial year total
deﬁciency contributions of £612 million were made,
including early payment of £380 million scheduled for
payment in the 2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years. This
compares to the £200 million annual deﬁciency payments
made in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The group is also
required to pay special contributions to cover costs arising
from enhanced pension beneﬁts provided to leavers. The
special contributions paid in the 2005, 2004 and 2003
ﬁnancial years amounted to £6 million, £130 million and
£129 million, respectively, in respect of early leavers. The
payment expected to be made in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
is £nil in relation to leavers in the calendar year ended
31 December 2004.
The group continues to account for pension costs in
accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 24 (SSAP 24). The group’s total annual
pension charges for the 2005, 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial
years were £465 million, £404 million and £322 million,
respectively. This includes £430 million, £376 million and
£306 million, respectively, in relation to the BTPS. The
increase in the pension charge in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
reﬂects the introduction of Smart Pensions, a salary
sacriﬁce scheme, as a result of which there is a switch
between wages and salaries and pension charges. The
2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years include a £154 million
amortisation charge for the pension deﬁcit partly offset by
a reduction in the number of active members and the
interest credit related to the balance sheet prepayment.
The proﬁt and loss charge for providing incremental
pension beneﬁts for leavers amounted to £nil, £1 million
and £60 million in the 2005, 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial
years, respectively.
The pension charge for the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial
years is based upon the SSAP 24 valuation as at 31 March
2003. This valuation is based on the December 2002
funding valuation, rolled forward to 31 March 2003, and
uses a slightly higher investment return assumption than
was used for the trustees’ funding valuation, a lower
inﬂation rate and lower salary increase assumptions. The
resulting SSAP 24 deﬁcit amounts to £1.4 billion. The
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 39 regular pension cost is charged at 11.3% of pensionable
salaries compared to the 11.6% rate applied in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
The full FRS 17 disclosures are provided in the notes to
the ﬁnancial statements. At 31 March 2005 the FRS 17
deﬁcit was £3.3 billion, net of tax, being a £0.3 billion
reduction from £3.6 billion at 31 March 2004.
The number of retired members and other current
beneﬁciaries in the pension fund has been increasing in
recent years and, at 31 December 2004, was
approximately 122% higher than the number of active
members. Consequently, BT’s future pension costs and
contributions will depend on the investment returns of the
pension fund and could ﬂuctuate in the medium term.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March
2001 and we launched a new deﬁned contribution
pension scheme for people joining BT after that date
which is to provide beneﬁts based on the employees’ and
the employing company’s contributions. This change is in
line with the practice increasingly adopted by major UK
groups and is designed to be more ﬂexible for employees
and enable the group to determine its pension costs more
precisely than is the case for deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
The ﬁnancial impact of this change was not signiﬁcant in
the ﬁnancial years under review and is not expected to be
signiﬁcant in the next few years but it should reduce
pension costs in the longer term.
Geographical information
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, approximately 91% of the
group’s turnover was generated by operations in the UK,
compared with 93% in the 2004 and 94% in the 2003
ﬁnancial years. BT’s operating proﬁts have been derived
from its UK operations with losses being incurred outside
the UK in each of the last three ﬁnancial years.
Regulatory ﬁnancial information
BT is required under the continuation notice issued by
Oftel on 25 July 2003, which extends the applicability of
certain conditions previously included in its main licence
to cover the 2004 ﬁnancial year, to publish disaggregated
ﬁnancial information for various activities of the group,
which have been used as the basis of charges paid by
other telecommunication operators in the UK for the use
of BT’s network. New SMP conditions (see ‘Regulation,

activities presented separately in the regulatory ﬁnancial
statements do not necessarily correspond with any
businesses separately managed, funded or operated
within the group. The results set out in regulatory
ﬁnancial statements for the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial
years showed that the group’s operating proﬁt is derived
predominantly from ﬁxed-network calls.

Critical accounting policies
The group’s principal accounting policies are set out on
pages 72 to 74 of the Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
and conform with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (UK GAAP). In accordance with the
requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No.18,
these policies and applicable estimation techniques have
been reviewed by the directors who have conﬁrmed them
to be the most appropriate for the preparation of the
2005 ﬁnancial statements. Additionally, during the 2005
ﬁnancial year, the group adopted UITF Abstract 38
‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’ and the related amendments
to UITF Abstract 17 (revised 2003) ‘Employee Share
Schemes’. See note 1 on page 81 for details.
We, in common with virtually all other companies,
need to use estimates in the preparation of our ﬁnancial
statements. The most sensitive estimates affecting our
ﬁnancial statements are in the areas of assessing the level
of interconnect income with and payments to other
telecommunications operators, providing for doubtful
debts, establishing ﬁxed asset lives for depreciation
purposes, assessing the stage of completion and likely
outcome under long term contracts, making appropriate
long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities
and costs, making appropriate medium-term assumptions
on asset impairment reviews and calculating current tax
liabilities on our proﬁts.
We are required to interconnect our networks with
other telecommunications operators. In certain instances
we rely on other operators to measure the trafﬁc ﬂows
interconnecting with our networks. We use estimates in
these cases to determine the amount of income receivable
from or payments we need to make to these other
operators. The prices at which these services are charged
are often regulated and are subject to retrospective
adjustment. We use estimates in assessing the likely
effect of these adjustments.
We provide services to over 20 million individuals and
businesses, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain
debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a
small number of our customers. We use estimates, based
on our historical experience, in determining the level of
debts that we believe will not be collected. These
estimates include such factors as the current state of the
UK economy and particular industry issues.
The plant and equipment used in our networks is long-
lived with cables and switching equipment operating for
over ten years and underground ducts being used for
decades. The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to
the estimated service lives we allocate to each type of
asset. We regularly review these asset lives and change
them when necessary to reﬂect current thinking on their
remaining lives in light of technological change,
prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of
the assets concerned.
As part of the property rationalisation programme we
have identiﬁed a number of properties that are surplus to
requirements. Although efforts are being made to sub-let
this space it is recognised by management that this may
not be possible immediately in the current economic
environment. Estimates have been made of the cost of
vacant possession and any shortfall arising from the sub
lease rental income being lower than the lease costs being
borne by BT.
We enter into long term customer contracts which can
extend over a number of ﬁnancial years. During the
40 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review contractual period, turnover, costs and proﬁts may be
impacted by estimates of the ultimate proﬁtability of each
contract. If, at any time, these estimates indicate the
contract will be unproﬁtable, the entire estimated loss for
the contract is recognised immediately. The company
performs ongoing proﬁtability analyses of its contracts in
order to determine whether the latest estimates require
updating. Key factors reviewed include future staff and
third party costs and potential productivity efﬁciencies.
We have a commitment, mainly through the BT
Pension Scheme, to pay pension beneﬁts to
approximately 357,000 people over more than 60 years.
The cost of these beneﬁts and the present value of our
pension liabilities depend on such factors as the life
expectancy of the members, the salary progression of our
current employees, the return that the pension fund
assets will generate in the time before they are used to
fund the pension payments and the discount rate at which
the future pension payments are discounted. We use
estimates for all these factors in determining the pension
costs and liabilities incorporated in our ﬁnancial
statements.
The actual tax we pay on our proﬁts is determined
according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where the
effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, we use
estimates in determining the liability for the tax to be paid
on our past proﬁts which we recognise in our ﬁnancial
statements.
Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS)
In compliance with European Union regulations BT will be
adopting IFRS as the basis of accounting for the 2006
ﬁnancial year. This will lead to a number of changes in
future reported ﬁnancial information.
The group started its IFRS transition project in 2003.
The project team is overseen by the Group Finance
Director and regular updates have been provided to the
Audit Committee. The project has involved a detailed
assessment of the impact of IFRS on BT’s accounting
policies and reported results; system changes to capture
additional data; training of staff and communications. As
part of the transition to IFRS, in March 2005, we
presented on our investor relations website our view of
the pro forma ﬁnancial impact of adopting IFRS for the
2004 ﬁnancial year.
BT continues to report under UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP) for the 2005 ﬁnancial
year, but will be presenting ﬁnancial information in
accordance with IFRS for each quarter and the year
ending 31 March 2006.
The following provides additional information on the
unaudited pro forma impact of IFRS in advance of the
publication of the ﬁrst IFRS results, and the material
changes to BT’s accounting policies used to prepare the
ﬁnancial results for 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Whilst some of the changes required by IFRS will
impact BT’s reported proﬁts and net assets this has no
impact on the cash ﬂows generated by the business or the
cash resources available for investment or distribution to
shareholders. Furthermore the adoption of IFRS does not
affect BT’s strategy or underlying business performance.
It is important to note that the IFRS position as stated
is BT’s current view based on the ﬁnancial reporting
standards currently in issue and changes may arise as new
accounting pronouncements are developed and issued.
Due to a number of new and revised Standards included
within the body of Standards that comprise IFRS, there is
not yet a signiﬁcant body of established practice on which
to draw in forming opinions regarding interpretation and
application. Accordingly, practice is continuing to evolve.
At this stage, therefore, the full ﬁnancial effect of
reporting under IFRS, as it will be applied and reported in
the group’s ﬁrst IFRS ﬁnancial statements, may be subject
to change.
We estimate that the pro forma impact of adopting
IFRS on the reported UK GAAP results for the 2005
ﬁnancial year would have been negligible on the
underlying earnings, being the proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation, exceptional items and tax and the earnings
per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items. However, due to the inherent volatilities introduced
by IFRS, no such statement can be made in respect of
future years. These estimates exclude the mark to market
effects of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ which we are not required to apply until
1 April 2005.
Pensions
Under UK GAAP, the group measures pension
commitments and other related post-retirement beneﬁts
in accordance with SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension
Costs’ with additional disclosures provided in accordance
with FRS 17 ‘Retirement Beneﬁts’. Under IFRS, the group
will measure pension commitments and other related
post-retirement beneﬁts in accordance with IAS 19
‘Employee Beneﬁts’, which takes a similar approach to
FRS 17.
On adoption of IAS 19 the deﬁcit/surplus of deﬁned
beneﬁt pension schemes will be recognised on balance
sheet. The amended version of IAS 19, which is subject to
EU approval, allows companies to choose to recognise
actuarial gains and losses immediately in reserves or
alternatively to be held on the balance sheet and released
to the income statement over a period of time. BT has
elected to early adopt the amended version of IAS 19 and
reﬂect the impact of actuarial gains and losses
immediately in reserves.
The income statement charge is split between an
operating charge and a net ﬁnance charge. The net
ﬁnance charge relates to the unwinding of the discount
applied to the liabilities of the scheme offset by the
expected return on the assets of the scheme, based on
conditions prevailing at the start of the year.
Under SSAP 24, the asset on the balance sheet
represents the timing differences between the pension
charge to the proﬁt and loss account and the payments
made to the pension scheme. Under IFRS, the liability/
asset on the balance sheet represents the deﬁcit/surplus
in the pension scheme. The scheme assets are valued at
market value and the liabilities are discounted using a
high quality corporate bond rate.
Under SSAP 24, a pension charge for the 2005
ﬁnancial year of £465 million, including a charge for the
amortisation of the SSAP 24 deﬁcit in the BT Pension
Scheme, and an interest credit relating to the balance
sheet prepayment was recognised. Under IFRS the
estimated total charge of £342 million is split between an
operating charge of £540 million and a net ﬁnance
interest income of £198 million. Accordingly there is an
additional £75 million charge to operating proﬁt and a
net ﬁnance income of £198 million under IFRS.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 41 A pension liability of £4,781 million (£3,347 million net of
tax) would be recognised at 31 March 2005, offset by the
reversal of provisions and other creditors of £44 million,
and the pension prepayment on the UK GAAP balance
sheet of £1,118 million. The tax effect of this reversal is
£329 million. The net effect is a reduction in
shareholders’ funds of £4,092 million at 31 March 2005.
Share-based payment
Under UK GAAP an expense is recognised for the award of
share options and shares based on their intrinsic value
(the difference between the exercise price and the market
value at date of the award). The majority of BT’s
share-based payments are made under all employee Save
As You Earn plans which are exempt under UK GAAP and
the intrinsic value of many of the senior management
schemes is nil.
Under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’, an expense is
recognised in the income statement for all share-based
payments (both awards of options and awards of shares).
This expense is based on the fair value at the date of
grant of the award, using option pricing models, and is
charged over the related vesting period.
The accounting rules of IFRS 2 will result in an
estimated operating charge for the 2005 ﬁnancial year of
£39 million, which is offset by the reversal of the UK GAAP
charge of £11 million. The majority of this IFRS charge
relates to the group’s all employee Save As You Earn
schemes. There is a related tax credit of £9 million, offset
by the reversal of the UK GAAP tax credit of £3 million. The
credit for the share based payments is recognised directly
in reserves as the awards are equity settled.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
UK GAAP requires goodwill to be amortised over its
expected useful economic life. Under IFRS 3 ‘Business
Combinations’, goodwill is no longer amortised but held at
carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for
impairment. BT has elected to adopt the IFRS 1 exemption,
which allows existing UK GAAP goodwill at the transition
date not to be restated but to be tested for impairment.
IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ requires other intangible
assets arising on acquisitions after the transition date to
be separately identiﬁed and amortised over their useful
economic life, often a shorter period than for goodwill. As
a result, intangible assets such as customer relationships
and trademarks, need to be separately valued and
recognised on business combinations, and then amortised
over their useful economic lives.
The goodwill amortisation charged in 2005 ﬁnancial
year of £16 million under UK GAAP will be reversed.
During the year BT has undertaken a number of
acquisitions, detailed in note 15 to the accounts.
Events after the balance sheet date
Under UK GAAP, the dividend charge is recognised in the
proﬁt and loss account in the period to which it relates.
Under IAS 10 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, the
dividend charge is not recognised in the income
statement but is recognised directly in reserves. In
addition the dividend is required to be recognised in the
period in which it is declared.
The ﬁnal dividend creditor of £551 million for the
2005 ﬁnancial year will be reversed as it was not declared
at 31 March 2005.
Foreign exchange
Under UK GAAP, exchange differences arising from the
translation of inter-company loans, which provide ﬁnance
or provide a hedge against foreign undertakings, are
taken to reserves on consolidation. These exchange
differences are reported in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses. Under IAS 21 ‘The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, foreign exchange
gains and losses arising on certain inter-company loans
are excluded from the amount taken to reserve on
consolidation. Foreign exchange gains and losses on these
balances are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account
under IFRS.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year a consolidated foreign
exchange gain of £4 million, which was taken directly to
the proﬁt and loss reserve under UK GAAP, is reversed
into operating proﬁt.
Lease accounting
There is a requirement under IAS 17 ‘Leases’ to view
leases of land separately from leases of buildings.
Furthermore, there is a requirement to recognise
operating lease charges as an expense on a straight line
basis. As a result the building elements of a small number
of properties have been reclassiﬁed from operating leases
under UK GAAP to ﬁnance leases under IFRS, and lease
rentals under BT’s 2001 sale and leaseback transaction
are recognised on a straight line basis.
The proﬁt before tax for the 2005 ﬁnancial year will be
reduced by approximately £3 million, as a result of the
recognition of depreciation and ﬁnance lease interest
charges and the removal of the UK GAAP operating lease
charges for the properties reclassiﬁed as ﬁnance leases.
The charge for the 2005 ﬁnancial year will also reduce by
approximately £101 million due to operating lease
charges being recognised on a straight line basis.
Other adjustments
There are a number of other minor adjustments and
reclassiﬁcation under IFRS, including;
(i) Computer software that is not an integral part of
hardware is treated as an intangible asset. Under UK
GAAP, the group’s policy was to categorise all
capitalised software as tangible ﬁxed assets. This will
result in a balance sheet reclassiﬁcation.
(ii) Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
required to be shown separately on the face of the
balance sheet. Under UK GAAP the net deferred tax
liability was shown within provisions. This will result in
£1,660 million being reclassiﬁed to deferred tax assets
leaving £1,941 million as deferred tax liabilities.
(iii)Liquid investments with maturities of less than three
months at acquisition are included within cash and
cash equivalents rather than current asset investments
resulting in a reclassiﬁcation.
(iv)Cash ﬂow statements under IFRS have a different
presentational format although the underlying cash
ﬂows remain unchanged.
Financial instruments
BT has taken the IFRS 1 exemption not to restate
comparatives for the adoption of IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’, and IAS 39
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
These standards set out the accounting rules surrounding
the recognition, measurement, disclosure and
42 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Operating and ﬁnancial review presentation of ﬁnancial instruments. These standards will
be adopted by BT with effect from 1 April 2005.
The fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments,
existing at 1 April 2005, will be included on the balance
sheet at fair value. Future market interest rate and
currency movements will give rise to adjustments to these
fair values. Where hedge accounting cannot be applied
under the prescriptive rules of IAS 39, changes in market
values of ﬁnancial instruments will impact the proﬁt and
loss account. We expect group reserves at 1 April 2005 to
be approximately £500 million lower under IFRS, than
under UK GAAP, as a result of adopting IAS 39.
The group will present a reconciliation between the
closing 31 March 2005 UK GAAP equity and opening
1 April 2005 IFRS equity when the ﬁrst IFRS results are
announced for the ﬁrst quarter to 30 June 2005.
US GAAP
The group’s net income and earnings per share for the
three ﬁnancial years ended 31 March 2005 and
shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2005 and 2004 under
US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP)
are shown in the United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles Section. Differences between UK
GAAP and US GAAP include results of the differing
accounting treatment of leasing transactions, pension
costs, redundancy costs, intangible assets, goodwill,
deferred taxation, capitalisation of interest, ﬁnancial
instruments, share based payment and dividends. Cash
ﬂow information under the US GAAP presentation is also
shown further in this document.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (SFAS 123R)
‘Share-Based Payment’ which revises SFAS 123 and
supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires that the cost of
all share-based payment transactions be recognised in the
ﬁnancial statements. SFAS 123R also establishes fair
value as the measurement method in accounting for
share-based payments to employees. BT adopted SFAS
123R on 1 April 2005 using the modiﬁed prospective
transition method. BT estimates the application of the
expensing provisions of SFAS 123R will result in a pre-tax
expense of approximately £45 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year subject to additional grants and awards.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 (SFAS 153)
‘Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets – an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29’. SFAS 153 addresses the
measurement of exchanges of non-monetary assets. It
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets in
paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29 ‘Accounting for
Non-monetary Transactions’ and replaces it with an
exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash ﬂows of the entity are
expected to change signiﬁcantly as a result of the
exchange. As required by SFAS 153, we will adopt this
new accounting standard effective July 1, 2005. The
adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material
impact on our ﬁnancial position, results of operations or
cash ﬂows.
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 151 (SFAS 151),
‘Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter
4’, which clariﬁes that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
(spoilage) should be recognised as a current period
expense. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of
ﬁxed production overhead to the costs of conversion be
based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS 151 is effective for ﬁscal years beginning after June
15, 2005. BT does not believe that the implementation of
this standard will have a material impact on its ﬁnancial
position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF Issue No. 02-14 ‘Whether an Investor Should Apply
the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other
Than Common Stock’, in which the Task Force reached
the consensus that an investor that has the ability to
exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the operating and
ﬁnancial policies of the investee should apply the equity
method of accounting when it has an investment in
common stock and/or an investment that is in-substance
common stock. The consensus of this EITF is to be applied
in reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004.
We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have
a material impact on our ﬁnancial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows.
In October 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue No. 04-1 ‘Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships
between the Parties to a Business Combination’
(EITF 04-1). EITF 04-1 addresses the accounting
treatment of pre-existing relationships between the
parties of a business combination. The consensus of EITF
04-1 should be applied to business combinations
consummated and goodwill impairment tests performed
in reporting periods beginning after the FASB ratiﬁed the
consensus at its October 13, 2004 meeting. The group
will adopt the provisions of EITF 04-1 as of April 1, 2005.
If it is determined that assets of an acquired entity are
related to a pre-existing contractual relationship, thus
requiring accounting separate from the business
combination, BT will evaluate whether the acquiring
entity of the group should recognise contractual
relationships as assets separate from goodwill in that
business combination.
In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF
Issue No. 03-1, ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments’
(EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribed a three-step model
for determining whether an investment is other-than-
temporarily impaired and requires disclosure for
unrealized losses on investments. In September 2004, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1 ‘Effective
Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1’ (FSP
EITF 03-1-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective date
for the measurement and recognition guidance contained
in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1. The disclosure
requirements of EITF 03-1 remain effective for ﬁscal years
ending after June 15, 2004. No effective date for the
measurement and recognition guidance has been
established in FSP EITF 03-1-1. During the period of
delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that companies should
continue to apply current guidance to determine if an
impairment is other-than-temporary. The adoption of EITF
03-1, excluding paragraphs 10-20, did not impact the
group’s consolidated ﬁnancial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows. The group will assess the impact
of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 once the guidance has
been ﬁnalised.
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 43 Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
Managing social, ethical and environmental issues in a
way that grows shareholder value and helps BT and our
customers to be more sustainable is a key challenge for us.
The Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes rank companies
for their success in managing social, ethical and
environmental factors for competitive advantage. During
the 2005 ﬁnancial year, BT was ranked as the top
telecommunications company in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the fourth year in a row.
We also hold the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in
recognition of our contribution to sustainable
development.
This section of the report, together with the broad
statement on social, environmental and ethical matters
included in the section on Corporate governance,
provides information in response to the Association of
British Insurers’ disclosure guidelines on social
responsibility.
More detailed disclosures on BT’s implementation of
social, ethical and environmental policies and procedures
are available online in our independently-veriﬁed social
and environmental report, which has been prepared in
accordance with the 2002 Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines.
CSR governance
The Board reviews our CSR strategy and performance
annually and is kept informed of our main CSR risks and
opportunities as well as new developments that may
impact on its duties.
A Board committee – the Community Support
Committee – oversees community, charitable and arts
expenditure and the strategy for maximising our
contribution to society. The committee, chaired by
Sir Christopher Bland, consists of representatives from BT
businesses, two non-executive directors and two external
independent members, who have a reputation for
excellence in this ﬁeld.
An executive committee, the Corporate Social
Responsibility Steering Group (CSRSG), oversees the
implementation of our CSR strategy and programme. This
includes risk assessment, target and objective setting,
ISO 14001 certiﬁcation – the international standard for
environmental management systems – and public
accountability.
The CSRSG consists of CSR champions nominated by
the lines of business and seven support functions (human
resources, corporate governance, health and safety, group
property, communications, internal audit and
procurement).
The CSRSG is chaired by BT’s CSR champion, Alison
Ritchie, Chief Broadband Ofﬁcer and a member of the
Operating Committee. It is supported by advice from an
independent panel of CSR experts.
Embedding CSR into BT’s commercial operations is an
important part of our CSR strategy, and a key part of our
work in the 2005 ﬁnancial year has been extending our
CSR activity into our global operations. We have carried
out a number of ‘health checks’ in our commercial
operations to identify speciﬁc social, economic and
environmental impacts (positive and negative) and
particular CSR risks and opportunities. A report is then
compiled which includes recommended actions.
We have important relationships with a wide range of
stakeholders, including employees, customers and
suppliers. We engage with these stakeholders in a number
of ways, including consumer liaison panels, an annual
employee survey and a supplier relationship management
programme.
Our CSR team co-ordinates and monitors CSR
performance, identiﬁes potential issues and opportunities
that might affect the business, and supports BT’s
commercial activities.
As part of our CSR performance measurement, we
have 12 non-ﬁnancial KPIs (key performance indicators)
which provide a comprehensive overview of BT’s social
and environmental performance. Our performance against
these is published in our annual Social and Environmental
report.
Social, environmental and ethical risks
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we further increased our
understanding of our CSR risks. Privacy has been
identiﬁed as an additional risk and we have developed a
set of privacy principles for the business and
commissioned research on the topic of privacy in the
digital networked economy.
In the context of CSR, our most signiﬁcant risks are:
& supply chain working conditions;
& health and safety;
& climate change;
& diversity;
& offshoring or the ‘geography of jobs’;
& breach of the code of business ethics; and
& privacy.
Each of these risks has a risk owner and mitigation
strategy in place (more detail on these can be found in
our online social and environmental report).
CSR business opportunities
There is a direct link between our CSR activity, corporate
reputation and customer satisfaction. A detailed analysis
in 2001 of customer opinion data based on tens of
thousands of interviews showed that a 1% improvement
in the public’s perception of our CSR activities resulted in
a 0.1% increase in our retail customer satisfaction ﬁgures.
This underlines how important it is not only to protect
our reputation through appropriate risk management
activities, but also to enhance it through our community
activities.
Long-term sustainability trends are creating market
opportunities for us, such as the use of teleconferencing
and ﬂexible working to reduce the need to travel and
provide more ﬂexible lifestyles.
Increasingly, BT has to address social and
environmental matters when bidding for business. In the
2005 ﬁnancial year, bids to the value of £2.2 billion
required us to demonstrate expertise in managing these
issues.
Environment
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we retained ISO 14001
accreditation for our UK operations and BT Spain and
extended it to BT Ireland.
BT is one of the largest consumers of industrial and
commercial electricity in the UK, and the growth of
broadband has, as expected, increased our electricity use.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, our usage increased by 3.1%.
However, we also signed the world’s largest green energy
contract which means that almost all of BT’s UK
electricity needs will be met from environmentally-friendly

to ﬁnd effective ways to use communications technology
to tackle social exclusion. On 12 October 2004, BT was
involved, as a founder member, in the launch of the
Alliance for Digital Inclusion.
Our involvement in the EverybodyOnline programme,
established in partnership with charity campaign group
Citizens Online, continues to be a key part of our digital
inclusion campaign. The campaign aims to increase skills
and access to communications technology in deprived
communities and to increase the understanding of the
causes and effects of the digital divide and how they can
be addressed at a national level.
Community
We commit a minimum of 0.5% of our UK pre-tax proﬁts
directly to activities which support society. This has
ranged from £10 million in 1987, peaking at £16 million
in 2001 and we provided £9.1 million in the 2005
ﬁnancial year. BT operations also provided a further
£11.7 million in funding and support in kind over the past
ﬁnancial year. In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, BT made
charitable donations of £2 million.
The focus of our community programmes is on big
issues where better communication can make a real
difference to society. For example, more than 10,500
schools and over two million young people have taken
part in the BT Education Programme – a drama-based
campaign helping children to improve their
communication skills. This activity is supported by our
volunteering programme which has several thousand
registered volunteers working with schools.
ChildLine, a UK charity, answers 2,300 calls every day
but many hundreds more go unanswered. We are working
with ChildLine on a campaign to ensure that every child’s
call for help is answered.
In addition, BT people gave £2 million directly to
charities during the 2005 ﬁnancial year through Give as
you Earn, to which BT added a direct contribution of
£1 million.
Tsunami response
BT played a role in the response to the Asian tsunami of
26 December 2004. We set up a live call centre at the BT
Tower to handle the unprecedented number of calls the
Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) was experiencing
and also ran the online donation facility. Individual
employees and the lines of business were also involved in
fundraising efforts. Sixteen BT engineers travelled to the
affected area to help re-establish the telecommunications
infrastructure. We made an immediate £500,000
donation.
Disability services
Our Age and Disability Action team promotes equal
access to a wide range of products and services. We work
directly with older and disabled people and their
representatives to raise awareness of BT’s inclusive
approach and are continuing to develop our processes to
ensure that new products and services are accessible to
disabled people.
For people with hearing or speech impairments, for
example, our textphone offers easy access to BT
TextDirect – the service that enables users to dial direct
to other text or voice users. Customers with visual or
mobility impairments beneﬁt from products with large,
clear keypads and cordless or hands-free options. During
the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we also launched Relate 3000, an
inclusively designed phone and our new BT Text service,
which includes a speaking SMS facility.

Board of directors and Operating Committee BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 47 The directors submit their report and the audited ﬁnancial
statements of the company, BT Group plc, and the group,
which includes its subsidiary undertakings, for the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
Introduction
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for
the BT group of companies.
The Operating and ﬁnancial review on pages 6 to 45,
the discussion on Corporate governance on pages 50 to
55, the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 56
to 68 and Risk Factors on page 126 form part of this
report. The audited ﬁnancial statements are presented on
pages 71 to 122.
Principal activity
The group’s principal activity is the supply
of communications services and equipment. In the 2005
ﬁnancial year, approximately 91% of group turnover arose
from operations in the UK.
Directors
The names and biographical details of the directors of the
company are given on pages 46 and 47. All served
throughout the ﬁnancial year, with the exception of Hanif
Lalani, who was appointed on 7 February 2005. Pierre
Danon served as a director until 28 February 2005.
In accordance with the articles of association, Hanif
Lalani, having been appointed as a director by the Board,
retires at the forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM)
and will be proposed for election. Ben Verwaayen, Paul
Reynolds, Carl Symon and Baroness Jay retire by rotation
and will be proposed for re-election. Details of these
directors’ contracts of appointment are included in the
Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 56 to 68
and the discussion on Corporate governance on pages 50
to 55.
Substantial shareholdings
At 18 May 2005, the company had received notiﬁcations
from Legal & General Investment Management Limited,
Barclays PLC and Brandes Investment Partners LLC, under
Part VI of the Companies Act 1985, in respect of holdings
of 289,727,496 shares, 341,139,080 shares and
347,201,310 shares respectively, representing holdings of
3.4%, 4.01% and 4.08% of the company’s issued
ordinary share capital.
Interest of management in certain transactions
During and at the end of the 2005 ﬁnancial year, none of
the company’s directors was materially interested in any
material transaction in relation to the group’s business
and none is materially interested in any presently
proposed material transactions.
Policy on the payment of suppliers
BT’s policy is to use its purchasing power fairly and to pay
promptly and as agreed.
BT has a variety of payment terms with its suppliers.
The terms for payments for purchases under major
contracts are settled when agreeing the other terms
negotiated with the individual suppliers. It is BT’s current
policy to make payments for other purchases within 30
working days of the invoice date, provided that the
relevant invoice is presented to the company in a timely
fashion and is complete. BT’s payment terms are printed
on the company’s standard purchase order forms or,
where appropriate, speciﬁed in individual contracts
agreed with the supplier. The ratio, expressed in days,
between the amounts invoiced to the company by its
suppliers in the 2005 ﬁnancial year and the amounts
owed to its trade creditors at the end of the year was 36
calendar days.
Political donations
The company’s continuing policy is that no company in
the group shall make contributions in cash or kind to any
political party. Arrangements are in place to implement
this policy. However, the deﬁnition of political donations
used in the Companies Act 1985 is very much broader
than the sense in which these words are ordinarily used. It
covers activities such as making MPs and others in the
political world aware of key industry issues and matters
affecting the company, which make an important
contribution to their understanding of BT. These activities
are carried out on an even-handed basis related broadly to
the major UK political parties’ electoral strength. The
authority we are requesting at the AGM is not designed to
change the above policy. It will, however, ensure that BT
acts within the provisions of the Companies Act 1985
requiring companies to obtain shareholder authority
before they can make donations to EU political
organisations (which includes UK political parties) as
deﬁned in the Act. During the 2005 ﬁnancial year the
company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, British
Telecommunications plc, made the following payments to
cover the cost of hosting brieﬁng meetings about the
company’s activities with MPs and MEPs: Labour Party
£10,972; Conservative Party £5,930; Liberal Democrats
Party £2,907; Scottish National Party £2,000; Plaid
Cymru £500.
Auditors
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors of the company and to authorise the directors to
settle their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.
Authority to purchase shares
The authority given at last year’s AGM of the company held
on 14 July 2004 for the company to purchase in the market
859 million of its shares, representing 10% of the issued
share capital, expires on 13 October 2005. Shareholders
will be asked to give a similar authority at the AGM.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, 101 million shares of
5 pence each were purchased under this authority (1.2%
of the share capital) for a total consideration of £195
million, at an average price of £1.92 per share. The shares
were purchased in an on-market programme of buying
back the company’s shares, initiated in November 2003,
as part of the company’s shareholder distribution strategy.
36 million shares were cancelled and 134 million shares
have been retained as treasury shares. At 18 May 2005,
11 million treasury shares had been transferred to meet
the company’s obligations under its employee share plans.

the separate Notice of Annual General Meeting sent to all
shareholders.

Registered ofﬁce: 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ
Registered in England and Wales No. 4190816
Report of the directors BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 49 It is BT’s policy to achieve for all our operations best
practice in our standards of business integrity. This
includes a commitment to maintaining the highest
standards of corporate governance and ethics throughout
the group.
The directors consider that BT has, throughout the
year, complied with the provisions set out in section 1 of
the 2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board
Composition and role
The Board, which operates as a single team, is currently
made up of the part-time Chairman, the Chief Executive,
four other executive directors and seven non-executive
directors. All of the non-executive directors meet the
criteria for independence set out in the Combined Code
and are therefore considered by the Board to be
independent. It is BT’s policy that the Board will comprise
a majority of independent non-executive directors. The
directors’ biographies are set out on pages 46 and 47.
The Board’s principal focus is the overall strategic
direction, development and control of the group. In
support of this the Board approves the group’s values,
business practice policies, strategic plans, annual budget,
capital expenditure and investments budgets, larger
capital expenditure proposals and the group’s overall
system of internal controls, governance and compliance
authorities. It also has oversight and control of the
group’s operating and ﬁnancial performance. These
responsibilities are set out in a formal statement of the
Board’s role. The Board has agreed the group’s corporate
governance framework, including empowering the
company’s key management committee, the Operating
Committee,to make decisions on operational and other
matters. The roles and powers of this committee are set
out later in this report under Principal Board committees.
Their powers and the authorities delegated to individual
members of the Operating Committee are available to
everyone in the group on the group’s intranet site.
Historically the Board has met every month, except in
August. Additionally, it meets on an ad hoc basis to
consider matters which are time critical. The Board met
14 times during the 2005 ﬁnancial year. For the 2006
ﬁnancial year, and going forward, the standard Board
cycle will be nine, not 11, meetings each year.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are
separate. They are set out in written job descriptions,
approved by the Nominating Committee. In addition to
chairing the Board, the Chairman is responsible for
consulting the non-executive directors, particularly the
Deputy Chairman, on corporate governance issues,
matters considered by the Nominating Committee, which
the Chairman chairs, and the individual performances of
the non-executive directors. The Chairman and the non-
executive directors hold regular dinners at which they
discuss matters without the executive directors being
present. With the Chief Executive and the Secretary, the
Chairman ensures the Board is kept properly informed, is
consulted on all issues reserved to it and that its decisions
are made in a timely and considered way that enables the
directors to fulﬁl their ﬁduciary duties. The Chairman
ensures that the views of the shareholders are known to
the Board and considered appropriately. He represents
the company in speciﬁed strategic and Government
relationships, as agreed with the Chief Executive, and
generally acts as the bridge between the Board and the
Company’s executive team, particularly on the Group’s
broad strategic direction. The Chief Executive has ﬁnal
executive responsibility to the Board for the success of the
group. The Chairman’s other current signiﬁcant
commitments are shown in his biography on page 46.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year the only change has been
his appointment as Chairman of the Royal Shakespeare
Company.
The Secretary manages the provision of timely,
accurate and considered information to the Board for its
meetings and, in consultation with the Chairman and
Chief Executive, at other appropriate times. He
recommends to the Chairman and the Chief Executive, for
Board consideration where appropriate, the company’s
corporate governance policies and practices and is
responsible for their communication and implementation.
The appointment and removal of the Secretary is a matter
for the whole Board. He advises the Board on appropriate
procedures for the management of its meetings and
duties (and the meetings of the company’s principal
committees), as well as the implementation of corporate
governance and compliance within the group.
BT’s non-executive directors
The Nominating Committee has agreed and periodically
reviews the combination of experience, skills and other
attributes which the non-executive directors as a whole
are to bring to the Board. This proﬁle is used by the
Committee when the appointment of a non-executive
director is being considered to assess the suitability of
candidates who are put forward by the directors and
outside consultants. Short-listed candidates meet the
Committee, which then recommends to the Board a
candidate for appointment.
The non-executive directors provide a strong,
independent element on the Board. Between them, they
bring experience and independent judgement, gained at
the most senior levels, of international business
operations and strategy, marketing, technology,
communications and political and international affairs.
Sir Anthony Greener, the Deputy Chairman, is the
senior independent director. He chairs the Audit and
Remuneration committees. In his capacity as the chairman
of the Remuneration Committee,he meets with BT’s major
institutional shareholders. The Deputy Chairman also
continues to be available to discuss matters with
institutional shareholders where it would be inappropriate
for those discussions to take place with either the
Chairman or the Chief Executive. He will also attend, at
his discretion and in consultation with the Chairman and
the Chief Executive, other meetings with shareholders
during the year. The other non-executive directors may
attend, at their request, meetings with the company’s
major shareholders and others.
Non-executive directors are appointed initially for three
years, subject to three months’ termination notice from
either BT or the director. At the end of the ﬁrst three
years the appointment may be continued by mutual
agreement. Each non-executive director is provided, upon
appointment, with a letter setting out the terms of his or
her appointment, including membership of Board
committees, the fees to be paid and the time
commitment expected from the director. The letter also
covers such matters as the conﬁdentiality of information
and the company’s share dealing code.
Corporate governance
50 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Election and re-election
All directors are required by the company’s articles of
association to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM
after their appointment, if appointed by the Board. A
director must subsequently retire by rotation at an AGM
at intervals of not more than three years. The director
may seek re-election.
Service agreements
The Chairman and executive directors have service
agreements, which are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. Information about the periods of these
contracts is in the Report on directors’ remuneration.
Independent advice
The Board has a procedure for directors, in furtherance of
their duties, to take independent professional advice if
necessary, at the company’s expense. In addition, all
directors have access to the advice and services of the
Secretary.
Training and information
On appointment, the directors take part in an induction
programme when they receive information about BT, the
role of the Board and the matters reserved for its
decision, the terms of reference and membership of the
principal Board committees, and the powers delegated to
those committees, the company’s corporate governance
policies and procedures, including the powers reserved to
the group’s most senior executives, and the latest
ﬁnancial information about the group. This is
supplemented by visits to key BT locations and meetings
with members of the Operating Committee and other key
senior executives. Throughout their period in ofﬁce the
directors are continually updated on BT’s business, the
competitive and regulatory environments in which it
operates, technology and corporate social responsibility
matters and other changes affecting BT and the
communications industry as a whole, by written brieﬁngs
and meetings with senior BT executives. Directors are also
advised on appointment of their legal and other duties
and obligations as a director of a listed company, both in
writing and in face-to-face meetings with the Secretary.
They are reminded of these duties each year and they are
also updated on changes to the legal, accounting and
governance requirements upon the company and
themselves as directors. During the 2005 ﬁnancial year,
for example, they have attended a presentation on the
effects of the introduction of international ﬁnancial
reporting standards on the Group’s results and have
received further brieﬁngs on the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, which affects BT because its securities are
registered with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), changes to UK company law and
various corporate governance proposals from the
European Commission.
Guidelines are in place concerning the content,
presentation and delivery of papers for each Board
meeting, so that the directors have enough information to
be properly briefed sufﬁciently far ahead of each Board
meeting and at other appropriate times.
Board evaluation
During summer 2004 the Board carried out, through a
questionnaire and discussion with directors, a formal
evaluation of Board and Board committee performance.
The individual performance of directors was also
evaluated at one-to-one sessions with the Chairman. As
part of this process, the Deputy Chairman, Sir Anthony
Greener, met all directors individually to review the
Chairman’s performance. The results of that exercise were
considered by the Board in July 2004 and a number of
actions agreed. These evaluations will be carried out
annually.
Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance and
indemnity
For some years the company has purchased insurance to
cover its directors and ofﬁcers against their costs in
defending themselves in civil legal proceedings taken
against them in that capacity and in respect of damages
resulting from the unsuccessful defence of any
proceedings. At the date upon which this report was
approved, and throughout the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the
company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, British
Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity in
respect of all the company’s directors. Neither the
insurance nor the indemnity provide cover where the
director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Principal Board committees
To meet best corporate governance practice, Audit,
Remuneration and Nominating Committees have long
been an established part of BT’s system of governance.
Each committee has written terms of reference, which are
available on the company’s website. The minutes of Audit
and Nominating Committee meetings are sent, at their
request, to directors who are not a member of a
committee. In the case of the Remuneration Committee,
minutes are circulated, on request, to other non-executive
directors as well as to members of the committee.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Sir Anthony Greener,
the Deputy Chairman and senior independent director.
The other members are Maarten van den Bergh, Clay
Brendish, Lou Hughes, John Nelson and Carl Symon. They
are all independent non-executive directors. They were
members of the committee throughout the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. The Board considers that the Committee’s members
have broad commercial experience and extensive business
leadership, having held various roles in accountancy,
ﬁnancial management and supervision, treasury and
corporate ﬁnance and that there is a broad and suitable
mix of business, ﬁnancial and IT experience on the
Committee. The Board has reviewed membership of the
Committee and is satisﬁed that several of the
Committee’s members have the recent and relevant
ﬁnancial experience required for the provisions of the
Combined Code.
The Committee recommends the appointment and
reappointment of the company’s external auditors and
considers their resignation or dismissal, recommending to
the Board appropriate action to appoint new auditors. It
ensures that key partners are rotated at appropriate
intervals. It discusses with the auditors the scope of their
audits before they commence, reviews the results and
considers the formal reports of the auditors and reports
the results of those reviews to the Board. It reviews the
auditors’ performance, including the scope of the audit,
and recommends to the Board appropriate remuneration.
Corporate governance BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 51 As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may
be necessary to employ the company’s external auditors
for certain non-audit work. In order to safeguard the
independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the
Board has determined policies as to what non-audit
services can be provided by the company’s external
auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not
be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear
efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the company. The
overall policies and the processes to implement them
were reviewed and appropriately modiﬁed in the light of
the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
relating to non-audit services that external auditors may
not perform. The Audit Committee monitors the extent of
non-audit work being performed by the company’s
auditors and approves such work before it is undertaken.
It also monitors the level of non-audit fees paid to the
external auditors.
The Audit Committee reviews the company’s published
ﬁnancial results, the Annual Report and Form 20-F and
other published information for statutory and regulatory
compliance. It reports its views to the Board to assist it in
its approval of the results’ announcements and the Annual
Report and Form 20-F. The Committee also reviews the
disclosure made by the Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director during the certiﬁcation process for the
annual report about the design or operation of internal
controls or material weaknesses in the controls, including
any fraud involving management or other employees who
have a signiﬁcant role in the company’s ﬁnancial controls.
The Board, as required by UK law, takes responsibility for
all disclosures in the annual report.
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the
standards of risk management and internal control, the
effectiveness of internal control, ﬁnancial reporting,
accounting policies and procedures, and the company’s
statements on internal controls before they are agreed by
the Board for each year’s annual report. It also reviews
the company’s internal audit function and its relationship
with the external auditors, including internal audit’s plans
and performance. It reviews the arrangements for dealing,
in conﬁdence, with complaints from employees about
accounting or ﬁnancial management impropriety, fraud,
poor business practices and other matters. At each of its
meetings it reviews with the group chief internal auditor
and appropriate executives the implementation and
effectiveness of key operational and functional change
and remedial programmes. The Committee also sets aside
time at every meeting to seek the views of the company’s
internal and external auditors in the absence of
executives.
In addition to carrying out those regular tasks which
are within the Committee’s terms of reference and which
are described above, it has also carried out its annual
consideration of the group’s risk register, as submitted to
it by the Operating Committee, and reviewed the
company’s system of internal control, its accounting
systems, IT security and fraud and related matters. It also
considered the effect on the company’s results of the
introduction of international ﬁnancial reporting standards,
which have applied to the company’s results from the
ﬁnancial year beginning on 1 April 2005. The Committee
has also reviewed at each of its meetings during the 2005
ﬁnancial year the steps being taken within the group with
regard to the application of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
dealing with the internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
It also speciﬁcally evaluated its performance and
processes and has reviewed the experience, skills and
succession planning within the Group’s ﬁnance function.
The Group Finance Director, the Secretary, the group’s
chief internal auditor and the company’s external auditors
attend the Committee’s meetings. The Committee met
four times during the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises solely independent
non-executive directors and is chaired by Sir Anthony
Greener. It met ﬁve times during the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Further details about the Committee are included in the
Report on directors’ remuneration.
Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee consists of the Chairman, the
Deputy Chairman, John Nelson and Maarten van den
Bergh. Its members have not changed during the 2005
ﬁnancial year. The Secretary and, where appropriate, at
the invitation of the Chairman, the Chief Executive
attends the Committee’s meetings. It ensures an
appropriate balance of experience and abilities on the
Board, using this evaluation to review the size and
composition of the Board and to recommend any
proposed changes to the Board. It keeps under review the
need for appointments to the Board, prepares a
description of the speciﬁc experience and skills needed for
an appointment, considers candidates who are put
forward by the directors and external consultants, and
recommends to the Board the appointments of all
directors after having met short-listed candidates. It also
reviews the time required from the Deputy Chairman and
other non-executive directors to carry out their duties and
advises the Board on succession planning for the positions
of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Chief Executive and
all other Board appointments. The Committee met four
times during the 2005 ﬁnancial year. It reviewed the
current structure, proﬁle and balance of the Board,
approved the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s job
descriptions and the Board and Board committee
evaluation questionnaire and process. The Committee
also reviewed and recommended to the Board the
continued appointments as non-executive directors of
Baroness Jay, John Nelson (who did not take part in the
review of his own reappointment) and Carl Symon.

Operating Committee
The Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, chairs the Operating
Committee, which meets weekly. The other members are
the Group Finance Director, the Chief Executives of BT
Retail, BT Wholesale and BT Global Services and the Chief
Broadband Ofﬁcer. The Secretary attends all meetings.
The Group Strategy and the Group HR Directors normally
attend each meeting. The Committee has collective
responsibility for running the group’s business end-to-
end. To do that, it develops the group’s strategy and
budget for Board approval, recommends to the Board the
group’s capital expenditure and investments budgets,
monitors the ﬁnancial, operational and customer quality
of service performance of the whole group, reviews the
group’s risks register, allocates resources across the group
within plans agreed by the Board, plans and delivers
major cross-business programmes and reviews the senior
talent base and succession plans of the group. Within the
group’s corporate governance framework, approved by
the Board, the Operating Committee is empowered to
approve up to limits after which Board approval is
required, capital expenditure, disposals of ﬁxed assets,
the making of investments by the group and divestments.
It is authorised to delegate these approvals, up to its own
limits, to senior executives.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the group’s systems of
internal control and risk management and for reviewing
the effectiveness of those systems. Such systems are
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives; any system can
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The Board also takes account of signiﬁcant social,
environmental and ethical matters that relate to BT’s
businesses and reviews annually BT’s corporate social
responsibility. The company’s workplace practices,
speciﬁc environmental, social and ethical risks and
opportunities and details of underlying governance
processes are dealt with in Our people and Our
commitment to society.
BT has processes for identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the group. These
processes have been in place for the whole of the 2005
ﬁnancial year and have continued up to the date on which
this document was approved. The processes are in
accordance with the Turnbull guidance for directors
published in the UK in September 1999.
Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an
integral part of the group’s annual strategic planning
cycle. The group has a detailed risk management process,
culminating in a Board review, which identiﬁes the key
risks facing the group and each business unit. This
information is reviewed by senior management as part of
the strategic review. The group’s current key risks are
summarised in Risk factors of this document.
The key features of the risk management process
comprise the following procedures:
& senior executives, led by the Secretary, review the
group’s key risks and have created a group risk
register, describing the risks, owners and mitigation
strategies. This is reviewed by the Operating Committee
before being reviewed and approved by the Board.
& the lines of business carry out risk assessments of their
operations, have created registers relating to those
risks, and ensure that the key risks are addressed.
& senior management report regularly to the Group
Finance Director on the operation of internal controls
in their area of responsibility.
& the Chief Executive receives annual reports from senior
executives with responsibilities for major group
operations with their opinion on the effectiveness of
the operation of internal controls during the ﬁnancial
year.
& the group’s internal auditors carry out continuing
assessments of the quality of risk management and
control. Internal Audit reports to the management and
the Audit Committee on the status of speciﬁc areas
identiﬁed for improvement. Internal audit also
promotes effective risk management in the lines of
business operations.
& the Audit Committee,on behalf of the Board, considers
the effectiveness of the operation of internal control
processes and procedures in the group during the
ﬁnancial year, including the review of reports from the
internal auditors and from the external auditors, and
reports its conclusions to the Board. The Audit
Committee has carried out these actions for the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
New subsidiaries acquired during the year have not
been included in the above risk management process.
They will be included for the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
Material joint ventures and associates, which BT does
not control, outside the UK have not been dealt with as
part of the group for the purposes of this internal control
assessment.
The Board has approved the formal statement of
matters which are reserved to it for consideration,
approval or oversight. It has also approved the group’s
corporate governance framework, which sets out the high
level principles by which the group is managed and the
responsibilities and powers of the Operating Committee
Corporate governance BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 53 and the group’s senior executives. As part of this
framework the development and implementation of
certain powers relating to group-wide policies and
practices are reserved to identiﬁed senior executives.
Relations with shareholders
Senior executives, led by the Chief Executive and the
Group Finance Director and including, as appropriate, the
other executive directors, hold meetings with the
company’s principal institutional shareholders to discuss
the company’s strategy, ﬁnancial performance and
speciﬁc major investment activities. The Deputy
Chairman also attends, at his discretion and in
consultation with the Chairman and the Chief Executive,
meetings with shareholders during the year. The company
also maintains contact, when appropriate, through the
chairman of the Remuneration Committee and other senior
executives to discuss overall remuneration policies and
plans. Contact with institutional shareholders (and with
ﬁnancial analysts, brokers and the media) is controlled by
written guidelines to ensure the protection of share price
sensitive information that has not already been made
generally available to the company’s shareholders. The
directors are provided with either full or summarised
reports and other written brieﬁngs from the company’s
major shareholders and analysts and are regularly
informed by the Secretary about the holdings of its
principal shareholders. The Secretary also surveys the
company’s retail shareholders about the quality of the
company’s shareholder communications and share
registration services.
We are continuing our policy that shareholders vote on
the annual report at the AGM. Shareholders will also again
be asked to vote on the Report on directors’
remuneration.
It is part of our policy to involve shareholders fully in
the affairs of the company and to give them the
opportunity at the AGM to ask questions about the
company’s activities and prospects. We also give the
shareholders the opportunity to vote on every
substantially different issue by proposing a separate
resolution for each issue.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well
as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM and the
results will be made available at the meeting after the
shareholders have voted on each resolution on a show of
hands and at the end of the meeting. It is our policy for all
directors to attend the AGM if at all possible. Whilst,
because of ill health or other pressing reasons, this may
not always be possible, in normal circumstances this
means that the chairman of the Audit, Nominating and
Remuneration committees is at the AGM and is available
to answer relevant questions.
The Annual Review and, if requested, the Annual
Report and Form 20-F, together with the Notice of the
AGM, are sent to shareholders in the most cost-effective
fashion, given the large number of shareholders. We aim
to give as much notice as possible and at least 21 clear
days, as required by the company’s articles of association.
In practice, these documents are being sent to
shareholders more than 20 working days before the AGM.
Established procedures ensure the timely release of
share price sensitive information and the publication of
the company’s ﬁnancial results and regulatory ﬁnancial
statements. All external announcements are also reviewed
for accuracy and compliance requirements by a
committee of senior, functional executives, the Disclosure
Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary.
Statement of business practice
To reinforce our commitment to achieve best practice in
our standards of business integrity and ethics, BT has a
written statement of business practice (The Way We Work).
The statement covers all our operations and reﬂects the
expectations in the area of corporate governance and
business practice standards. A copy of the statement has
been sent to every employee. Copies are also sent to the
employees of newly acquired subsidiaries.
These high-level principles are supported by a
continuing and comprehensive communications
programme and online training. A conﬁdential helpline
and e-mail facility are also available to employees who
have questions about the application of these principles.
The helpline number is published externally. We also
continue to require our agents and contractors to apply
these principles when representing BT.
Pension funds
BT’s two main pension funds – the BT Pension Scheme
and the BT Retirement Plan – are not controlled by the
Board but by separate trustees who are company and
union nominees, under independent chairmen. The
trustees look after the assets of the funds, which are held
separately from those of the company. The pension funds’
assets can only be used in accordance with their
respective rules and for no other purpose.
Financial statements
A statement by the directors of their responsibilities for
preparing the ﬁnancial statements is included in the
Statement of directors’ responsibility. The directors’
statement on going concern is on page 38 of the Financial
review.
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
BT has securities registered with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, BT is obliged to
comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
applicable to foreign issuers. BT will comply with the legal
and regulatory requirements introduced pursuant to this
legislation, in so far as they are applicable to the group.
Given the narrow and prescriptive deﬁnition under the
relevant SEC rules, it is the opinion of the Board that the
Audit Committee does not include a member who is an
‘audit committee ﬁnancial expert’. However, the Board
considers that the Committee’s members have broad
commercial experience and extensive business leadership,
having held various roles in accountancy, ﬁnancial
management and supervision, treasury and corporate
ﬁnance and that there is a broad and suitable mix of
business, ﬁnancial and IT experience on the Committee.
The Board and its committees are keeping the
appointment of a ﬁnancial expert, as deﬁned by US law,
under review.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, after
evaluating the effectiveness of BT’s disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report and Form 20-F, have concluded that, as of
such date, BT’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to ensure that material information relating to
BT was made known to them by others within the group.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director have also
54 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Corporate governance provided the certiﬁcations required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.
There were no changes in BT’s internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during the year ended
31 March 2005 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, BT’s internal control
over ﬁnancial reporting.

The New York Stock Exchange
The company, as a foreign issuer with American
Depositary Shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), is obliged to disclose any signiﬁcant ways in
which its corporate governance practices differ from the
corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE.
The company has reviewed the NYSE’s new listing
standards and believes that its corporate governance
practices are consistent with them, with the following
exception where the company does not meet the strict
requirements set out in the standards. The standards
state that companies must have a nominating/corporate
governance committee composed entirely of independent
directors and with written terms of reference which, in
addition to identifying individuals qualiﬁed to become
board members, develops and recommends to the Board
a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the
company. BT has a Nominating Committee.It does not
develop corporate governance principles for the Board’s
approval. The Board approves the group’s overall system
of internal controls, governance and compliance
authorities. The Board and the Nominating Committee are
made up of a majority of independent, non-executive
directors.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC and NYSE rules will
require the company from 31 July 2005 to comply with
certain provisions relating to the Audit Committee. These
include the independence of Audit Committee members
and procedures for the treatment of complaints regarding
accounting or auditing matters. The company is already
fully compliant with these requirements.

This part of the Report on directors’ remuneration is
not subject to audit.
(i) Constitution and process
The directors consider that BT has, thoughout the year,
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the
2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the
company’s 2005 AGM. The Board is ultimately
responsible for both the structure and amount of
executive remuneration, but it has delegated prime
responsibility for executive remuneration to the
Remuneration Committee. The Committee is made up
wholly of independent non-executive directors. The terms
of reference of the Committee are available on the
company’s website at www.bt.com. The Committee’s role
is to set the remuneration policy and individual
remuneration packages for the Chairman and the senior
management team, comprising the executive directors,
members of the Operating Committee (OC) and other
senior executives reporting to the Chief Executive. This
includes approving changes to the company’s long-term
incentive plans, recommending to the Board those plans
which require shareholder approval and overseeing their
operation. In this role the Committee also monitors the
structure of reward for executives reporting to the senior
management team and determines the basis on which
awards are granted under the company’s executive share
plans. The Committee met ﬁve times during the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05. Sir Anthony Greener has chaired the
Committee since 18 July 2001. Other members of the
Committee who served during the ﬁnancial years 2003/04
and 2004/05 were:
& Maarten van den Bergh
& Lou Hughes
& Margaret Jay
& Carl Symon.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to
attend meetings. They are not present when matters
affecting their own remuneration arrangements are
considered. No director or executive is involved in any
decision relating to his or her remuneration. Non-
executive directors who are not members of the
Committee are entitled to receive papers and minutes of
the Committee. The Committee has access to
professional advisers, both from within the company and
externally. Towers Perrin (HR consultants); Ben
Verwaayen, Chief Executive; Ian Livingston, in his capacity
as Group Finance Director; Alex Wilson, Group HR
Director and Larry Stone, Company Secretary, provided
advice that materially assisted the Committee in relation
to directors’ remuneration in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05.
Towers Perrin, who are appointed by the company,
provide BT with a range of data and advisory services
covering all aspects of executive pay, bonus
arrangements, shares and beneﬁts. The Committee has
agreed that Towers Perrin may advise both the
Committee and BT, and should be invited to attend
meetings when major remuneration policy issues are
being discussed.
BT’s executive remuneration policy is to reward
employees competitively, taking into account individual
line of business and company performance, market
comparisons, and the competitive pressures in the
information and communications technology industry as
BT focuses on growth through transformation. Base
Report on directors’ remuneration
56 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 salaries are positioned around the mid-market, with total
direct compensation (basic salary, annual bonus – cash
and deferred shares – and the expected value of any long-
term incentives) to be at the upper quartile only for
sustained and excellent performance. There are no plans
to change this policy. A signiﬁcant and increasing
proportion of the total executive remuneration package is
linked to line of business and/or corporate performance.
Remuneration arrangements and performance targets are
kept under regular review to achieve this.
(ii) Packages
The remuneration package is made up of some or all of
the following:
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually, but increases are made
only where the Committee believes that adjustments are
appropriate to reﬂect contribution, increased
responsibilities and/or market pressures. No base pay
changes were proposed or made, save that the
Committee agreed an increase in base salary effective on
1 January 2005 for Andy Green and Ian Livingston to
align their packages with their revised responsibilities in a
highly competitive market.
Performance-related remuneration
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to reward the
achievement of results against set objectives.
For the ﬁnancial year 2004/05, on-target and
maximum (requiring truly exceptional performance) bonus
levels for executive directors and OC members, as a
percentage of salary, were 75% and 150%, respectively,
and for the Chief Executive they were 127.5% and 195%,
with one-third of any bonus payable in the form of
deferred shares. Under his contract the Chairman is not
entitled to a bonus.
Targets, in respect of corporate performance, set at
the beginning of the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 for each
objective, to which speciﬁc weights were attached, were
based on earnings per share, free cash ﬂow and customer
satisfaction. Delivery against these operational targets will
be a key determinant of success and supports BT’s
strategy for transformation and growth. For the three line
of business Chief Executives, 75% of the potential bonus
was linked to BT’s corporate performance and 25% to the
performance of their respective line of business. For all
other relevant executives, bonuses were based solely on
corporate performance. The Committee retains the
ﬂexibility to enhance or reduce bonus awards in
exceptional circumstances.
Achievement against corporate targets in the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05:
Earnings per
share –

40% of target
Free cash

37 20 18 75
(Note – threshold reflects 50% of target; target is 100% and stretch is
150%)
The deferred share element of the annual bonus is paid
under the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP). The shares are held
in trust and transferred to the executive after three years
if still employed by the company. There are no additional
performance measures for the vesting of deferred share
awards. The Committee considers that deferring a part of
the annual bonus in this way also acts as a retention
measure and contributes to aligning management with
long-term shareholder interest.
These deferred awards for Ben Verwaayen, Andy
Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds at
the end of the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 are contained in the
table on page 67. The initial values of the awards are in
note f on page 62.
Long-term incentives
The BT Equity Incentive Portfolio (the Portfolio) is
designed to ensure that equity participation is an
important part of overall remuneration. It comprises three
elements: share options, incentive shares and retention
shares. A combination of share options and incentive
shares was used for equity participation in the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05. Retention shares are used only as a
recruitment or retention tool.
Under his service agreement, the Chairman is not
entitled to receive annual grants of long-term incentive
awards or options.
Normally, awards vest and options become exercisable
only if a predetermined performance target has been
achieved. The performance measure for outstanding
awards and options is TSR (total shareholder return)
compared with a relevant basket of companies. TSR links
the reward given to directors with the performance of BT
against the shares of other major companies. For grants
in the ﬁnancial years 2001/02, 2002/03 and 2003/04, the
comparator group was the FTSE 100 at 1 April in each
year and for grants in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05, TSR was
measured against a comparator group of companies from
the European Telecom Sector.
At 1 April 2004, the group contained the following
companies:
BT Group
Cable & Wireless
Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications
Deutsche Telekom
France Telecom
Hellenic Telecommunications
O2 (formerly mmO
2
)
Portugal Telecom
KPN
Swisscom
TDC
Tele2
Telecom Italia
Telecom Italia Mobile
Telefonica
Telekom Austria
Telenor
TeliaSonera
Vodafone Group
The base price at the beginning of the performance
period is calculated by averaging the share price of BT
and other companies in the comparator group over the six
months to 31 March prior to the award. However, for the
awards granted in the ﬁnancial year 2002/03, the period
was from 19 November 2001 (the date of the O2
demerger) to 31 March 2002. The end price is the
average of the share price over the six months to the end
of the performance period, adjusted for all capital actions
and dividend payments that occur during the performance
period.
Share options
The price at which shares may be acquired under the
Global Share Option Plan (GSOP) is the market price at
the date of grant. Other than for new recruits, the size of
Report on directors’ remuneration BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 57 option grant is based on corporate and individual
performance. Options are exercisable after three years,
subject to a performance target being met. The
Committee would not normally expect the initial value of
annual grants of options, based on the market price of a
BT share, to exceed three times base salary. In the
ﬁnancial year 2004/05, the maximum option grant for
executive directors and OC members was reduced to 1.5
times base salary (see ‘Incentive shares’ below).
For options granted subject to a TSR measure, BT’s
TSR at the end of the three-year period must be in the
upper quartile for all of the options to be exercisable.
At median, 30% of the options will be exercisable. Below
that point, none of the options may be exercised. The
proportion of options that are exercisable reduces on a
straight-line basis between those points. For options
granted in the ﬁnancial year 2002/03, if the performance
measure is not met in full at the ﬁrst measurement, it
may be re-tested against a ﬁxed base in years four and
ﬁve and for options granted in the ﬁnancial year 2003/04
may be re-tested in year ﬁve. If TSR has not reached the
median at the end of the ﬁfth year, previously
unexercisable options will lapse. For options granted in
the ﬁnancial year 2002/03, TSR had reached 74th
position at the ﬁrst measurement relative to the FTSE 100
and performance will be re-tested in the ﬁnancial year
2005/06. For options granted in the ﬁnancial year
2004/05 there will be no re-testing, and the policy of the
Committee going forward is for there to be no re-testing.
The one-off grant of additional options in the ﬁnancial
year 2002/03 to the senior executives most responsible
for delivering BT’s strategic plan lapsed on 31 March
2005, as the required 35% compound annual growth in
BT’s earnings per share over three years (equivalent to 22
pence per share at the end of the 2005 ﬁnancial year) was
not achieved. The grant was not subject to a re-testing
condition.
The option granted to Sir Christopher Bland on 22 June
2001 as part of his recruitment package is not subject to
a performance measure as it matched a personal
investment in BT shares of £1 million.
The details of the options held by Sir Christopher
Bland, Ben Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian
Livingston and Paul Reynolds at the end of the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05 are contained in the table on page 65.
Incentive shares
In the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 the Committee decided to
grant a combination of performance-linked share options
and incentive shares instead of a grant of share options.
Incentive shares with a maximum value of two-thirds base
salary were granted in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05. Awards
of incentive shares vest after a performance period of
three years, if the participant is still employed by BT and a
performance measure has been met. For awards of
incentive shares in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05, TSR at the
end of the three year period must be in the upper quartile
relative to the comparator group for all of the shares to
vest. At median, 25% of the shares under award will vest.
Below that point, none of the shares under award will
vest. The proportion of shares that vests reduces on a
straight-line basis between those points. There will be no
re-testing, and no matching shares are being offered to
any executive on vesting of the incentive shares.
The details of incentive share awards held by Ben
Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and
Paul Reynolds at the end of the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 are
contained in the table on page 66.
Retention shares
Retention shares are granted under the Retention Share
Plan (RSP) to individuals with critical skills, as a
recruitment or retention tool. As a result, shares currently
under award are not generally linked to a corporate
performance target. The length of the retention period
before awards vest is ﬂexible. The shares are transferred
at the end of the speciﬁed period if the individual is still
employed by BT.
Retention shares are used only in exceptional
circumstances and, in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05,
six awards were made for recruitment purposes, none of
which was to an executive director or OC member. The
Committee has approved the grant of an award of
retention shares to Ian Livingston with an initial market
value of £1m, to help secure his appointment and long-
term retention as Chief Executive, BT Retail. It is
expected that these will be granted at the end of May
2005 and will vest in two tranches.
The awards under the RSP held by Sir Christopher
Bland, Ben Verwaayen and Ian Livingston at the end of
the ﬁnancial year 2004/05, or which vested during the
year, are contained in the table on page 66.
Other share plans
The executive directors and the Chairman may participate
in BT’s HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee
share plans, the Employee Sharesave Scheme and
Employee Share Investment Plan (which replaced the BT
Employee Share Ownership Scheme), on the same basis
as other employees. There are further details of these
plans in note 31 to the accounts.
(iii) Annual package – ﬁnancial year 2005/06
The Remuneration Committee does not expect there to
be any general increase in base pay for executive directors
in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06.
Long-term reward
The Committee believes that, in the increasingly
competitive markets for communications and ICT in which
BT operates, BT’s present long-term incentive
arrangements have not been acting as a sufﬁciently
effective retention tool. This has been reﬂected in the loss
to the business of a number of key senior executives in
the past year. The Committee believes that key to the
successful execution of BT’s transformation strategy will
be year on year delivery of operational targets.
Accordingly, the Committee has decided to modify the
emphasis on some of the components making up the
remuneration package for executive directors and OC
members.
This involves:
& no further annual grants of options, balanced by;
& an increase in the maximum award of incentive shares
from two-thirds to 100% of base salary; and
& an increase in annual bonus potential, payable in
deferred shares.
TSR will continue to be measured against a
comparator group of companies from the European
Telecom Sector.
The Committee determined, with advice from Towers
Perrin, that the overall value of long-term incentive
58 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Report on directors’ remuneration awards will not change materially as a result of these
proposals.
The change in emphasis will increase the proportion of
variable reward linked to annual performance targets.
Incentive share awards remain a signiﬁcant part of the
package, and together with deferred shares, these
modiﬁcations further align management with long term
shareholder interests.
The changes have the effect of increasing on-target
bonus from 75% to 87.5% of base salary of which the
cash element continues to be 50% of salary.
Arrangements for BT Group Chief Executive and the
Chief Executive BT Global Services
The salary of the Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, has
remained unchanged since joining the company in
January 2002. With the announced retirement of the
Chairman at the AGM 2007, management continuity
through this period is an important issue. The Committee
has decided therefore, in order to make his total package
both increasingly retentive and competitive with leaders
of the 30 largest companies in the FTSE 100, to increase
further the deferred share element of his annual bonus,
but not the cash element. Both elements are determined
by performance against corporate targets. For the
ﬁnancial year 2005/06, and subsequent ﬁnancial years,
two-thirds of his bonus will be payable in deferred shares
which will vest after three years. This has the effect of
increasing his on-target annual bonus to 255% of salary,
of which 85% would be payable in cash as currently and
170% of salary payable in deferred shares. His total bonus
– cash and deferred shares – will be subject to an overall
cap of 300% of base salary in any one year.
As a retention measure and given competitive market
conditions, the Committee has also decided to introduce
an additional special bonus arrangement for Andy Green,
Chief Executive BT Global Services, linked to performance
targets for that line of business, given the critical
importance of its continuing growth and margin
improvement to BT’s transformation. This bonus
arrangement, payable in retention shares which will vest
three years after grant, will be applied to performance in
each of the ﬁnancial years 2005/06, 2006/07 and
2007/08. Awards will be linked to a sliding scale of BT
Global Services’ performance, weighted equally around
revenue growth, EBIT and cash generation. The target
award will be equivalent to 100% of salary, with a
maximum of 150% of salary.
Annual bonus plan
The annual bonus plan will continue to focus on annual
objectives and to reward the achievement of results
against those objectives. Performance will again be
against earnings per share, free cash ﬂow and customer
satisfaction measures. In the ﬁnancial year 2005/06,
targets will be linked to corporate performance only.
Previously, 25% of potential bonus for line of business
Chief Executives was linked to the performance of their
respective line of business. Group performance targets for
the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 are believed to be more
challenging than the outturn of the ﬁnancial year 2004/05
(which outturned below target), as BT continues its
programme of transformation and investment.
Proportion of ﬁxed and variable remuneration
For the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, for the achievement of
target, performance-related remuneration, comprising
annual and long-term incentives, will be approximately
74% of total remuneration (excluding pension) for the
Chief Executive, 70% for Chief Executive Global Services
and 56% for the remaining three executive directors.
Total remuneration comprises base salary, annual bonus –
cash and deferred shares – and the expected value of
awards under BT’s long-term incentive plans.
(iv) Other matters
Executive share ownership
A mandatory shareholding programme has been
introduced for the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 onwards. This is
to encourage executive directors and OC members to
build up a shareholding in the company over time by
retaining shares received either as a result of participating
in a BT employee share plan (other than the shares sold to
pay a National Insurance or income tax liability) or from
on-market purchases. The Chief Executive is required to
build up a shareholding of 2 x salary and the remaining
executive directors and OC members 1.5 x salary. Given
that a large part of an executive’s remuneration is already
variable, the requirement excludes the need to make a
further personal investment to build up the shareholding
should awards not vest. Current shareholdings are set out
on page 61.
Pensions
Those executive directors and most other senior
executives who joined the company prior to 1 April 2001,
have their pension beneﬁts based on service and salary
(known as deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements). Those with
longer BT service are entitled to pensions at normal
retirement age of two-thirds of ﬁnal salary, including any
cash lump sum entitlement. Those with shorter BT service
are entitled to a pension of one-thirtieth of salary for each
year of service. In both cases, for most executives, a
spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the executive’s pension
is provided in the event of death after retirement. Should
the executive die in service, a lump sum equal to four
times annual salary is payable together with a spouse’s
pension of two-thirds of the executive’s anticipated
pension at normal retirement age. BT closed its deﬁned
beneﬁt arrangements to new employees with effect from
1 April 2001. From this date retirement provision is
generally made on a deﬁned contribution basis. The
company agrees to pay a ﬁxed percentage of the
executive’s salary each year towards the provision of
retirement beneﬁts, typically this is around 30% of salary.
Additionally, a lump sum equal to four times annual salary
is payable on death in service.
The Committee has reviewed the impact of the
Lifetime Allowance under tax legislation, as the taxation
of approved pension schemes will change from 6 April
2006. As a result, BT will offer to those members affected
the option to opt out of the pension scheme and in its
place to receive a cash allowance annually. This will be
broadly cash neutral for the company. The Committee will
keep this policy under review as best practice develops.
Pension provision for all executives is based on salary
alone – bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term
incentives are excluded.
Report on directors’ remuneration BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 59 Other beneﬁts
Other beneﬁts for the Chairman and the senior
management team include some or all of the following:
company car, fuel or driver, personal telecommunications
facilities and home security, medical and dental cover for
the director and immediate family, special life cover,
professional subscriptions and personal tax planning and
ﬁnancial counselling. The company has a permanent
health insurance policy to provide cover for the Chairman
and executive directors and members of the OC who may
become permanently incapacitated.
Service agreements
It is the policy for the Chairman and executive directors to
have service agreements providing for one year’s notice.
It may be necessary on recruitment to offer longer initial
periods to new directors from outside BT, or
circumstances may make it appropriate to offer a longer
ﬁxed term. All the service agreements contain provisions
dealing with the removal of a director through poor
performance, including in the event of early termination
of the contract by BT. Sir Christopher Bland’s contract
expires at the conclusion of the AGM in 2007. On
termination of his contract by BT before that date, he is
entitled to payment of salary and the value of beneﬁts for
the period of 12 months from date of termination, or until
the conclusion of the company’s AGM in 2007, if that
period is shorter. Ben Verwaayen’s contract entitles him
on termination of his contract by BT to payment of
£700,000. The contracts of Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian
Livingston and Paul Reynolds entitle them on termination
of their contract by BT to payment of salary and the value
of beneﬁts until the earlier of 12 months from notice of
termination or the director obtaining full-time
employment. If the contract of a director (other than that
of the Chairman and Hanif Lalani) is terminated by BT
within one year of BT entering into a scheme of
arrangement or becoming a subsidiary of another
company, he will be entitled to receive the higher of that
current year’s on-target bonus or the previous year’s
bonus, the market value of shares awarded under an
employee share ownership plan or deferred bonus plan
that have not vested, together with a year’s salary and the
value of any beneﬁts.
The Committee has reviewed contracts taking into
account the joint statement of best practice on executive
contracts and severance by the Association of British
Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds,
and other relevant guidelines, and believes that contract
terms are generally in line with best practice. The clause
described above dealing with termination following BT
entering into a scheme of arrangement or becoming a
subsidiary of another company will be excluded from
contracts for new appointments, as was the case for
Hanif Lalani.
Outside appointments
The Committee believes that there are signiﬁcant
beneﬁts, to both the company and the individual, from
executive directors accepting non-executive directorships
of companies outside BT. The Committee will consider up
to two external appointments (of which only one may be
to the Board of a major company), for which a director
may retain the fees. Ben Verwaayen was appointed as a
non-executive director of United Parcel Service, Inc. on
17 March 2005 and is entitled to receive an annual fee of
US$75,000. On joining the Board, he received 336 shares
of restricted UPS common stock amounting to
US$25,000 and will receive an US$85,000 restricted
stock grant annually. Ian Livingston receives an annual fee
of £38,000 as a non-executive director of Hilton Group
plc. Paul Reynolds was appointed a non-executive director
of E-Access in Japan on 29 June 2004 and receives an
annual fee of ¥3 million (approximately £15,000). He was
granted an option over 250 shares at ¥139,000
(approximately £695) per share on 1 July 2004. Pierre
Danon, who resigned on 28 February 2005 as a director
of BT, was a non-executive director of EMAP plc and
received an annual fee of £35,000.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment. They
are appointed for an initial period of three years. During
that period, either party can give the other at least three
months’ notice. At the end of the period the appointment
may be continued by mutual agreement. Further details
of appointment arrangements for non-executive directors
are set out on page 50 in the section dealing with
corporate governance issues. The letters of appointment
of non-executive directors are terminable on notice by the
company without compensation.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Seven of the directors on the Board are non-executive
directors who, in accordance with BT’s articles of
association, cannot individually vote on their own
remuneration. Non-executive remuneration is reviewed by
the Chairman and the Chief Executive and discussed and
agreed by the Board. Non-executive directors may attend
the Board discussion but may not participate in it.
The fees paid to non-executive directors were
increased with effect from 1 January 2004 to reﬂect their
increasing responsibilities and time commitments.
Non-executive directors’ fees were last changed ﬁve years
previously, on 1 January 1999.
The basic fee for non-executive directors is £40,000
per year. An additional fee for membership of Board
committees is £5,000 per year, other than for the Pension
Scheme Performance Review Group for which no fee is
paid. Sir Anthony Greener, Deputy Chairman and senior
non-executive director, who also chairs both the
Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee,
receives total fees of £115,000 per year.
To align further the interests of the non-executive
directors with those of shareholders, the company’s policy
is to encourage these directors to purchase, on a
voluntary basis, £5,000 of BT shares each year. The
directors are asked to hold these shares until they retire
from the Board. This policy is not mandatory.
No element of non-executive remuneration is
performance-related. Non-executive directors do not
participate in BT’s bonus or employee share plans and are
not members of any of the company pension schemes.

Report on directors’ remuneration BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 61 Performance graph
This graph illustrates, as required by the Companies Act 1985, the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR
(adjusted for the rights issue and the demerger of BT’s mobile business in the ﬁnancial year 2001/02) relative to a
broad equity market index over the past ﬁve years. The FTSE 100 is considered to be the most appropriate index
against which to measure performance for these purposes, as BT has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 throughout
the ﬁve-year period and the index is widely used. TSR is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its
shareholders, reﬂecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.

Pierre Danon resigned from the Board on 28 February 2005.
62 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Report on directors’ remuneration The annual salaries of the Chairman, Ben Verwaayen,
Pierre Danon and Paul Reynolds remained unchanged
during the ﬁnancial years 2003/04 and 2004/05. On
1 January 2005, the annual salaries of Andy Green and
Ian Livingston increased from £425,000 to £500,000 and
£450,000 to £525,000, respectively. Hanif Lalani joined
the Board on 7 February 2005 on an annual salary of
£400,000. Following this year’s salary review, the
Committee decided that there should be no general
increase from 1 June 2005 in basic salaries.
A special retention arrangement was established for
Hanif Lalani on 1 July 2004, when he was CFO, BT
Wholesale, under which he will receive a lump sum cash
payment of £150,000 on 30 June 2006, provided he is
still an employee of the company on that date. The award
will be forfeited without compensation if Mr Lalani resigns
or his employment is terminated by the company with
cause before that date.
Pierre Danon’s pro rata bonus in respect of the
ﬁnancial year 2004/05 until he resigned from the Board
on 28 February 2005 was based on the achievement of
corporate and line of business objectives and on the
Committee’s view on his outstanding contribution to BT.
All his executive share awards and options lapsed on his
resignation. The annual bonus of Hanif Lalani relates to
the whole year and is based solely on line of business
objectives. Ian Livingston’s annual bonus was based solely
on the achievement of corporate objectives.
Annual cash bonus awards in respect of the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05, which are not pensionable, to executive
directors ranged from 38% to 64% of current salary (2004
– 58% to 123%).
Former directors
Yve Newbold retired on 31 August 2004 as a member of
the Community Support Committee for which she
received fees in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 of £2,708. She
also received fees of £2,000 as a member of BT’s Social
Policy Leadership Panel, which she left on 16 November
2004. Dr Iain Anderson retired in June 2004 as chairman
BT Scotland, for which he received fees in the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05 of £3,000.
Sir Peter Bonﬁeld received, under pre-existing
arrangements, a pension of £340,000 payable in the
ﬁnancial year 2004/05 (2004 – £331,000).
Loans
Prior to the date of their appointment to the Board on
19 November 2001, Pierre Danon and Paul Reynolds each
had interest-free loans from the company to assist with
relocation of £375,000 and £300,000, respectively. At
31 March 2005, Pierre Danon owed £209,374 (2003 –
£243,750), which is repayable by 1 June 2005, and Paul

Pensions
Sir Christopher Bland is not a member of any of the
company pension schemes, but the company matches his
contributions, up to 10% of the earnings cap, to a
personal pension plan. Company contributions of £10,200
were payable in respect of the ﬁnancial year 2004/05. The
earnings cap is a restriction on the amount of pay which
can be used to calculate contributions and beneﬁts due to
a tax approved pension scheme.
Ben Verwaayen is not a member of any of the company
pension schemes, but the company has agreed to pay an
annual amount equal to 30% of his salary towards
pension provision, increased from 20% and effective on
1 January 2005. The company paid £30,600 into his
personal pension plan plus a cash payment of £126,900
representing the balance of the pension allowance for the
ﬁnancial year 2004/05. BT also provides him with a lump
sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary.
Ian Livingston is not a member of any of the company
pension schemes, but the company has agreed to pay an
annual amount equal to 30% of his salary towards
pension provision. The company paid £20,400 into his
personal pension plan plus a cash payment of £120,225
representing the balance of the pension allowance for the
ﬁnancial year 2004/05. BT also provides him with a lump
sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary.
Andy Green is a member of the BT Pension Scheme.
From 31 December 1997 the company has been
purchasing an additional 203 days of pensionable service
each year to bring his pensionable service at age 60 up to
40 years. A two-thirds widow’s pension would be payable
on his death.
Hanif Lalani is a member of the BT Pension Scheme.
From 7 February 2005, the company has been purchasing
an additional 23 days of pensionable service each year to
bring his pensionable service at age 60 up to 40 years.
Paul Reynolds is a member of the BT Pension Scheme.
From 1 July 1996 the company has been purchasing an
additional 109 days of pensionable service each year to
bring his pensionable service at age 60 up to 40 years. A
two-thirds widow’s pension would be payable on his
death.
Pierre Danon resigned as a director on 28 February
2005. His pension accrued at the rate of one-thirtieth of
his ﬁnal salary for each year of service. In addition, a two-
thirds widow’s pension would have been payable on his
death. He was a member of the BT Pension Scheme, but
as he was subject to the earnings cap the company
agreed to increase his beneﬁts to the target level by
means of a non-approved, unfunded arrangement.
Report on directors’ remuneration BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 63 The table below shows the increase in the accrued beneﬁts, including those referred to above, to which each director

These amounts represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the company on 31 March 2004 and 2005,
respectively.
c
Transfer value of the deferred pension in column (a) as at 31 March 2005 calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial
Guidance Note GN11. The transfer value represents a liability of the company rather than any remuneration due to the individual and cannot be
meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration, as it is not money the individual is entitled to receive.
d
The equivalent transfer value but calculated as at 31 March 2004 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
e
The increase in pension built up during the year, net of inflation.
f

All of the above options were granted for nil consideration. No options were exercised during the year.
a
Options granted under the GSOP on 22 June 2001. The option is not subject to a performance measure. It was a term of Sir Christopher Bland’s initial
service contract that (i) he purchased BT shares to the value of at least £1 million; and (ii) as soon as practicable after the purchase of the shares
(‘invested shares’), the company would grant a share option over shares to the value of at least £1 million. Sir Christopher Bland was the legal and
beneficial owner of the invested shares on 1 May 2004, so the option became exercisable on that date.
b
Options granted under the GSOP on 11 February 2002. The exercise of options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance
measure is relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median,
40% of the options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options may be exercised.
c
Options granted under the GSOP on 29 July 2002. The exercise of options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is
relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median, 30% of the
options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options may be exercised.
d
Options granted under the GSOP on 29 July 2002. The vesting of the options was subject to a performance measure being met. The performance
measure was earnings per share. The performance measure was not met and as a result, the options have lapsed.
e

relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100 – see note c above.
f

become exercisable. At median, 30% of the options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options may be exercised.

68 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Report on directors’ remuneration The directors are required by law to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the
group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt
or loss and cash ﬂows of the group for that period.
The directors consider that, in preparing the ﬁnancial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2005, on pages
71 to 122 the company has used appropriate accounting
policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable
and prudent judgements and estimates. The directors also
consider that all applicable accounting standards have
been followed and conﬁrm that the ﬁnancial statements
have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the
company keeps accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of
the company and which enable them to ensure that the
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985.
The directors are also responsible for taking such steps
that are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets
of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
The auditors’ responsibilities are stated in their report
to the shareholders.
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 69
Statement of directors’ responsibility
for preparing the ﬁnancial statements United Kingdom Opinion
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of BT Group plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the
group proﬁt and loss account, group and company balance sheets,
group cash ﬂow statement, group statement of total recognised
gains and losses and the related notes which have been prepared
under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set
out in the Accounting Policies. We have also audited the
disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies
Act 1985 contained in the directors’ remuneration report (‘‘the
audited part’’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for
preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the
audited part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the audited part of the directors’ remuneration
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if
the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and Form 20-F and consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The other
information comprises only the Financial headlines, Chairman’s
message, Chief Executive’s statement, Operating and ﬁnancial
review, Report of the directors, Corporate governance, the
unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report and Risk
factors.
We review whether the corporate governance statement
reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
2003 FRC Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the audited part of
the directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment
of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the audited part of the
directors’ remuneration report are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion: the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the company and the group at 31 March
2005 and of the proﬁt and cash ﬂows of the group for the year
then ended; the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and those parts of
the directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule
7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

United States Opinion
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the
board of directors and shareholders of BT Group plc
In our opinion, the accompanying group proﬁt and loss account,
group balance sheet, group cash ﬂow statement, group statement
of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes present
fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of BT Group
plc and its subsidiaries at 31 March 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash ﬂows for each of the three
years in the period ended 31 March 2005, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
These ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the group’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
ﬁnancial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
signiﬁcant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
Kingdom vary in certain important respects from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is
presented in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles section.
As discussed in Note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements the company
changed its method for accounting for the employee beneﬁt trust
in 2005.

Consolidated ﬁnancial statements i Basis of preparation of the ﬁnancial statements
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable
accounting standards and the provisions of the
Companies Act 1985. The group ﬁnancial statements
consolidate those of the company and all of its subsidiary
undertakings. Where the ﬁnancial statements of
subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures do
not conform with the group’s accounting policies,
appropriate adjustments are made on consolidation in
order to present the group ﬁnancial statements on a
consistent basis. The principal subsidiary undertakings’
ﬁnancial years are all coterminous with those of the
company. The results of undertakings acquired during the
year are consolidated from the date of effective
acquisition.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of
income and expenditure during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
are used principally when accounting for interconnect
income, provision for doubtful debts, payments to
telecommunication operators, long-term contracts,
depreciation, goodwill amortisation and impairment,
employee pension schemes, provisions for liabilities and
charges and taxes.
ii Turnover
Group turnover net of discounts, which excludes value
added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value of
services provided and equipment sales by group
undertakings, excluding those between them.
Total turnover is group turnover together with the
group’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’
turnover.
Turnover from calls is recognised in the group proﬁt
and loss account at the time the call is made over the
group’s networks. Turnover from rentals is recognised
evenly over the period to which the charges relate.
Turnover from equipment sales is recognised at the point
of sale. Prepaid call card sales are deferred until the
customer uses the stored value in the card to pay for the
relevant calls. Turnover arising from the provision of other
services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised
evenly over the periods in which the service is provided to
the customer. Turnover from installation and connection
activities is recognised in the period in which it is earned.
Turnover from long term contracts is recognised
throughout the duration of the contract, to the extent
that the outcome of the contract can be assessed with
reasonable certainty and in accordance with the stage of
completion of contractual obligations. Turnover from
classiﬁed directories, mainly comprising advertising
revenue, is recognised in the group proﬁt and loss
account upon completion of delivery.
iii Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is written off as
incurred.
iv Leases
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are capitalised and
depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element of
future obligations under ﬁnance leases are recognised as
liabilities. The interest element of rental obligations are
charged over the period of the ﬁnance lease and represent
a constant proportion of the balance of capital
repayments outstanding.
Operating lease rentals are charged against the proﬁt
and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease
period except where the contractual payment terms are
considered to be a more systematic and appropriate
basis.
v Interest
Interest payable, including that related to ﬁnancing the
construction of tangible ﬁxed assets, is written off as
incurred. Discounts or premiums and expenses on the
issue of debt securities are amortised over the term of the
related security and included within interest payable.
Premiums payable on early redemptions of debt
securities, in lieu of future interest costs, are written off
when paid.
vi Foreign currencies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign
undertakings are translated into sterling at year end
exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for
the year.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at
year end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign
undertakings, less exchange differences on borrowings
which ﬁnance or provide a hedge against those
undertakings, are taken to reserves and are reported in
the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with
through the proﬁt and loss account.
vii Intangibles
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiary
undertakings and interests in associates and joint
ventures, represents the excess of the fair value of the
purchase consideration over the fair value of the
identiﬁable net assets acquired.
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Albacom
SpA was accounted for as a joint venture. In accordance
with FRS 2 ‘Accounting for subsidiary undertakings’, and
in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill
has been calculated as the sum of goodwill arising on
each purchase of shares in Albacom and represents a
departure from the statutory method. See note 15 for
further information.
For acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 1998,
the goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset
or, if arising in respect of an associate or joint venture,
recorded as part of the related investment. Goodwill is
amortised on a straight line basis from the time of
acquisition over its useful economic life. The economic life
is normally presumed to be a maximum of 20 years.
For acquisitions on or before 31 March 1998, the
goodwill is written off on acquisition against group
reserves.
If an undertaking is subsequently divested, the
appropriate unamortised goodwill or goodwill written off
to reserves is dealt with through the proﬁt and loss
account in the period of disposal as part of the gain or
loss on divestment.
72 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005
Accounting policies (b) Other intangibles
Licence fees paid to governments, which permit
telecommunication activities to be operated for deﬁned
periods, are amortised from the latter of the start of the
licence period or launch of service to the end of the
licence period on a straight-line basis.
viii Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at historical cost less
depreciation.
(a) Cost
Cost in the case of network services includes contractors’
charges and payments on account, materials, direct
labour and directly attributable overheads.
(b) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on tangible ﬁxed assets on a
straight line basis from the time they are available for use,
so as to write off their costs over their estimated useful
lives taking into account any expected residual values. No
depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The lives assigned to other signiﬁcant tangible ﬁxed
assets are:
Freehold buildings – 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings – Unexpired portion
of lease or 40
years, whichever
is the shorter
Transmission equipment:
duct – 25 years
cable – 3 to 25 years
radio and repeater equipment – 2 to 25 years
Exchange equipment – 2 to 13 years
Computers and ofﬁce equipment – 3 to 6 years
Payphones, other network equipment,
motor vehicles and cableships – 2 to 20 years
Software – 2 to 5 years
ix Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates and
joint ventures are stated in the balance sheet of the
company at cost less amounts written off.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are stated
in the group balance sheet at the group’s share of their
net assets, together with any attributable unamortised
goodwill on acquisitions arising on or after 1 April 1998.
The group’s share of proﬁts less losses of associates
and joint ventures is included in the group proﬁt and loss
account.
Investments in other participating interests and other
investments are stated at cost less amounts written off.
x Asset impairment
Intangible and tangible ﬁxed assets are tested for
impairment when an event that might affect asset values
has occurred. Goodwill is also reviewed for impairment at
the end of the ﬁrst ﬁnancial year after acquisition.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the
carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the
asset or by the discounted future cash ﬂows from
operating the assets.
xi Stocks
Stocks mainly comprise items of equipment, held for sale
or rental, consumable items and work in progress on long-
term contracts.
Equipment held and consumable items are stated at
the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after
provisions for obsolescence.
Work in progress on long-term contracts is stated at
cost, after deducting payments on account, less
provisions for any foreseeable losses.
xii Debtors
Debtors are stated in the balance sheet at estimated net
realisable value. Net realisable value is the invoiced
amount less provisions for bad and doubtful debtors.
Provisions are made speciﬁcally against debtors where
there is evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay. An
additional provision is made based on an analysis of
balances by age, previous losses experienced and general
economic conditions.
xiii Redundancy costs
Redundancy or leaver costs arising from periodic reviews
of staff levels are charged against proﬁt in the year in
which the group is demonstrably committed to the
employees leaving the group.
If the estimated cost of providing incremental pension
beneﬁts in respect of employees leaving the group
exceeds any total accounting surplus based on the latest
actuarial valuation of the group’s pension scheme and the
amount of the provision for pension liabilities on the
balance sheet, then the excess estimated cost is charged
against proﬁt in the year in which the employees agree to
leave the group, within redundancy or leaver costs.
xiv Pension schemes
The group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme, which is independent of the group’s ﬁnances, for
the substantial majority of its employees. Actuarial
valuations of the main scheme are carried out by an
independent actuary as determined by the trustees at
intervals of not more than three years, to determine the
rates of contribution payable. The pension cost is
determined on the advice of the company’s actuary,
having regard to the results of these valuations. In any
intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing
appropriateness of the contribution rates.
The cost of providing pensions is charged against
proﬁts over employees’ working lives with the group using
the projected unit method. Variations from this regular
cost are allocated on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining service lives of current employees to the extent
that these variations do not relate to the estimated cost
of providing incremental pension beneﬁts in the
circumstances described in xiii above.
Interest is accounted for on the provision or
prepayment in the balance sheet which results from
differences between amounts recognised as pension costs
and amounts funded. The regular pension cost, variations
from the regular pension cost, described above, and
interest are all charged within staff costs.
The group also operates deﬁned contribution pension
schemes and the proﬁt and loss account is charged with
the contributions payable.
Accounting policies BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 73 xv Taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing
differences which have arisen but have not reversed at the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that
there will be taxable proﬁts from which the underlying
timing differences can be deducted. No deferred tax is
provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of
foreign subsidiaries or associates where no commitment
has been made to remit such earnings. The deferred tax
balances are not discounted.
xvi Financial instruments
(a) Debt instruments
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net
proceeds adjusted to amortise any discount over the term
of the debt, and further adjusted for the effect of currency
swaps acting as hedges.
(b) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce
exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate
movements. The group does not hold or issue derivative
ﬁnancial instruments for ﬁnancial trading purposes.
Criteria to qualify for hedge accounting
The group considers its derivative ﬁnancial instruments to
be hedges when certain criteria are met. For foreign
currency derivatives, the instrument must be related to
actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment and whose characteristics have been
identiﬁed. It must involve the same currency or similar
currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the
risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the
group’s operations. For interest rate derivatives, the
instrument must be related to assets or liabilities or a
probable commitment, such as a future bond issue, and
must also change the interest rate or the nature of the
interest rate by converting a ﬁxed rate to a variable rate
or vice versa.
Accounting for derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Principal amounts underlying currency swaps are revalued
at exchange rates ruling at the date of the group balance
sheet and, to the extent that they are not related to debt
instruments, are included in debtors or creditors.
Interest differentials, under interest rate swap
agreements used to vary the amounts and periods for
which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed, are
recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
The forward exchange contracts used to change the
currency mix of net debt are revalued to balance sheet
rates with net unrealised gains and losses being shown as
part of debtors, creditors, or as part of net debt. The
difference between spot and forward rate for these
contracts is recognised as part of net interest payable over
the term of the contract.
The forward exchange contracts hedging transaction
exposures are revalued at the prevailing forward rate on
the balance sheet date with net unrealised gains and
losses being shown as debtors and creditors.
Instruments that form hedges against future ﬁxed-rate
bond issues are marked to market. Gains or losses are
deferred until the bond is issued when they are recognised
evenly over the term of the bond.

Group balance sheet
as at 31 March 2005 1. Changes in accounting policy and presentation
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year the group adopted UITF Abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’ and the related
amendments to UITF Abstract 17 (revised 2003) ‘Employee Share Schemes’. UITF 38 changes the presentation of an
entity’s own shares held in an ESOP trust from previously being held as assets to being deducted in arriving at
shareholders’ funds. UITF 17 (revised 2003) requires the amounts recognised in the proﬁt and loss account in respect
of share awards previously based on the book value of shares held in the ESOP trusts to being based on the fair value of
shares at the date the award is made.
An additional charge of £3 million and a credit of £16 million for the 2004 and 2003 ﬁnancial years, respectively has
been made to the group proﬁt and loss account. The effect on the group’s balance sheet at 1 April 2002 has been to
reduce ﬁxed assets by £177 million, to reduce other creditors by £25 million and to reduce shareholders’ funds by
£152 million. The prior year adjustment in the statement of total recognised gains and losses is £21 million. Had we
not adopted this change the charge to the proﬁt and loss account would have been £18 million higher in the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
A small number of changes in the presentation of the notes to the ﬁnancial statements have been made and
comparative ﬁgures have been restated accordingly as explained in the notes where material.
2. Segmental analysis
The group provides telecommunication services, principally in the UK, and essentially operates as a unitary business. Its
main services and products are ﬁxed voice and data calls, the provision of ﬁxed exchange lines to homes and
businesses, the provision of communication services to other operators, the provision of private services to businesses
and the supply of telecommunication equipment for customers’ premises.
The turnover of each line of business is derived as follows:
& BT Retail derives its turnover from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the
provision of ICT products and services, the leasing of private circuits and other private services, the sale and rental
of customer premises equipment to the group’s UK customers and other lines of business and from its narrowband
and broadband internet access products.
& BT Wholesale derives its turnover from providing network services and solutions to communications companies,
including ﬁxed and mobile network operators, ISPs (internet service providers) and other service providers, including
other BT lines of business, and from carrying transit trafﬁc between telecommunications operators.
& BT Global Services mainly generates its turnover from the provision of ICT products and services, outsourcing and
systems integration work and from the ﬁxed network operations of the group’s European subsidiaries. The business
also derives revenues from providing web hosting facilities to end customers and through BT lines of business.
Segmented information on the lines of business is given below for the years ended 31 March 2005, 31 March 2004
and 31 March 2003 as required by the UK accounting standard SSAP 25 and the US accounting standard SFAS No. 131
(SFAS 131).
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price levels.
These intra-group trading arrangements and operating assets are subject to periodic review and have changed in some
instances. Comparative ﬁgures have been restated for these and other changes and in certain instances have
been determined using apportionments and allocations.

The directors believe that the nature of the group’s business is such that the analysis of operating costs required by the

12. Earnings (loss) per share
The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year attributable to
shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the company’s shares held by
employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings (loss) per share, share options outstanding and other potential ordinary shares
have been taken into account.
The weighted average number of shares in the years were:
2005
millions
of shares
2004
millions

2003
millions

Basic 8,524 8,621 8,616
Dilutive ordinary shares from share options outstanding and shares held in trust 57 55 52
Total diluted 8,581 8,676 8,668
Options over 207 million shares (2004 – 259 million, 2003 – 177 million) were excluded from the calculation of the
total diluted number of shares as they were anti-dilutive.

a
On 25 February 2005 the group acquired Infonet Services Corporation for total consideration of £520 million, including
acquisition costs, (£315 million net of cash in the business). This gave rise to goodwill of £264 million.

The fair value adjustments are revaluations of the assets and liabilities to reﬂect their fair value.
Since the acquisition was made towards the end of the year ended 31 March 2005, the fair values of the identiﬁable
assets and liabilities have been determined on a provisional basis. Goodwill arising on acquisition of Infonet is being
amortised over 20 years.
In the period from 1 April 2004 to 24 February 2005 Infonet generated operating losses after tax of US$83 million
(year to 31 March 2004 – US$66 million losses).
b
In December 2004 the group agreed to acquire the 74% interest in Albacom SpA not already held, giving BT full
ownership for total consideration of £131 million, including deferred consideration of £38 million. The deferred
consideration is dependent upon the financial performance of Albacom in the 2009 financial year and the minimum
payable is £38 million. The transaction completed 4 February 2005. This gave rise to goodwill of £9 million.
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Albacom SpA was accounted for as a joint venture undertaking. In
accordance with FRS 2 ‘Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings’, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased
goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of shares in Albacom, being the
difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the
identiﬁable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased. This represents a departure from the statutory
method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Albacom
became a subsidiary undertaking. The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in
the group’s share of Albacom’s retained reserves, during the period that it was a joint venture undertaking, being
recharacterised as goodwill. The effect of this departure is to reduce retained proﬁts by £313 million, and to reduce
purchased goodwill by £313 million.

The fair value adjustments include the elimination of goodwill recorded in the books of Albacom and the revaluation of

Since the acquisition was made towards the end of the year ended 31 March 2005, the fair values of the identiﬁable
assets and liabilities have been determined on a provisional basis. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Albacom is
being amortised over 20 years.
In the period from 1 April 2004 to 3 February 2005 Albacom generated operating losses after tax of E195 million
(year to 31 March 2004 – E263 million losses).

On 5 January 2004 the group acquired the UK trade and assets of BT Expedite Limited (formerly NSB Retail plc) for
consideration of £17 million (£2 million deferred). The net liabilities acquired amounted to £1 million giving rise to
goodwill of £18 million which is being amortised over a period of 5 years. On 15 March 2004 the group acquired
controlling interest in Transcomm plc for consideration of £15 million. The group’s share of the net assets acquired was
£2 million giving rise to goodwill of £13 million which is being amortised over a period of 13 years. On 13 January
2004 the group took full control of Siosistemi SpA for consideration of £4 million including deferred consideration of £1
million. Net assets of £1 million were acquired giving rise to goodwill of £4 million which is being amortised over a
period of 10 years.

On completion of the unwind of Concert on 1 April 2002, the former Concert businesses, customer accounts and
networks were returned to the two parent companies with BT and AT&T each taking ownership of substantially those
parts of the Concert global venture originally contributed by them. As part of the settlement with AT&T for the unwind
of the Concert global venture BT received net cash of US$72 million (£56 million). This net settlement included the
receipt of US$350 million reflecting the allocation of the businesses and the payment of US$278 million to achieve the
equal division of specified working capital and other liability balances. The results of the acquired businesses, both pre
and post acquisition, cannot be separately identified and, therefore, cannot be reported.

The interest rate payable on these notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s (S&P) reduces the
rating ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P. In this event, the interest
rate payable on the notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be increased by 0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings
agency. In addition, if Moody’s or S&P subsequently increase the rating ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt, then the interest rate then
payable on notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but
in no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum interest rate reflected in the table above.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reﬂect the coupons on the underlying issued loans
and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated currency and interest rate swaps.

and products from these undertakings. The amount of debt outstanding with these undertakings, at 31 March 2005,
was £6 million (2004 – £28 million). The maximum debt outstanding during the year was £40 million (2004 – £43
million). As at the latest practicable date, 13 May 2005, the amount of debt outstanding was £6 million.

Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of leases of land and buildings.
At 31 March 2005, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those
arising in the ordinary course of the group’s business and on these no material losses are anticipated. The group has
insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising
in the course of its operations. Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger
with O2 on 19 November 2001. O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees. The maximum likely
exposure is US$76 million (£41 million) as at 31 March 2005, although this could increase by a further US$563 million,
(£298 million) in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations. The
guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on
30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect
on the ﬁnancial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with
the Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process. The hearings
are continuing, in Rome. If the proceedings are successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages. The
company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.
The European Commission is formally investigating the way the UK Government has set BT’s property rates and
those paid by Kingston Communications. The Commission is examining whether the Government has complied with EC
Treaty rules on state aid in assessing BT’s rates. BT’s rates were set by the Valuation Ofﬁce after lengthy discussions
based on well established principles, in a transparent process. In BT’s view, any allegation of state aid is groundless and
BT is conﬁdent that the Government will demonstrate the fairness of the UK ratings system. A ﬁnding against HM
Government could result in BT having to repay any amount of state aid it may be determined to have received. The
company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential ﬁnding.
28. Pension costs
Background
The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice
No. 24 ‘‘Pension Costs’’ (SSAP 24). In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with Financial Reporting
Standard No. 17 ‘‘Retirement Beneﬁts’’ (FRS 17).
The group offers retirement plans to its employees. The group’s main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), is a
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme where the beneﬁts are based on employees’ length of service and ﬁnal pensionable pay. The
BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund. This scheme has been closed to new entrants
since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a deﬁned contribution scheme. Under this deﬁned contribution scheme the proﬁt
and loss charge represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a ﬁxed percentage of employees’ pay.
The total pension costs of the group expensed within staff costs in the year was £465 million (2004 – £404 million,
2003 – £322 million), of which £430 million (2004 – £376 million, 2003 – £306 million) related to the group’s main
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BTPS. The increase in the pension cost in the 2005 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the
introduction of Smart Pensions, a salary sacriﬁce scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee
contributions and for the company to make additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result there has been a switch between wages and salaries and pension costs of £99 million in the year. The
increase in the pension cost in the 2004 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the amortisation charge for the pension deﬁcit partly
offset by a reduction in the number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit relating to the balance sheet
prepayment. This total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension beneﬁts to leavers, which
amounted to £nil (2004 – £1 million, 2003 – £60 million).
The pension cost applicable to the group’s main deﬁned contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March 2005
was £11 million (2004 – £7 million, 2003 – £4 million) and £1.2 million (2004 – £0.7 million, 2003 – £0.4 million) of
contributions to the schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2005.
The group occupies four properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of £7 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, ﬁxed interest and index linked
securities, deposits and short-term investments. At 31 March 2005, the UK equities included 17 million
(2004 – 33 million, 2003 – 37 million) ordinary shares of the company with a market value of £36 million (2004 – £58
million, 2003 – £58 million).

BT Pension Scheme
Funding valuation
A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualiﬁed independent
actuary, using the projected unit method. The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that
present and future contributions should be sufﬁcient to meet future liabilities. The triennial valuation as at
31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the group’s pension fund contributions for the year ending 31 March
2005 and future periods until the next valuation is completed. The funding valuation is performed at 31 December
because this is the ﬁnancial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows:
& scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return
reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions:

Average increase in pensions – – – 2.50 3.00 3.75-4.00
*There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
The mortality assumption reﬂects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates further
future improvements.
The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a signiﬁcant effect on the funding
valuation. A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects on the funding
deﬁcit:
Impact on funding deﬁcit

0.25 percentage point change in:
Investment return (0.9) 0.9
Wage and salary increases 0.2 (0.2)
An additional year of life expectancy would result in a £0.7 billion increase in the deﬁcit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of £22.8 billion (1999 – £29.7 billion) and were
sufﬁcient to cover 91.6% (1999 – 96.8%) of the beneﬁts accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future
increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension beneﬁts for
employees leaving under release schemes since that date. This represents a funding deﬁcit of £2.1 billion compared to
£1.0 billion at 31 December 1999. The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation
been based on the actuary’s view of the median estimate basis, the funding deﬁcit would have been reduced to
£0.4 billion. Although the market value of equity investments had fallen, the investment income and contributions
received by the scheme exceeded the beneﬁts paid by £0.3 billion in the year ended 31 December 2002. As a result of
the triennial funding valuation the group agreed to make employer’s contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable
pay from April 2003 and annual deﬁciency payments of £232 million. This compared to the employer’s contribution
rate of 11.6% and annual deﬁciency payments of £200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, the group made regular contributions of £376 million (2004 – £284 million,
2003 – £278 million) and additional special contributions for enhanced pension beneﬁts to leavers in the year ended
31 December 2003 of £6 million (2004 – £130 million, 2003 – £129 million) and deﬁciency contributions of £nil (2004
– £612 million, 2003 – £200 million) as a result of the early payment of £380 million made in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
that was scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should
address the deﬁcit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses the deﬁcit over
a period of 15 years. The group will continue to make deﬁciency payments until the deﬁcit is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age proﬁle of active members will consequently
increase. Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members’
pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement. Despite the scheme
being closed to new entrants, the projected payment proﬁle extends over more than 60 years.
98 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 28. Pension costs continued
SSAP 24 accounting valuation
The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis:
& scheme assets are valued at market value; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return
reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
The pension cost for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was based on the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000. At 31 March
2000 there was a SSAP 24 deﬁcit of £0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years was 11.6%
of pensionable salaries. The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000 was based on the same assumptions as the
December 1999 funding valuation, with the exception that, over the long term, it has been assumed that the return on
the existing assets of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal 5.6% per annum which equates to a
real return of 2.5% per annum.
The pension costs for the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years were based upon the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2003 there was a SSAP 24 deﬁcit of £1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet prepayment
and the regular cost is 11.3% of pensionable salaries. The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003 is based on the 31
December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out above, with the following
exceptions:
& return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return of 4.7%;
& average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum; and
& the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real salary
growth assumption to 0.75% for the ﬁrst three years, before returning to 1.5%.
The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group
to the pension scheme and the proﬁt and loss charge is reﬂected on the balance sheet. The cumulative cash
contributions exceed the proﬁt and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance
sheet. At 31 March 2005 the prepayment was £1,118 million (2004 – £1,172 million).
The pension charge to the proﬁt and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension fund
position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which amounts to 13
years, and the cost of enhanced pension beneﬁts provided to leavers.
FRS 17 – Retirement beneﬁts
The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Full implementation of FRS 17 has been
deferred by the Accounting Standards Board and would have applied to the group for the 2006 ﬁnancial year. However,
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year the group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The requirements for
disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and adoption of IFRS, and the required information is set out
below. FRS 17 speciﬁes how key assumptions should be derived and applied. These assumptions are often different to
the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary and trustees in determining the funding position of pension
schemes. The accounting requirements under FRS 17 are broadly as follows:
& scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date;
& scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high
quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
& movement in the scheme surplus/deﬁcit is split between operating charges and ﬁnancing items in the proﬁt and loss
account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The ﬁnancial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2005 are:

The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the deﬁcit but does affect the level of
the expected return on assets within the net ﬁnance cost charged to the proﬁt and loss account under FRS 17.
The net pension deﬁcit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied. The fair value of the BTPS
assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the ﬁnancial assumptions set out above, and the resulting

fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to signiﬁcant change
before it is realised. The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term cash ﬂow projections and is thus
inherently uncertain.

31. Employee share plans
The company has an employee share investment plan, and savings-related share option plans for its employees and
those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected group employees and an employee stock
purchase plan for employees in the United States. It also has several share plans for executives.
Share option schemes
On the demerger of O2, BT’s share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee
Sharesave plans and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was operated on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and
demerger in November 2001. Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted to all participants
in the executive option plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares. The value of
the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and O2 plc shares over the
20 dealing days following the demerger on 19 November 2001. This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the
former option over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the
new option. The option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of
shares under option.
102 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 31. Employee share plans continued
In the year ended 31 March 2005, options over 31 million shares were granted under the BT Group Global Share
Option Plan. The options will be exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance
targets, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.

The option prices of shares under the BT Group Legacy Option Plan were adjusted at the time of the demerger as detailed on page 102.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2005 has been estimated on
the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in that
model: an expected life extending one month later than the ﬁrst exercise date; estimated annualised dividend yield of
approximately 5% (2004 – 5%, 2003 – 5%); risk free interest rates of approximately 5% (2004 – 4%, 2003 – 5%); and
expected volatility of approximately 25% (2004 – 25%, 2003 – 40%).
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 41p
(2004 – 42p, 2003 – 55p) for Sharesave options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 52p
(2004 – 51p, 2003 – 72p) for Sharesave options exercisable ﬁve years after the date of grant. The BT Group Global
Share Option Plan and the BT Group Incentive Share Plan (an executive share plan) were valued using Monte Carlo
simulations. The weighted average fair value of options granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan has
been estimated as 36p. The weighted average fair value of awards of shares granted under the Incentive Share Plan has
been estimated as 98p. The total value of share options granted by BT in the year ended 31 March 2005 was
£77 million (2004 – £136 million, 2003 – £41 million).
In accordance with UK accounting practices, no compensation expense is recognised for options granted where the
exercise price equals the market price at date of grant, or options granted under approved Sharesave plans. See United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles – IV Accounting for share options for the treatment under US GAAP.
Options granted, exercised and lapsed under these share option plans during the years ended 31 March 2003, 2004

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 103 31. Employee share plans continued
Incentive Share Plan and Retention Share Plan
The BT Incentive Share Plan (ISP) and the BT Retention Share Plan (RSP) were introduced for employees of the group in
2000. Under the plans, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally
awarded to participants. Under the ISP participants are normally only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a
three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the
participants are still employed by the group. If the company has exceeded the pre-determined corporate performance
measure the participants may be awarded up to double the shares conditionally awarded. The corporate performance
measure is BT’s total shareholder return (TSR) measured against a group of companies from the European Telecom
Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period. The ISP was operated in the 2005 ﬁnancial year with 1,406
participants receiving awards over 12,654,013 shares. The ISP was not operated in the 2004 ﬁnancial year. Under the
RSP the length of retention period before awards vest is ﬂexible. Awards may vest in annual tranches. The shares are
transferred at the end of a speciﬁed period, only if the individual is still employed by the group. During the 2005
ﬁnancial year 1,340,256 (2004 – 720,472) shares vested in 11 (2004 – 7) participants in the RSP.
Deferred Bonus Plan
The BT Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to employees of the
group. Under this plan, shares in the company are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and transferred to
participants at the end of three years if he or she has continued to be employed by the group throughout that period.
On 2 August 2004, 1,280,934 shares (1 August 2003 – 653,899) were transferred to 219 participants (1 August 2003
– 225) at the end of the three-year deferred period.
At 31 March 2005, 27.8 million shares (2004 – 30.5 million shares) in the company were held in trust for employee share
plans, of which 12.7 million shares (2004 – no shares) were held for the ISP, 2.8 million shares (2004 – 3.0 million shares)
were held for the RSP and 7.9 million shares (2004 – 6.5 million shares) were held for the DBP. Dividends or dividend
equivalents earned on the shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential beneﬁt of
the participants.

employee share plans. These shares had a nominal value of £0.2 million and a market value of £9.3 million at 31 March
2005.
The values of possible future transfers of shares under the plans were based on the BT Group plc share price at
31 March 2005 of 205.5p (2004 – 177p). The provisions for the costs of the ISP and RSP were based on best estimates
of the company’s performance over the plans’ conditional periods, relating to those portions of the plan conditional
periods from commencement up to the ﬁnancial year end.
104 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 31. Employee share plans continued
Employee Share Investment Plan
From December 2001 the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP) has been in operation. The ESIP,
which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs, gives UK employees an opportunity to purchase shares
(partnership shares) monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of £1,500 per year. During the 2005
ﬁnancial year, 6.1 million shares (2004 – 6.0 million shares), including 0.2 million shares purchased by dividend
reinvestment, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 13,017 (2004 – 13,974) employees at a total
cost of £11.7 million (2004 – £11.1 million). The free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK
employees which are held in trust for at least three years. A phantom plan, which delivers cash awards equivalent to the
value of the free shares, operates for employees outside the UK. In 2005, 0.5% of pre-tax proﬁts, amounting to
£11 million, was allocated to the ESIP and the phantom plan for employees outside the UK (2004 – £20 million). Up to
2% of pre tax proﬁts would have been available subject to meeting two corporate performance targets; one of
increasing earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items by 8% and the other of reducing
customer dissatisfaction by 25% on a compound annual basis over the past three years. Although these targets were
not met, a discretionary payment was made. The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme which
operated for employee proﬁt sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for employees in the US enables participants to purchase ADSs
quarterly at a price (the Base Option Price) which is 85% of the market price of an ADS at the start of the offer (or, in
the case of employees who join the ESPP after the start of the offer, 85% of the market price on their eligibility date,
whichever is higher). Up to 15 May 2005, 934,782 shares (93,478 ADSs) have been transferred to participants out of
treasury under the ESPP (up to 15 May 2004, 69,164 new shares were issued and 226,218 shares were transferred out
of treasury). The second offer, with a Base Option Price of US$25.61 ended in December 2004. A third offer was
launched in December 2004 with a Base Option Price of US$31.52 and will run until December 2005.
32. Auditors
The auditors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2005 for the group was £4,396,000 (2004 – £3,790,000,
2003 – £2,943,000). The audit fees payable to the company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for the company
and UK subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts were £2,454,000 (2004 – £2,482,000, 2003 – £1,910,000). The
audit fee of the company was £35,000 (2004 – £32,000, 2003 – £31,000). The following fees for audit and non-audit

2005 were £5,171,000 (2004 – £4,545,000, 2003 – £8,980,000).
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non
audit services can be provided by the company’s external auditors and the approval processes related to them. Under
those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efﬁciencies
and value added beneﬁts to the company.
BT’s regulatory obligations require it to publish audited regulatory ﬁnancial statements. The fees for regulatory work
principally reﬂect the audit fees associated with those regulatory ﬁnancial statements. The fees for tax services include
tax compliance and tax advisory services. The fees for systems advice in the year ended 31 March 2003 related to
advisory services provided in connection with the implementation of certain billing systems. These services, which were
provided by PwC Consulting, the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers that was sold to IBM in October 2002,
commenced in 2002 and were completed in 2003.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 105 33. Financial instruments and risk management
The group holds or issues ﬁnancial instruments mainly to ﬁnance its operations; for the temporary investment of short-
term funds; and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of
ﬁnance. In addition, various ﬁnancial instruments – for example trade debtors and trade creditors – arise directly from
the group’s operations.
The group ﬁnances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained proﬁts, deferred taxation,
long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes. The group
borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies. Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets
provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing. The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments
primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates. The derivatives
used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The types of ﬁnancial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies
with limits on the exposure to any one organisation. Short-term investing in ﬁnancial instruments is undertaken on
behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain
deﬁned derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversiﬁcation and maturity proﬁles.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the group’s net debt reduced from £8.4 billion to £7.8 billion mainly from
working capital inﬂows and proceeds from the sale of investments. During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the group
restructured some of its swaps portfolio. As a result, the group terminated £2.9 billion of cross-currency and sterling
interest rate swaps with some swaps being replaced with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect. This
resulted in the group paying £107 million in reducing gross debt and receiving a net £14 million of interest receipts.
The interest receipts and payments on restructuring have been included within deferred income and other debtors
respectively and will be amortised to the proﬁt and loss account over the term of the underlying hedged debt. The
group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle on net debt is 95:5 at 31 March 2005.
During the year ended 31 March 2004, the group’s net debt reduced from £9.6 billion to £8.4 billion mainly from
working capital inﬂows. During the 2004 ﬁnancial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio to mitigate
credit risk to certain counter parties. As a result, the group terminated £7 billion of cross-currency interest rate swaps
and replaced these with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect. This resulted in the group paying
£445 million in reducing gross debt and receiving £420 million of interest. The interest receipt has been included in
deferred income and will be amortised to the proﬁt and loss account over the term of the underlying debt. The group’s
ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle on net debt was 76:24 at 31 March 2004.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group’s net debt reduced from £13.7 billion to £9.6 billion. £2.6 billion
was realised from the disposal of the group’s interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the group has closed out
£2.6 billion of associated ﬁxed interest rate swaps. The group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle on net debt therefore
remained at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.
The group uses ﬁnancial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets,
liabilities and forward purchase commitments. The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities. The ﬁnancial
instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, gilt locks and
interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the group’s risk proﬁle between 31 March 2005 and the date of these
ﬁnancial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the
parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives. The
amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to interest
and exchange rates.
(a) Interest rate risk management
The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and
periods for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed. Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties
to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the differences between ﬁxed rate and ﬂoating rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed notional principal amount. Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK government long-dated treasury
stock were entered into for periods of up to one year. This hedge effectively ﬁxed in the interest on part of the group’s
then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2005, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal
amount of £5,297 million (2004 – £5,210 million).
(b) Foreign exchange risk management
Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency
exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s net assets. The group also enters into forward foreign exchange
contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign
currencies (principally US dollars and the euro). The remaining terms of the currency swaps are up to 26 years and the
terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the group’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual
net inﬂows and net outﬂows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2005, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts
having a total notional principal amount of £9,819 million (2004 – £11,367 million).
106 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 33. Financial instruments and risk management continued
The values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2005 were £427 million (2004 – £301 million) for
purchases of currency and £782 million (2004 – £1,223 million) for sales of currency. These values have been
estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate to the terms of the
contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2005, the group had deferred unrealised gains of £2 million (2004 – £nil) and losses of £nil (2004 –
£5 million), based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in addition had deferred
realised net losses of £5 million (2004 – £3 million gains). These are included in the proﬁt and loss account as part of
the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no
longer expected to occur.
(c) Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of ﬁnancial instruments
The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not expect
any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
counterparty. The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that if the
group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P, additional
interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings
category adjustment by each ratings agency. In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s credit rating to Baa1, which
increased BT’s interest charge by approximately £32 million per annum. BT’s current credit rating from S&P is A minus.
Based upon the total debt of £9 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2005, BT’s annual interest
charge would increase by approximately £26 million if BT’s credit ratings were to be downgraded by one credit rating
category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1/A minus. If BT’s credit rating with Moody’s was to be
upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest charge would be reduced by approximately £13 million.
(d) Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the group’s ﬁnancial instruments at 31 March 2005
and 2004. The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings, with the
exception of derivative amounts, which are included in debtors or other creditors or as part of net debt as appropriate.
The fair values of the ﬁnancial instruments are the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in forced or liquidation sale.

The fair values of listed short-term investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments. The carrying amount of the other
short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments held.

The fair values of listed fixed asset investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.

The fair value of the group’s bonds, debentures, notes and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the
same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash flows using the appropriate
discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
d
The fair value of the group’s outstanding foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements was estimated by calculating the present value, using
appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, of affected future cash flows translated, where appropriate, into pounds sterling at
the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.

United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
112 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 The group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the UK (UK GAAP), which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US (US GAAP).
i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles
The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the group’s
ﬁnancial statements.
(a) Sale and leaseback of properties
Under UK GAAP, the sale of BT’s property portfolio is treated as a ﬁxed asset disposal and the subsequent leaseback is
an operating lease. Under US GAAP, the transaction is regarded as ﬁnancing and the land and buildings are recorded
on the balance sheet at their net book value, an obligation equivalent to the cash proceeds is recognised and the gain
on disposal is deferred until the properties are vacated by BT. Rental payments made by BT are reversed and replaced
by a ﬁnance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
(b) Pension costs
Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice
No. 24, with costs being charged against proﬁts over employees’ working lives. Under US GAAP, pension costs are
determined in accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Nos. 87
and 88. Differences between the UK and US GAAP ﬁgures arise from the requirement to use different actuarial
methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deﬁcits.
(c) Accounting for redundancies
Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing incremental pension beneﬁts in respect of workforce reductions is taken into
account when determining current and future pension costs, unless the most recent actuarial valuation, combined with
the provision for pension costs in the group balance sheet, under UK actuarial conventions, shows a deﬁcit. In this case,
the cost of providing incremental pension beneﬁts is included in redundancy charges in the year in which the employees
agree to leave the group.
Under US GAAP, the associated costs of providing incremental pension beneﬁts are charged against proﬁts in the
period in which the termination terms are agreed with the employees. The fair value of termination beneﬁts for
employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual retention period is recognised on a straight line
basis over the future service period.
(d) Capitalisation of interest
Under UK GAAP, the group does not capitalise interest. To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest
incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in ﬁxed assets, and depreciated over the lives of the
related assets. The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rates on
outstanding borrowings. At 31 March 2005 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of £349 million (2004 –
£358 million) with regard to the company and its subsidiary companies was subject to depreciation generally over
periods of 3 to 25 years.
(e) Goodwill
Under UK GAAP, in respect of acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 1998, the group wrote off goodwill arising from
the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition against retained earnings. The
goodwill is reﬂected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain or loss on
divestment. Following the implementation of UK Financial Reporting Standard No. 10 (FRS 10), goodwill arising on
acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic
life. All unamortised and pre-April 1998 goodwill will be brought back to the proﬁt and loss account on disposal.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life. BT adopted SFAS No. 142 on
1 April 2002 and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment. In connection with the adoption
of SFAS No. 142 transitional and annual impairment reviews were performed. There was no transitional impairment
charge recorded. As a result of the annual impairment review, no goodwill impairment charge was recognised in the
year ended 31 March 2005 (2004 – nil, 2003 – £54 million). Goodwill of £16 million (2004 – £12 million, 2003 –
£20 million) amortised under UK GAAP is written back through the income statement.
(f) Intangible assets
Certain intangible ﬁxed assets recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements are subsumed within
goodwill under UK GAAP. The intangible assets acquired in the 2005 ﬁnancial year comprise customer relationships
and brand relating to Infonet – see note 15. Under US GAAP these separately identiﬁed intangible assets are valued
and amortised over their useful lives which range from 5 to 15 years.
(g) Financial instruments
Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost. Gains and losses on instruments used for
hedges are not recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised. Under US GAAP, trading securities and
available-for-sale securities are carried at market value with appropriate valuation adjustments recorded in proﬁt and
loss and shareholders’ equity, respectively.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 113 i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles continued
Certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify for hedge
accounting under US GAAP. Under US GAAP, ﬁnancial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the
extensive documentation requirements. These ﬁnancial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried at market value with
valuation adjustments recorded in the income statement. The reassessment and purchase of derivatives in the year
ended 31 March 2005 gave rise to an adjustment reducing net income by £299 million net of tax (2004 – reduction
£133 million, 2003 reduction £610 million). The net unrealised holding gain on equity investments held as available-
for-sale securities for the year ended 31 March 2005 was £19 million (2004 – £5 million, 2003 – £22 million).
(h) Employee share plans
Certain share options have been granted under BT save-as-you-earn plans at a 20% discount. Under UK GAAP, the
share issues are recorded at their discounted price when the options are exercised. Under US GAAP, a plan is considered
compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15%. Compensation cost is recognised for the
difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the
date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
(i) Investments in associates
Under UK GAAP, the economic interest in the associates’ operating proﬁts before minority interest is reported as part
of the total operating proﬁt. For those associates in which a minority interest is recognised in their respective
statements of proﬁt and loss, such minority interest is reported as minority interest in the consolidated
proﬁt and loss account. Under US GAAP, the minority interest in the associates is reclassiﬁed from minority interest
and reported within the share of results of associates.
(j) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arose as a result of transactions that
had occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay
less tax in the future. Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis. Future tax beneﬁts are
recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than not. At 31 March 2005 total
deferred tax liabilities were £2,715 million primarily in respect of accelerated capital allowances and total deferred tax
assets were £2,221 million, primarily in respect of pension obligations.
The total valuation allowance recognised for deferred tax assets was as follows:

Overseas losses not utilised 860 572 288
Other 705 419 286
6,001 5,834 167
At 31 March 2005 the group had operating losses and capital losses carried forward. The group’s capital losses have no
expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various
territories in which the losses arise. A summary of expiry dates for losses in territories in which restrictions do apply is

(k) Dividends
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared (in the case of interim or any
special dividends) or proposed by the board of directors to the shareholders (in the case of ﬁnal dividends). Under
US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
(l) Impairment
Under UK GAAP, if there is an indication of impairment the assets should be tested for impairment and, if necessary
written down to the value in use, calculated based on discounted future pre-tax cash ﬂows related to the asset or the
income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash
ﬂows. An impairment loss exists if the sum of these cash ﬂows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The
impairment loss recognised in the income statement is based on the asset’s fair value, being either market value or the
sum of discounted future cash ﬂows. Tangible assets that were not impaired under US GAAP are depreciated over their
remaining useful lives.
(m) Disposals of businesses
There are timing differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP for recognition of gains on the sale of certain businesses.
Foreign exchange movements taken to reserves under UK GAAP are reported in the income statement under US GAAP.
Historical GAAP differences on disposed businesses are also shown under this line item.
(n) Property rationalisation provision
Under UK GAAP in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the group’s London
ofﬁce property portfolio was recorded. Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146, these costs are not
recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties. All these properties were
exited by 31 December 2004.
(o) Revenue
Under UK GAAP long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under SSAP 9
‘‘Stocks and long-term contracts’’ and FRS 5 ‘‘Reporting the substance of transactions’’, under which turnover is
recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP revenue of £162 million under these contracts is deferred in the 2005 ﬁnancial year under SOP 97-

iii Minority interests
Under US GAAP, the income to minority interests would have been unchanged (2004 – unchanged, 2003 – £27 million
reduction) after adjusting for goodwill amortisation and accounting for associates and joint ventures. Net assets
attributable to minority interests would have been unchanged (2004 – unchanged) after adjusting for ﬁnancial
instruments.
116 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles iv Accounting for share options
Under UK GAAP, the company does not recognise compensation expense for the fair value, at the date of grant, of
share options granted under the employee share option schemes. Under US GAAP, the company adopted
the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No. 123 ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation’’. Accordingly, the company
accounts for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees’’, under
which no compensation expense on ﬁxed plans, other than SAYE plans, is recognised. Had the group recognised
compensation cost for options granted in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the group’s pro forma net income (loss),
basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share under US GAAP would have been £1,289 million
(2004 – £862 million, 2003 – £4,127 million), 15.1p (2004 – 10.0p, 2003 – 47.9p) and 15.0p (2004 – 9.9p, 2003 –
47.6p), respectively. See note 31 for the SFAS No. 123 disclosures of the fair value of options granted under employee
schemes at date of grant.
v Consolidated statements of cash ﬂows
Under UK GAAP, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented in accordance with UK Financial Reporting
Standard No. 1 (FRS 1). The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same information as that
required under SFAS No. 95.
Under SFAS No. 95, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase. Under FRS 1 cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and overnight deposits,
net of bank overdrafts.
Under FRS 1, cash ﬂows are presented for operating activities; returns on investments and servicing of ﬁnance;
taxation; capital expenditure and ﬁnancial investments; acquisitions and disposals; dividends paid to the company’s
shareholders; management of liquid resources and ﬁnancing. SFAS No. 95 requires a classiﬁcation of cash ﬂows as
resulting from operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities.
Cash ﬂows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid (net of that capitalised under US GAAP) and
taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No. 95. Cash ﬂows from purchases, sales and
maturities of trading securities, while not separately identiﬁed under UK GAAP, would be included within operating
activities under US GAAP. Capitalised interest, while not recognised under UK GAAP, is included in investing activities
under US GAAP. Dividends paid are included within ﬁnancing activities under US GAAP.
The following statements summarise the statements of cash ﬂows as if they had been presented in accordance with
US GAAP, and include the adjustments which reconcile cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP to cash at bank and
in hand reported under UK GAAP.

vi Current asset investments
Under US GAAP, investments in debt securities would be classiﬁed as either trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
Trading investments would be stated at fair values and the unrealised gains and losses would be included in income.
Securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale would be stated at fair values, with unrealised gains and losses, net of deferred
taxes, reported in shareholders’ equity. Debt securities classiﬁed as held-to-maturity would be stated at amortised cost.
The following analyses do not include securities with original maturities of less than three months.
At 31 March 2005, the group held trading investments (as deﬁned by US GAAP) with fair values totalling
£339 million (2004 – £423 million). Held-to-maturity securities at 31 March 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following:

vii Pension costs
The following position for the main pension scheme is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting rules
under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No. 87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate of
return on scheme assets of 7.27% (2004 – 7.35%, 2003 – 6.90%). The components of the pension cost for the main
pension scheme comprised:

Pension cost for the year under US GAAP 642 804 461
The information required to be disclosed in accordance with SFAS No. 132(R) concerning the funded status of the main
scheme at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005, based on the valuations at 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2005,

Unrecognised prior service costs on scheme benefit improvements are being amortised over periods of 15 or 16 years commencing in the years of the
introduction of the improvements.
Asset allocation
The Trustees of the main pension scheme approve the target asset allocation as well as deviation limits. The objective
of the investment activities is to maximise investment return within an acceptable level of risk, taking into consideration
the liabilities of the main pension scheme.

The assumption for the expected return in scheme assets is a weighted average based on an assumed expected return
for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year. The expected returns on
bonds are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year. Expected returns on equities and property are
based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus
economic forecasts of future returns. The expected return of 7.27% per annum used for the calculation of pension
costs for the year ending 31 March 2005 is consistent with that adopted for FRS 17.
viii Income statement in US GAAP format
The group proﬁt and loss accounts on pages 75 to 77 comply with UK GAAP and the directors believe they are in the
most appropriate format for shareholders to understand the results of our business. We believe that it is important to
show our results before deducting goodwill amortisation and exceptional items because these items predominantly
relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group. For SEC reporting purposes this
presentation would be considered ‘‘non GAAP’’ and therefore the group has also prepared the following income
statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X. The ﬁnancial numbers
disclosed in the following income statement are prepared under UK GAAP.

ix US GAAP developments
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (SFAS 123R) ‘‘Share-
Based Payment’’ which revises SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires that the cost of all share-based
payment transactions be recognised in the ﬁnancial statements. SFAS 123R also establishes fair value as the
measurement method in accounting for share-based payments to employees. BT adopted SFAS 123R on 1 April 2005
using the modiﬁed prospective transition method. BT estimates the application of the expensing provisions of SFAS
123R will result in a pre-tax expense of approximately £45 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year subject to additional
grants and awards.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 (SFAS 153) ‘‘Exchanges
of Non-monetary Assets – an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29’’ SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges
of non-monetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for non-monetary exchanges of similar
productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29 ‘‘Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions’’ and replaces
it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash ﬂows of the entity are expected to change signiﬁcantly as a result of the exchange. As
required by SFAS 153, we will adopt this new accounting standard effective 1 July 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 is
not expected to have a material impact on our ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.151 (SFAS 151), ‘‘Inventory
Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4’’, which clariﬁes that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognised as a current period expense. In addition,
SFAS 151 requires that allocation of ﬁxed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for ﬁscal years beginning after 15 June 2005. BT does not
believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its ﬁnancial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows.
120 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ix US GAAP developments continued
In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 02-14 ‘Whether an Investor Should Apply the
Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock’, in which the Task Force reached the
consensus that an investor that has the ability to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the operating and ﬁnancial policies
of the investee should apply the equity method of accounting when it has an investment in common stock and/or an
investment that is in-substance common stock. The consensus of this EITF is to be applied in reporting periods
beginning after September 15, 2004. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on
our ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In October 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 04-1 ‘Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships
between the Parties to a Business Combination’ (EITF 04-1). EITF 04-1 addresses the accounting treatment of
pre-existing relationships between the parties of a business combination. The consensus of EITF 04-1 should be applied
to business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests performed in reporting periods beginning after
the FASB ratiﬁed the consensus at its October 13, 2004 meeting. The group will adopt the provisions of EITF 04-1 as
of April 1, 2005. If it is determined that assets of an acquired entity are related to a pre-existing contractual
relationship, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination, BT will evaluate whether the acquiring
entity of the group should recognise contractual relationships as assets separate from goodwill in that business
combination.
In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments’ (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribed a three-step model for
determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosure for unrealized losses on
investments. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1 ‘Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20
of EITF Issue No. 03-1’ (FSP EITF 03-1-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective date for the measurement and
recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1. The disclosure requirements of EITF 03-1 remain
effective for ﬁscal years ending after June 15, 2004. No effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance
has been established in FSP EITF 03-1-1. During the period of delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that companies should
continue to apply current guidance to determine if an impairment is other-than-temporary. The adoption of EITF 03-1,
excluding paragraphs 10-20, did not impact the group’s consolidated position, results of operations or cash ﬂows. The
group will assess the impact of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 once the guidance has been ﬁnalised.

BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 125 The business of BT is affected by a number of factors, not all of which are wholly within BT’s control. Although many of the
factors inﬂuencing BT’s performance are macro economic and likely to affect the performance of businesses generally, some
aspects of BT’s business make it particularly sensitive to certain areas of business risk. This section highlights some of those
speciﬁc areas. However, it does not purport to be an extensive analysis of the factors affecting the business and some risks may
be unknown to us and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, could turn out to be material. All of these could
materially adversely affect our business, turnover, proﬁts, assets, liquidity and capital resources. They should also be considered
in connection with the forward looking statements in this document and the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking
statements on page 128 of this document.
If BT’s activities are subject to signiﬁcant price and other regulatory controls, its market share, competitive position and
future proﬁtability may be affected
Most of BT’s ﬁxed network activities in the UK are subject to signiﬁcant regulatory controls. The controls regulate, among other
things, the prices BT may charge for many of its services and the extent to which it has to provide services to its competitors. In
recent years, the effect of these controls has been to cause BT to reduce its prices. BT cannot assure its shareholders that the
regulatory authorities will not increase the severity of the price controls, nor extend the services to which controls apply
(including any new services that BT may offer in the future), nor extend the services which it has to provide its competitors.
These controls may adversely affect BT’s market share, the severity of competition and its future proﬁtability. During 2004 and
2005 Ofcom has been undertaking a strategic review of the UK telecommunications market in order to formulate the principles
on which it can base its regulatory decisions in the future. This review is scheduled to be completed in 2005. It is not possible to
predict the ultimate outcome or implications for BT of Ofcom’s review. Further details on the regulatory framework in which
BT operates can be found in ‘‘Business Review – regulation, competition and prices’’ on pages 15 to 22 of this document.
BT faces strong competition in UK ﬁxed network services
BT continues to have a signiﬁcant market share in some aspects of UK ﬁxed network services. In particular, in the 2005
ﬁnancial year we estimate we had a market share of 64% of consumer calls and 42% of business calls in the UK. Regulators
have promoted competition in this area by allowing BT’s competitors to site equipment in or adjacent to its exchanges (local
loop unbundling), to make it easier for BT’s customers to route some or all of their calls over competitors’ networks (carrier
pre-selection) and by the introduction of a wholesale access product (wholesale line rental). Reduction in BT’s market share in
the ﬁxed network may lead to a fall in BT’s turnover and an adverse effect on proﬁtability. Unlike its competitors, BT continues
to be obliged by the current regulatory regime to serve customers in the UK, whether or not such provision of service is
economic, and the competitive measures described above may have the effect of accelerating the diversion of its more
proﬁtable existing customers without it being able to reduce its costs commensurately. There is also competition for voice and
data trafﬁc volumes between ﬁxed network operators and those operators offering VoIP (Voice over IP) and mobile services.
These changes in the regulatory environment and ensuing increased competition on BT’s ﬁxed network may cause adverse
effects on its business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and prospects.
BT’s business is dependent on the ability to exploit technological advances quickly and successfully
BT operates in an industry with a recent history of fast technological changes. It expects that new products and technologies will
continue to emerge and that existing products and technologies will develop further. BT needs to continually develop its services
and products to exploit those next generation technologies. However, BT cannot predict the actual effect of these technological
changes on its business or on its ability to provide competitive services. For example there is evidence of substitution by
customers using mobile phones for day-to-day voice calls in place of making such calls over the ﬁxed network. Additionally,
some calls are now being routed over the internet in place of the traditional switched network. If these trends accelerate, BT’s
ﬁxed network assets may be used uneconomically and its investment in these assets may not be recovered through proﬁts on
ﬁxed-network calls and line rentals. The complexity of the 21st Century Network may also result in delays to the delivery of
expected beneﬁts. Impairment write-downs may be incurred and margins may decline if ﬁxed costs cannot be reduced in line
with falling turnover.
BT is carrying out a transformation strategy, including the targeting of signiﬁcant growth in new wave business areas
BT has a strategy to transform its business. This may result in changes to its products, services, markets and culture. If the
group’s transformation strategy is unsuccessful there is a risk that the future turnover and proﬁtability will decline. In particular
BT has targeted signiﬁcant growth in new business areas, such as broadband, mobility and Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) solutions. In view of the likely level of competition and uncertainties regarding the level of economic activity,
there can be no certainty that BT will meet its growth targets in these areas, with a consequential impact on future turnover
and proﬁtability.
BT’s businesses may be adversely affected if they fail to perform on major contracts
BT has entered into a number of complex and high value services contracts with customers. Failure to manage and meet BT’s
commitments under these contracts may lead to a reduction in BT’s future turnover, proﬁtability and cash generation.
BT’s businesses may be adversely affected if their networks or systems experience any signiﬁcant failures or interruptions
BT’s businesses are dependent on their ability to transfer substantial volumes of data speedily and without interruption. Any
signiﬁcant failure or interruption of such data transfer due to factors outside their control could have a material adverse effect
on the businesses and their results from operations. BT has a business continuity strategy designed to deal with such
catastrophic events, including for example major terrorist action, industrial action, extreme virus attack, hurricane or ﬂooding,
that may impact the ability to maintain an effective service to customers. A failure to deliver that strategy may result in a
material loss and there can be no assurance that material adverse events will not occur.
Declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may result in the funding cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on the ﬁnancial resources of BT
The deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), was closed to new members on 31 March 2001 and has
been replaced by a deﬁned contribution scheme (BTRP). The latest full triennial actuarial valuation of the BTPS was completed
as at 31 December 2002. As a result, BT agreed to make normal contributions of 12.2% of pensionable pay and annual
deﬁciency payments of £232 million. This will apply until the next triennial actuarial valuation is completed as at 31 December
2005. In March 2004 a £380 million prepayment of deﬁciency contributions was made, representing most of the deﬁciency
contributions for the 2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years. The results of future scheme valuations will be impacted by the future
investment market performance, interest and inﬂation rates and the general trend towards longer life expectancy, all of which
are outside the control of BT. In the event that investment returns decline or life expectancy increases, the cash funding cost to
BT may increase and may have a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnancial resources of BT.

BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 127 Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
Certain statements in this annual report are forward-looking and are made in reliance on the safe harbour provisions of
the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to analyses and other information
which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements
include, without limitation, those concerning: BT’s transformation strategy and its ability to achieve it; expected cost
savings; growth of, and opportunities available in, the communications industry and BT’s positioning to take advantage
of those opportunities; expectations regarding competition, market shares, prices and growth; expectations regarding
the convergence of technologies; growth and opportunities in new wave business (such as networked IT services,
broadband and mobility); BT’s network development and plans for the 21st century network; plans for the launch of
new products and services; network performance and quality; the impact of regulatory initiatives on operations,
including the regulation of the UK ﬁxed wholesale and retail businesses; BT’s possible or assumed future results of
operations and/or those of its associates and joint ventures; BT’s future dividend policy; capital expenditure and
investment plans; adequacy of capital; ﬁnancing plans; demand for and access to broadband and the promotion of
broadband by third-party service providers; and those preceded by, followed by, or that include the words ‘believes’,
‘expects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘intends’ or similar expressions.
Due to a number of new and revised Standards included within the body of Standards that comprise IFRS
(International Financial Reporting Standards), there is not yet a signiﬁcant body of established practice on which to
draw in forming opinions regarding interpretation and application. Accordingly, practice is continuing to evolve. At this
preliminary stage, therefore, the full ﬁnancial effect of reporting under IFRS as it will be applied and reported on in the
group’s ﬁrst IFRS ﬁnancial statements cannot be determined with certainty and may be subject to change.
Although BT believes that the expectations reﬂected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give
no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct. Because these statements involve risks and
uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause differences between actual results and those implied by the forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to: material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by BT and its
lines of business; future regulatory actions and conditions in its operating areas, including competition from others in
the UK and other international communications markets; selection by BT and its lines of business of the appropriate
trading and marketing models for its products and services; technological innovations, including the cost of developing
new products and the need to increase expenditures for improving the quality of service; the anticipated beneﬁts and
advantages of new technologies not being realised; developments in the convergence of technologies; prolonged
adverse weather conditions resulting in a material increase in overtime, staff or other costs; the timing of entry and
proﬁtability of BT and its lines of business in certain communications markets; signiﬁcant changes in market shares for
BT and its principal products and services; ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; and
general ﬁnancial market conditions affecting BT’s performance. Certain of these factors are discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this annual report including, without limitation, in Risk factors.BT undertakes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The pre-19 November 2001 prices shown have been adjusted for the rights issue and demerger that occurred in the 2002 financial year.
The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the Daily
Ofﬁcial List of the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest closing sales prices of ADSs, as reported on the
New York Stock Exchange composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent of the
pound sterling price of the company’s ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to
affect the market price of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
Capital gains tax (CGT)
The rights issue in June 2001 and the demerger of O2 in November 2001 adjusted the value for capital gains tax
purposes of BT shares.
Rights issue
An explanatory note on the effects of the rights issue on the CGT position relating to BT shareholdings is available from
the Shareholder Helpline (see page 139).
Demerger of O2 – capital gains tax calculation
The conﬁrmed ofﬁcial opening prices for BT Group and O2 shares on 19 November 2001 following the demerger were
285.75p and 82.75p, respectively. This means that, of the total (combined) value of 368.50p, 77.544% is attributable
to BT Group and 22.456% to O2. Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost of BT Group shares and O2 shares is
calculated by multiplying the acquisition cost of a BT shareholding by 77.544% and 22.456%, respectively. 130 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders

So far as the company is aware, the company is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or
by the UK Government or any other foreign government or by any other natural or legal person severally or jointly.
There are no arrangements known to the company the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change

At 13 May 2005, there were 8,634,629,038 ordinary shares outstanding including 134,277,107 shares held as
treasury shares. At the same date, approximately 25 million ADSs (equivalent to 250 million ordinary shares, or
approximately 2.9% of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding on that date) were outstanding and were held
by 2,579 record holders of ADRs. At 31 March 2005, there were 3,593 shareholders with a US address on the register
of shareholders.
Dividends
Since shortly after its incorporation in 1984, British Telecommunications plc paid interim dividends annually in February
and ﬁnal dividends in September. However, as part of BT’s debt reduction and restructuring plans, neither a ﬁnal
dividend for the year ended 31 March 2001 nor an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2002 was paid to
shareholders.
A ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004, was paid on 6 September 2004 to shareholders on the
register on 6 August 2004, and an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005 was paid on 7 February
2005 to shareholders on the register on 31 December 2004.
The dividends paid or payable on BT shares and ADSs for the last ﬁve years are shown in the following table. The
dividends on the ordinary shares exclude the associated tax credit. The amounts shown are not those that were actually
paid to holders of ADSs. For the tax treatment of dividends paid see Taxation of dividends below. Dividends have been
translated from pounds sterling into US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the date the ordinary dividends were
paid.

Qualifying holders of ADSs on record as of 5 August 2005 are entitled to receive the final dividend which will be paid on 12 September 2005, subject
to approval at the annual general meeting. The US dollar amount of the final dividend of 65 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based
on the exchange rate in effect on 5 September 2005, the date of payment to holders of ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate ﬂuctuations will affect the US dollar amounts
received by holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
Dividend mandate
Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact
the Shareholder Helpline (see page 139). Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers Automated
Clearing System (BACS). Alternatively, a form may be downloaded from the internet at

Dividend investment plan
The dividend investment plan replaced the share dividend plan for shareholders following the 1999 interim dividend.
Under the dividend investment plan, cash from participants’ dividends is used to buy further BT Group shares in the
market.
Shareholders could elect to receive additional shares in lieu of a cash dividend for the following dividends:

Total shareholder return
Total shareholder return (TSR) is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders,
reﬂecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is, therefore, a good indicator of a
company’s overall performance.
Over the past ﬁve years (as shown in the TSR chart below), BT Group’s TSR (as adjusted for the rights issue and
demerger) was negative 70% compared to a FTSE 100 TSR of negative 12%. This was primarily due to a fall in BT’s
share price which, like many stocks in the telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector, declined in the ﬁrst two years
of the period.
In the period between the demerger on 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2005, BT’s TSR was negative 17%,
almost in line with the FTSEuroﬁrst 300 Telco Index (negative 16%). However, in the last 12 months, BT’s TSR has
outperformed both the FTSE 100 and FTSEuroﬁrst 300 Telco Index with a 21.8% return compared to a 15.4% return
for each of those indices.

Memorandum and Articles of Association
The following is a summary of the principal provisions of BT’s memorandum and articles of association (‘Memorandum’
and ‘Articles’), a copy of which has been ﬁled with the Registrar of Companies. Additional information for shareholders BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 133
Memorandum
The Memorandum provides that the company’s principal objects are, among other things, to carry on any business of
running, operating, managing and supplying telecommunication systems and systems of any kind for conveying,
receiving, storing, processing or transmitting sounds, visual images, signals, messages and communications of any
kind.
Articles
In the following description of the rights attaching to the shares in the company, a ‘holder of shares’ and a
‘shareholder’ is, in either case, the person entered on the company’s register of members as the holder of the relevant
shares. Shareholders can choose whether their shares are to be evidenced by share certiﬁcates (i.e. in certiﬁcated form)
or held in electronic (i.e. uncertiﬁcated) form in CREST (the electronic settlement system in the UK).
(a) Voting rights
Subject to the restrictions described below, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any
general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each
share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman
of the meeting or by at least ﬁve shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies), or by one
or more shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies) and who have, between them, at least
10% of the total votes of all shareholders who have the right to vote at the meeting.
No person is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting or to exercise any
other right conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person appearing to be interested in those shares has been
sent a notice under section 212 of the Companies Act 1985 (which confers upon public companies the power to require
information with respect to interests in their voting shares) and he or any interested person has failed to supply to the
company the information requested within 14 days after delivery of that notice. These restrictions end seven days after
the earlier of the date the shareholder complies with the request satisfactorily or the company receives notice that there
has been an approved transfer of the shares.
(b) Variation of rights
Whenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to any of
those classes can be varied or withdrawn either:
(i) with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that
class; or
(ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
At any separate meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one-
third in nominal amount of the issued shares of the class in question (but at any adjourned meeting, any person holding
shares of the class or his proxy is a quorum).
The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by
special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take
priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the
existing shares can rank equally.
(c) Changes in capital
The company may by ordinary resolution:
(i) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount;
(ii) divide all or part of its share capital into shares of a smaller amount;
(iii) cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the ordinary resolution, been taken or agreed to be taken by any
person and reduce the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares cancelled; and
(iv) increase its share capital.
The company may also:
(i) buy back its own shares; and
(ii) by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account.
(d) Dividends
The company’s shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution provided that no dividend can
exceed the amount recommended by the directors. Dividends must be paid out of proﬁts available for distribution. If
the directors consider that the proﬁts of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim dividends on any
class of shares of the amounts and on the dates and for the periods they decide. Fixed dividends will be paid on any
class of shares on the dates stated for the payments of those dividends.
The directors can offer ordinary shareholders the right to choose to receive new ordinary shares, which are credited
as fully paid, instead of some or all of their cash dividend. Before they can do this, the company’s shareholders must
have passed an ordinary resolution authorising the directors to make this offer.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for ten years after it was declared or became due for payment will
be forfeited and will belong to the company unless the directors decide otherwise. 134 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders
(e) Distribution of assets on winding up
If the company is wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of the court or by the court) the
liquidator can, with the authority of an extraordinary resolution passed by the shareholders, divide among the
shareholders all or any part of the assets of the company. This applies whether the assets consist of property of one
kind or different kinds. For this purpose, the liquidator can place whatever value the liquidator considers fair on any
property and decide how the division is carried out between shareholders or different groups of shareholders. The
liquidator can also, with the same authority, transfer any assets to trustees upon any trusts for the beneﬁt of
shareholders which the liquidator decides. The liquidation of the company can then be ﬁnalised and the company
dissolved. No past or present shareholder can be compelled to accept any shares or other property under the Articles
which could give that shareholder a liability.
(f) Transfer of shares
Certiﬁcated shares of the company may be transferred in writing either by an instrument of transfer in the usual
standard form or in another form approved by the Board. The transfer form must be signed or made effective by or on
behalf of the person making the transfer. The person making the transfer will be treated as continuing to be the holder
of the shares transferred until the name of the person to whom the shares are being transferred is entered in the
register of members of the company.
The Board may refuse to register any transfer of any share held in certiﬁcated form:
& which is in favour of more than four joint holders; or
& unless the transfer form to be registered is properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty and
delivered to the company’s registered ofﬁce or any other place the Board decide. The transfer must have with it the
share certiﬁcate for the shares to be transferred; any other evidence which the Board ask for to prove that the
person wanting to make the transfer is entitled to do this; and if the transfer form is executed by another person on
behalf of the person making the transfer, evidence of the authority of that person to do so.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using a relevant system (as deﬁned in the Uncertiﬁcated
Securities Regulations 1995 (the Regulations)). The Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertiﬁcated share in
the circumstances stated in the Regulations.
If the Board decide not to register a transfer of a share, the Board must notify the person to whom that share was to
be transferred no later than two months after the company receives the transfer or instruction from the operator of the
relevant system.
The Board can decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of
shareholders. The register must not be closed without the consent of the operator of a relevant system (as deﬁned in
the Regulations) in the case of uncertiﬁcated shares.
(g) Untraced shareholders
BT may sell any shares after advertising its intention and waiting for three months if the shares have been in issue for at
least ten years, during that period at least three dividends have become payable on them and have not been claimed
and BT has not heard from the shareholder or any person entitled to the dividends by transmission. The net sale
proceeds belong to BT, but it must pay those proceeds to the former shareholder or the person entitled to them by
transmission if that shareholder, or that other person, asks for them.
(h) General meetings of shareholders
Every year the company must hold an annual general meeting. The Board can call an extraordinary general meeting at
any time and, under general law, must call one on a shareholders’ requisition.
(i) Limitations on rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders
The only limitation imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders is that a shareholder
whose registered address is outside the UK and who wishes to receive notices of meetings of shareholders or
documents from BT must give the company an address within the UK to which they may be sent.
(j) Directors
Directors’ remuneration
Excluding remuneration referred to below, each director will be paid such fee for his services as the Board decide, not
exceeding £50,000 a year and increasing by the percentage increase of the UK Retail Prices Index (as deﬁned by
Section 833(2) Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) for any 12-month period beginning 1 April 1999 or an
anniversary of that date. The company may by ordinary resolution decide on a higher sum. This resolution can increase
the fee paid to all or any directors either permanently or for a particular period. The directors may be paid their
expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of the company.
The Board can award extra fees to a director who holds an executive position; acts as chairman or deputy chairman;
serves on a Board committee at the request of the Board; or performs any other services which the Board consider
extend beyond the ordinary duties of a director.
The directors may grant pensions or other beneﬁts to, among others, any director or former director or persons
connected with them. However, BT can only provide these beneﬁts to any director or former director who has not been
an employee or held any other ofﬁce or executive position in the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, or to
relations or dependants of, or people connected to, those directors or former directors, if the shareholders approve this
by passing an ordinary resolution. Additional information for shareholders BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 135
Directors’ votes
A director need not be a shareholder, but a director who is not a shareholder can still attend and speak at shareholders’
meetings.
Unless the Articles say otherwise, a director cannot vote on a resolution about a contract in which the director has a
material interest (this will also apply to interests of a person connected with the director). The director can vote if the
interest is only an interest in BT shares, debentures or other securities. A director can, however, vote and be counted in
a quorum in respect of certain matters in which he is interested as set out in the Articles.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the shareholders can by passing an ordinary resolution suspend or relax, among
other things, the provisions relating to the interest of a director in any contract or arrangement or relating to a
director’s right to vote and be counted in a quorum on resolutions in which he is interested to any extent or ratify any
particular contract carried out in breach of those provisions.
Directors’ interests
If the legislation allows and the director has disclosed the nature and extent of the interest to the Board, the director
can:
(i) have any kind of interest in a contract with or involving BT (or in which BT has an interest or with or involving
another company in which BT has an interest);
(ii) have any kind of interest in a company in which BT has an interest (including holding a position in that company or
being a shareholder of that company);
(iii) hold a position (other than auditor) in BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions
decided by the Board; and
(iv) alone (or through some ﬁrm with which the director is associated) do paid professional work (other than as auditor)
for BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by the Board.
A director does not have to hand over to BT any beneﬁt received or proﬁt made as a result of anything permitted to
be done under the Articles.
When a director knows that they are interested in a contract with BT they must tell the other directors.
Retirement of directors
Provisions of the legislation which, read with the Articles, would prevent a person from being or becoming a director
because that person has reached the age of 70 do not apply to the company.
At every annual general meeting, any director who was elected or last re-elected a director at or before the annual
general meeting held in the third year before the current year, shall retire by rotation. Any director appointed by the
directors automatically retires at the next following annual general meeting. A retiring director is eligible for re-election.
Directors’ borrowing powers
To the extent that the legislation and the Articles allow, the Board can exercise all the powers of the company to
borrow money, to mortgage or charge its business, property and assets (present and future) and to issue debentures
and other securities, and give security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the
company or another person. The Board must limit the borrowings of the company and exercise all the company’s
voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable by the company in relation to its subsidiary undertakings so as
to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the group outstanding, net of amounts borrowed intra-group
among other things, at any time does not exceed £35 billion.
Material contracts
Excluding contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, no contracts have been entered into in the two
years preceding the date of this document by BT or another member of the group which are, or may be, material to the
group or contain a provision under which a member of the group has an obligation or entitlement which is, or may be,
material to BT or such other member of the group.
Taxation (US Holders)
This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and
disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs by US Holders (as deﬁned below) who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as
capital assets. It does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects that may be
relevant to persons who are subject to special provisions of US federal income tax law, including US expatriates,
insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, banks, regulated investment companies, ﬁnancial institutions,
securities broker-dealers, traders in securities who elect a mark-to-market method of accounting, persons subject to
alternative minimum tax, investors that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10% or more of the outstanding share
capital or voting power of BT, persons holding their ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, hedging transaction
or conversion transaction, persons who acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or
otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar, amongst others. Those holders
may be subject to US federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below.
For purposes of this summary, a ‘US Holder’ is a beneﬁcial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US federal
income tax purposes, is: a citizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a
corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any
state thereof, an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust
if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons are 136 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders
authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust. If a partnership holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax
treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A
partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or ADSs is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the speciﬁc
tax consequences of owning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs.
In particular, this summary is based on (i) current UK tax law and UK Inland Revenue practice and US law and US
Internal Revenue Service (‘IRS’) practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury
regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in effect, (ii) the United Kingdom–
United States Income Tax Convention that entered into force on 25 April 1980 and the protocols thereto in effect until
31 March 2003 (the ‘1980 Convention’), (iii) the United Kingdom–United States Convention relating to estate and gift
taxes, and (iv) the new United Kingdom–United States Tax Convention that entered into force on 31 March 2003 and
the protocol thereto (the ‘New Convention’), all as in effect on the date of this Annual Report, all of which are subject
to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should be aware that the New Convention generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid in 2004
and all subsequent years. However, a US Holder entitled to beneﬁts under the 1980 Convention could have elected to
have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue until 1 May 2004 if the election to apply the 1980 Convention
would have resulted in greater beneﬁts to the Holder. If a US Holder made a valid election in 2003, the discussion
below with respect to dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would apply to dividends paid by BT
prior to 1 May 2004. The discussion below notes instances where the relevant provisions of the New Convention will
produce a materially different result for a validly electing US Holder. US Holders should note that certain articles in the
New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US Holder to claim beneﬁts under the New Convention and that similar
provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Conventions and the consequences
under UK, US federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends
The UK currently does not apply a withholding tax on dividends under its internal tax laws.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution (including any additional dividend income arising from a foreign
tax credit claim as described below) will be treated as ordinary dividend income. The amount of the distribution
includible in gross income of a US Holder will be the US dollar value of the distribution calculated by reference to the
spot rate in effect on the date the distribution is actually or constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares,
or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs. A US Holder who converts the British pounds into US dollars on the date of
receipt generally should not recognise any exchange gain or loss. A US Holder who does not convert the British pounds
into US dollars on the date of receipt generally will have a tax basis in the British pounds equal to its US dollar value on
such date. Foreign currency gain or loss, if any, recognised by the US Holder on a subsequent conversion or other
disposition of the British pounds generally will be US source ordinary income or loss. Dividends paid by BT to a
corporate US Holder will not be eligible for the US dividends received deduction.
For dividend payments subject to the 1980 Convention as described above, a US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs
who is a resident of the US (and is not a resident of the UK) for the purposes of the 1980 Convention generally is
entitled to receive, in addition to any dividend that BT pays, a payment from the UK Inland Revenue in respect of such
dividend equal to the tax credit to which an individual resident in the UK for UK tax purposes would have been entitled
had that individual received the dividend (which is currently equal to one-ninth of the dividend received) reduced by a
UK withholding tax equal to the amount not exceeding 15% of the sum of the dividend paid and the UK tax credit
payment. At current rates, the withholding tax entirely eliminates the tax credit payment but no withholding in excess
of the tax credit payment will be imposed upon the US Holder. Thus, for example, a US Holder who receives a £90
dividend will also be treated as receiving from the UK Inland Revenue a tax credit payment of £10 (one-ninth of the
dividend received) but the entire £10 payment will be eliminated by UK withholding tax, resulting in a net receipt of
£90. The effect on each US Holder will depend on circumstances that are particular to that Holder.
The foreign tax deemed paid generally will be available as a US credit or deduction. A US Holder validly electing
under the 1980 Convention could elect to receive a foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to any UK withholding
tax on IRS Form 8833 (Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b)). For purposes of
calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as income from sources
outside the United States and generally will constitute ‘passive income’ or, for certain Holders, ‘ﬁnancial services
income’. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are very complex. US Holders who do not
elect to claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given taxable year may instead claim a deduction for
foreign taxes paid. A deduction does not reduce US federal income tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit. The
deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign credits.
There will be no right to any payment from the UK Inland Revenue and no notional UK withholding tax applied to a
dividend payment made under the New Convention. Therefore, it will not be possible for US Holders to claim a foreign
tax credit in respect of any dividend payment made by BT in 2004 (or from 1 May 2004 in the case of a US Holder who
effectively elected to extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention).
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the US Holder is eligible for beneﬁts under
the 1980 Convention and the New Convention, and whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available
with respect to dividends received from BT. The US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADSs are
released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADSs.
Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of British withholding taxes in the case of the US Holder who properly
elected to apply the 1980 Convention could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury. Additional information for shareholders BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 137
Certain US Holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of US federal income tax (currently at a
maximum rate of 15%) in respect of ‘qualiﬁed dividend income’ received in taxable years beginning before 1 January
2009. For this purpose, qualiﬁed dividend income generally includes dividends paid by a non-US corporation if, among
other things, the US Holders meet certain minimum holding periods and the non-US corporation satisﬁes certain
requirements, including that either (i) the shares (or ADSs) with respect to which the dividend has been paid are readily
tradeable on an established securities market in the United States, or (ii) the non-US corporation is eligible for the
beneﬁts of a comprehensive US income tax treaty (such as both Conventions) which provides for the exchange of
information. BT currently believes that dividends paid with respect to its ordinary shares and ADSs should constitute
qualiﬁed dividend income for US federal income tax purposes. The US Treasury and the IRS have announced their
intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or ordinary shares, among others, will be permitted to
rely on certiﬁcations from issuers to establish that dividends are treated as qualiﬁed dividend income. Each individual
US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs is urged to consult his own tax advisor regarding the availability to him of the
reduced dividend tax rate in light of his own particular situation and regarding the computations of his foreign tax
credit limitation with respect to any qualiﬁed dividend income paid by BT to him, as applicable.
Taxation of capital gains
Unless a US resident carries on a trade through a branch or agency (if an individual), or through a permanent
establishment (if a company) in the UK, and the disposal of ordinary shares and/or ADSs is related to the activities of
that trade, neither UK capital gains tax nor corporation tax is normally charged on US residents who dispose of ordinary
shares and/or ADSs.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange
or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the
amount realised on the disposition and the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the ordinary
shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain
or loss if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year at the time of disposition. Capital gains recognised
by an individual US Holder generally are subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates if speciﬁed holdings
periods are met. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to signiﬁcant limitations.
Passive foreign investment company status
A non-US corporation will be classiﬁed as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (a ‘PFIC’) for any taxable year if at
least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50% of the average value of its assets consist of
assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. BT currently believes that it did not qualify as a
PFIC for the taxable year ending 31 March 2004 for US federal income tax purposes. If BT were to become a PFIC for
any taxable year, US Holders would suffer adverse tax consequences. These consequences may include having gains
realised on the disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains and being
subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the
ordinary shares or ADSs. Furthermore, dividends paid by BT would not be ‘qualiﬁed dividend income’ and would be
subject to the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary income. US Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to BT.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may
be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28%. Certain exempt
recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will
not apply, however, to a Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identiﬁcation number or certiﬁcate of foreign status
and makes any other required certiﬁcation or who is otherwise exempt. US persons who are required to establish their
exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number and Certiﬁcation).
Non-US Holders generally will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding. However, such
Holders may be required to provide certiﬁcation of non-US status in connection with payments received in the United
States or through certain US-related ﬁnancial intermediaries.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
Holder’s US federal income tax liability. A Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules by timely ﬁling the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required
information.
UK stamp duty
A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% of the
amount or value of any consideration provided. A transfer of an ordinary share into a clearance service or American
depositary system gives rise to a 1.5% charge of either the amount of the consideration provided or the value of the
share issued. No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS (assuming it is not registered in the UK),
provided that the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and/or ADSs
Where an individual holder, who is not a UK national, of ordinary shares and/or ADSs falls within the scope of the UK/
US Estate and Gift Tax Convention, US-domiciled holders of ordinary shares and/or ADSs will not generally be subject
to UK inheritance tax on a gift of ordinary shares and/or ADSs if the gift is subject to US federal gift tax. Similarly, 138 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders
ordinary shares and/or ADSs passing on the death of a US-domiciled shareholder, who is not a UK national, will not
generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the estate is subject to US estate tax. The rules and scope of domicile are
complex and action should not be taken without advice speciﬁc to the individual’s circumstances.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders
There are currently no government laws, decrees or regulations in the United Kingdom that restrict the export or
import of capital, including, but not limited to, UK foreign exchange control restrictions, or that affect the remittances
of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the company’s ordinary shares, except as otherwise
described in Taxation (US Holders) above. There are no limitations under the laws of the United Kingdom restricting
the right of non-residents to hold or to vote shares in the company.

Chairman’s message
Earnings per share in the 2005 financial
year, before goodwill amortisation 
and exceptional items, grew by 7% to
18.1 pence. While continuing to invest 
for the future, we generated free cash 
flow of £2.3 billion, up 10%. 
The news on dividends is positive. 
We are recommending a full-year dividend
of 10.4 pence per share, a pay out ratio 
of 57% of earnings before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items,
compared to 50% last year. We continue 
with our progressive dividend policy.
The dividend for the 2006 financial year
will be at least 60% of underlying earnings:
subject to the group’s overall financial
position, we expect our pay out ratio to rise
to around two-thirds of underlying earnings
by the 2008 financial year.
We continued with our share buy back
programme in the 2005 financial year. 
This is being funded from cash generated
over and above that required for servicing
our debt. We have reduced net debt to
below £8 billion, a level with which we
are comfortable.
Business progress
In support of our strategy for transformation
and growth, your Board gave backing
during the year for a targeted series of
acquisitions that will help to build our
capabilities as one of the world’s foremost
global networked IT services companies.
These acquisitions offered value for money,
had a compelling strategic fit and brought
capabilities to strengthen BT globally. 
In addition, passing the five million mark
for broadband connections in the UK in
early April was a key moment in the history
of your company.
Regulation
BT welcomed the Strategic Review of
Telecommunications by Ofcom. During the
year we have worked to help influence and
shape their thinking and made a radical
proposal for a new regulatory landscape in
the UK. We continued to argue strongly
that structural separation was not in
shareholders’ or customers’ interests. 
We look forward to the published outcome.
Our position remains that a strategic and
flexible regulatory regime, together with
rapid deregulation wherever possible,
is vital to meeting customers’ developing
needs and creating the conditions in which
we, and others, can continue to invest 
with confidence.
Board membership
There were a number of changes to 
your Board during the 2005 financial 
year. I would like to welcome Hanif Lalani
as our new Group Finance Director. Ian
Livingston, who had occupied the finance
role with distinction for three years, was
appointed Chief Executive BT Retail with
effect from February 2005. It is a testament
to the strength of BT’s management team
generally that we were able to appoint
people from inside the company to such 
key roles. I would also like to thank Pierre
Danon, who left the Board in February, 
for his significant contribution as Chief
Executive of BT Retail for the last four years.
Wider responsibilities
It is increasingly important that companies
such as BT continue to be good corporate
citizens, living up to our responsibilities to
the communities in which we operate and
to the environment. I’m proud to be able to
report that, for the fourth year in a row, BT
was the highest placed telecommunications
company in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Our results for the 2005 financial year were strong.
New wave revenues grew by 32% to £4.5 billion, and
now represent nearly a quarter of our business. Earnings
per share have more than doubled over the past three
years and net debt is more than £20 billion lower than
in 2001.
Index. Our community programmes focus
on those issues where communications
really can make the difference; we have
provided long-term support, for example,
for a drama-based education programme
to help develop young people’s
communications skills, and for the work 
of the children’s charity ChildLine.
Like so many other companies and
individuals, we wanted to respond to the
devastating Asian tsunami in December
2004. We made a donation of £500,000 to
the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC)
and we provided a live call centre for the
unprecedented number of calls coming into
the DEC. I’m particularly proud of the fact
that so many of our employees were
involved in fundraising activities and that 
16 of our engineers travelled to the affected
area to help re-establish communications.
Outlook
The process of transformation on which
your company embarked in 2001 is
accelerating. That process is increasingly
reflected in your company’s results.
We are well set for further success in the 
years ahead.
I’d like to thank shareholders for the
loyalty they’ve shown. Your continued
confidence – coupled with the loyalty 
of our customers and suppliers and the
imagination and commitment of our
employees – is fundamental to our
transformation for growth.
Sir Christopher Bland
Chairman
18 May 2005 2BT Annual Review 2005
Chief Executive’s statement
In 2005, convergence is at the heart of
BT’s strategy. 
By convergence, we mean the ability 
to bring together our capabilities and
capacities in new ways to make life better,
simpler and cheaper for our customers. 
For our business customers this means
productivity improvements; for consumers
it’s about new, easier to use services. 
For customers of all kinds it means a more
joined-up communications experience.
So, for example, we offer our major
corporate customers around the world 
a unique marriage of our networking
experience and infrastructure with IT
services. These used to be separate
offerings, often supplied by different
companies, but we’re bringing them
together in one place. This means that
however much their operations are
dispersed around the globe, our customers
can communicate and operate as one,
anytime, anywhere, and at lower cost. 
What we’re doing in the mobile market
is similarly about convergence – we aim to
offer customers a converged combination
of ‘the best of fixed and the best of
mobile’. Ultimately, our customers shouldn’t
have to worry about fixed or mobile when
what they really want is freedom and
flexibility. This means that we have to 
find ways of helping them communicate,
wherever they are, using whatever device
they choose, at the right price.
And convergence is also what our
twenty-first century network (21CN)
programme is all about. What our
customers need to know is that the 21CN
can support a range of technologies and
services that will enable them to do the
things they want to do – faster, more
seamlessly and more cost efficiently. 
And because this new network will support
a wide range of innovative services which
are currently run on separate networks, it
will be much more cost efficient for BT. 
Global networked IT services  
We have raised our global profile through
targeted acquisitions, including Infonet and
Radianz, and by increasing our holding in
Albacom to 100%.
We continued to play to our strengths 
in the networked IT services market. A few
years ago, our position in this market was
aspirational; today, we are competing with
the best – and winning. The BT brand is
now a powerful presence in the global
networked IT services market. It’s a brand
that stands for excellent networking skills
and a genuine commitment to finding
innovative ways of delivering what our
customers want, end to end, leaving them
free to do what they’re good at: running
their businesses. 
Our ICT (information and communications
technology) revenues were £3 billion in the
year and the major contracts we’ve won
indicate the confidence that our customers
are prepared to put in us. We now have 
a track record of meeting the needs of
public and private sector customers in, 
for example, the financial services and
government arenas. 
Our networked IT services order intake
for the year was over £7 billion.
Broadband
Broadband has been an enormous success
story, not just for BT but for the UK as a
whole, which now has the highest levels of
broadband access of any country in the G7
group of nations. We hit our five million
broadband lines target a year early.
As broadband access becomes a fact of
life for most people in the UK, our focus is
shifting further towards the retail market
where we have fantastic scope to drive
further growth.
BT’s key strategic imperatives
Today, BT is a very different company from the one that 
I joined three years ago. As our customers’ needs have
changed and continue to change, so we have found and
continue to find new ways of meeting those needs,
investing in innovative products and services which add
value to our customers and to BT. That, after all, is what
being a service company means.

BT’s transformation for 
growth is fuelled by our eight
strategic imperatives, five of which
are focused on generating new
revenues in exciting new markets,
defending revenues in traditional
markets and operating with 
maximum efficiency. BT Annual Review 2005  3
Having got broadband, people now want 
to do more and more with it. We are
increasing speeds by up to four times at
no extra cost to our retail customers.
Convergent mobility services
The launch, in partnership with Vodafone,
of our mobile virtual network operator in
both the business and consumer markets 
is the key to building a mobility customer
base and a path to mobile convergence.
We now have over 372,000 contract
connections. 
Our strategy is to build a foundation 
for the delivery of high-value, fixed/mobile
convergent solutions, for consumers and
businesses. An early example of this will
be Project Bluephone which will give
customers the convenience of a mobile
phone with the quality and cost advantage
of fixed-line services.
Twenty-first century network
Our 21CN will help to make the UK one 
of the most advanced telecommunications
countries in the world, transform our
wholesale business and support the next
generation of flexible, cost-efficient
services. At the end of April 2005, we
announced the eight preferred suppliers
who will help us to implement the 21CN.
The capital expenditure involved is
significant but the 21CN will lead to a
radical simplification of our networks
making it easier to offer compelling
propositions to all our customers. The real
challenge is to ensure that we invest in a
way that meets customers’ needs.
Traditional business
We are experiencing major changes in
our traditional markets as a result of
regulation, growing competition and
significant shifts in our customers’ buying
patterns, as they discover the possibilities
of technologies such as instant messaging
and voice over IP.
Fixed-voice telephone calls may no
longer be the only way to measure the
success of a communications company, but
they remain fundamental to our business.
We may have lost some market share to
competitors but we will continue to compete
aggressively by offering new and better
services, and improved customer value.
Cost efficiency
Taking a leadership position on costs 
is critical. Earnings per share is a key
measure, which means that we have to
continue to look at every cost line in the
business and challenge it. We’ve made
excellent progress on improving our cost
efficiency in the past few years and in the
2005 financial year, our cost efficiency
programmes achieved savings of around
£400 million, and we aim to deliver at least
£300 million to £400 million of savings in
each of the next three years.
Relentless customer focus
Our 20 million customers are a wonderful
asset and we have to continue to show 
how much we value every one of them. 
A key target for us was driving down
customer dissatisfaction – we’ve reduced
dissatisfaction levels by 23% on a
compound annual basis over the past three
years. There is still more to be done and we
must continue this focus.
Our people
People bring strategies to life, people
deliver world-class customer experiences,
people make convergence happen. 
Two years ago, we introduced our 
new brand values – trustworthy, helpful,
inspiring, straightforward, heart. Since
then, BT people have embraced these
values, and turned the business inside out
and upside down to deliver our strategy,
finding innovative ways to reinvent BT in
our traditional markets at the same time 
as establishing our BT brand in new
markets, all the while driving down
customer dissatisfaction. 
I am constantly amazed by their
commitment and by what they have
achieved.

Broadband
It’s easy to forget how 
fast the world can change. 
Blink and you might miss it.
When, three years ago, we
said that we would have
five million broadband
connections by the summer
of 2006, no one thought we
had a chance. But now that
we’ve delivered those five
million connections more
than a year ahead of
schedule, no one seems
very surprised. After all, 
it’s been clear for some
time that we were going 
to make it.
Broadband is a huge success story for 
BT, which is transforming itself from a
narrowband to a broadband company at
the same time as the UK is fast becoming 
a broadband nation.
In the past few years, we’ve brought
broadband to more than 4,400 exchanges,
connected to almost 97% of the UK’s homes
and businesses. That figure will reach 99.6%
this summer, the highest availability in any
of the G7 group of countries.
A few years ago, only the experts had
any clear idea what broadband was all
about. Today, it’s one of the first must-
have products of the twenty-first century
and one of the fastest growing consumer
products of all time with a higher early
take-up rate than TVs, video recorders or
mobile phones. 
And the momentum continues to build.
It took us about a year to reach our first
million broadband connections; the fifth
million took just four months.
Since September 2004, we’ve been
connecting a new customer to broadband
every ten seconds, 24/7.
Pushing the boundaries
Now that broadband has become a
genuinely mass market product, the nature
of the broadband debate has changed. 
The focus is moving away from
availability and towards the ways in which
broadband can transform our lives at work
and at home.
For many people, broadband initially
meant fast, always-on internet access and
email – an end to the worldwide wait. But
now, they’re beginning to realise that so
much more is possible – music and video
downloads, video emails, education
services and so on. 
Within a couple of years, every child in
the UK will have the chance to learn via
“The focus is now moving away from
availability and towards the ways in which
higher-speed broadband services can
transform our lives at work and home.”

customers
For BT in the twenty-first
century, transformation is
part of the job description. 
While we remain
committed to our 
traditional portfolio of
telecommunications services
such as voice calls and private
circuits, we are equally
focused on generating new
revenues in exciting and
fast-growing new markets,
particularly broadband,
networked IT services and
mobility. This transformation
is driven by a single,
overriding goal – sustainable,
profitable growth.
Achieving this goal is
in the best interests of our
shareholders, our customers,
our people and the wider
communities in which 
we operate.
4BT Annual Review 2005 BT Annual Review 2005  5
broadband and up to 18 million of us will
be shopping online.
But as the demand for increasingly
sophisticated broadband services grows, 
so must technology’s ability to cope with 
it. That’s why we’re continuing to push 
the boundaries of broadband technology.
We transformed our retail broadband
offering by moving most of our broadband
customers to a new super-fast standard
speed of up to 2Mbit/s at no extra cost,
beginning February 2005. Customers now
have access to speeds up to four times
faster than before. 
And we’re not stopping there. We’ve
been testing speeds of up to 8Mbit/s and
plan to launch high-speed wholesale
products later this year. And we’ve even
been trialling something called ADSL2+
which may support speeds of more than
20Mbit/s. 
Something for everyone
For customers at home we have a family 
of broadband packages designed to meet 
a wide range of needs.
Key packages include BT Broadband,
which offers rapid, always-on internet
access, and BT Yahoo! Broadband which
gives users access to exciting content as
well as a range of other benefits, including
multiple email addresses, protection
against junk email, parental controls to
prevent children accessing unsuitable
content and protection against computer
viruses.
In July 2004, BT Communicator with
Yahoo! Messenger became the latest
addition to this family, enabling customers
to manage all their home communications
– phone calls, texts, emails and so on – 
on their PC. 
And we’ll also use broadband
to make new services, such
as video on demand and
interactive TV, available to
customers.
In the broadband economy
Broadband also has a key role 
to play in the UK economy,
enhancing competitiveness,
driving up productivity, promoting
growth. Analysts estimate that the
UK economy as a whole could be
boosted to the tune of £7.5 billion a year
by 2007 as a result of productivity gains
made possible by broadband.
And what’s true of national economies 
is true of local ones as well, many of 
which are keenly aware of the possibilities.
In February 2005, for example, Northern
Ireland became the first UK region outside
London to have every one of its exchanges
upgraded to broadband by BT. Just a
month later – thanks to a partnership
between BT and the regional development
agency, One Northeast – all 181 exchanges
in the region had been upgraded. And in
April 2005, we won a contract with the
Scottish Executive to bring broadband 
to the UK’s remotest communities, by
broadband-enabling 378 exchanges.
BT Business Broadband is the leading
service provider for small and medium
businesses in the UK, with over 340,000
customers as at 31 March 2005. At the 
end of the 2005 financial year, we were
connecting around 250 business customers
to BT Business Broadband every day. 
This is excellent business, particularly since
more than half of them also took value-
added services from us such as the Internet
Security Pack and Internet Business Pack.
BT used to be essentially 
a narrowband company;
today we are rapidly
becoming a broadband
company.

Networked IT services
As communications and
information technology
networks increasingly
converge, corporations and
other large organisations
are looking for strategic
partners who can develop
and run their networks for
them, leaving them to
concentrate on their core
business. In recent years,
our networking skills have
enabled us to establish 
BT as one of the world’s
foremost global networked
IT services companies.
Where business is done
In the digital networked economy, our
networking skills and experience are
proving critical and the revenues we are
generating in this market show how far 
we have come in a short time. In the 2005
financial year, our ICT (information and
communications technology) revenues
were £3.0 billion, compared with 
£2.5 billion in the 2004 financial year
(see graph below).
And if anyone wanted proof that BT
really is transforming itself for growth, 
they would only have to look at some 
of the recent contracts we’ve won. 
Major contracts
Our most high-profile success of the
year came in March 2005 when it was
announced that BT will become Reuters’
supplier of network services around the
world, under a contract expected to be
worth up to £1.5 billion over its eight and 
a half-year life. And just a month earlier,
we’d announced a new deal with Barclays 
to provide enhanced communications
infrastructure services for their UK
operations. Taking account of existing
business, our relationship with Barclays

In 2004/05, we signed networked
IT services contracts worth over

Reuters is now worth in excess of £500 million 
over the life of the contract, and confirms
our growing strength and credibility as a
supplier to companies in the financial
services market.
Other big wins helped to confirm our
European capabilities. For example, we
signed an outsourcing contract with 
French company, THALES Group – the
international electronics and systems group
serving the defence, aeronautics, security
and services market – to provide fixed-
voice and data network services in
42 countries.
In the Asia Pacific region we were
awarded a global network outsourcing
contract by South Korea-based
CyberLogitec, a subsidiary of Hanjin
Shipping, to integrate the systems that 
it needs to run its operations in the US,
Europe and locally. Worth £18 million, 
this is one of the largest contracts we 
have ever won in the region. 
But it’s not just major contracts that
make for a healthy order book. We secured
over 300 networked IT services contracts
each worth between £1 million and
£5 million during the 2005 financial year.
Building global presence
Our customers for networked IT services
are increasingly operating globally and it’s
vital that we should be able to meet their
requirements around the world – not just 
in Europe where we own operations in
many countries, but elsewhere as well.
There are a number of ways to do this.
Strategic partners can help us reach parts
of the world where we don’t operate and
it’s certainly possible to deliver a truly
global service from any one location to 
any other, without owning everything 
in between.
But we also believe that it makes
excellent commercial sense to acquire
operations outside the UK, where these
offer the right kind of strategic fit at the
right price. 
In February 2005, we completed the
acquisition of Infonet, one of the world’s
leading providers of international managed
voice and data network services, for 
£315 million, net of cash in the business.
Infonet brings with it local operations 
and/or distributors in some 70 countries
and remote network access in around
180 countries, significantly extending 
our global reach. 
Infonet brings local operations

In the same month, we acquired the 74%
that we didn’t already own of Albacom,
which provides data transmission, voice
and internet services to more than
170,000 customers in the Italian business
communications market.
And in April 2005, we acquired Radianz
– the leading financial services extranet
provider – from Reuters for £107 million –
another significant step forward in our
transformation into a global provider of
networked IT services. 8BT Annual Review 2005
Mobility
Mobility is about much
more than mobile phones
and text messages. In a
convergent world, individuals
and businesses want and
need to communicate
wherever they happen to
be, using whatever devices
– mobile and fixed-line
phones, PCs, palmtops –
they choose. True mobility
is about connecting people
to people, people to
systems, businesses to
businesses and machines 
to machines, any time, 
any place, any device.

The 21CN programme has three broad
objectives:
•
to enhance the service experience,
flexibility and value we provide to all 
our customers;
•
to accelerate the delivery of innovative
new products and services to market;
and
•
to reduce costs radically. 
We began technical trials during 
the 2005 financial year. For example, 
we conducted a trial in which we moved
voice traffic from the traditional public
voice network onto an internet protocol 
(IP) network. It may have gone largely
unnoticed, but 7 January 2005 may turn
out to be a key date in the history of
telecommunications, because that was 
the day that saw the first end-to-end IP
voice call.
In April 2005, we announced the eight
preferred suppliers that we expect will help
to build and implement the 21CN. The
announcement was the culmination of two
years of discussions with over 300 potential
technology suppliers – one of the largest
procurement programmes ever undertaken
in the communications industry.
And in order to ensure that all other
operators understand what the 21CN
means for them and have a chance to input
their ideas, we’ve launched a programme
of industry consultation – Consult21. 
Twenty-first century
network
The twenty-first century
network (21CN) is at the
heart of our transformation
strategy, underpinning
broadband, networked IT
services and convergent
mobility services, flexibly and
cost effectively. It will lead
to a radical simplification 
of our networks, making it
easier for us – and the
other telecommunications
operators who interconnect
with our networks – to offer
compelling converged
propositions for all 
our customers. BT Annual Review 2005  9
The right stuff
BT has the right brand, channels and
network capabilities to really deliver in the
fast-growing mobility market.
What we’re aiming for is providing all
our customers with a winning combination
of the quality, reliability, cost advantages
and capacity associated with fixed-line
communications, AND the convenience,
personalisation and independence
associated with mobile communications. 
In other words, the best of both worlds. 
During the 2005 financial year, in
partnership with Vodafone, we launched 
BT Mobile as a mobile virtual network
operator (MVNO) – a move that puts us
well on the road to offering the world’s 
first fully converged, fixed/mobile service.
This really is a new way of doing a new kind
of business.
And it can be a major growth area for
us. In the 2005 financial year, revenue
growth in the mobility market was 107%.
And we’ll shortly be launching Project
Bluephone – a converged mobile service,
enabling customers to use a single device
that can switch seamlessly between fixed
and mobile networks.
True mobility is about
connecting people to
people, people to
systems, businesses to
businesses and machines
to machines, any time,

More than 372,000 BT Mobile connections
Mobility for businesses
We launched BT Mobile as an MVNO 
in the business market in November 2004,
offering a wide range of flexible mobile
services including mobile conferencing
facilities.
We’re also a leading UK provider of
wireless broadband (Wi-Fi).
BT Openzone, our public Wi-Fi 
service, gives users a high-speed wireless
broadband connection at thousands of
‘hotspots’ from which they can access 
the internet, send and receive emails with
attachments and connect to a corporate
network. As at 31 March 2005, our
customers had access to more than 7,500
hotspots throughout the UK and more than
20,000 around the world. 
We are convinced that a partnership
strategy is essential for success in this
market and we are working hard through
the Fixed Mobile Convergence Alliance,
which is developing open industry
standards, and through the Wireless
Broadband Alliance, which is driving the
roaming arrangements that will help to
make global mobility a reality.
Mobility for consumers
In January 2005, we launched the 
BT Mobile MVNO in the consumer market,
with a package aimed at families, offering 
a range of benefits including up to five
additional handsets, free short calls to 
a designated home number and a single
consolidated mobile bill.

Keep a relentless focus on improving
customer satisfaction
Reducing customer dissatisfaction is a key
objective for us. In the 2005 financial year,
for the third year in a row, all lines of
business reduced customer dissatisfaction
levels. In total, we have achieved a group-
wide reduction of 23% on a compound
annual basis over the past three years.
Transforming the traditional
Of course, transformation and tradition are
not mutually exclusive and there’s nothing
to say we shouldn’t find new ways to do the
things we’ve always done.
In July 2004, for example, we abolished
the standard rate for telephone calls for all
our residential customers and switched
them to BT Together Option 1, offering
them better value for money and making 
it easier for them to compare our prices
with those of our competitors. We also
introduced Call Mobile,a discount
package offering customers savings of
up to 40% on all fixed-to-mobile calls.
For business customers, we cut the cost
of fixed-to-mobile calls by between 25%
and 30% and offered BT Business Plan
customers the option of a 30 pence cap 
on all such calls lasting less than an hour.
As at 31 March 2005, BT Business Plan
had over 440,000 locations – up 67% on
the 2004 financial year.
Traditional business
Transformation may be a
way of life, but that doesn’t
mean everything has to
change. We will continue 
to provide all our customers
in our traditional markets
with an excellent customer
experience. Our values 
– trustworthy, helpful,
inspiring, straightforward,
heart – continue to define
the way we do business
around here. Our people
continue to live these
values. And being a good
corporate citizen is as
important now as it’s 
ever been.
Continuing to provide all our customers in our traditional markets with...
We have reduced
customer dissatisfaction 
by 23% on a compound
annual basis over the past
three years
Customer protection remains vitally
important to us, which is why we’ve been
helping to combat the menace of rogue
internet diallers. BT Modem Protection,
for example, is a free service designed to
prevent a customer’s computer dialling
high-cost, premium rate or international
numbers. At the end of March 2005,
around one million customers had signed
up for one or more of our barring options.
Drive for cost leadership
We remain focused on financial discipline
and our cost efficiency programmes
achieved savings of around £400 million in
the 2005 financial year. This has enabled
us to invest in growing our new wave
activities. We aim to deliver at least
£300 million to £400 million of savings
in each of the next three years.
We can’t starve ourselves to success,
but reducing the costs of failure,
complexity and duplication and generally
working smarter increases the scope we
have to invest for growth. And technology
really can contribute to the cause. At the
end of the financial year, for example, 
we had a total of 6.2 million online
relationships with customers through our
website (bt.com) and almost two million
customers receiving e-bills. BT Annual Review 2005  11

Our wider responsibilities
We are privileged to 
play a role in the wider
communities of which we
are a part and we recognise
that an innovative approach
to managing social, ethical
and environmental issues 
is good business in 
every sense. 
Increasingly, we have to demonstrate 
social and environmental responsibility
when bidding for new business – in the
2005 financial year, bids to the value of
£2.2 billion required us to demonstrate
expertise in managing these issues.
We commit a minimum of 0.5% of our
UK pre-tax profits directly to activities in
support of society – we provided over
£9 million in the 2005 financial year. 
In addition, BT operations provided a
further £12 million in funding and support
in kind. 
The focus of our community
programmes is on the big issues where
better communications can make a real
difference. That’s why we’ve been
sponsoring a drama-based education
programme – to date, more than 
two million children have had the chance 
to enhance their communications skills –
and why we’re supporting children’s charity
ChildLine in its drive to ensure that every
child’s call for help is answered.
And we’re committed to minimising 
any adverse impact on the environment.
During the year, we signed the world’s
largest green energy contract, which means
that almost all our future UK electricity
needs will be met from environmentally-
friendly sources, including wind generation,
solar, wave and hydroelectric schemes. 
This is expected to reduce our carbon
dioxide (CO
2
) emissions by around
325,000 tonnes a year.
We played a role in the response to 
the Asian tsunami of 26 December 2004. 
We set up a live call centre to handle 
the response to the Disasters 
Emergency Committee’s (DEC) appeal 
and ran the online donation facility. 
Individual employees were also involved
in fundraising and 16 BT engineers
travelled to the affected area to help 
re-establish the telecommunications
infrastructure. We also made an immediate
donation of £500,000.
Digital inclusion is a key public policy
issue and we are working with the
UK Government and the voluntary 
sector to find effective ways of using
communications technology to tackle 
social exclusion. We are, for example,
actively involved in the EverybodyOnline
programme – established in partnership
with charity campaign group Citizens
Online – which aims to increase skills and
access to communications technology in
deprived communities.
Our Age and Disability Action team
promotes equal access to a wide range 
of products and services, including large-
button phones, cordless and hands-free
options and a spoken text service.

of communications products and services,
including voice, data, internet and
multimedia services, and offering a
comprehensive range of managed and
packaged communications solutions.
On 1 July 2004, we abolished the
standard rate for residential customers 
and switched all existing standard rate
customers to BT Together Option 1,
offering them better value for money and
making it easier for to them to compare
BT’s prices with those of our competitors.
We also introduced a number of
enhancements to our BT Business Plan,
which had over 440,000 locations at the
end of the 2005 financial year.
In the 2005 financial year, we launched
BT Mobile as an MVNO (mobile virtual
network operator) in the business and
consumer markets. This is a major step
towards building a mobility customer base
and developing and delivering one
converged customer experience.
BT is the UK’s leading service provider
of broadband with 1.75 million consumer
and business broadband connections. 
We transformed our retail broadband
offering by transferring our broadband
customers to a high speed (up to 2Mbit/s)
connection, beginning February 2005.
BT Business Broadband remained the
leading ISP (internet service provider) for
SMEs (typically companies with up to 500
employees) with over 340,000 customers.
BT Wholesale
BT Wholesale provides network services
and solutions to over 600 communications
companies including fixed and mobile
network operators, ISPs and service
providers. Interconnecting with over 
180 other operators, it also carries transit
traffic between telecommunications
operators. Its UK network consists of
684 local and 135 trunk processor units, 
121 million kilometres of copper wire and
over seven million kilometres of optical
fibre. BT Wholesale has the most extensive
IP backbone network in the UK.
In early April 2005, we provided our five
millionth broadband connection, more than
one year ahead of target. 4,419 exchanges
had been upgraded for broadband at the
end of the 2005 financial year, and almost
97% of the UK’s homes and businesses
were connected to a broadband-enabled
exchange. 
BT’s 21CN programme is at the heart of
our transformation strategy, underpinning
broadband, networked IT services and
convergent mobility services. During the 
2005 financial year, we took steps toward
the 21CN’s three broad objectives: to
enhance the service experience, flexibility
and value we provide all our customers; 
to accelerate the delivery of innovative 
Operating performance
The financial results for the 2005 financial
year reflect the continuing strong growth in
new wave services as we deliver value from
transforming the business. Our global
networked IT services business is growing
strongly and our global capabilities have
been strengthened by the successful
completion of the acquisitions of Albacom
and Infonet. Subsequent to the year end
we also completed the acquisition
of Radianz.
Profit and loss account
Group turnover from new wave businesses
showed strong growth of 32% to £4.5 billion
in the year driven by growth in global
networked IT services, broadband and
mobility. Turnover from our traditional
business declined by 7% to £14.0 billion,
being impacted by regulatory intervention,
competition and technological changes
as we migrate customers to new wave
services. Regulatory reductions in mobile
termination rates are passed on to BT
customers resulting in lower charges but
are profit neutral. Group turnover of 
£18.6 billion increased by 2% (excluding
the impact of acquisitions and regulatory
reductions to mobile termination rates).
Group operating profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items
decreased by 1% to £2.9 billion. This mainly
reflects the cost of supporting networked IT
services contracts and investment in new
wave activities. Net interest payable before
exceptional items was £0.8 billion for the
year, an improvement of £0.1 billion,
reflecting the reduction in net debt.
Earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items were
18.1 pence, an increase of 7%.

BT Retail
BT Retail is the UK’s largest communications
service provider, by market share, to the
residential and business markets, supplying
over 20 million customers with a wide range
new products and services; and to reduce
costs radically.
Technical fibre and voice trials began
in the 2005 financial year.
On 28 April 2005, we announced the
preferred suppliers that we expect will 
help build and implement the 21CN. 
BT Global Services
BT Global Services is BT’s managed services
and solutions provider. Its core target
market is 10,000 multi-site organisations
including major companies with significant
global requirements and large organisations
in target local markets. BT Global Services
provides global reach and a complete range
of networked IT services.
Our extensive communications network
and strong strategic partnerships enable us
to serve customers in the key commercial
centres of Europe, North America and the
Asia Pacific region. 
The acquisition of Infonet – one of the
world’s leading providers of international
managed voice and data network services 
– was a major step forward in addressing
the global networked IT services needs of
our core customers, significantly extending
our global reach. We also acquired the
74% that we did not already own of
Albacom, which provides data transmission,
voice and internet services in the Italian
business communications market. In April
2005, we also completed the acquisition 
of Radianz – the leading financial services
extranet provider.
Our most high-profile success of the
year in the global market was winning the
contract to become Reuters’ supplier of
network services. The contract is expected
to be worth up to £1.5 billion over its
lifetime. 
In April 2005, we won an extension to
July 2012 of a contract to deliver essential
telecommunications services to the
Ministry of Defence and the UK’s armed
forces. The total value of the contract is
more than £2.7 billion.
Research and development and IT support
Our IT division, BT Exact, offers the
services of IT professionals with knowledge
of leading-edge network design and IT
systems and application development. 
In the 2005 financial year, we invested
£257 million in research and development.
Balance sheet
The group balance sheet continued to
strengthen during the year and provides
confidence to our customers and suppliers.
Net debt was reduced by a further 
£0.6 billion to £7.8 billion and is now 
£20 billion lower than in 2001. Fixed 
assets totalled £16.7 billion, of which
£15.9 billion were tangible fixed assets, BT Annual Review 2005 13
principally the UK fixed network. The return
on capital employed, before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items on the
average capital employed, was 16%.
Cash flow
Cash inflow from operating activities 
was £5.9 billion. Capital expenditure of
£3.1 billion increased by 14%, reflecting
the rising investment in our network
transformation. Free cash flow of 
£2.3 billion was generated, an increase 
of 10%.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend 
of 6.5 pence per share to shareholders,
amounting to £551 million, taking the full
year dividend to 10.4 pence per share, 
an increase of 22% on the previous year. 
This year’s dividend pay out ratio is 57% 
of earnings before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items compared to 50%
last year.
We continue with our progressive
dividend policy. The dividend for the 2006
financial year will be at least 60% of
underlying earnings: subject to the group’s
overall financial position, we expect our
pay out ratio to rise to around two-thirds
of underlying earnings by the 2008
financial year.
Customer satisfaction
Driving up customer satisfaction is at the
heart of our strategy. In the 2005 financial
year, for the third year in a row, all lines 
of business reduced dissatisfaction levels. 
In the past three years, we have achieved 
a group wide reduction of 23% on a
compound annual basis.
Our people
As at 31 March 2005, we employed
102,100 people throughout the world.
Our core people engagement initiative 
is the my customer programme which aims
to enable BT people to deliver an excellent
customer experience through teamwork.
More than 3,000 issues have now been
resolved.
For the 2005 financial year, we allocated
£11 million to provide free shares to our
employees under the BT Employee Share
Investment Plan (employees outside the UK
receive a cash payment equivalent to the
value of the shares). The amount allocated
was linked to the achievement of corporate
targets determined by the Board.
Corporate social responsibility
Our aim is to manage social, ethical and
environmental issues in ways that grow
shareholder value and help BT and our
customers to be more sustainable. In the
2005 financial year, BT was ranked as the
top telecommunications company in the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the
fourth year running. We commit a 
minimum of 0.5% of our UK pre-tax profits
directly to activities which support society.
Our contribution in the 2005 financial 
year was over £9 million. In addition, we
made charitable donations of £2 million.
More details of our social and
environmental performance are available 
at www.bt.com/betterworld
Statement of business practice 
BT’s policy is to achieve best practice in
our standards of business integrity in all 
our operations, in line with our published
statement of business practice – 
The Way We Work, which is available at
www.btplc.com/society/values
Going concern
The company’s financial statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2005 have been
prepared on a going concern basis as, 
after making appropriate enquiries, the
directors have a reasonable expectation
that the group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future.
Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS)
BT continues to report under UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP)
for the 2005 financial year, but, as required
by EU regulations, will present financial
information in accordance with IFRS for the
2006 financial year.
Whilst some of the changes required by
IFRS will impact BT’s reported profits and
net assets, this has no impact on the cash
flows generated by the business or the 
cash resources available for investment or
distribution to shareholders. Furthermore,
the adoption of IFRS does not affect BT’s
strategy or underlying business performance. 
The main areas of change relate 
to pensions, share-based payments,
intangible assets, leases and financial
instruments. We estimate the unaudited
pro forma impact of adopting IFRS on the
2005 financial year reported UK GAAP
results will be negligible on the underlying
profit before tax and underlying earnings
per share. However, due to the inherent
volatilities introduced by IFRS, no such
statement can be made in respect of future
years. This estimate excludes the fair value
effects on financial instruments which
we are not required to apply until
1 April 2005.

from the sale of the group’s investments in Intelsat, Eutelsat and StarHub. This resulted in a net credit of £258 million to profit before taxation.

profit of £32 million on the sale of our interest in Inmarsat, and a one-off interest credit of £34 million offset by a charge for the premium on buying

Summary report on directors’ remuneration
bonus is payable in the form of deferred
shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
The shares are held in trust for three
years and act both as an incentive and
a retention measure.
•
Long-term incentives – the BT Equity
Incentive Portfolio, comprising share
options, incentive shares and retention
shares, is designed to ensure that equity
participation plays an important part 
in overall remuneration. In the financial
year 2004/05, a combination of
performance-linked share options and
incentive shares replaced the grant of
share options.
– Awards vest and options become
exercisable only if a predetermined
performance target has been
achieved.
– The performance measure is total
shareholder return (TSR) compared
with a group of companies from the
European Telecom Sector, replacing
the FTSE 100 as the comparator group.
–BT’s TSR at the end of the three-year
measurement period must be in the
upper quartile for all of the awards to
vest or options to become exercisable.
At median, 30% of options would be
exercisable and 25% of shares under
award would vest. Below that point 
all of the share awards and options
would lapse. 
Retention shares are granted in
exceptional circumstances to help recruit or
retain individuals with critical skills. In the
financial year 2004/05, six awards were
made for recruitment purposes.
In the financial year 2005/06, the
emphasis on some of the components
making up remuneration packages will 
be modified, as the present long-term
arrangements have not been acting as a
sufficiently effective retention tool. As a
result, no further options will be granted
and this will be balanced by an increase in
the maximum award of incentive shares
from two-thirds to one times base salary.
There will also be an increase in annual bonus
potential, payable in deferred shares for
the financial year 2005/06 onwards,
which will vest three years after grant.
Pension arrangements
Pensions are based on salary alone –
bonuses, other benefits and long-term
incentives are excluded.
Executive directors and most other
senior executives who joined the company
prior to 1 April 2001 receive their pensions
under defined benefit arrangements. 
Those with longer BT service are entitled
Introduction
This is a summary of the full Report on
directors’ remuneration in the Annual
Report and Form 20-F 2005, a copy 
of which is available on request or at
www.bt.com/annualreport. The full report
will be voted on at the 2005 Annual
General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee sets the
remuneration policy and individual
packages for the Chairman, executive
directors, members of the Operating
Committee (OC) and other senior
executives reporting to the Chief Executive.
It also approves changes in the company’s 
long-term incentive plans, recommends 
to the Board those plans which require
shareholder approval and oversees 
their operation.
Remuneration policy for executives
BT’s executive remuneration policy is to
reward employees competitively, taking
into account individual, line of business
and company performance, market
comparisons and the competitive pressures
in the information and communications
technology industry.
The policy for executive pay, in general
terms, is for base salaries to be positioned
around the mid-market, with total direct
compensation (basic salary, annual bonus
and the value of any long-term incentives)
to be at the upper quartile only for
sustained and excellent performance.
Main components of remuneration
Executive benefits packages comprise a mix
of basic salary and performance-related
remuneration, as follows:
Basic salary
This is reviewed annually. Basic salaries
remained unchanged during the 2004 and 
2005 financial years with the exception of
increases agreed for Andy Green and Ian
Livingston on 1 January 2005 to align their
packages with their revised responsibilities
in a highly competitive market.
Performance-related remuneration
•
Annual bonus – the annual bonus plan 
is designed to reward the achievement
of results against set objectives. 
Targets in respect of corporate
performance, set at the beginning of 
the financial year 2004/05 for each
objective, were based on earnings per
share, free cash flow and customer
satisfaction. One-third of any total
to pension benefits of two-thirds of final
salary payable at normal retirement age.
Those with shorter BT service are entitled to
pension benefits of one-thirtieth of salary
for each year of service.
Retirement provision for executive
directors and other senior executives who
joined BT on or after 1 April 2001 is
generally made on a defined contribution
basis – the company agrees to pay a fixed
percentage (typically around 30%) of the
executive’s salary each year towards the
provision of retirement benefits.
Other benefits
Other benefits include some or all of:
company car, fuel or driver, personal
telecommunications facilities and home
security, medical and dental cover, special
life cover, professional subscriptions and 
tax planning and financial counselling.
Service agreements
The policy is for the Chairman and executive
directors to have service agreements
providing for one year’s notice by the
company. If BT terminates the Chairman’s
contract before it expires – at the end of
the 2007 AGM – he is entitled to payment
of salary for 12 months from termination
or until the 2007 AGM if that is shorter.
Ben Verwaayen is entitled to £700,000
on termination by BT. Andy Green, Hanif
Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds
are entitled to salary and benefits until the
earlier of 12 months from notice of BT’s
termination of the contract or the director
obtaining full-time employment.

of directors’ emoluments and interests

Notes
(a) Beneficial shareholdings include shares
held in the director’s own name or by close
family members.
(b) Options granted under the Global Share
Option Plan are normally exercisable in full
between the third and tenth anniversaries 
of their date of grant only if a corporate
performance target has been met. Option
prices range between 187p and 318p.
(c) Retention shares are used as a
recruitment and retention tool. They are
held in trust for up to three years and are
transferred to participants, if they are still
employed by the company.
(d) Awards of shares are directly linked to 
the value of annual bonuses. The shares 
are held in trust for three years and are
transferred to participants, if they are still
employed by the company.
Notes
(1) In addition, deferred bonuses payable 
in shares in three years’ time were awarded
to B Verwaayen (£224,000), A Green
(£102,000), H Lalani (£68,000), I Livingston
(£99,000) and P Reynolds (£106,500).
(2) Part of the pension allowance of 30% of
salary for B Verwaayen (20% of salary until
1January 2005), and 30% of salary for 
I Livingston, was paid to them direct.
Pensions
Sir Christopher Bland is not a member of 
any of the company’s pension schemes but
the company matches his contributions, up 
to 10% of the earnings cap, to a personal
pension plan. B Verwaayen and I Livingston
are not members of any of the company’s
pension schemes but the company has
agreed to pay an amount equal to 30% 
of salary towards pension provision. 
The aggregate value of contributions paid, 
or treated as paid, to defined contribution
schemes in the 2005 financial year was
£61,200. A Green, H Lalani and P Reynolds
are members of the BT Pension Scheme. 
Additional days of pensionable service are
being purchased for A Green, H Lalani and
PReynolds to bring their pensionable service
at age 60 up to 40 years.

Asia Pacific. Its principal activities include
networked IT services, local, national and
international telecommunications services,
and higher-value broadband and internet
products and services. In the UK, we serve
over 20 million business and residential
customers with around 29 million exchange

Non-executive directors
Corporate governance
It is BT’s policy to achieve for all our
operations best practice in our standards 
of business integrity. The directors consider
that BT has, throughout the year, complied
with the provisions set out in section 1 of
the 2003 Combined Code on Corporate
Governance. 
Board, directors and board committees
The Board is currently made up of the 
part-time Chairman, the Chief Executive,
four other executive directors and seven
independent non-executive directors. It is
BT’s policy that the Board will comprise a
majority of independent non-executive
directors. The roles of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive are separate. 
The non-executive directors provide a
strong, independent element on the Board.
Sir Anthony Greener, the Deputy Chairman,
is the senior independent director. Non-
executive directors are appointed initially 
for three years at the end of which the
appointment may be continued by mutual
agreement. The Chairman and the non-
executive directors meet regularly without
the executive directors. The Chairman
ensures the views of shareholders are known
to and appropriately considered by the Board.
The Board’s principal focus is the overall
strategic direction, development and
control of the group. A formal statement 
of its role is available on the company’s
website. Historically, the Board has met
every month, except August. For the 2006
financial year, and going forward, the Board
will meet at least nine times each year.
During summer 2004 the Board carried
out a further evaluation of its performance.
A number of actions were agreed as a
result. As part of this process, the Chairman
has one-to-one sessions with the directors;
the Deputy Chairman, Sir Anthony
Greener, meets all directors individually
to review the Chairman’s performance.
To meet best corporate governance
practice, Audit, Remuneration and
Nominating Committees have long been 
an established part of BT’s system of
governance. Each committee has written
terms of reference, which are available on
the company’s website. The Audit and
Remuneration Committees are made up
entirely of independent non-executive
directors. The Board considers that several of
the Audit Committee’s members have recent
and relevant financial experience. The Audit
Committee reviews the company’s published
financial results, the Annual Report and Form
20-F and other published information for
statutory and regulatory compliance and
reports its views to the Board. It
recommends the appointment,
reappointment and remuneration of the
company’s external auditors. The Board has
policies determining what non-audit services
the company’s external auditors can provide
in order to safeguard their independence and
objectivity. 
The Nominating Committee ensures 
an appropriate balance of experience and
abilities on the Board, using this evaluation
to review the size and composition of the
Board and to recommend any proposed
changes to the Board.
The Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen,
chairs the Operating Committee, which
meets weekly.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the group’s
systems of internal control and risk
management and for reviewing the
effectiveness of those systems. Such
systems are designed to manage, rather
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives; any system can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
BT has processes for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant
risks faced by the group. These processes
have been in place for the whole of the
2005 financial year and have continued 
up to the date on which this document 
was approved. Information for shareholders

be uneconomic to sell. Details of the 
scheme are available from ShareGift at
www.sharegift.org or by telephone on 
020 7337 0501. Details can also be

Unclaimed Assets Register
BT subscribes to this search facility for
financial assets that have become
separated from their owners. The register
donates a proportion of its public search
fees to charity via ShareGift. Further
information can be found at www.uar.co.uk
or telephone 0870 241 1713.
Capital gains tax 
The rights issue in June 2001 adjusted the
value of your BT shares for capital gains tax
(CGT) purposes. An explanatory leaflet is
available from the Shareholder Helpline. 
The demerger of O2 in November 2001
adjusted the value of your BT shares for
CGT purposes. For CGT calculations the
base cost of the BT Group shares and O2
shares is calculated by multiplying the
acquisition cost of the BT shareholding by
77.544% for the BT Group shares, and
22.456% for the O2 shares. This is in
accordance with the confirmed opening
prices for BT Group and O2 shares
following the demerger.
