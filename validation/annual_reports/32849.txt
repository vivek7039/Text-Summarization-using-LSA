Dear fellow stakeholders
In 2018, Polymetal celebrates its 20th anniversary;  
perhaps still youthful by global metrics but, nevertheless, a 
respectable milestone for a business built from the ground 
up in an emerging market. During that time, the Company has 
delivered a production compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 24%, developed 16 mines from scratch, added 6.7 Moz of 
gold equivalent and 9.5 Moz of palladium equivalent in newly 
discovered resources, paid out more than US$1 billion in 
dividends and attained industry leadership in processing 
refractory gold ore. We have expanded our operations within 
three mining jurisdictions in the former Soviet Union (Russia, 
Kazakhstan and Armenia) and have maintained a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange since 2011.
Playing to our strengths
Over the last 20 years, we have built on our core 
competencies: using a hub-based system (Dukat, Omolon 
and Okhotsk); mastering POX technology and trading 
refractory gold concentrates (Kyzyl, Albazino, Mayskoye); 
operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at 
locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations 
in the Russian Far East). Consistently focusing on high-grade 
assets has also ensured that we have delivered superior 
returns on capital.
Financial prudence pays dividends
Adherence to strong capital discipline has been the foundation 
of our strategy – in careful project selection with a preference 
for high grade and low-capital-intensity, in value-accretive 
mergers & acquisitions (M&As), as well as in our dividend 
policy. From free cash flow for 2012-2017 totalling US$1.3 
billion, Polymetal paid out US$1.0 billion in dividends, providing 
tangible returns to shareholders with a sector-leading three-
year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 61%.
Leading by example
At the same time, Polymetal recognises its duty of care for its 
entire stakeholder base, as evidenced by its practice of good 
governance and sustainable development in the regions in 
which we operate. The Board and management are fully 
committed to a sustainability agenda with a renewed focus  
on health and safety. In other areas, Polymetal’s position as an 
industry leader in sustainability is acknowledged both by local 
communities and by an increasing number of international 
rating agencies, most recently the World Wildlife Fund and 
Sustainalytics. We are also signatories to the International 
Cyanide Management Code.
Polymetal is at the start of another dynamic stage in its 
history. Our investment in new projects – Kyzyl, and 
potentially into Nezhda, Prognoz and a second Amursk POX 
line – is expected to enable Polymetal to deliver superior 
shareholder returns and industry leadership over the long 
term. I look forward to making this journey, along with the 
Company’s stakeholders.

On a 100% basis.
A successful and eventful year
2017 has been an exciting year for Polymetal, with significant 
progress made on the Kyzyl construction and the Amursk 
POX expansion. Both projects are on track and will launch 
within a few months. We further advanced our growth 
pipeline with the initial resource-and-reserve estimate on 
Nezhda joint venture reaffirming the economic attractiveness 
of the asset and justifying our development approach; we 
have also secured an option to consolidate our ownership. 
During the year, we invested in Prognoz, the largest 
undeveloped silver asset in Russia and progressed with 
pilot plant testing at Viksha, our first platinum group metals 
(PGM) project.
We have substantially increased our resources this year. 
Reserves at Nezhda
2
 were confirmed as 2.0 Moz of GE at  
4.0 g/t with an exploration upside of 8.9 Moz of additional 
resources at 5.0 g/t. At Prognoz
2
, where we have begun 
drilling, according to historical estimates there is a high-grade 
resource of 292 Moz of silver at 586 g/t with excellent 
exploration potential. An updated reserve estimate at the 
Komar gold deposit reported an increase of 524 Koz of 
gold with the grade stable at 1.8 g/t. We are now planning 
to transport more than 2 million tonnes of ore from Komar 
to our Varvara processing site, doubling the anticipated 
production rate. 
Operationally, we met the production guidance comfortably, 
growing GE production 13% year-on-year to 1.43 Moz. 
Just one year after launch, Svetloye delivered superior  
results while Komar provided strong support to our Varvara 
operations. Other mature mines generally performed in line 
with expectations, with the exception of Mayskoye where 
open-pit production has been delayed until 2018 in order  
to rectify recovery issues. By the end of the year we also 
achieved a record 97.2% recovery at our flagship 
Amursk POX hub.
Full-year gold production of 1,075 Koz, a 21% increase  
year-on-year, allowed Polymetal to join the prestigious  
1 Moz club, the second gold company listed on the  
London Stock Exchange to achieve this impressive milestone. 
Robust financial performance
Despite peak capital spending at Kyzyl and the Amursk POX 
expansion, in addition to our investment in new development 
projects, Polymetal delivered meaningful free cash flow, 
totalling US$143 million in 2017. There were some cost 
pressures during the year due to the significant 15% 
appreciation of the Russian Rouble, driven by the rebound 
in oil prices, which pushed TCC up to US$658/GE oz in 2017 
(2016: US$570/GE oz). However, this was partially offset by 
the best performance in gold prices since 2010, with 13% 
annual growth.
This enabled us to deliver a net profit for the year of  
US$354 million. In line with the new dividend policy, the 
pay-out ratio for regular dividends has been increased to 
50%. In 2017 , dividends of US$138 million (US$ 0.32 per 
share) were paid out and a final dividend of US$129 million 
(US$0.30 per share) is proposed.
Health and safety still a key focus
Although there has been some improvement in our health 
and safety performance, there is no room for complacency 
since, sadly, we have to report the death of two employees  
in 2017 . We continue to view this as unacceptable and remain 
committed to our zero-fatalities target, as our enhanced 
critical risk management system gains traction.
At the same time, we have received wide-spread recognition 
for our sustainability initiatives, both here in our home market 
and internationally. Most recently we were awarded a top 
ranking for environmental responsibility among Russian 
metals and mining companies by the World Wildlife Fund; 
Sustainalytics positioned Polymetal as an outperformer in 
the metals and mining industry, ranking it first among its 
peers and fourth globally among the 44 mining companies  
included in the report; our performance on the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index was assessed as above industry 
average and up 28% over the previous year. We were also 
awarded the highest score for Corporate Governance and 
Anti-Corruption in the FTSE4Good Index.
Anticipating the future
2018 looks set to become another transformational year for 
Polymetal. The launch of the Kyzyl project is scheduled for 
the third quarter and is much anticipated both within the 
Company and by all our stakeholders. This, in turn, should 
allow us to move closer to finalising decisions on two further 
investments by the end of 2018, namely the construction 
plans for Nezhda and the feasibility study for a second POX 
line at Amursk. We expect further production growth in 2018, 
with this predominantly driven by Kyzyl but also from Komar’s 
ramp-up to 2.2 Mtpa and from our existing mines continuing 
to deliver stable performances.
Last, but by no means least, I wish to thank our employees 
for all their commitment and professionalism. It is their 
efforts that have helped to shape the Company over the 
last 20 years and this should be celebrated, along with 
the anniversary itself. I am optimistically looking forward 
to the next decade in our history and to us all playing our 
parts in this new chapter of Polymetal’s story.

Exceptional investment prospects
Polymetal’s focus on its particular strategic 
and competitive strengths – in selective mining, 
processing refractory ores and trading precious 
metal concentrates – has established a company 
with the enviable position of being both able to 
acquire or explore attractive investment 
opportunities, and also to deliver on them.
High-grade assets
Our choice of high-grade assets and strategic use 
of a hub-based system generates free cash flow 
through the cycle and maximises returns on 
investment, while at the same time reducing 
project development risks.
Investing in greenfield exploration
Reserve quality and low-capital intensity are 
fundamental to our continuing investment in 
greenfield exploration and how we appraise  
M&A opportunities.
Committed to capital discipline
Through our commitment to capital discipline,  
we are able to deliver a sector-leading TSR  
and maintain a strong balance sheet.

PROGRESS UPDATE
Svetloye Albazino/Amursk Komar and Varvara Kapan
In 2017, the Svetloye 
heap leach operation was 
ramped-up to full capacity, 
making a substantial 
contribution to the Group’s 
strong performance. Just one 
year after launch, Svetloye 
delivered superior results  
with GE production of 106 Koz  
compared with 23 Koz in  
2016 and was the lowest 
cost operation, with TCC of 
US$313/GE oz, on the back 
of exceptional operational 
delivery and positive 
grade reconciliations.
In 2017 , Albazino/Amursk 
achieved record gold 
production of 269 Koz,  
up 10% year-on-year,  
while advancing the 
debottlenecking project. 
The production increase  
was primarily driven by higher 
hourly productivity and recovery 
levels, as well as significant 
improvement in head grades. 
At the Amursk POX plant, a 
record recovery of 97 .2% was 
achieved in Q4 2017 , due 
mostly to the automation of the 
material flow control system 
and expansion of the water 
treatment section.
Almost 2 Mt of Komar ore  
was railed to the Varvara hub 
resulting in record GE 
production of 130 Koz, up 
54% year-on-year. In 2018, 
additional Komar ore will 
displace the lower-grade 
material from the Varvara 
deposit, increasing production 
and reducing costs at the 
Varvara processing hub.  
To further streamline logistics 
and reduce haulage costs, a 
new railway spur has been 
commissioned at Komar.
In 2017, full year gold 
production at Kapan  
reached a record 50 Koz of 
GE. The strong operational 
performance at Kapan 
was driven by increased 
processing volumes and 
improved head grades on 
the back of ongoing  
measures to debottleneck 
the underground mine and 
improve recovery levels.  
This will continue in 2018 
along with active exploration 
within the region.

PROGRESS UPDATE
Kyzyl Amursk POX expansion POX-2 project 
Kyzyl is one of the best development-
stage gold projects in the world. With its 
large high-grade reserves, long mine life 
and low-capital intensity, it is set to create 
significant shareholder returns
Construction activities are now focused  
on the installation of smaller technological 
equipment and Kyzyl is on track to 
produce the first concentrate in Q3 2018. 
First ore has already been mined from 
the open-pit ahead of schedule in 
January 2018. 
There is a strong demand for concentrate 
from multiple offtakers with the first 
contract signed in Q1 2018.
Expansion of Amursk POX plant targets 
an increase in POX capacity, enabling 
Polymetal to retain approximately 50% of 
Kyzyl concentrate for in-house treatment, 
as opposed to a third-party offtake.  
This is expected to improve effective  
gold recovery from concentrate,  
as well as bring down processing  
and transportation costs.
The debottlenecking project at the 
Amursk POX is progressing on schedule. 
Polymetal plans to ramp up the 
debottlenecked POX plant in the  
second half of 2018, in time to take first 
feed from the Kyzyl concentrator.
Polymetal is continuing to undertake 
extensive metallurgical testwork 
and evaluate its ability to use high-
temperature (230-240C) POX technology 
to process high-carbon Kyzyl concentrate 
and third-party feedstocks. The project 
will enable Polymetal to materially 
improve the economics of refractory gold 
projects by increasing gold recovery 
from concentrates and bringing down 
processing and transportation costs, 
and will also strengthen Polymetal’s 
commercial position on the concentrate 
market vis-à-vis offtakers. A decision 
on construction of the second POX is 
expected in late 2018, in conjunction with 
the ramp-up of Kyzyl and an investment 
decision on Nezhda project.

representation of investors with a majority 
representation of fully independent, 
non-executive Board members. Diverse, 
both in terms of professional experience 
and nationality, the Board both aspires to 
and believes that it achieves global best 
practice in terms of corporate governance. 
During 2017, Polymetal instigated the first 
stages of a comprehensive Board 
succession programme, which will ensure 
that we continue to have a majority of 
independent Directors on the Board while, 
at the same time, providing a greater 
depth in finance, mining and institutional 
investment skills.
In 2017, Polymetal made significant 
progress in sustainability performance 
with an all-round improvement that has 
been highly rated by leading sustainability 
agencies. We believe that this recognition 
reflects Polymetal’s serious commitment 
to sustainability and continuous 
improvement, which translates into safer 
working conditions for people, responsible 
environmental management, social 
support for the local communities 
and growing economic value for our 
stakeholders. Our focus remains  
on health and safety, where we are 
determined to achieve our principal  
goal of zero fatalities at our operations.
• Sustainalytics positioned Polymetal as an

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 16 OUR CAPITAL OUR BUSINESS OUTCOME
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
FOCUS ON HIGH-GRADE ASSETS
Return on investment in the precious metals industry is reliant on 
grades and mining conditions. We achieve better returns and lower 
risks from our project portfolio by setting appropriate thresholds  
on head grades and largely focusing on open-pit mines.
HUB-BASED SYSTEM 
Our centralised hub-based system handles ores from different 
sources, achieving economies of scale by minimising processing 
and logistics costs, as well as capital spending per ounce. 
This facilitates production at otherwise uneconomical  
medium- and small-sized near-plant deposits.
STRONG CAPITAL DISCIPLINE 
We engender a strong focus on capital discipline throughout the 
business; maximising risk-adjusted return on capital is our priority  
in all investment decisions. We do not retain excess cash and 
return free cash flow to shareholders through substantial dividend 
payments while retaining a safe leverage level.
EXEMPLARY GOVERNANCE 
We believe that good corporate governance is key to the ongoing 
success of the business and value creation for our shareholders. 
We are compliant with all regulatory requirements and are 
recognised as sustainability leaders in the countries in which we 
operate, adopting best practice in nurturing relationships with all  
our stakeholders in government, industry and the communities.
INVESTING IN EXPLORATION 
Investment in both greenfield and near-mine exploration provides 
us with a cost-effective increase in our reserve base and, along with 
successful acquisitions, is the key source of our long-term growth.
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
We pride ourselves on our operational excellence and 
delivering on our promises to shareholders. Despite difficult 
trading conditions, we beat our production guidance for the 
sixth consecutive year.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 19
POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 18 MARKET TRENDS
While 2016 was quite volatile, 2017 saw the global 
economy pick up with many assets, including 
major indices, rise in value and close the year on a 
bullish note, all against the backdrop of heightened 
geopolitical instability and tightening monetary 
policy across the board. The markets witnessed 
three interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve 
during the year and a benchmark increase by the 
Bank of England, for the first time in a decade, 
while the EU Central Bank declared victory over 
deflation, signaling a potential end to their loose 
monetary policy.
Gold
The precious metals sector was no exception, displaying 
positive price momentum in the course of the year.  
For the second year in a row, gold became one of the best 
performing assets following consecutive price declines  
from 2013-2015. The gold price grew by 13.5% – its biggest 
annual gain since 2010 – and outperformed all major asset 
classes other than stocks. This performance was primarily 
supported by a weakened US Dollar, as well as heightened 
investor uncertainty on the back of geopolitical instability and 
a potential pullback on increased P/E ratios and expensive 
stock valuations, which fuelled investor flows into gold in 
order to manage risk exposure. Although gold was traded 
within a narrow range of US$1,200–1,300 for most of the 
year, it closed at US$1,297/oz compared with US$1,146/oz  
in 2016, averaging US$1,257 for the year and recording a 
year-high of US$1,351 in the third quarter. 
However, gold demand remained under pressure in 2017 , 
down 7% to 4,072 tonnes over 2016. The decline was driven 
by substantially lower retail investment demand and lagging 
ETFs, which only added one-third of 2016’s inflows. On the 
other hand, buying from the official sector recorded a 
substantial gain of 36% year-on-year as Russian and Turkish 
central banks continued to bolster gold reserves. Technology 
demand recorded its first year of growth as the use of gold in 
smartphones and vehicles continued to increase, ending a 
six-year downtrend. Physical demand remained relatively flat 
over the previous year, while jewellery demand posted its first 
annual increase since 2013, however remaining weak in a 
historical context. 
Gold and silver mine output, on the other hand, continued 
to slow down due to substantial production losses seen in 
Indonesia and China on the back of environmental concerns 
and a crackdown on illegal mining. This has resulted in 
the plateauing of global output, which many believe to 
be the start of a multi-year downtrend, at least at current 
price levels.
Silver
In 2017 , silver underperformed gold ending the year on par 
with its 2016 average of US$17.0/oz. This was primarily 
driven by lacklustre interest from investors on the back of 
stronger performances from equities and a sharp decline 
in investment demand. ETF holdings also weighed on silver 
price dynamics, posting a decrease over 2016. Meanwhile, 
in 2017 , industrial demand for silver grew by roughly 3% 
on the back of increased demand from the solar and 
automotive sectors. Mine output recorded a modest 
decrease year-on-year due to production declines in Chile 
and Australia, as well as in Guatemala where resource 
nationalism disrupted production at one of the largest 
primary silver mines. 
Platinum group metals
2017 was an interesting year for PGMs, primarily led by 
palladium’s stellar performance. Palladium outperformed 
every other precious metal in 2017 , gaining more than 
50% and reaching a price of more than US$1,000/oz 
something not seen since the start of 2000. Platinum,  
on the other hand, rose only 4% as the market share of 
diesel-powered vehicles – where the metal is primarily  
used – declined in favour of petrol cars. As a result, platinum 
prices remained under pressure, while palladium prices 
benefited from the boost in global petrol car demand. 
Moreover, palladium prices were further bolstered due to  
a substantial supply deficit on the back of mining issues  
in South Africa.

Precious metals market summary 
 Gold     Silver
Mine production around the world
Year-on-year mine production recorded a modest decline 
in 2017 , marking what many believe is the beginning of a 
sustained downtrend in gold mine output, which is set to 
continue during 2018. At the global level, environmental 
concerns and a crackdown on illegal mining were the  
driving forces behind the drop in output in 2017. Of equal 
significance is the broader issue of a reduction in project 
pipelines, as a consequence of lower gold prices and wider 
project development challenges across the sector, and the 
fact that new mine starts in recent years have mainly 
served to fill the gaps left by production losses elsewhere. 
The league table of the biggest gold mining countries in  
2017 remains unchanged: China, Russia and Australia. 
Our operating environment  
In Russia, the mining industry is the second-largest sector 
after oil and gas. However, despite the country’s vast 
resource potential in precious metals, it remains largely 
underexplored with a lack of investment in the sector, due 
mainly to low gold prices and the limited availability of foreign 
debt and equity investments stemming from international 
sanctions introduced in 2014.  
For the Russian economy as a whole, 2017 proved to be a 
year of moderate improvement as the oil price continued the 
positive price momentum it gained in 2016, finishing the year 
at US$60 per barrel. The Russian Rouble also strengthened 
by 15% year-on-year from 67.1 RUB/USD in 2016 to 58.3 
RUB/USD in 2017. Conversely, this had a negative impact 
on the mining sector, resulting in an increased dollar value of 
rouble-denominated operating costs across the board and 
lower Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
Although Kazakhstan and Armenia have a significantly 
smaller share in global gold mine production, these countries 
have a strong growth profile, attributable to a good climate 
for foreign investment in the sector as well as some 
government incentives. The economics of Kazakh gold 
mining was also supported by the moderate devaluation of 
the Kazakh Tenge (5% stronger against the US Dollar year-
on-year), while the Armenian Dram remains the most stable 
currency in the Former Soviet Union.
How we respond to these trends
We continue to utilise our 20 years of experience  
in mine performance optimisation and the pursuit  
of high-grade and high-optionality assets in order  
to ensure resilient economics against the backdrop 
of commodity price and FX volatility. Our strong 
performance in 2017 , with a record 1,433 Koz  
of GE produced and a net profit of US$354 million, 
re-affirms the success of our approach and  
sets us on the right track to deliver on our  
long-term strategy. 
In order to limit our exposure to risk, in the process 
of project approval, our stress tests are carried  
out with a 20% discount to spot prices and a  
10% increase in operating costs, ensuring that  
our operations can be sustained even under  
volatile market conditions. Similarly, we continue  
to review the prices used for our reserve and 
resource statement on a regular basis to reflect 
market fluctuations.

Annual targets for gold equivalent (GE) 
production are an indicator to the market 
of our confidence in our operating 
performance – and one that we 
regularly exceed. 
In 2017, Polymetal delivered a strong 
operational performance with a record gold 
equivalent production of 1,433 Koz, a 13% 
increase year-on-year, meeting our initial 
production guidance for the sixth 
consecutive year.
Top-line indicator, heavily depends on 
commodity prices but also driven by  
delivery of production volumes. 
In 2017, revenue increased by 15% over 
2016 to US$1,815 million, primarily driven  
by GE production growth of 13%. Gold and 
silver sales volumes both broadly followed 
the production dynamics.
High-grade, full capacity utilisation and 
continued operating improvement, as well 
as foreign exchange rates and oil price are 
the key drivers of total cash cost per ounce. 
TCC were US$658/GE oz, up 15% from 
2016 levels and within the Company’s 
updated guidance of US$650-675/GE oz. 
The increase in TCC was predominantly 
driven by the strengthening of the Russian 
Rouble. AISC amounted to US$893/GE oz, 
an increase of 15% year-on-year, driven 
mostly by the same factor.
Return on equity is one of the most 
important metrics for evaluating a 
company’s profitability and measures the 
efficiency with which a company generates 
income using the funds that shareholders 
have invested. 
In 2017, return on equity (based on 
underlying net earnings and average equity 
adjusted for translation reserve) was 16%, 
compared with 18% in the prior period,  
and remains one of the highest in the sector.
Our rigorous approach to all investment 
decisions ensures tight controls on capital 
expenditure, boosting return on invested 
capital for shareholders and sustainable 
development for the business. 
Capital expenditure came in at US$383 
million, up 41% compared with 2016 on  
the back of accelerated pre-stripping  
and construction at Kyzyl, as well as an 
increased brownfield exploration spend 
across the operating assets portfolio. 
Reducing GHG emissions is one of the  
core pillars of our long-term commitment  
to maintaining the highest environmental, 
social and governance standards. 
We are aware of climate change and 
recognize our responsibility to manage 
carbon footprint and minimize our GHG  
and other emissions. This year the part of  
our energy needs were met through clean 
energy sources and together with our energy 
efficiency programs it resulted in GHG 
intensity decrease of 8%.

Both extending mine life through near-mine 
exploration and new discoveries from 
greenfield exploration contribute to the 
Company’s long-term growth prospects. 
In 2017, the Company increased its  
ore reserves by 5% to 20.9 Moz of gold 
equivalent on the back of successful 
exploration at Albazino, Komar and Dukat, 
as well as initial reserve estimates at Kapan 
and Nezhda.
Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of 
our ability to generate operating cash flows 
from the current business. 
Adjusted EBITDA was US$745 million,  
down 2% compared to 2016, as a result of 
increased costs incurred due to a stronger 
Russian Rouble, which largely offset 
production growth.
A key indicator in any business. Generating a 
healthy free cash flow enables us to provide 
significant cash returns for shareholders. 
Despite intensive construction activities at 
Kyzyl in the course of 2017, the Company 
continued to generate positive free cash 
flow
1
 that amounted to US$143 million.
Our aim is to deliver meaningful dividends  
to our shareholders at all stages of both the 
commodity cycle and our investment cycle. 
In 2017, dividends of US$138 million (0.32 
per share) were paid out and a final dividend 
of US$129 million (US$0.30 per share) is 
proposed, bringing total dividend declared 
for the period to US$189 million.
Underlying net income is a comprehensive 
benchmark of our core profitability excluding 
foreign exchange gains/losses and 
impairments. 
Underlying net earnings (adjusted for the 
after-tax amount of write-down of metal 
inventory to net realisable value, foreign 
exchange gains/losses and change in fair 
value of contingent consideration liability) 
were US$376 million, almost flat compared 
with 2016. 
An improvement in the health and safety of 
employees at our operations is a key priority 
with a goal of zero fatalities. 
Sadly, the Company did not manage to 
reach its zero fatalities target in 2017, with 
two lives lost at the Group’s operations 
during the year. Nevertheless, Polymetal 
notes a visible improvement in its overall 
health and safety performance, with a 21% 
reduction in LTIFR compared with 2016.

Gold equivalent production by mine in 2017
In 2017, Polymetal delivered a strong operational 
performance with a record GE production of  
1,433 Koz, meeting our production guidance for the 
sixth consecutive year. We expect further production 
growth in 2018, coming mainly from Kyzyl but also 
from Komar’s full ramp-up and our existing mines 
continuing to deliver stable performances.
A record-breaking year
In 2017 , Polymetal delivered a strong operational 
performance with a record gold equivalent production 
of 1,433 Koz, a 13% increase year-on-year, meeting our 
initial production guidance for the sixth consecutive year. 
The robust finish to the year was driven by contributions 
from the fully ramped-up Svetloye heap leach (Okhotsk hub), 
as well as a solid performance at Komar (Varvara hub), 
Omolon and Amursk-Albazino.
Gold production totalled 1,075 Koz, a 21% increase year-on-
year, allowing Polymetal to join the prestigious 1 Moz club, 
the second premium-listed gold company on the London 
Stock Exchange to achieve this important milestone. Silver 
production was down 8% to 26.8 Moz, due to the planned 
grade decline at the Dukat and Lunnoye underground mines. 
Gold sales were 1,099 Koz, up 25% year-on-year, while silver 
sales were down 14% year-on-year at 26.5 Moz, generally in 
line with production dynamics and volume. 
Analysis of production results
Mining 
Stripping volumes in 2017 grew by 39% to 114 Mt of rock 
moved, driven mostly by drill-and-blast pre-stripping at  
Kyzyl and the removal of historic waste stockpiles at Komar.
Underground development increased by a further 25% to  
115 km (2016: 92.2 km), with increased capacity to match 
processing volumes at Kapan underground mine, as well 
as underground development for new brownfield extensions 
at an active pace at Omolon hub (Birkachan and Olcha) 
and at Dukat hub (Perevalnoye and Terem). At Olcha,  
first ore stopes were extracted at the underground mine, 
where development is in full swing. Underground 
development at Perevalnoye and Terem is making good 
progress with both ore sources expected to make significant 
contributions to the feed at the Omsukchan concentrator 
in 2018.

Based on actual realised prices.
Ore mined decreased by 6% year-on-year to 12.6 Mt (2016: 
13.4 Mt), mainly as a result of the completion of open-pit 
mining at Oroch and a temporary suspension at Birkachan 
(where sufficient historic ore stockpiles are available).
Processing 
Ore processed increased by 14% to 13.0 Mt (2016: 11.4 Mt), 
mainly on the back of the resumption of the Birkachan heap 
leach project and the ramp-up of Svetloye.
As expected, the average gold equivalent grade in ore 
processed decreased slightly from 4.0 g/t to 3.9 g/t, while 
remaining close to average reserve grade. The decline came 
mostly from mature operations: the normalisation of the 
grade profile at the Dukat and Lunnoye mines; a scheduled 
slight decline in average grades at the Voro heap leach 
facility; and a lower gold average grade at Omolon’s Kubaka 
plant due to a change in the feedstock mix.
Production and sales 
In 2017 , Polymetal continued to deliver solid production 
results, producing 1.4 Moz of gold equivalent, up 13%  
year-on-year. Key drivers behind this performance were 
Svetloye (Okhotsk hub), Komar (Varvara hub), 
Omolon and Amursk-Albazino.  
At Okhotsk operations, Svetloye heap leach was ramped-up 
to full capacity, making a significant contribution to the 
Group’s strong performance and delivering superior results: 
GE production was 106 Koz compared with 23 Koz in 2016. 
Komar provided valuable support to the Varvara operations: 
almost 2 Mt of Komar ore was mined and railed to the 
Varvara hub, resulting in a record GE production of 123 Koz, 
up 53% year-on-year. At Kapan, GE production almost 
doubled: a good operational performance was driven by 
increased processing volumes and improved head grades  
on the back of ongoing measures to debottleneck the 
underground mine and improve recovery levels.
Albazino/Amursk achieved record gold production of 
269 Koz, up 10% year-on-year, driven by higher productivity 
and recovery levels, as well as a significant improvement 
in head grades. At Dukat, there was a 13% decline in GE 
production, where higher processing volumes and improved 
recoveries failed to offset declining grades. This is partially 
due to a reduction in cut-off grades, which take into 
account lower mining costs, lower treatment charges 
and higher recoveries.
Metal sales in 2017 were 1,468 Koz of gold equivalent, up 
13% compared with 2016, broadly following the production 
dynamics. While most of the sales are comprised of refined 
metals, we continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold/
silver), Varvara (gold/copper), Kapan (gold/copper and gold/
zinc) and Mayskoye (refractory gold) to different offtakers 
worldwide. Offtake allows us to maximise our margins and 
achieve an optimal combination of transportation costs and 
treatment charges/recoveries, this being one of our core 
competencies. In February 2018, Polymetal also secured 
its first offtake contract for Kyzyl concentrate.
Exploration 
Exploration – greenfield and brownfield – is a core element  
in our strategy for driving future growth and has proved to  
be one of the most efficient growth sources for Polymetal 
historically. Both extending mine life through near-mine 
exploration at existing operations and new discoveries from 
greenfield exploration contribute to the Company’s long-term 
development prospects. Our exploration activities are 
focused on six regions in Russia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, 
Karelia, Yakutia, Chukotka and Urals – as well as on 
Kazakhstan and Armenia. 
Four new licences were obtained over the course of 2017 , 
bringing the total number to 82, of which 60 are currently 
involved in active exploration activities.

Our key exploration objectives in 2017 
• Brownfield exploration and resource-to-reserve 
conversions and resource upgrades at our brownfield 
projects with particular focus mature assets: 
Omolon (Irbychan and Yolochka); Voro (Saum) and 
Okhotsk  (Levoberezhny, Gyrbykan, and Kundumi);
• a comprehensive exploration campaign at Dukat  
(the deeper levels of Lunnoye deposit, Primorskoye  
and Perevalnoye) with a goal to extend the scope 
of resource estimates;
• an initial JORC reserve-and-resource estimate at  
Nezhda’s zone 1 and further drilling on smaller,  
potentially mineralised zones;
• 37 km of diamond drilling at the Prognoz silver deposit 
to confirm the resources of Main and Swamp ore zones;
• a JORC-compliant reserve estimate and a combined 
life-of-mine plan for Kapan and Lichkvaz;
• 30 km of step-out drilling at Komar and an update of 
the reserve-and-resource estimates for the deposit; and
• continuing step-out and deep-level drilling at Kyzyl. 
Key 2017 achievements
In 2017 , Polymetal succeeded in extending the life-of-mine 
at producing assets and continued to invest in the next 
phase of our growth. The Company completed 421 km of 
exploration drilling in 2017 , up 48% year-on-year with the 
scope of exploration expanding to include our new assets, 
mostly Prognoz and Nezhda joint ventures, in addition 
to continued exploration efforts at existing operations. 
The total capital expenditure on exploration was 
US$58 million, up 43% compared with 2016.
As a result of our exploration efforts, significant resource-to-
reserve conversions were achieved during the year, along 
with the completion of new reserve-and-resource estimates 
for several projects, including: 
• at Albazino, the initial ore reserve estimate for Farida  
open-pit (169 Koz GE) and Anfisa underground (47 Koz GE); 
• significant ore reserves increase of 524 Koz of gold  
(+49%) at Komar;

.
2018 targets
In 2018, Polymetal will continue to invest in exploration with 
the goal of expanding the pace and scope of drilling, as well 
as a prospect evaluation. The key objectives are as follows:
• to achieve resource-to-reserve conversions at existing 
operations with relatively shorter life-of-mine; 
• Polymetal aims to complete initial ore reserves estimates 
for the following deposits in 2018: Irbychan and Yolochka 
at Omolon; Saum and Pesherny at Voro; Levoberezhny 
and Kundumi at Okhotsk; Primorskoye and Perevalnoye 
(revaluation) at Dukat; 
• to prepare an updated mineral resources estimate and 
achieve resource-to-reserve conversion at Nezhda to 
include the southern flank of ore zone 1 and smaller 
mineralised zones;
• to complete an audited JORC-compliant resource estimate 
for Prognoz largest ore zones, Main and Swamp;
• to prepare an updated mineral resources estimate for 
Viksha, based on new drilling data and metallurgical 
studies; and
• to continue step-out and in-fill drilling at Kyzyl to increase 
reserves for open-pit mining.

Outlook for 2018
During 2018, we have an important year ahead of us with the 
first production from Kyzyl, which is set to deliver free cash 
flow soon after ramp-up. This will pave the way for further 
investment decisions by the end of the year: the construction 
plans for Nezhda and the feasibility study for a second POX 
line at Amursk. In the meantime, we will continue to focus 
on sustaining robust operating performance at mature 
operations and advancing our long-term project pipeline, 
including Prognoz and Viksha. 
We expect further production growth in 2018, coming mainly 
from Kyzyl but also from Komar’s (Varvara hub) full ramp-up 
to 2.2 Mtpa and our existing mines continuing to deliver 
stable performances. At Mayskoye, a combined float-leach 
circuit with flotation will commence operation in May 2018, 
while open-pit mining will resume in Q1 2018.
The launch of the Kyzyl project is scheduled for Q3 2018 and 
is much anticipated both within the Company and by all our 
stakeholders. At the processing facility, construction activities 
will be focused on the installation of smaller technological 
equipment. In Q1 to Q3 2018, we will commission the 
accomodation camp, engineering networks and facilities, 
warehouse facilities, and heat and power complex, as well as 
the tailing dump and the main concentrator complex. Kyzyl 
remains on track to produce the first concentrate in Q3 2018. 
In January 2018, the first ore was mined from the open-pit 
ahead of schedule. Polymetal is on track to ramp up the 
debottlenecked POX plant in the second half of 2018,  
in time to take feed from the Kyzyl concentrator.
We will also focus on our new projects that will drive growth 
beyond the launch of Kyzyl. We plan to advance the feasibility 
studies for Nezhda and POX-2 projects and continue the 
drilling campaign at the Prognoz silver project, with an 
updated resource estimate scheduled for Q4 2018.
The Company reiterates its production guidance for 2018 
and 2019 of 1.55 Moz and 1.7 Moz of gold equivalent, 
respectively. The main growth drivers will be the ramp-up  
of Kyzyl, re-commissioning of the oxide circuit at Mayskoye 
and incremental improvements at Varvara and Kapan.  
This should offset anticipated grade declines at Khakanja 
and Voro. As previously, production in both years will be 
weighted towards the second half of the year due 
to seasonality.
Our focus remains on health and safety, where we are yet  
to achieve our principal goal of zero fatalities at all operations. 
In 2018, we will continue implementing a geomechanical 
management system that will help eliminate accidents 
related to mining processes.

OPERATING REVIEW
Reserves and resources 
In 2017 , the Company increased its ore reserves by 5%  
to 20.9 Moz of GE on the back of successful exploration  
at Albazino, Komar and Dukat, as well as initial reserve 
estimates at Kapan and Nezhda.  Gold reserves were up 5% 
at 18.4 Moz, while silver reserves decreased 3% to 158 Moz. 
At the same time, copper reserves grew 25% to 82 Kt.
Mineral resources (in addition to ore reserves) increased by  
10% to 18.2 Moz of GE, mainly driven by initial resource 
estimates for the Pesherniy and Nezhda deposits, as well as 
resource additions at the deeper levels of Mayskoye and Dukat. 
The average grade in ore reserves was stable year-on-year  
at 3.9 g/t of GE and remains one of the highest in the sector. 
At the same time, the average grade in mineral resources 
increased by 11 % to 4.7 g/t of GE due to high-grade 
resource additions at new projects.
We expect 2018 to result in further significant extensions 
of our reserves and resources.

OPERATING REVIEW
OPERATING ASSETS
Despite a moderate scheduled decrease in production driven by 
grade profile, Dukat continues to be the major contributor to EBITDA 
and free cash flow. In 2017, the hub delivered on our targets and 
produced 22.5 Moz of silver.
Mining 
The amount of ore mined at the Dukat hub in 2017 increased by  
6% year-on-year to 2.4 Mt, and underground development was  
up 17% year-on-year at 54 km.
At Dukat, for the third consecutive year, the volume of ore mined 
remained virtually unchanged at a record level of 1,605 Kt. 
Underground development decreased by 4% to 34 km. Average 
silver grade decreased by 19% to 306 g/t in accordance with the 
mine plan. The effectiveness of underground works was enhanced 
thanks to the increased productivity of drilling rigs. 
At Goltsovoye, mining volumes increased by 4% to 190 Kt, 
while underground development was up 15%, mainly due to the 
continued increase in mining works at deep levels and flank areas. 
Average silver grade remained almost unchanged at 366 g/t.
At Lunnoye, a record amount of ore was mined and processed in 
2017 (up 27% year-on-year) as stoping continued at the new zone 
5 vein. Lower silver grade of 352 g/t, a 23% decrease compared 
with the prior period, is mostly attributable to the depletion of the 
high-grade portion of zone 7.
There has been good progress with the underground development 
at two brownfield sites, Perevalnoye and Terem, with both ore 
sources expected to make significant contributions to the feed  
at the Omsukchan concentrator in 2018. 
Processing and production 
Full-year silver production at the Dukat hub was 22.5 Moz, a decrease 
of 12% over the previous year, as higher processing volumes and 
improved recoveries did not offset declining grades. Lower grades 
in  the feed were partially the result of reduced cut-off grades, which 
take into account lower mining costs, lower treatment charges and 
higher recoveries. 
At the same time, the Dukat concentrator set a new throughput 
record, processing 1,979 Kt of ore in 2017 , while maintaining stable 
recoveries (86.3% for gold and a 4% increase for silver to 88.6%) 
on the back of continuous improvement in the ore quality control 
system, based on geological and process mapping. Average grades 
decreased by 26% for gold to 0.4 g/t and by 14% for silver to 321 g/t. 
Gold and silver production decreased by 23% and 11%, respectively, 
to 24.2 Koz of gold and 17 .7 Moz of silver. 
The Lunnoye plant delivered a robust set of results: ore processed 
grew by 6% year-on-year to 460 Kt, while average gold and silver 
grades were down 17% and 19%, respectively. Average recoveries 
were strong at 90.3% for gold and 92.8% for silver. Annual 
production at Lunnoye was 4.8 Moz of silver, down 14% year-on-
year due to the change in grade profile.

 > The reconstruction of the tailing dump #3.
DUKAT CONTINUED
Resources and exploration 
At the Dukat hub, the Company achieved a 70% increase in 
additional mineral resources. This success was primarily driven 
by additional exploration at the deeper levels of the Lunnoye deposit 
and the discovery of previously unknown veins at the Dukat flanks. 
In 2018, prospecting activities are set to continue at the northern 
and eastern flanks of Dukat. 
At the Primorskoye property, 6.9 km of exploration drilling was 
completed at ore zones 1 and 3 with a goal to trace ore bodies 
along the strike and at depth. In 2018, the Company intends to 
conduct further prospecting activities at other ore zones with the 
goal to increase the resource base of the deposit and delineate  
ore bodies in zones 1 and 3. 
At Perevalnoye, exploration continued by in-fill drilling from the 
underground with trial ore stoping expected to lead to a material 
upgrade in resources at the deposit.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 32 AMURSK POX 
UNIQUE PROCESSING CENTRE FOR 
REFRACTORY GOLD CONCENTRATES 
IN THE RUSSIAN FAR EAST
Expansion of the targets for Amursk POX plant and the doubling in 
the current POX capacity, in terms of sulphur oxidation, will enable 
Polymetal to retain approximately 50% of Kyzyl concentrate for 
in-house treatment, as opposed to a third-party offtake. This is 
expected to improve effective gold recovery from concentrate, 
as well as bringing down the processing and transportation costs.
2017 highlights
In 2017, the Amursk POX plant worked steadily at design 
parameters. Concentrate processed remained stable at 160 Kt 
(2016: 166 Kt), while total gold production amounted to 280 Koz 
of gold equivalent (up 3% year-on-year), thanks to the optimal 
processing of feedstock mix and despite two maintenance 
shutdowns (one for seven weeks), which were required to 
install equipment needed for the expansion. 
Concentrate processed from Albazino was 154 Kt (up 3% year-on-
year), while the average gold grade increased by 12% year-on-year 
to 58.3 g/t. Concentrate processed from Mayskoye decreased by 
63% to 6 Kt, as the capacity at Amursk POX was taken up by 
higher-grade and higher-margin third-party material. The average 
grade was 49.6 g/t (down 10% year-on-year). Recoveries from both 
Albazino and Mayskoye concentrate exceeded the design levels at 
96.4% and 96.2%, respectively, and a record recovery level of 
97.2% was achieved in Q4 2017.
Amursk POX expansion
The debottlenecking project at the Amursk POX is progressing 
on schedule. The oxygen plant has arrived on site and equipment 
installation is under way, including new filter presses for tails and 
gypsum sediment. In 2017, the construction, commissioning and 
launch of new desorption section and control filtration were 
completed. The autoclave oxidation section was modernised. 
Construction of the filtration sections of the leaching tails and  
oxygen station No. 2 have also been completed.
Polymetal plans to ramp-up the debottlenecked POX plant in 
the second half of 2018, just in time to take first feed from the 
Kyzyl concentrator.
Polymetal is continuing to undertake extensive metallurgical 
testwork and evaluate its ability to use high-temperature (230-240C) 
POX technology to process high-carbon Kyzyl concentrate and 
third-party feedstocks. The project will enable Polymetal to materially 
improve the economics of refractory gold projects by increasing gold 
recovery from concentrates and bringing down processing and 
transportation costs, and will also strengthen Polymetal’s 
commercial position on the concentrate market vis-à-vis offtakers. 
A decision on the construction of the second POX is expected in late 
2018, in conjunction with the ramp-up of Kyzyl and an investment 
decision on Nezhda project.

OMOLON CONTINUED
Omolon delivered strong operating and financial performance in 
2017, with gold equivalent production increasing by 19% to 202 Koz. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 3% to US$120 million, despite the 
appreciation of Russian Rouble, which negatively affected total 
cash costs.
Mining
In 2017, the total ore mined decreased by 69% to 692 Kt, driven 
mainly by the completion of open-pit mining at Oroch and the 
temporary suspension of open-pit mining at Birkachan due to 
the availability of sufficient historic ore stockpiles. Underground 
development almost doubled to 11.5 km on the back of ramping 
up underground mining at Birkachan and Tsokol. 
At Sopka, open-pit mining is proceeding as planned, with 261 Kt  
of mined ore to be transported to the Kubaka mill for processing in  
Q1 2018. Open-pit mining at Sopka is expected to wind down in  
Q2 2018. 
At Tsokol, underground development continued with 153 Kt of ore 
mined and a slight decrease in the average gold grade to 10.4 g/t. 
At Birkachan, ore mined decreased by 88% to 114 Kt, as open-pit 
activities are now complete, with personnel transferred to Olcha 
where the first ore stopes were extracted and development is  
in full swing. 
Processing
Omolon delivered a robust set of production results for the year, 
with gold equivalent production up 19% year-on-year at 202 Koz. 
The increase is attributable to significantly improved gold grades  
and recovery levels at the Kubaka processing plant due to the 
continuing increase in the levels of higher-grade ore from the  
Tsokol and Birkachan underground mines. 
Throughput at the Kubaka mill remained stable, with 858 Kt of ore 
processed during 2017 (up 2% year-on-year). Recoveries increased 
by 2% to 94.2% for gold and decreased by 2% to 83.9% for silver. 
Average grades processed were up 13% for gold at 6.7 g/t and 
remained stable for silver at 90 g/t.
In Q2 2018, we plan to increase the pace of heap leaching 
at Birkachan; in 2017 a total 459 Kt of ore were stacked and  
the leaching resumed. 
Exploration 
At Omolon, the completion of initial ore reserve estimates for new 
veins at Birkachan and Sopka open-pit have largely offset reserve 
depletion in 2017.
At Irbychan, exploration has previously focused on in-fill drilling at  
the Central and Northern ore zones. In 2018, the focus will shift to 
the Eastern zone.
At Yolochka, 6.7 km of in-fill drilling was completed at the  
Central and Southern zones. Both zones remain open at depth.  
The Company also completed prospecting drilling at the flanks  
and the Promezhutochnaya zone.
At Nevenrekan, exploration activities were previously focused on 
in-fill drilling at zone 2, with several high-grade intercepts confirming 
potential for profitable underground mining. As a result of 
prospecting drilling at ore zone 1 new high-grade ore zones were 
discovered. In 2018, the Company plans to complete regular drilling 
at zones 1 and 5 as well as surveying activities at the flanks of  
the deposit.

HIGH-GRADE PROFILE AND 
SOLID PERFORMANCE 
In 2017, Albazino demonstrated an excellent operating performance 
and achieved record gold production of 268.5 Koz, up 10% year-on-
year. This was driven by increased recovery levels and higher hourly 
productivity, as well as increased volumes of third-party material 
processing at the Amursk POX.
Mining 
At the Albazino underground mine, productivity continued to 
improve with full transition to partially consolidated backfill in primary 
stopes. There was a substantial improvement in both the extent of 
underground development and the volume of ore mined, up year-
on-year by 33% and 20%, respectively. However, the amount of ore 
mined from the open-pit decreased 5% year-on-year to 1,512 Kt. 
As a result, the total amount of ore mined was 1,832 Kt and 
remained almost flat year-on-year.
Open-pit mining at the Olga pit was completed in Q4 with  
all the equipment now moved to the Ekaterina-1 pit.
Processing
Ore processed grew by 4% year-on-year to 1,725 Kt, while 
average gold grade in ore processed declined by 3% to 4.9 g/t in 
line with the mine plan grade profile. Gold recoveries at the 
Albazino concentrator were 87 .5% while concentrate yield was 8%. 
Incremental continuous improvements in throughput and recovery 
at the Albazino concentrator ensured production growth, despite 
the decrease in grade. In 2017 , the concentrate loading station was 
upgraded and the third stage of the tailing dump was commissioned.
Concentrate of 141 Kt with an average grade of 52.3 g/t was 
produced, up 3% year-on-year. All concentrate was processed 
at the Amursk POX plant. The total gold production for 2017 was 
269 Koz, a 10% increase on the previous year, driven mostly by 
improved recoveries at the Amursk POX plant and processing 
of third-party material.
Exploration and development 
In 2017, successful exploration results were achieved at Albazino. 
Ore reserves increased by 12% year-on-year to 2.3 Moz GE, driven 
by the initial ore reserve estimate for Farida open pit (169 Koz GE) 
and Anfisa underground (47 Koz GE). 
In 2018, exploration will focus on delineating resources and 
estimating mineral resources at new ore zones, namely Tatiana  
and Kuyan.

MAYSKOYE 
LONG-LIFE HIGH-GRADE REFRACTORY 
GOLD MINE 
In 2017, Mayskoye delivered a 124 Koz contribution to the Group’s 
total production, a 7% increase compared with 2016. Production 
was entirely from concentrate offtake to China since the POX 
capacity was taken by higher-margin, third-party material. We have 
commenced development of the combined float-leach circuit, which 
is expected to start operation in the first half of 2018, bringing the 
oxide ore from the open-pit into production.
Mining 
Total ore mined increased by 29% to 944 kt, following the 
commencement of open-pit mining, which contributed 225 kt. 
The average grade mined was 6.3 g/t, up 20% year-on-year, 
driven by higher grades in the open-pit.  
Open-pit mining was slowed-down during the winter months, 
Additional metallurgical testing was conducted in order to try and 
combat the low carbon-in-pulp (CIP) recoveries, caused by intense 
preg-robbing in the near-surface ore. It will resume in Q1 2018. 
Geological and technological mapping of oxidised and transition 
ores in zones 5 and 6 were carried out for a further estimation of  
ore reserves and planning of mining works (both open-pit 
and underground). 
Processing 
In 2017, ore processed at the flotation circuit decreased by 15% 
year-on-year to 644 Kt, as planned, with an average gold grade 
of 5.4 g/t (2016: 5.3 g/t). The recoveries were stable at 87.7%. 
The gold in concentrate produced decreased by 16% year-on-year 
and comprised 96 Koz, reflecting the lower volumes of ore 
processed at the circuit. 
Ore processed at the leaching circuit was 67 Kt, with an average 
grade of 9.9 g/t contributing 11 Koz of gold produced. After low 
carbon-in-leach (CIL) recoveries in the first half of 2017 at the 
crown pillar project, additional and extensive metallurgical testing 
was undertaken. As a result, future oxide-ore processing will be 
through a combined float-leach circuit, with flotation removing the 
bulk of preg-robbing organic carbon. This circuit will commence 
operation in May 2018. 
Total gold production at Mayskoye increased 7% year-on-year to 
124 Koz. Production was solely from offtake sales to China as the 
capacity at Amursk POX was taken up by higher-grade and higher-
margin third-party material.
Exploration
At Mayskoye, 610 Koz of gold were added to mineral resources 
following a 33 km drilling campaign in 2017. This brings total 
additional mineral resources for Mayskoye to 3.8 Moz of gold, 
up 19% year-on-year.

OKHOTSK 
DELIVERING FULL POTENTIAL FROM 
SVETLOYE HEAP LEACH
Mining
The annual amount of ore mined at the Okhotsk hub decreased 
by 6% in 2017 to 1,383 Kt.
Svetloye became the major source of ore for processing: 1,246 Kt of 
ore were mined with gold grade in ore stacked of 4.4 g/t. Svetloye is 
a seasonal operation and shuts down for the winter, with operations 
resuming in Q2 2018.
Avlayakan underground mine operated at design capacity and 
produced 137 Kt of ore in 2017, down 3% compared with 2016, and 
with average grades in ore mined of 15.9 g/t gold and 147 g/t silver, 
almost flat year-on-year. Life-of-mine at Avlayakan was extended to 
the second half of 2018 on the back of positive down-dip 
exploration results.
Processing and production
At Okhotsk, gold production grew by an impressive 71% year-on-year 
to 196 Koz. Growth was largely driven by a significant contribution 
from the fully ramped-up Svetloye heap leach operation. Silver 
production for the year grew by 25% to 1.7 Moz as more third-party 
ore, with better metallurgical properties, was introduced to the feed 
at the Khakanja plant in 2017 . 
Svetloye heap leach operation was ramped-up to full capacity 
significantly contributing to the Group’s strong performance. 
The amount of ore stacked was 1,054 Kt and GE production at 
the heap leach amounted to 106 Koz of gold produced, compared 
with 23 Koz in 2016, and is a first-class result just one year after 
launch. A study is being conducted on the feasibility of all-year-
round leaching of the heap leaching pads, using a heating option.
At Khakanja CIP plant, processing volumes remained flat at 623 Kt, 
with feed mainly drawn from high-grade Avlayakan ore. Gold 
equivalent production during 2017 decreased by 3% as expected, 
since the historic reserves are being depleted and the plant is 
mainly focused on stockpile and third-party material processing. 
Resources and exploration
48.0 km of exploration drilling has been completed in the Okhotsk 
region in 2017, a 70% increase compared with the previous year. 
At Levoberezhny (35 km from Svetloye), in-fill drilling confirmed the 
continuity of mineralisation and the option of using heap leaching 
to extract gold.
12.8 km were drilled at Kundumi within the Central and Western ore 
zones resulted in a material increase in mineral resources. In 2018, 
the Company plans to undertake an additional 15 km of core 
drilling targeting both resource-to-reserve conversion and further 
resource growth. 
At Khotorchan and Gyrbykan, multiple new veins have been 
discovered during the year. In 2018, Polymetal plans to complete 
resource definition drilling and start open-pit mining on previously 
discovered veins.

Voro is one of the oldest assets in the portfolio, but continues to  
be a key cash-flow contributor with an attractive cash-cost profile.  
In 2017, Voro delivered stable operating performance in line with 
the mine plan.
Mining
Mining is currently focused on the primary ore, while oxide ore 
is nearing depletion. In 2017, total volumes of ore mined at Voro 
increased by 19% to 1,553 Kt. Average grades for primary and 
oxidised ore were down 16% and 24% year-on-year, respectively. 
Optimisation of the cycle time of the mining fleet was undertaken, 
enabling an increase in productivity from dump trucks.
Processing and production
Total gold production at Voro decreased by 7% year-on-year to 
118 Koz, primarily driven by anticipated lower head grades at both 
the heap leach and CIP operations. Voro continues  to deliver a 
stable performance in line with the mine plan. 
In 2017, the CIP plant delivered throughput of 1,002 Kt of  
ore processed, which remained relatively unchanged over the 
previous year, and produced 102 Koz of gold, down 8% year-on-
year. The average gold grade in ore processed was 4.0 g/t, a 5% 
decrease from 2016. 2018 is expected to be the last year of heap 
leaching at Voro operations.
Resources and exploration 
In 2017 , the Company increased Voro’s mineral resources by 28% 
to 1.0 Moz GE with the discovery of a new gold deposit at Pesherny  
(30 km from the CIP plant). An initial resource estimate comprised  
449 Koz of gold at an average grade of 6.7 g/t. In 2018, we plan to 
continue exploring this highly promising property that may significantly 
extend the life-of-mine and halt production decline at Voro.
At Saum, mineral resource grew to reach 67.4 Kt of copper 
equivalent at an average grade of 2.9%. In 2018, we plan to 
complete the feasibility study for the property. 
At Voro open-pit, exploration focused on the assessment of 
mineralisation below the ultimate pit floor. Mineral resources grew by 
86 Koz of gold equivilant at 2.6 g/t. The results suggest feasibility of 
underground mining after open-pit mining is completed. Ore bodies 
are open along strike with drilling to continue in 2018.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 38 KAPAN 
CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT AT OUR FIRST 
ARMENIAN OPERATION 
In 2017, Kapan delivered a strong operational performance driven 
by increased processing volumes and improved head grades on 
the back of ongoing enhancement measures to debottleneck the 
underground mine and improve recovery levels. 
Mining
At Kapan mine, underground development grew by 78% year-on-
year to 16.9 km and the amount of ore mined was 527 Kt compared 
with 287 Kt in 2016. Average GE grade in ore mined was 2.7 g/t (an 
increase of 7% year-on-year). In 2017, a comprehensive technical 
re-equipping of the mine and the renewal of mining fleet were 
carried out with already visible results in the increased underground 
mining productivity. The projects for the reconstruction of the mine 
ventilation system and construction of an underground water 
pumping station have been started. While the upgrade of the 
mining fleet was largely completed in 2017, the increase in 
productivity at the underground mine is taking longer to achieve  
than expected.
At Lichkvaz, preparatory activities for underground mining are 
currently underway and are aimed at widening the underground 
tunnels for consecutive underground and stope development later 
this year.
Processing and production
During 2017, we undertook measures to debottleneck the 
processing plant and improve recovery levels. This included the 
construction of an ore blending warehouse, the overhaul of the 
copper circuit crusher, vacuum filter and thickener, and the 
installation of a vibrating griddle at the central crushing section.
Ore processed was 530 Kt, up 81% year-on year. The recoveries 
increased from the previous year to 83.6% for gold and 83.0% for 
silver. GE production at Kapan comprised a record 50 Koz on the 
back of increased processing volumes and improved head grades.
Reserves and resources
At Kapan, Polymetal prepared an initial JORC-compliant reserve 
estimate as at 1 January 2018, which comprised 558 Koz GE at 
an average grade of 4.3 g/t. Additional mineral resources were 
estimated at 1,632 Koz GE at an average grade of 6.1 g/t.
At Lichkvaz (70 km from Kapan) an initial JORC-compliant reserve 
estimate was prepared by Polymetal and comprised 134 Koz GE at 
3.9 g/t, while additional mineral resources amounted to 257 Koz GE 
at 5.0 g/t.

VARVARA 
QUICK RAMP-UP OF NEWLY ACQUIRED  
KOMAR DELIVERING EXCELLENT 
PERFORMANCE 
Komar provided strong support to Varvara operations: almost 2 Mt of 
Komar ore was mined and railed to the Varvara hub. This resulted in a 
record GE production of 130 Koz, up 54% year-on-year. 
Mining
In 2017 , mining volumes were almost flat year-on-year at 3,243 Kt, 
while we experienced a slight decrease in float ore average grade to 
1.0 g/t (down 15% compared with 2016) and 48% increase in Komar 
leach ore average grade to 1.4 (up 48% compared with 2016). 
Processing and production
In 2017, Varvara produced a record 130 GE Koz, up 54% year-on-
year. Growth was driven by increased processing volumes and 
substantially improved grades at both flotation and leaching circuits 
as more high-grade ore was delivered by rail from Komar, an 
operation acquired by Polymetal in August 2016 and quickly 
ramped-up to full productivity. 
At the leaching circuit, 3,279 Kt was processed in 2017 (up 5% 
year-on-year) while the flotation circuit processed 389 Kt (up 5% 
year-on-year).
In an effort to further streamline Komar ore logistics, a new railway 
spur at Komar has been commissioned. It is adjacent to the open-
pit and will enable further reductions in ore haulage costs.
In 2018, Polymetal aims to transport more than 2 Mt of Komar ore to 
Varvara by rail, a key element in plans to further increase production 
levels at the operation. The additional Komar ore will displace the 
lower-grade material from the Varvara deposit and, consequently, 
increase production and result in lower costs at the Varvara 
processing hub.
Resources and exploration 
At Komar, 30 km of exploration drilling at the central and southern 
zones was completed in 2017 , driving a significant increase in ore 
reserves of 524 Koz of gold (+49%). The upgraded estimate 
represents a significant increase over the previous estimate, up 60% 
in tonnage and 57% in gold content, further extending the Varvara 
hub mine life by three years to 2032. The reserve expansion, 
increased processing capacity and associated economies of scale 
have far outstripped our expectations at the time of the acquisition.  
In 2018, exploration activities are set to continue at the northern and 
south-eastern parts of the deposit. 
12.1 km of drilling was completed at Elevator – a new prospect that is 
situated 8 km north-east of the Komar deposit. New thick ore bodies 
were discovered below the previously mined oxidized ore. Exploration 
will continue in 2018.

MAJOR MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH DRIVER FOR 
POLYMETAL 
Kyzyl is one of the best development-stage gold projects in the 
world and is on track to produce its first concentrate in Q3 2018. 
It offers a perfect fit with Polymetal’s core competencies: project 
development from scratch, open-pit mining, treating refractory 
materials in-house (through Amursk POX plant) and trading 
concentrates with offtakers.
Mining
At Kyzyl, stripping volumes increased significantly to 48.5 Mt, 
compared with 22.4 Mt in 2016. The first ore was mined from 
the open-pit ahead of schedule in January 2018. 
Development
Construction activities are in line with the project schedule 
All external electrical infrastructures (substation, power lines, 
switchboxes) are fully operational. The tailings storage facility 
has been completed. At the ore preparation complex, the crusher, 
conveyor gallery and apron feeder are in place. Foundations for 
the mills and other processing equipment have been completed, 
together with the tunnel gallery leading from the crusher to the 
main concentrator building. At the processing facility, construction 
activities are now focused on the installation of smaller technological 
equipment. Work has started on electrical wiring, ventilation ducting 
and installation of process control equipment.
Kyzyl remains on track to produce the first concentrate in Q3 2018. 
There is strong demand for concentrate from multiple offtakers,  
with the first contract signed in Q1 2018. The commercial terms of 
the offtake agreement compare favorably with management’s 
original expectations, with the percentage of payable gold in 
concentrate in line with the project feasibility study and also 
treatment charges better than those for Mayskoye concentrate.
Exploration
At Bakyrchik, 49 holes totalling 8.3 km were drilled at the eastern 
flank of the deposit with results indicating strong potential to 
increase open-pit reserves. In-fill drilling leading to an updated 
ore reserve estimate is planned for 2018.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 42 Nezhda, Polymetal’s joint venture in Yakutia, is the fourth largest 
gold deposit in Russia by GKZ (statutory) reserves and has sizeable 
open-pittable reserves, with further resources targeted for 
underground operations. 
Development
In July 2017, Polymetal secured an option to consolidate 100% 
in Nezhda, for the development of the high-grade refractory 
gold deposit.
During the year, Polymetal undertook an extensive exploration 
campaign: 34.7 km of exploration drilling was completed.  
In November 2017. Polymetal reported the initial ore reserve  
estimate (JORC) for open-pit mining at ore zone 1, re-affirming  
the economic viability of the project and justifying the Company’s 
approach of developing the asset by starting it up as an open-pit 
with a concentrator on-site, followed by concentrate offtake. 
Open-pit ore reserves are estimated at 15.5 Mt of ore with  
an average GE grade of 4.0 g/t for 2.0 Moz of GE contained
3
. 
Additional mineral resources are estimated at 55.9 Mt of ore with 
an average GE grade of 5.0 g/t for 8.9 Moz of GE contained
4
. 
Nezhda is expected to benefit from low-capital intensity with robust 
project economics and has an excellent fit with our core capabilities. 
In 2018, Polymetal will focus on upgrading the open-pittable 
resources at the southern flank of ore zone 1 and producing the 
initial reserve estimate for underground mining at ore zone 56. 
The production start date is currently projected to start during the 
first half of 2022, subject to a positive investment-and-development 
decision in Q4 of 2018, after successful commencement of 
production at Kyzyl.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 45
POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 44 Viksha is Polymetal’s first platinum group metal (PGM) resource,  
and one of the largest open-pit PGM deposits in the world 
containing roughly 9.5 Moz of palladium equivalent.
Development
Polymetal was granted the 20-year mining licence in 2016, which 
covers a project area of 47 km
2
 and comprises three adjacent zones 
— Viksha, Kenti and Shargi — each containing platinum, palladium, 
gold and copper mineralisation. The depth of the mineralisation is 
just 150 m with an average ore body thickness  
of 7 m and a total length of 20 km along the surface.
In 2017, 39.6 km of exploration drilling was completed at the Viksha 
deposit in order to gain a better understanding of the geological 
controls and enable a future reserve estimate. An updated mineral 
resources estimate is expected in Q3 2018. 
Pilot plant metallurgical tests are currently being carried out and will 
be completed in 2018. Polymetal intends to complete a feasibility 
study for an ore reserve estimate for Viksha by Q3 2019. Provided 
the development decision based on the feasibility study is positive, 
the asset could enter production in 2022.
The Prognoz project fits well with Polymetal’s strategy and has the 
potential for a relatively low-capital and fast-development approach 
based on open-pit mining and conventional processing.
Development
Prognoz is the largest undeveloped primary silver deposit in Eurasia 
with an outstanding exploration upside (only 40% of known vein 
outcrop has been tested by drilling). Polymetal acquired a 5% 
indirect interest in Prognoz in January 2017, with new terms 
negotiated to consolidate a 45% stake in the property for a total 
consideration of US$72 million and a deferred consideration 
element, payable in Polymetal shares. The transaction is expected to 
close in the first half of 2018, subject to receipt of the required 
regulatory approvals. 
Mineral resources were estimated by Micon in 2009 at  
292 Moz at 586 g/t silver, 3% lead, with an additional mineralised 
potential of 7.9-18.1 Mt of ore at 469 g/t silver for 119-273 Moz of 
silver contained. During the year, Polymetal undertook 37.2 km of 
exploration drilling at the deposit to confirm the resources of Main 
and Swamp ore zones and established a basic remote-site 
infrastructure on the property. The results of the drilling campaign

20 years of discovering
Over the last two decades, Polymetal has built thriving and 
responsible mining business. We attribute our success to our 
focus on what is right – conducting business while prioritising 
health and safety, minimising our environmental impact, 
treating our employees fairly, and supporting local 
communities and the economy.
We were delighted to have our work in 2017 recognised 
externally. We were ranked 1st among environmentally 
responsible metals and mining companies in Russia by the 
WWF and the UNDP . We were proud to be shortlisted in the 
British IR Magazine Awards for Best ESG Communications 
and to win the award for Best Technology at the MINEX 
conference for our environment-friendly underground 
electrical vehicles. In addition, we reaffirmed FTSE4Good 
memebership. Sustainalytics positioned Polymetal in the 
93rd percentile as an outperformer in the industry, ranking 
us first among our peers and fourth globally out of the 44 
mining companies included in the report.
20 years prioritising safety
Nothing is more important to us than the safety, health 
and well-being of our employees and their families. 
Our commitment is to have zero injuries. We regrettably  
failed in our care of duty in 2017 with two fatalities. 
With the implementation of our Critical Risks Management 
System, we have seen a visible improvement in our health 
and safety performance, with a 21% reduction in LTIFR 
compared with 2016, and a decrease in the number of 
fatalities from four to two. 
20 years protecting the environment
At every stage of the mining life cycle, we work to avoid, 
reduce or mitigate any negative environmental impacts. 
In 2017 , we completed our energy study, with pilot projects on 
solar and wind sources to be launched in 2018. Our energy 
management system has been developed in accordance with 
ISO standards, and our climate change strategy and carbon 
management system is currently under development.  
20 years valuing employees
Our people are our greatest and most valued asset, 
working with enormous commitment to execute our strategy. 
We focus on increasing diversity and equal opportunities for 
women, decreasing labour turnover and providing training 
and development for all employees. In 2017 , collective 
bargaining agreements were extended at operating mines 
and we incorporated our Company’s standards at newly 
acquired operations. Health initiatives, such as our 
HIV programmes, were also launched the most exposed 
operations. 2018 is the 70th anniversary of the Declaration of 
Human Rights and we will mark this year with a widespread 
training programme on the importance of human rights.
20 years supporting local communities
Our vision is to generate wealth through responsible 
mining and to have a positive impact on the countries and 
communities where we operate. In 2017 , we held inaugural 
annual meetings with local residents in our new regions of 
operation (Armenia and Yakutia). We signed four additional 
socio-economic community agreements in three new regions 
of operation. There was a significant increase in employee 
involvement in our corporate volunteering activities aimed at 
helping communities. We also implemented our Community 
Engagement Standards at all our operations and updated 
our Social investments and Donations Policy.
The next 20 years
Sustainability is a journey – we have made good progress 
and are continuously looking at ways we can improve and 
grow our operations. In the years to come, we will continue 
to build a thriving and responsible business.

Our approach
We are deeply committed to sustainability and continuous 
improvement, which translates into safer working conditions 
for people, responsible environmental management, support 
for our local communities and growing economic value for 
our stakeholders. Our sustainability strategy is designed to 
meet the principles of the UN Global Compact, to which 
we signed up voluntarily in 2009. We comply with the Ten 
Principles relating to the environment, labour, human rights 
and anti-corruption, and participate in the UN Global 
Compact Network Russia.
Alongside our corporate values of dialogue, compliance, 
ethical conduct, fairness, stewardship and effectiveness, 
the Ten Principles help inform our sustainability policies. 
These are agreed by central management and implemented 
Group-wide, and we benchmark our performance against 
the most up-to-date regulatory requirements through regular 
monitoring and auditing.
Sustainability leadership
Ultimate responsibility for sustainability lies with our Board 
of Directors. Our Group CEO, Vitaly Nesis, oversees all local 
management decisions and processes, and sustainability 
performance reviews take place at Board meetings several 
times a year. The Board approves sustainability strategy 
initiatives and has final sign-off on our sustainability reports.
In 2015, we established our Safety and Sustainability 
Committee. This provides support to the Board by 
monitoring the Group’s safety record, sustainability 
performance and ethical conduct. The Committee oversees 
the Company’s overall approach to sustainability, developing 
and implementing short and long-term policies and 
standards. To address safety, the Committee has been 
working hard to implement major improvements to risk 
management procedures to achieve our goal of zero 
fatalities. The Committee measures the impact of our 
initiatives, and helps the Audit and Risk Committee identify, 
manage and mitigate sustainability risks.
Stakeholder engagement and materiality
It is important to understand our stakeholders’ perspectives 
on sustainability issues. We regularly carry out a ‘materiality 
assessment’ in accordance with GRI Standards, engaging 
with all stakeholders, including governments, organisations 
and local communities, our employees, suppliers, contractors, 
investors and financial institutions. This enables us to prioritise 
key sustainability risks.
Our 2017 assessment showed that both internal and external 
stakeholders care most about economic performance. 
Occupational health and safety, and emissions, effluents and 
waste are considered high priorities for investors, suppliers 
and contractors. However, employees and local residents 
ranked these lower. Environmental management and 
engaging with local communities were ranked highly by local 
communities, investors, offtakers and employees, while 
suppliers consider these medium priority issues – suppliers’ 
top concern is legal compliance. In 2018, we will evaluate the 
results of our assessment and ensure all priorities are being 
addressed effectively. 
Delivering economic sustainability
We deliver long-term value for shareholders, employees, 
partners and other stakeholders. Our operations also have 
a major positive impact on the economy - we contribute to 
regional sustainable economic progress by paying national 
and local taxes, employing local people wherever possible, 
and finding local or regional suppliers to buy from. This helps 
to improve standards of living for residents, further boosts 
local economies, and minimises the environmental impact 
of our supply chain. We also make social investments, 
helping to improve people’s livelihoods and strengthening 
our relationships with local communities. 
In our supply chain management, we ensure that our 
procedures are transparent, conditions are competitive, 
partnerships are fair, goods and services are delivered on 
time, suppliers are reliable, and all parties are fully compliant 
with applicable regulations. We use a business-to-business 
e-procurement system, which enables us to expand our list 
of contractors and make our processes more transparent 
and safe. Wherever  possible, we engage local and regional 
suppliers to help stimulate regional and national supply 
chains and economies.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 50 SUSTAINABILITY
PRIORITISING HEALTH AND SAFETY
We work hard to create a ‘zero harm’ mindset and culture. 
This means every employee taking personal responsibility  
not only for their own safety, but also for that of the people 
around them. We continually promote safety behaviours  
to ensure all our people and contractors work in a 
safe environment.
We comply fully with health and safety (H&S) legislation 
wherever we operate, and strive to meet all relevant 
international requirements. We communicate our Health and 
Safety Policy (available at www.polymetalinternational.com) 
to our employees and stakeholders through information 
boards, our internal newspaper and weekly Safety Day 
meetings. Every year, we work hard to ensure that our 
compliance with external certification OHSAS 18001 is 
re-affirmed for our Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System (OHSMS).
Our OHSMS guides us in detecting, assessing and mitigating 
risks, safeguarding employee health and workplace safety, 
and making sure that equipment, buildings and other 
structures are used safely. It also ensures that supervision 
measures are carefully controlled and that we conduct 
internal audits effectively.
Identifying risk management focus areas
Each year, we identify and assess risks across the Group 
and create risk maps for all our working processes and 
locations. We then develop detailed programmes to help 
us reduce these risks.
We recognise risks associated with each of our sites – 
in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Individual units  
across our production facilities, plants and mines which have 
been classified as ‘hazardous’ are all fully insured. Our primary 
focus is on reducing the level of the most significant risks at 
our underground operations. We carry out an annual 
qualitative hazardous risk assessment, and inform employees 
of the results through a range of communication channels.
In 2017 , we implemented our new Critical Risks Management 
(CRM) system, identifying critical risks for 2018. While the 
greatest hazards at our sites are from falling rock, road 
transportation accidents and falling (slipping), we have seen 
reduced exposure in the past year from these categories. 
We have upgraded the risk of fire to ‘critical’; controlling 
measures for flammable materials is a particular challenge.
To reduce the potential impact of critical risks at all our 
subsidiaries, our CRM includes a health and safety action 
plan for all critical risks. For each risk, we have identified five 
main directions of impact and at least two preventative 
actions for each direction of impact.
We follow a Shift Risk Assessment (SRA) model to raise 
employee awareness of workplace dangers, manage risks 
promptly and control the accuracy of our risk assessments. 
We implement the SRA most rigorously in hazardous 
operational areas, for example plant and power supply, 
automobile transport and mines.
Workplace accidents
Even when complying with the most stringent international 
standards and regulations as well as our safety management 
systems, unfortunately accidents can still happen. In recent 
years, the number of our underground mining operations 
has increased, with more complex and challenging 
geomechanical conditions. Despite more employees working 
in these conditions, and the increased number of production 
sites, we are encouraged that our Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (LTIFR) has declined from 0.19 to 0.15. While we are 
also encouraged that the overall number of fatalities in our 
operations has reduced by 50% in the past year, any fatality 
at Polymetal is one too many.
We are deeply concerned with the loss of two colleagues 
in 2017: one in a laboratory fire at Varvara, caused by a 
concentration of flammable substances, and the other from 
fatal injuries incurred from a rock fall during an inspection of 
underground mine at Omolon operation. We pay tribute to 
these colleagues’ hard work and dedication, and offer our 
condolences to their families and friends. We will continue to 
support their families financially and, most importantly, will do 
everything possible to return to our previous record of zero 
fatalities across all our operations. 
As a response, we have reviewed our internal safety 
guidelines and procedures regarding chemicals storage and 
checked our electrical equipment to ensure no further faults. 
We are helping our employees to better identify risks and 
effectively prevent any incidents in the future.
In 2017, there were also 14 non-fatal accidents in total 
(2016:15) across the Group. Most of these injuries 
occurred at sites where our CRM system had not been fully 
implemented and this is now an urgent priority. Our goal is 
for a zero-harm work culture: we will implement additional 
measures and devote significant resources to do all we can 
to prevent future accidents.
Analysis and response
To help us understand any weaknesses in our safety 
performance, we always investigate and analyse all 
workplace accidents. We apply the ‘5 Whys?’ principle to 
internal investigations, which we undertake in addition to 
investigations by state authorities. This process involves 
evaluating all possible health and safety risks – from 
technological and technical liabilities to employees’ 
psychological and emotional influences.
After thorough research and analysis, we draw 
comprehensive conclusions and implement measures to 
help prevent re-occurrence. We inform all employees and 
contractors of our findings and incorporate new measures 
into our health and safety action plan. In addition, we 
implement all recommendations by the state authorities. 
By implementing our health and safety action plan, we have 
been able to successfully transfer to our new CRM system. 
Overall, this new system has reduced injury risk and we hope 
will prevent repeat of past accidents in the future.
Engaging and training employees on safety
Training and engaging employees and contractors is 
essential to achieving our zero-harm goal. Polymetal’s 
Human Resources Management System sets out our 
procedures for recruitment and assigning employees with 
specific skills, as well as for providing training.
We clarify competence requirements for each relevant job 
description and heads of business units identify training 
needs. We provide training in occupational health, and 
industrial, electric and fire safety. We also provide refresher 
and training for specific purposes.
In 2017 , our employees and contractors attended safety 
refresher courses and some of those involved in dangerous 
works underwent mandatory safety training. To motivate 
employees about the importance of safety, we hold contests 
and reward departments that achieve zero occurrences and 
incidents. We also publish our ‘safety barometer’ in our 
corporate newspaper and on information desks and portals.
Occupational diseases
Three cases of occupational diseases and health difficulties 
were recorded in 2017 (two cases of silicosis and one of 
hearing loss) at our Dukat mine. Both employees had more 
than 15 years’ experience working in hazardous conditions, 
including chemicals, cold climate, noise, vibration, dust and 
hard physical work. Following these cases, one changed his 
role at Polymetal, and the other left the Company.

 Fatalities  Accidents    LTIFR PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT
Central to running a sustainable business is being mindful of 
environmental responsibility. Over the past two decades, our 
systems have been designed to protect both human health 
and the environment. We ensure that environmental aspects 
are taken into consideration when designing, constructing 
and operating our mines and processing facilities.
As with all mining companies, our work involves a number 
of environmental risks. Our Environmental Policy focuses on 
continuous improvement, risk reduction, best practice and 
compliance. It also covers managing key environmental 
issues, including incident and emergency control and the  
use of environmentally-friendly materials.
Our Group-wide Environmental Management System (EMS) 
helps us manage these risks, driving resource and energy 
efficiency across the business. In 2017 , we updated our EMS 
to the requirements of international standard ISO 14001:2015. 
All our production sites are certified for compliance with ISO 
14001:2006, and a certification audit of our updated system 
(since the 2015 version) will be held in 2018.
Water management
Efficient water management is a key concern among our 
stakeholders and vital to us as a business. We use water 
for industrial use, drinking and irrigation, and it is a major 
component in ore processing. Fortunately, our production 
sites are located in regions where there is no water shortage. 
Despite this, we aim to re-use as much water as possible 
and in 2017 we recycled 83% of process water (2016: 84%). 
We also work with local governments and stakeholders to 
protect water security in our host communities, often 
providing water and infrastructure through our operations.
Reducing our materials and waste
We are firmly committed to the responsible management of 
waste materials. Our audit teams carry out regular internal 
checks and assess our compliance with national and regional 
standards, and government agencies conduct regular 
environmental performance spot-checks at our facilities.
Overburden and tailings are the most significant waste 
streams associated with our operations, accounting for 
more than 99% of the total waste volume. During 2017 , we 
mined 12,589 Kt of ore and 114 Mt of waste, processed 
13,037 Kt of ore and generated 128 Mt of waste. (While more 
than in 2016, when we generated 74 Mt of waste, the volume 
of mining have increased). We now operate eight tailings 
facilities; there were no significant or major environmental 
accidents involving tailings facilities at our operations last year.
Cyanide and hazardous waste management
Our production methods involve several harmful consumables. 
Among these, the largest is cyanide, which generates 
hazardous waste during the recovery of gold from the ore we 
process. We are rigorous in our handling, management and 
monitoring of cyanide due to its hazardous potential. 
In 2016, we became signatories to the International Cyanide 
Management Code, followed by the certification of Amursk 
POX. At Polymetal, we used 8.9 thousand tonnes of cyanide 
in 2017. 
Energy and carbon management
The main sources of energy consumed at our sites include 
electricity, diesel fuel, natural gas and coal. Diesel fuel makes 
up a significant proportion of our total energy consumption, 
due to the remoteness of our sites and no proximity to 
industrial centres and centralised power supply systems. 
One of our priorities is to increase our energy efficiency.  
Our new Energy Management System has been developed 
in compliance with ISO-50001 and will be implemented 
across the Company in 2018. Following a feasibility study into 
alternative energy sources in 2017 , approval has been given 
for a solar power plant at Svetloye and a wind farm at the 
seaport of Unchi, with the aim of launching both during 2018.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Heat and electricity from our diesel generators, as well as 
our mining fleet operations, produce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. The burning of natural gas and coal and the use 
of landfill also contribute to our GHG footprint. We measure 
and monitor our CO2 emissions using established 
international methodology – our full Carbon Management 
Policy is on our website. In 2017 , we introduced a number 
of measures to reduce GHG emissions, including converting 
all lighting to LED, and equipping diesel-powered generators 
with a heat recovery system. We also began to develop our 
Climate Management System.

Protecting biodiversity
We are committed to treading lightly in the regions where 
we operate and work hard to minimise our impact on local 
biodiversity. We do not operate in or adjacent to protected 
or vulnerable areas or upon land that has particular value –
natural, historical or cultural – for Indigenous Minorities of the 
North (IMN). Due to the extreme northern location of most of 
our sites, the surrounding territory is low in conservational 
value. However, some sites are situated in the Russia’s Far 
East, which provides natural habitats for various rare and 
threatened or vulnerable plant and animal species. 
All our employees are involved in our biodiversity conservation 
programme and help with biodiversity monitoring. In addition, 
we insist that all site staff, including contractors, take part in 
environmental, health and safety awareness training to ensure 
that they understand their responsibilities. Our biodiversity 
assessment in 2017 concluded that with the exception of one 
endangered species, the Poiny flower identified at Kapan,  
there was no significant impact on biodiversity in or around 
our production sites.
Planning for mine closures and rehabilitation
As all sites will eventually deplete their mineral resource 
and ore reserves, it is essential that we plan responsibly 
for the end of each mine’s operational life. Our long-term 
remediation obligations include fulfilling decommissioning and 
restoration liabilities and covering suspension or 
abandonment costs in compliance with national regulations 
and legislation. In 2017 , we started developing our Corporate 
Mine Closure Standard, which will be implemented in 2018.
VALUING OUR PEOPLE
We want to attract the best people and ensure they are 
motivated to stay. So we strive to create a fair and inclusive 
environment, pay competitive salaries that benchmark well 
within the industry, offer equal terms of employment and 
reward performance. Through training, and skills and 
leadership development, we are creating our future  
business leaders.
We are fully compliant with national and international 
standards relating to staff and management, ensuring that 
our working environment is based on fairness and respect.
We expect all employees to comply with our Company Code 
of Conduct, which covers equality, health and safety, 
government and community relations, environmental 
protection, transparency, competition and data protection.  
It sets out our zero-tolerance approach to drug use, conflicts 
of interest, bribery and bullying. In accordance with our 
Human Rights Policy, and as signatories to the UN Global 
Compact, we are also committed to a zero-tolerance 
approach to human trafficking and modern slavery.
Anti-corruption
We work hard to raise awareness of bribery and corruption 
and its potential impact on our business. Across the Group, 
we have implemented measures and training to help prevent 
corruption and fraud among our employees, contractors 
and suppliers.
During the year, the instances of corruption identified within 
our business were limited to minor fraud, with no material 
impact on our operations or financial position. No court 
cases relating to corruption were brought against the 
Company or any of our employees.
Equal opportunities and diversity
We are committed to equal opportunities and terms of 
employment. We recruit people on merit and do not 
discriminate on any grounds, including gender, race, skin 
colour, religion, nationality, social origin and political opinions. 
In 2017 , no reported cases of discrimination were made 
within the Group.

We ensure equality in pay and provide equal levels of 
remuneration at positions with the same competence 
requirements for both male and female employees. We 
actively promote the inclusion of women in our workforce and 
leadership teams. At Polymetal, women are well represented 
in senior positions, particularly in administrative, social and 
communication professions, although the number is much 
lower in production, construction and geology. In 2017 , 
women occupied 24% of our management roles, and 
represented 22% of our total workforce (see the diagram

Fair employee relations
We have an excellent track record in regulating employee 
relations based on equality, consideration of mutual interests, 
strict compliance with local social and labour regulations, and 
constructive dialogue between partners on all social and 
labour issues. We support our employees’ rights to freedom 
of association and collective agreements. In 2017 , 89% of all 
our employees worldwide and 100% of personnel at our 
operating sites in Russia, Armenia and Kazakhstan were 
covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
All issues raised by employees through our internal 
communication systems are considered and investigated 
promptly. In 2017 , we received 1,001 queries via our various 
communication channels. The results of our employee survey 
show that 76% of employees are satisfied with our feedback 
system, and that meeting with the Company’s management 
is considered the most effective.
Headcount and turnover
At the end of 2017 , we employed 11,919 people (2016: 
11,261). The majority of our people work on a ‘fly-in/fly-out’ 
basis rather than permanent relocations, because of the 
demanding nature of the work and our remote site locations. 
Over the last seven years, we have been steadily reducing 
our average employee turnover rate (including fly-in/fly-out 
operations). In 2011, this rate was 19.6%, and in 2017 , 
the rate was just 5.4%. This achievement is partly attributable 
to a difficult macroeconomic environment, but also to our 
efforts to promote internal employee mobility, training and 
development, and favourable working conditions.
Investment in training and development
Training and development are critical to improving skills, 
keeping employees motivated and ensuring the future 
success of the Company. We invest in Group-wide training 
and development, as well as our Talent Pool to help develop 
the next generation of skilled managers. In 2017 , we invested 
US$1,474 thousand in professional training across the 
business – 70% more than in 2016. 
Our local stakeholders are key to our business success. 
We do everything we can to ensure that our work does 
not negatively impact our local communities, and that in 
fact we have a positive impact on them.
Our corporate standards and policies for community relations 
have been developed in line with international best practice 
and the conventions of the UN Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and the UN Global Compact. 
Community engagement
Our dedicated teams oversee our community investment and 
engagement programmes. We communicate about 
our activities through our Community Engagement System 
(CES) and encourage local stakeholders to give us their 
feedback. In 2017 , we held 37 meetings (2016: 32), public 
gatherings and hearings for local community members and 
IMN. We also organised 20 site visits (2016: 15) for members 
of the public and community representatives.
Each time we invest in a new mining site or project, we 
assess the social and economic risks and impacts that our 
activities may have at local and regional level, We develop 
long-term strategies and engage with local communities, 
institutions, authorities and organisations to ensure we deliver 
maximum value to local people. In 2017 , we began a dialogue 
with the community of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), our 
newest region of operation. 
Assessing our impact
We conduct community polls and hold annual performance 
review meetings with stakeholders to evaluate the social 
and economic performance of our projects. This provides 
communities with the opportunity to participate directly in the 
development and monitoring of our social programmes – 
and helps us respond flexibly to changing situations. In 2017 , 
we conducted polls in eleven districts and discussed various 
issues involving 726 people with our assessments showing no 
negative impacts from our operations.
Positive impacts included tax payments, support of 
infrastructure and auxiliary industries, environmental 
protection and ecological projects, regional population 
increase due to industrial growth, local employment 
opportunities, and social investment and community support. 
During 2017 , we constructed or upgraded 100 socially 
significant institutions (2016: 50), including kindergartens, 
schools, health centres, and sport and culture centres in 
host communities in new and remote areas. 
Our commitment to social investment
We discuss community needs and decide investment 
priorities with local stakeholders. In 2017 , we invested more 
than US$11.7 million in local communities; our investment 
over the last five years exceeded US$30 million. We focus on 
projects involving sport, healthcare and education, 
infrastructure, culture and creative potential, Indigenous 
Minorities of the North (IMN) and environmental protection. 
We made charitable donations worth US$187 ,243 as well 
as ‘in-kind’ donations, including humanitarian aid to reindeer 
herders (food, fuel and medicines); delivery of food and 
medicine to remote communities and IMN; and construction 
and maintenance of roads in remote areas.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 57
POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 56 FINANCIAL REVIEW
I am pleased to report robust earnings for 
the year. The Group continued to deliver 
positive free cash flow and generate 
meaningful cash returns to our shareholders.
Financial highlights
• In 2017 , revenue increased by 15% over 2016 to  
US$1,815 million, primarily driven by gold equivalent (GE) 
production growth of 13%. Gold sales were 1,090 Koz,  
up 24% year-on-year, while silver sales were down 14%  
to 26.5 Moz, in line with production volume dynamics. 
Average realised gold and silver prices remained largely 
unchanged from 2016 at US$1,247/oz and US$16.1/oz, 
respectively.
• Group Total cash costs
1
 (TCC) were US$658/GE oz for 
the year, up 15% from 2016 levels and at the lower end of 
the Company’s updated guidance of US$650-675/GE oz. 
The increase in TCC was predominantly driven by the 
strengthening of the Russian Rouble (by 15% from an 
average rate of 67.1 RUB/USD in 2016 to 58.3 RUB/USD in 
2017) on the back of the recent oil-price rally and stabilising 
macroeconomic conditions in Russia. All-in sustaining 
cash costs
1
 (AISC) amounted to US$893/GE oz, also 
within the Company’s updated guidance, an increase of 
15% year-on-year, driven mostly by the same factors, 
as well as significantly increased exploration spending 
across the portfolio.
• Adjusted EBITDA
1
 was US$745 million, down 2% 
compared with 2016, as increased costs incurred due to 
a stronger Russian Rouble largely offset the production 
growth. The Adjusted EBITDA margin was at 41% 
compared with 48% in 2016.
• Net earnings
2
 were US$354 million versus US$395 
million in the prior year, reflecting the decrease in EBITDA 
and the impact of foreign exchange gains on 2016 
earnings. Underlying net earnings
1
 were US$376 million  
(2016: US$382 million). 
• Capital expenditure came in at US$383 million
3
, 
up 41% compared with 2016 due to accelerated  
pre-stripping and construction at Kyzyl, as well as an 
increased spend on brownfield exploration across the 
operating assets portfolio. The Group is on track with the 
commissioning of Kyzyl and the ramp-up of the 
debottlenecked POX plant in the second half of 2018.
• Net debt
1
 increased to US$1,420 million during the period 
(31 December 2016: US$1,330 million), representing a 
Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.91x. Despite intensive 
construction activities at Kyzyl in the course of 2017 , 
the Company continued to generate meaningful free cash 
flow
1
 that amounted to US$143 million (2016: US$257 
million), while maintaining a stable net cash operating 
inflow of US$533 million (2016: US$530 million). 
• A final dividend of US$0.30 per share (approximately 
US$129 million), representing 50% of the Group’s 
underlying net earnings for the second half of 2017 ,  
has been proposed by the Board in accordance with the 
revised dividend policy and in compliance with the hard 
ceiling of Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio below 2.5x. 
This will bring the total dividend declared for the period  
to US$189 million.

Market summary
Please see the market overview on pages 20-21.
Foreign exchange
The Group’s revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Group’s 
operating costs are denominated in Russian Roubles. As a result, changes in exchange rates affect its financial results 
and performance. 
For the Russian economy as a whole, 2017 proved to be a year of moderate improvement as oil continued the positive 
price momentum it gained in 2016, finishing the year at US$60 per barrel. At the same time, the Russian Rouble appreciated 
15% year-on-year from an average of 67.1 RUB/USD in 2016 to 58.3 RUB/USD in 2017 , while the spot rate as at 31 December 
2017 appreciated by 5% to 57.6 RUB/USD compared with 31 December 2016. However, this trend had a negative impact on 
the mining sector, resulting in increased Dollar value of the Group’s Rouble-denominated operating costs and lower Adjusted 
EBITDA margins in the reported period. 
The economics of Kazakh gold mining operations were also impacted by a moderate strengthening of the Kazakh Tenge  
(up 5% year-on-year, from 342 KZT/USD in 2016 to 326 KZT/USD in 2017). The Armenian Dram remains the most stable 
currency in the Former Soviet Union region with an average exchange rate of 484 AMD/USD in 2017  
(2016: 480 AMD/USD).

The total cost of sales increased by 31% in 2017 to US$1,106 million, mainly on the back of a negative effect from the Russian 
Rouble appreciating 15% compared with 2016, combined with a volume-based increase in production and sales (13% and 
12% year-on-year in gold equivalent terms, respectively), as well as a significant increase in purchases of third-party ore and 
concentrate at Varvara and Amursk.
Compared with 2016, the cost of services and the cost of consumables and spare parts increased by 33% and 21%, 
respectively, driven by the higher gold equivalent production coupled with a stronger Russian Rouble.

In 2017 , revenues grew by 15% over 2016 to US$1,815 million, primarily driven by gold equivalent production growth of 13%.  
The average realised gold and silver prices were largely unchanged compared with the prior year period. Gold sales volumes 
increased by 24% year-on-year, while silver sales volumes decreased by 14% in line with production dynamics. 
The average realised price of gold was US$1,247/oz in 2017 , up 3% from US$1,216/oz in 2016, and slightly below the average 
market price of US$1,258/oz. The average realised silver price was US$16.1/oz, down 1% year-on-year and 6% below the 
average market price of US$17.0/oz as the bulk of Polymetal’s sales were recorded in the second half of 2017 when the silver 
market prices were lower.
The share of gold sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from 68% in 2016 to 75% in 2017 , driven by sales 
volume movements.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 60 FINANCIAL REVIEW
The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2017 was US$183 million, a 24% increase over 2016, mainly stemming 
from additional labour costs at the new Kapan, Komar and Svetloye operations and annual salary increases (tracking 
domestic CPI inflation). 
Mining tax increased by 7% year-on-year to US$88 million as production increased by 13%, and was mainly driven by 
regional tax incentives introduced in the Russian Far East and utilised at Dukat, Omolon and Svetloye. 
Depreciation and depletion was US$193 million, up 19% year-on-year and largely driven by the negative effect of a stronger 
Russian Rouble with one specific increase attributable to Varvara where the depreciation of mineral rights for the new 
Komar asset has started.
In 2017 , a net metal inventory increase of US$26 million was recorded (excluding write-downs to net realisable value)  
mainly represented by gold and silver concentrate produced but not yet sold at Dukat and Albazino. In the second half 
of the year, the Company successfully completed scheduled stockpile reductions, with total gold equivalent sales 
exceeding production by 42 Koz. De-stockpiling was mainly driven by concentrate shipments from Mayskoye and 
seasonal de-stockpiling at Svetloye.

Other operating expenses increased by 22% from US$36 million in 2016 to US$44 million in 2017. Written-off exploration 
expenses during the period increased by 80% to US$18 million. Cash-based exploration expenses in 2017 were  
US$16 million (2016: US$11 million). 
Social payments totalled US$15 million, up 50% year-on-year. The increase was mostly attributable to the financing of  
social and infrastructure development projects at Kyzyl and the start of a social development programme at Kapan.
During 2017 , the Group released US$6 million of accrued penalties and interest due to settlements with tax authorities  
at Kapan and paid US$6 million in relation to royalty provisions identified as of 31 December 2016. There were no  
other significant changes in tax provisions. For more information refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.

Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory to net realisable value and 
certain other adjustments) and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices 
in the relevant period. Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as Total cash costs divided by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold.
11 
Dukat’s total cash cost per gold equivalent was US$646/GE oz (2016: US$494/GE oz) and was included in the Group TCC calculation. 
In 2017 , total cash costs (TCC) per gold equivalent ounce sold were US$658/GE oz, up 15% year-on-year. The continuing 
appreciation of the Russian Rouble against the US Dollar had a negative impact on cost levels reported in US Dollars, 
which was partially offset by the robust operating performance at Varvara (Komar), Svetloye and Kapan.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure of the Company’s operating performance and cash generation capacity (excluding impact of financing, depreciation and tax) and a key industry 
benchmark allowing to perform peer comparison. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of certain accounting adjustments (mainly non-cash items) that can mask underlying 
changes in core operating performance.
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, write-downs and reversals of inventory to 
net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, bad debt allowance, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in fair value of contingent 
consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expense and other tax exposures accrued within other operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted 
EBITDA divided by revenue.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Total cash cost (TCC) by operation: 
• Dukat’s TCC per silver equivalent ounce sold (‘SE oz’) increased by 28% year-on-year to US$8.2/SE oz.  
In addition to Russian Rouble appreciation, the cost increase is attributable to the planned silver grade decline at  
Dukat and Lunnoye underground mines.
• At Voro, TCC increased by 19% year-on-year to US$383/GE oz, which is largely attributable to a stronger Russian Rouble. 
At the same time, the heap leach facility and CIP plant continued to deliver a stable performance in line with the mine plan.
• At Okhotsk, TCC was US$702/GE oz, an 8% increase year-on-year, which is below the Russian Rouble appreciation 
during the year and was offset by third-party ore with better metallurgical properties that was introduced to the feed at  
the Khakanja plant in 2017. 
• Svetloye was the lowest cost operation in 2017 , with TCC of US$313/GE oz, 25% lower than in 2016 as it ramped-up 
to full capacity and achieved positive mine-to-model grade reconciliations.
• At Varvara, TCC was US$701/GE oz, declining by 10% year-on-year. The decrease mainly stemmed from significantly 
improved head grades at the leaching circuit, enabled by the quick ramp-up in ore railed from Komar that is displacing 
lower grade ore from Varvara. 
• At Omolon, TCC amounted to US$652/GE oz, a 30% increase year-on-year, driven by the strengthening of the Russian 
Rouble. The costs in the second half of 2016 were also positively impacted by processing high-grade ore from Oroch. 
• At Albazino/Amursk, TCC was US$676/GE oz, up 28% compared with 2016. The cost increase was mostly attributable 
to a seven-week maintenance and retrofit shutdown in May plus an additional 15-day maintenance shutdown in Q4,  
as well as processing of higher cost third-party concentrate.
• TCC at Mayskoye were US$1,040/GE oz, a 3% increase year-on-year and below the Russian Rouble appreciation,  
as the underground operation ramped-up and the production profile was supported by the crown pillar open-pit project.
• Kapan’s TCC were US$871/GE oz, improved by 3% year-on year thanks to the operational and financial turnaround and 
the ongoing improvement measures to debottleneck the underground mine, while there were purchases of higher cost 
third-party material in order to utilise available capacity at the processing plant.

All-in sustaining cash costs comprise total cash costs, all selling, general and administrative expenses for operating mines and head office not included in TCC (mainly represented 
by head office SG&A), other expenses (excluding write-offs and non-cash items, in line with the methodology used for calculation of Adjusted EBITDA), and current period capex 
for operating mines (i.e. excluding new project capex (‘Development capital’), but including all exploration expenditure (both expensed and capitalised in the period) and minor 
brownfield expansions).
All-in sustaining cash costs amounted to US$893/GE oz in 2017 and increased by 15% year-on-year, driven mostly by the 
increase in TCC as a result of the continued strengthening of the Russian Rouble, as well as increased exploration spending 
across the portfolio.

In 2017 , Adjusted EBITDA was US$745 million, down 2% year-on-year, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%.  
The decrease was mainly driven by a 15% increase in TCC, which was to a large extent offset by 13% growth in GE 
production. At Omolon, Svetloye, Varvara, Mayskoye and Kapan, Adjusted EBITDA increased on the back of a strong 
operating performance, offsetting the negative impact of an appreciating Russian Rouble. Across other operating mines, 
Adjusted EBITDA declined year-on-year.
Other income statement items
Polymetal recorded a net foreign exchange loss in 2017 of US$10 million compared with a gain of US$65 million in 2016.  
These unrealised non-cash forex gains and losses recorded in both periods are mainly comprised of the revaluation of  
US-Dollar-denominated borrowings of Russian operating companies, where the functional currency is the Russian Rouble.  
The Group’s average gross debt during 2017 was US$1,417 million, mostly denominated in US Dollars, while the RUB/USD 
exchange rate decreased from 60.7 RUB/USD as at 31 December 2016 to 57 .6 RUB/USD as at 31 December 2017 . 
The Company does not use any hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange risk, other than a natural hedge arising 
from the fact that the majority of the Group’s revenue is denominated or calculated in US Dollars. Though income statement 
volatility may arise in financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against debt 
repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.
Income tax expense for 2017 was US$89 million compared with US$169 million in 2016. The decrease was mainly 
attributable to the effect of regional tax incentives applied by operations in the Russian Far East, most notably Svetloye,  
Dukat and Omolon. For details refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.
Net earnings, earnings per share and dividends
The Group recorded a net income of US$354 million in 2017 versus US$395 million in 2016. Underlying net earnings 
(excluding after-tax impact of write-down of metal inventory to net realisable value, foreign exchange gains/losses and  
change in fair value of contingent consideration liability) were US$376 million, compared with US$382 million in 2016.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 66 Total operating cash flows in 2017 remained stable compared with the prior year. Operating cash flows before changes  
in working capital grew by 8% year-on-year to US$601 million mainly as a result of a decrease in cash tax payments.  
Net operating cash flows were US$533 million, compared with US$530 million in 2016. This was also affected by an increase  
in working capital in 2017 of US$68 million. 
Total cash and cash equivalents decreased by 25% compared with 2016 and comprised US$36 million, with the following 
items affecting the cash position of the Group:
• operating cash flows of US$533 million;
• investment cash outflows totalled US$477 million, up 19% year-on-year and mainly represented by capital expenditure  
(up 41% year-on-year to US$383 million), cash investments in new assets (namely, Nezhda US$20 million, Prognoz  
US$5 million, Kapan US$5 million) and loans advanced on capital expenditure at growth projects (Nezhda and Prognoz 
totalling US$52 million);
• payment of regular dividends for 2016 and the first half of 2017 amounting to US$138 million; and
• the net increase in borrowings of US$76 million.

The Group’s net debt increased to US$1,420 million as of 31 December 2017 , representing a Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA  
ratio of 1.91x.
The proportion of long-term borrowings comprised 98% as at 31 December 2017 (93% as at 31 December 2016).  
In addition, as at 31 December 2017 , the Group had US$1.4 billion (31 December 2016: US$1.0 billion) of available  
undrawn facilities, of which US$1.3 billion is committed from a wide range of lenders, that maintain its operational flexibility  
in the current environment.  
The average cost of debt remained low at 3.96% in 2017 (2016: 4.33%), supported by low base interest rates and the 
ability to negotiate competitive margins given the solid financial position of the Company and its excellent credit history. 
The Group is confident in its ability to repay its existing borrowings as they fall due. 
2018 outlook
While we recognise that our financial performance remains contingent on commodity prices and the Rouble/Dollar exchange 
rate dynamic, which has a significant effect on the Group’s operating costs, Polymetal expects to deliver a robust financial 
and operating performance in our first year of production from Kyzyl:
• The Company reconfirms its production guidance for 2018 and 2019 of 1.55 Moz and 1.7 Moz of gold equivalent, 
respectively. 
• TCC in 2018 are expected to be in the range of US$650-700/GE oz while AISC are expected to average US$875-925/GE oz 
on the back of anticipated rising domestic diesel prices and expected strengthening of the Russian rouble. 
• The capital expenditure in 2018 is expected to be slightly lower compared with 2017 at roughly US$400 million. Significant 
investments will be directed towards the completion of the Kyzyl and POX debottlenecking projects. The Company also 
plans to advance feasibility studies for Nezhda and POX-2 projects. Exploration spending is expected to stay elevated as 
Polymetal will continue its aggressive drilling campaign at the Prognoz silver project.
• As a result, the Company expects to continue to deliver positive free cash flow and prioritise dividends in our capital 
allocation process in 2018.
Maxim Nazimok
Chief Financial Officer
The major capital expenditure items in 2017 were as follows:
• At all operating mines except for Albazino/Amursk, Kapan and Varvara, capital expenditures declined or remained almost 
unchanged year-on-year beyond the effect of Russian Rouble appreciation, and were mainly represented by routine mining 
fleet upgrades/replacements and maintenance expenditure at processing facilities.
• Capital expenditure at Albazino/Amursk was US$62 million, almost a two-fold increase year-on-year, mostly related to the 
POX debottlenecking project in the amount of US$40 million during 2017 (planned to reach full expanded capacity in the 
second half of 2018), underground engineering and other technical re-equipment, as well as the construction of the second 
tailings storage.
• US$24 million was invested at Kapan, mostly related to purchases of underground mining equipment and near-mine 
exploration, including drilling at Lichkvaz, as well as a number of initiatives to improve safety and reduce the environmental 
footprint of operations (centralised the mine ventilation, tailings storage facility upgrade, water treatment and recycling facilities).
• At Varvara, the increased capital expenditure is mainly related to debottlenecking of the railway station for cargo 
acceptance and purchases of railway carriages to allow transportation of larger volumes of ores from Komar and third 
parties, technical re-equipment and reconstruction of the tailing storage.
• At Kyzyl, capital expenditure in 2017 comprised US$116 million, mainly representing the main concentrator building,  
ore-preparation complex (the crusher, conveyor gallery and apron feeder), tailings storage facility, electric shovels, 
mechanical and repair shop and purchases of mining machinery, as well as capitalised pre-stripping of US$31 million.
• The Company invests in standalone exploration projects. Capital expenditures for exploration in 2017 was US$58 million 
compared with US$37 million in 2016.
• Capitalised stripping costs totalled US$28 million in 2017 (2016: US$10 million) and are attributable to operations with 
stripping ratios exceeding their life-of-mine (LOM) averages during the period, in particular Albazino (US$9 million),  
Varvara (US$6 million) and Omolon (US$6 million).

Risk identification and documentation 
Risk awareness is embedded within the Group and is 
grounded in our strong ethical values and pro-active 
corporate culture. Our risk management philosophy 
is cascaded top down  from the Company’s Board 
of Directors and runs through all our management, 
employee and connected stakeholder activities – 
from developing strategy to day-to-day operations.
Our policy is to identify and assess risks at the 
earliest possible stage and to implement an 
appropriate risk response and internal controls in 
advance. Our risk management procedures are 
designed to delegate the responsibility for risk 
identification while avoiding gaps and duplications. 
Risk identification requirements are also taken into 
account in the design of accounting and 
documentation systems in order to be able to identify 
and process information on potential risk triggers. 
Polymetal’s risk identification system considers not 
only single, mutually exclusive risks, but also multiple 
linked and correlated risks.
Risk assessment 
Once identified, potential risk factors are 
assessed to consider the quantitative and 
qualitative impact that they might have on the 
business and the likelihood of the event (see 
table below). Together these create a risk profile.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors risk 
KPIs for all principal risks a three times a year. 
Risk matrices and assurance maps are used to 
record, prioritise and track each risk through the 
risk management process. These are reviewed 
regularly by the Audit and Risk Committee.
Development and implementation 
of risk mitigation strategies 
When the appropriate ranking has been identified, 
a response to each risk is formulated and 
implemented. Management assesses the effects 
of a risk’s likelihood and impact, as well as the 
costs and benefits of possible mitigating actions.  
A response is then determined and implemented 
to bring the risk within acceptable tolerance levels.
Monitoring and reporting 
Ongoing monitoring processes are embedded in 
Polymetal’s business operations. These track the 
effective application of internal control and risk 
management policies and procedures, including 
internal audit and specific management reviews. 
Risk matrices and assurance maps are used to 
re-evaluate and adjust controls in response to 
changes in the Company’s objectives, its 
business and the external environment.
Management is responsible for the 
implementation of effective follow-up procedures 
to ensure appropriate actions occur in response 
to changes in risk and control assessments.
Companies in the mining sector are challenged with 
managing a rapidly changing risk landscape, including 
market volatility, widespread macroeconomic changes, 
geopolitical crises and environmental risks. Rigorous risk 
management is essential to the achievement of our strategic 
objectives and sustainable value creation and continues to 
remain a key part of our business model. We are committed 
to minimising risks to all our stakeholders through accurate 
and timely risk identification and effective mitigation activities.
Risk management framework
At Polymetal, we maintain a robust and sustainability-
conscious risk management framework, which ensures that 
risks are properly identified, assessed against tolerance levels 
and appropriately managed across the Group. Our risk 
management system is designed to minimise the potential 
threats to achieving our strategic objectives and the process 
is underpinned by a bottom-up approach and examined from 
a top-down perspective, ensuring adequate involvement of 
the Board and executive management and alignment with 
the Company’s strategy.
The global and local markets, in which we operate, remain 
volatile with shifting commodity prices and exchange rates, 
macroeconomic instability and unpredictable climatic 
conditions. The Board is responsible for carrying out a 
thorough assessment of the key risks facing the Company, 
including those threatening stakeholders, values, business 
model, operations, social and environmental issues, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. On behalf of the Board, 
the Audit and Risk Committee reviews the effectiveness of 
the risk management process and develops and oversees 
implementation of risk management strategies. The Safety 
and Sustainability Committee measures the impact of the 
Company’s initiatives and helps the Audit and Risk 
Committee to manage sustainability risks. The Audit and 
Risk Committee is supported by Group Internal Audit to 
enable effective risk identification, evaluation and mitigation 
process across the Company. Further information on the 
Board and its Committees is given in the Governance section 
on pages 81 to 87.
The principal risks identified during the process form the 
Group’s principal risk profile, which is reviewed and approved 
by the Audit and Risk Committee three times a year. The 
potential impact of principal risks and the availability and 
effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could be taken to 
avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying 
risks are carefully considered during the annual assessment 
of future prospects and long-term viability of the Group. 
Further detail on our approach to assessing long-term 
viability can be found on page 112. 
Risk management and internal control systems are 
continuously enhanced in accordance with COSO ERM 
framework and are adjusted for any changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. They are also regularly 
reviewed to incorporate global best practice and add  
value to our business.

Set out below are the Group’s principal risks and related 
mitigation strategies. Principal business risks are identified  
by the Board based on a detailed understanding of the 
Company, its markets and the legal, social, political, 
economic, technological, environmental and cultural 
environments in which we operate, and robust assessment 
of the likelihood of occurrence and potential consequences 
of risk event. For the current reporting period, we validated 
the continued importance of our 12 principal risks and our 
risk profile remains stable relative to last year.
Risk description 
and potential effect
Risk response Risk  
level
1. MARKET RISK Link to strategy: Deliver robust operating and financial performance 
Gold and silver price volatility  
may result in material and 
adverse movements in the 
Company’s operating results, 
revenues and cash flows.
The Company has developed and implemented procedures to ensure consistent cash flow generation 
at operating mines, including:
• redistribution of ore feedstock between deposits within a hub to achieve higher margins due to better 
grade profile, better logistics or less expensive mining methods;
• deferring the start of production while continuing ore stacking to achieve better cost profiles due to 
positive effects of scale;
• managing the volume of third-party ore purchases;
• staffing level review and hiring freeze; and
• asset-level cost-cutting.
Reserve and resource prices, as well as cut-off grades, are reviewed at least annually to 
conservatively reflect the prevailing commodity price levels. Short-, medium- and long-term life-of-
mine plans are adjusted as appropriate.
Stress testing for these conservative price assumptions is performed to ensure resilience of the 
operating mines in a stress scenario and continued value creation. Contingency action plans have  
been developed to address performance in a stress scenario.
While precious metals prices remain volatile, the measures taken by the Company ensure that each 
operating mine remains cash flow positive. The Company will continue with this approach.
Currently, the Group does not hedge its commodity price exposure since its strategy is to offer 
stakeholders full exposure to the potential upside of gold and silver pricing.
2. PRODUCTION RISK Link to strategy: Deliver robust operating and financial performance
The risk of failure to meet 
the planned production 
programme. Failure to meet 
production targets may adversely 
affect operating performance and 
the financial results of the Group. 
The key sources of risk may 
include:
• inability to achieve volume, 
grade or recovery assumed  
nlife-of-mine plans;
• failure of supply chains to 
procure complex logistics  
to remote locations;
• failure to retain key employees 
or to recruit new staff; and
• failure of contractors to  
meet required performance 
standards.
 • Inability to achieve volume, grade or recovery assumed in life-of-mine plans
Annual, quarterly and monthly production budgeting and subsequent monthly control against budget 
is designed to mitigate the risk. The effectiveness and efficiency of the production process is ensured 
by the Group’s engineering team senior management. An approved production programme includes 
increased volume of operational prospecting works, such as in-fill drilling and grade control sampling. 
To mitigate the risk, the Group invests considerable amounts in ore quality assessment procedures 
and seeks to control ore quality by separate stockpiling of ore with the required characteristics.
 • Failure of supply chains to procure complex logistics to remote locations
The Group has implemented and constantly improves the supply chain system to closely link the 
production demand of resources with inventory levels, optimise the number of order placements 
and ensure the in-time inventory and equipment delivery to production sites.
 • Failure to retain key employees or to recruit new staff
Remuneration policies are designed to incentivise, motivate and retain key employees. There is an 
increased focus on health and safety – refer to pages 52-53 of this report. There is an active 
promotion of a positive corporate culture within the Group.
 • Failure of contractors to meet required performance standards
The contractors’ performance control system is designed, implemented and applied.

3. CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT RISK Link to strategy: Deliver medium-term growth
Inability to achieve target return on capital  
for large investment projects, such as building 
new mines and processing facilities or 
extension/refurbishment of existing operating 
mines, due to delay in commissioning or 
capital expenditure overruns. This may have  
a negative impact on the Group’s financial 
performance and cash flows.
The Company applies global best practices in project management. The Group’s 
technical personnel are in charge of the project’s capital expenditure, including project 
support, supply chain management and permitting process. A significant share of 
projects is developed by the in-house engineering company, Polymetal Engineering, 
which has vast experience and a successful track record of design and ramp up of 
mines and processing facilities. We are continuously improving our construction risk 
management systems and employ leading world-class consultants in applicable areas.
4. TAX RISK Link to strategy: Deliver robust operating and financial performance
Due to frequent changes in tax legislation in 
Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia, lack of 
established practices in tax law means that 
additional costs such as taxes or penalties 
may occur. The taxation risk level correlates 
with the legal and political risks levels. 
Multinational companies will continue to be 
subject to considerable public scrutiny across 
the world within the BEPS (Base Erosion and 
Profit Shifting) action plan.
The Group’s policy is to comply fully with the requirements of applicable tax laws, 
providing adequate controls over tax accounting and tax reporting.
Nevertheless, the ongoing changes to Russian, Kazakh and Armenian tax legislation, 
and evolving practice of application of these laws in courts, could lead to tax disputes 
and potential additional tax liabilities.
The Group regularly evaluates its tax positions to ensure they are adequately reflected in 
the consolidated financial statements. To date, the Group is not aware of any significant 
outstanding tax claims, which could lead to additional taxes accrued in the future  
(except for amounts already booked or disclosed in the Group’s financial statements).
The Group is continuously monitoring its tax strategies and tax structures to comply  
with the new landscape created by BEPS without suffering unwarranted disruptions  
in business operations or incurring excessive tax costs.
5. EXPLORATION RISK Link to strategy: Build and advance long-term growth pipeline
Exploration and development are time and 
capital-intensive activities and may involve  
high degrees of risk but are necessary  
for the future growth of the business.  
Failure to discover new reserves of sufficient 
magnitudecould adversely affect the 
Company’s future performance.
Risk and uncertainty are inherent for exploration and development activities.
The Group invests considerable amounts in key exploration projects to obtain sufficient 
information about the quantity and quality of new reserves and to estimate expected 
cash flows. The Group’s Chief Geologist and engineering teams have a strong track 
record of successful greenfield and brownfield exploration, leading to the subsequent 
development of exploration fields into commercial production.
6. HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK Link to strategy: Maintain high standards of governance and sustainable development
The Group operates potentially hazardous  
sites such as open-pits, underground mines, 
exploration sites, processing facilities and 
explosive storage facilities. The operation  
of these sites exposes our personnel to  
a variety of health and safety risks.
A control system covering occupational and industrial safety in the Company is in place, 
including risk assessment of individual work places and the use of safety equipment 
for the protection of personnel.
The Company has reinforced the need for individual responsibility for personal safety 
and risk awareness, and developed additional security measures to ensure strict 
compliance with safety requirements by employees.
The Group’s general approach to this risk is determined by the Group’s Health and 
Safety Policy, which serves as the basis for the Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System (OHSMS). The Group adopts the industry’s global best practice 
in managing these risks and ensuring safe working conditions for our employees. 
Our OHSMS ensures compliance with international, national and local regulatory 
requirements and is based on modern standards. It is also certified in accordance 
with the OHSAS 18001.
The Group has strong safety procedures across all its operating mines and has 
implemented additional measures to ensure proper enforcement of these stricter safety 
standards. We have intensified training programmes, with a particular focus on high-risk 
functions, and implemented a number of other measures, including a change of 
underground mining methods at certain sites. We are continuing to conduct a detailed 
review of the source of injuries and are further improving the shift risk assessment 
system, as well as conducting an external audit of our health and safety system.

7. ENVIRONMENT RISK Link to strategy: Maintain high standards of governance and sustainable development
Major pollution arising from operations include: 
deforestation, air and water pollution, land 
contamination. Potential impacts include fines 
and penalties, statutory liability for 
environmental redemption and other financial 
consequences that might be significant.
The Company operates a certified environmental management system which meets 
international standards and is audited for compliance.
The Company has implemented a number of initiatives to monitor and limit the impact of 
its operations on the environment, including external expert assessment of the pollution 
generated and adopting industry best practice for corporate and mine level policies 
and procedures.
8. LEGAL RISK Link to strategy: Maintain high standards of governance and sustainable development
Operating in developing countries, such as 
Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia, involves the 
risk that changes in tax and other legislation 
may occur from time to time.
The most sensitive areas are regulation of 
foreign investments, private property, 
environmental protection and taxation.
In recent years, the governments of Russia and 
Kazakhstan have become more consistent 
regarding the introduction of new regulations 
and taxes, demonstrating an awareness of 
investment climate issues. However, in the 
application of existing legislation requiring 
interpretation, courts often uphold the more 
assertive position of the tax authorities, which 
does not always coincide with the 
Company’s position.
As a result of changes in laws and regulations, 
certain types of transactions and technologies 
may become unavailable to the Group or the 
costs of compliance may be increased.
Polymetal has a successful track record of operating in Russian, Kazakh and, more 
recently, Armenian jurisdictions, having developed its own expertise in corporate, tax, 
licensing and other legal areas.
Corporate and operating management teams are responsible for meeting the legal 
requirements in their operating activities. Head office and on-site legal teams guarantee 
appropriate controls over compliance issues.
The Group’s policy is to ensure strict legal compliance in all jurisdictions where Group 
companies operate. The Group’s financial and legal teams monitor current legislation and 
proposed changes, and incorporate these into the practice, involving leading external 
experts where appropriate.
9. POLITICAL RISK Link to strategy: Maintain high standards of governance and sustainable development
Operating in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia 
involves some risk of political instability, which 
may include changes in government, negative 
policy shifts and civil unrest.
Financial and economic sanctions imposed  
in 2014-2017 by the United States and the 
European Union on certain businesses 
and individuals in Russia increased political 
tensions and economic instability; there is a risk 
that further sanctions could impact the Group’s 
ability to operate in Russia.
Russia’s complex relations with the 
United States and European Union,  
as well as its involvement in conflicts  
in the Middle East, may potentially present  
a risk to Group’s operations.
In addition, there is a risk that due to the 
deterioration of the macroeconomic situation, 
governments in Russia, Kazakhstan and 
Armenia may consider imposing currency 
controls and limitations on capital flows.
These factors are not expected to affect the 
Group’s operating performance, yet may have  
a negative impact on the ability of the Group  
to secure external financing.
These factors may have an adverse  
effect on the Group’s market value and 
operating environment.
The Group actively monitors political developments on an ongoing basis. We aim to 
maintain open working relationships with local authorities in the countries where 
we operate.
Sanctions imposed on Russian individuals and businesses in 2014-2017 have not 
currently had any direct influence on the Group’s operations. However, at the same time, 
to a limited extent they have affected both the macroeconomic situation in Russia and 
interest rates for borrowings.

level
10. CURRENCY RISK Link to strategy: Deliver robust operating and financial performance
The risk arises from Company’s receipts  
from metal sales and foreign currency 
denominated debt, as well as the foreign 
currency denominated cost of imported  
capital goods and consumables.
Natural hedging is used to reduce the risk exposure: revenue is matched with  
US Dollar denominated debt.
Flexible budgeting is used to monitor the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the 
Group’s financial results. The Group has determined critical exchange rates levels  
for its operations and is monitoring risk against these levels.
During 2017 there was moderate volatility of the Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge 
exchange rates against foreign currencies. The Company believesthat critical  
devaluation of these currencies is unlikely. The Armenian Dram was stable during 2017.
11. LIQUIDITY RISK Link to strategy: Deliver robust operating and financial performance
The inability to raise sufficient funds to meet 
current operating or ongoing financial needs  
or to develop new projects and growth.
Inadequate cash management in terms of 
cash flow forecast, available resources and 
future requirements.
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for ensuring that there are sufficient funds 
in place, including loan facilities, cash flow from operating activities and cash on hand 
to meet shortterm business requirements. Long-term credit lines and borrowings are 
used to finance new projects and organic growth.
The Group ensures that significant undrawn committed facilities are in place to cover 
any funding gaps.
12. INTEREST RATE RISK Link to strategy: Deliver robust operating and financial performance 
The Group is exposed to the interest rate risk 
as the significant part of the Group’s debt 
portfolio is US Dollar-denominated floating  
rate borrowings.
The Group monitors recent trends for any increase in base rates by the US Federal 
Reserve since the election results in the United States. Although market interest rates 
have gone up during the past 12 months, the magnitude of risk remains low as rates 
continue to rise (fueled by expectations of a Federal rate hike and US Dollar inflation),  
the dominant market expectation is that this will continue.
Management proactively locked interest rates on significant parts of the loan portfolio 
(currently 46%) in anticipation of the rate rise. Current negotiations with banks include 
assessment of their fixed vs floating rates. The Group does not rule out the possibility 
of further fixing the interest rate on its borrowings should assessment of the ongoing 
economic situation suggest this would reduce the risk level.
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Respect for our stakeholders, employees and the 
environment are all integral to making Polymetal 
a profitable business. We are committed to 
building a successful corporate culture with a 
sustainable future.
Dear Shareholders
Maintaining and delivering returns to our shareholders remains an absolute 
for Polymetal. Alongside the constant focus on our current portfolio and 
projects in the pipeline, which provide us with financial stability, it is also 
vital that we look to the future of the business in terms of both our 
leadership and skills base. We have put in place a succession programme 
that will increase the breadth of expertise and enhance the independence 
of the Board in its decision making. Retaining and training employees is 
also key to achieving our long-term goals. Each year, we commit 
substantial funds to both internal and external training opportunities, 
and we are already seeing promotions from within our own talent pool.
Adhering to key strategic goals 
Core to the role of the Board is ensuring that the business adheres to its 
key strategic goals. The delivery of a dividend that is both significant and 
sustainable throughout the cycle is crucial to our shareholders. Our 
positive free cash flow enabled us to meet our obligations and continue 
to deliver a sector-leading TSR. At the same time, we met our production 
guidance with particularly good performances from Svetloye, Komar and 
Amursk POX, supporting our plans for growth and quality at our existing 
operations. Our strong financial discipline ensures that we control costs, 
but we are still looking to increase our reserves; the latest estimates from 
Nezhda reaffirmed our confidence in this asset. Kyzyl takes centre stage 
when it launches later this year successfully fulfilling our medium-term 
growth plans. However, with our investments in Nezhda as well as in the 
largest undeveloped silver asset in Russia at Prognoz, we have already 
started looking at the next phase of our development programme. 
Throughout all our activities, we are mindful of our responsibilities in 
upholding the highest ethical standards and best practice in corporate 
governance and sustainable development.
Future proofing the business
Through open channels of communication, we keep all our stakeholders 
informed about major plans for the business and, in doing so, develop good 
working relationships and create value for Polymetal. Similarly, it is important 
that investors and analysts have a good understanding of our strategy and 
operations. Our investor relations programme includes regular presentations 
and webcasts, as well as opportunities to meet and discuss issues with 
senior management. In 2017 , we also met with key shareholders to discuss 
various governance and sustainability matters. The Board believes that the 
disclosures set out on pages 18 to 69 of the Annual Report provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess theСCompany’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.
During 2017 , Polymetal instigated the first stages of a comprehensive 
Board succession programme, which will ensure that we continue to have 
a majority of independent directors on a board while at the same time 
providing a greater depth in finance, mining and institutional investment 
skills. Russell Skirrow and Len Homeniuk, long-standing members of the 
Board, will be stepping down at the 2018 AGM and, on behalf of the  
Board and Polymetal, I would like to thank them both for their invaluable 
contributions. Three new board members, Tracey Kerr, Giacomo Baizini 
and Ollie Oliveira were appointed in 2018 and will be offering themselves 
for election at the AGM. 
Succession planning is also of vital importance in ensuring that we are 
able to access a combination of skills and experience across all levels 
that will, in turn, deliver the effective and strategic leadership needed 
to take the business forward. Our Young Leaders Programme provides 
bespoke training for our future generation of senior managers and is 
invaluable to our ability to compete successfully in the marketplace.
Our Safety and Sustainability Committee continues to devote 
considerable efforts to improvement of safety measures and 
maintenance of appropriate risk management procedures. 
The Committee met six times in 2017 and will continue to address 
sustainability issues in due course. A joint meeting was held between 
the Safety and Sustainability and Audit and Risk Committees to carry 
out an in-depth review of the results of the internal audit of environmental 
and safety risks and how to mitigate against them. There are definite 
synergies to be gained from such joint working and is something that 
we will be encouraging where it enhances continuity and increases 
awareness among the Board Committees.
Achieving international accolades
We are particularly pleased that our commitment to good environmental, 
social and governance practices continues to gain recognition from 
external agencies. We achieved a significant improvement in our ratings 
for FTSE4Good, Sustainalytics and Dow Jones, scoring maximum 
points for governance and most improved for our environmental 
practices. We were ranked the leader in environmental management 
among Russian metals and mining companies by the World Wildlife 
Fund/UN. We were shortlisted by IR Magazine Europe for the Best 
ESG Communications and our business case for electric vehicles in 
underground mines won the award for the best use of technology at 
the MINEX 2017 conference. More details about these and all our ESG 
activities are available in our Sustainability Report 2017.
Respect for our stakeholders, employees and the environment is integral 
to making Polymetal a profitable business. The Board works closely with 
the senior management team to ensure that the framework for corporate 
governance is embedded in every aspect of our operation. Through 
ethical standards and responsible behaviour, together we are committed 
to building a successful corporate culture with a sustainable future.

Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. As a premium UK-listed company, during 
the year ended 31 December 2017 , Polymetal International was 
required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the UK Code) – published in April 2016 and available through the 
UK Financial Reporting Council’s website – or, where the provisions 
of the UK Code have not been complied with, to provide appropriate 
explanations. During 2017 , the Company was in compliance  
with all provisions of the UK Code.
As well as complying with the UK Code, the Company has complied 
with all applicable regulations of the Moscow Stock Exchange and 
Russian securities laws since its shares were admitted for 
secondary trading on the Moscow Exchange.
Role and structure of the Board
In 2017 , the Company started its Board succession programme in 
order to further enhance the Board’s core skills in finance, mining and 
institutional investor engagement while adhering to best practice in 
corporate governance, including having a majority of independent 
directors. Polymetal started a phased refresh of its Board and 
appointed Spencer Stuart, an international search firm, to find further 
independent non-executive directors; two new Directors, Tracey Kerr 
and Giacomo Baizini were appointed on 1 January 2018.  
At the 2018 AGM, they will be offering themselves for election by 
the shareholders and at the same time two of the existing Directors, 
Russell Skirrow and Len Homeniuk will be stepping down having 
served on the Board approximately seven years since IPO. In addition, 
Ollie Oliveira will also stand for election at the 2018 AGM. 
As of the date of this report, the Company’s Board comprises 
the non-executive Chairman, one executive Director and nine  
non-executive Directors. Excluding the Chairman, six members of the 
Board are independent non-executive Directors. The graphic opposite 
shows the current structure of the Board and its Committees along 
with the status of each Director. Subject to shareholder approval, 
when Mr Oliveira joins the Board, he will become a member of the 
Audit and Risk, and Remuneration Committees and serve as a  
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
The independent non-executive Directors are those determined by 
the Board to be independent in character and judgement and to be 
free from relationships or circumstances which may affect or could 
appear to affect their judgement. The role of the independent 
Directors on the Board is to challenge the strategy and scrutinise 
the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and 
objectives, to monitor the reporting of the Company’s performance, 
to review the integrity of financial information and ensure that the 
Company’s internal financial controls and system of risk 
management are robust and defensible. They are responsible for 
determining the appropriate level of remuneration for the Group 
Chief Executive (Group CEO) and have a primary role in appointing 
and, when necessary, removing him.
Non-independent non-executive Directors include Mr Yanakov  
(who is a representative of Powerboom Investments Limited);  
Ms Grönberg (who is a representative of Vitalbond Limited) and  
Mr Duvieusart (who is a representative of PPF Group). Mr Nesis is the 
brother of the beneficial owner of Powerboom Investments Limited. 
Save for the potential conflicts inherent in these relationships, there 
are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties owed by the 
Directors or senior management to the Company and their private 
interests or other duties. The Company’s corporate governance 
framework safeguards against any conflict of interest, including 
complete independence of the Audit and Risk, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees and disclosure of any related party 
transactions in the financial statements.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 80 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors’ interests are disclosed in annual declarations and the 
Company Secretary is notified promptly of any changes to those 
interests. Before each Board meeting, independent non-executive 
Directors reconfirm their independence and all Directors disclose 
whether they hold any interests in any matters to be reviewed at 
the Board meeting.
The Board has determined Jonathan Best, Christine Coignard, 
Leonard Homeniuk, Russell Skirrow, Tracey Kerr and Giacomo 
Baizini to be independent non-executive Directors. Bobby Godsell 
met the independence criteria on appointment.
Jonathan Best has been on the Board of the Company since 
September 2011 and on the Board of JSC Polymetal since 
December 2006, and his re-appointment is subject to particularly 
rigorous review. The Board believes that Mr Best continues to 
display all of the qualities of independence pursuant to the 
criteria set out in the Code. 
The Company considers that the Board and its Committees have 
the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge their 
respective duties and responsibilities effectively. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, 
and are able to take independent professional advice, if necessary,  
at the Company’s expense.

by a Board Committee on three occasions. 
The Board is responsible for:
Strategy – defining the commercial strategy and long-term 
objectives of the Group;
Expenditure – approving annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any material changes to them;
Governance – overseeing the Group’s operations, ensuring 
competent and prudent management, sound planning, a strong 
system of internal control, and compliance with all statutory and 
regulatory obligations;
Performance – reviewing the performance of the Group in the light 
of its business strategy, objectives, business plans and budgets and 
ensuring that any necessary corrective action is taken;

stakeholders; and promoting a healthy corporate culture.
Separate meetings are held between the non-executive Directors without the Chairman or the Group CEO being present; between non-

and between the independent non-executive Directors without the other non-executive Directors being present. This includes both formal 
and informal meetings.

Roles of the Chairman, Group CEO and Senior Independent Director
The Board has approved the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group CEO and defined the role of the 
Senior Independent Director (SID).
Chairman Group CEO
The Chairman reports to the Board and is responsible for the 
leadership and overall effectiveness of the Board and for setting 
the Board’s agenda. Mr Godsell is able to commit sufficient time 
to his role as non-executive Chairman of Polymetal International 
and the Board believes that other commitments do not adversely 
affect his contribution to the Company. Mr Godsell’s other 
significant commitment is a non-executive directorship in the 
South African Industrial Development Corporation. He is also the 
Co-Chairman of the South African Millennium Labour Council.
Chairman’s responsibilities include:
• effective running of the Board;
• ensuring that there is appropriate delegation of authority 
from the Board to executive management;
• promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the 
effective contribution of non-executive Directors and ensuring 
constructive relations between executive and non-executive 
Directors;
• encouraging active engagement by all members of the 
Board and ensuring that the Directors receive accurate,  
timely and clear information; and
• ensuring that the views of the shareholders are communicated 
to the Board as a whole.
The Group CEO exercises his role through his executive and/or 
Director positions in the Group sub-holding companies. He reports 
to the Chairman and the Board directly and upholds the Group’s 
responsibilities to its shareholders, customers, employees and 
other stakeholders. He is responsible for the management of 
the Group and for developing the Group’s business strategy, 
objectives, budget and forecasts, and overseeing their successful 
implementation, once approved by the Board.
The Board interacts with management on a regular basis.  
Directors invite senior managers to attend relevant parts of Board 
and Committee meetings to report on agenda items and participate 
in discussion.
The Group CEO’s responsibilities include:
• developing and proposing Group strategy, including communicating 
annual plans and commercial objectives to the Board;
• upholding the Group’s responsibilities to its shareholders, 
customers, employees and other stakeholders;
• identifying and executing strategic opportunities;
• reviewing the operational performance and strategic direction 
of the Group;
• making recommendations on remuneration policies, executive 
remuneration and terms of employment for senior employees;
• ensuring that the development needs of senior management are 
identified and met;
• ensuring effective succession planning for senior management; 
and
 • ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that 
appropriate, timely and accurate information is disclosed to the 
market, with issues escalated promptly to management and 
the Board.
Senior Independent Director (SID)
Christine Coignard serves as a SID of Polymetal. In 2017,  
Ms Coignard attended a series of one-on-one meetings with 
institutional shareholders and investors, arranged as part of 
the Company’s roadshow, and the investor events organised 
by the Company’s brokers. The Board is regularly updated 
on shareholders’ opinions following meetings with the  
Directors and management. 
From AGM 2018, Mr Oliveira will replace Ms Coignard as  
Senior Independent Director.
SID’s responsibilities include:
• being available to major shareholders in order to listen to their 
views and help develop a balanced understanding of their  
issues and concerns; and 
 • to act as an intermediary for the other Directors if necessary. Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with investors and 
to encourage their participation. To ensure the Company’s 
shareholders have time to consider the Annual Report and Notice of 
the AGM and lodge their proxy votes in good time, all meeting 
materials are made available more than 20 working days prior to the 
AGM. Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate subject and all resolutions are put to a poll. The Company 
also offers shareholders the option to abstain.
Shareholders who are not able to attend the AGM are encouraged 
to submit proxy votes either electronically or in paper format. 
At the Company’s 2017 AGM, we received votes representing 
approximately 69% of our issued share capital. The Company did 
not have a significant percentage of shareholders voting against 
any resolution.
The results of the proxy vote are presented at the AGM, with the final 
results announced via the London Stock Exchange and available on 
the website.
In addition, our AGM provides a valuable opportunity for 
shareholders to meet with and put questions to the Directors in 
person. The 2017 AGM was attended by the majority of Directors, 
including the Chairs of the Audit and Risk, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Safety and Sustainability Committees. The 2018 
AGM of the Company will be held in London to enable easier 
participation of shareholders in the meeting.
The primary means of communication with the majority of 
our shareholders, who have not requested paper copies 
of our documentation, is through our corporate website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr Godsell and its other 
members are Mr Homeniuk and Ms Coignard. Tracey Kerr became 
a Committee member on 1 January 2018 and Mr Homeniuk will step 
down on 25 April 2018. The Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the composition of the Board 
and its Committees, including appointments of additional  
and replacement Directors. 
The Committee:
• leads the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board;
• regularly reviews the Board structure, size and composition 
(including skills, knowledge, independence, experience and 
diversity) and makes recommendations to the Board about any 
changes that the Committee considers necessary;
• considers plans and makes recommendations to the Board for 
orderly succession to the Board and to senior management,  
so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience 
within the Company and on the Board and to ensure progressive 
refreshing of the Board, taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company;
• keeps under review the leadership needs of the Group, 
both executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring 
the continued ability of the Group to compete effectively in 
the marketplace;
• evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge, experience, 
independence and diversity of the Board before any appointment 
is made by the Board, and in the light of this evaluation prepares 
a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular 
appointment and the expected time commitment; and
• reviews the results of the Board’s performance evaluation  
process that relates to the composition of the Board and whether 
non-executive Directors are spending enough time in discharging 
their duties.
There were three formal meetings of the Nomination Committee  
in 2017. At its meetings, the Committee:
• continued to review skills and experience of the Board,  
age and term limits of Directors, concept of independence; 
reviewed composition of the Board and its Committees; 
• reviewed results of interviews with all directors and consider  
what skills would be required for the new independent non-
executive Director appointments;
• led independent non-executive Director succession programme, 
which resulted in the appointment of three new independent 
non-executive Directors; 
• supervised the start of the tailored induction process;
• continued succession discussion at executive level, including 
formalised Group CEO succession planning;
• made recommendations to the Board about the re-election of 
Directors at the 2017 AGM; 
• reviewed the statement for the Annual Report about activities 
of the Committee;
• reviewed HR reports (including headcount, costs, diversity, 
professional development and Young Leaders Programme 
information, employment culture and approach to the 
learning process);
• reviewed diversity policy implementation, including equality audit;
• reviewed Committee’s performance and its terms of reference; 
and
 • approved working plan for the year.
The Nomination Committee acknowledges that a deep and 
rigorous approach to succession planning is vital for the Company’s 
continuing success and ensures that leadership is fully aligned to 
corporate strategy, both at Board and senior management levels. 
The Young Leaders Programme is now fully established and will 
continue in 2018; this programme helps to evaluate the talent pool 
and tailors training for the future senior management needs of the 
Group. As part of this programme, meetings take place between 
young leaders and Board members so that the Board has a chance 
to challenge the leaders and debate with them and the leaders can 
ask questions and interact directly with the Board. One-third of the 
programme participants in 2017 were women. Following the 
meeting, feedback is provided by both the Directors and young 
leaders and a follow up plan is put in place. 
In 2017, the Directors and young leaders had in-depth discussion 
about corporate culture, including recognition of the value of culture, 
leadership, openness and accountability, integration, assessment, 
measurement and engagement, and alignment of values and 
incentives. The key areas identified by young leaders in achieving 
a strong corporate culture were openness at all levels, honesty, 
transparency, willingness to be engaged in a dialogue, hunger for 
innovation. Accountability at all levels, starting from the Board of 
Directors and throughout the Company down to individual 
employees, was noted as a key to the successful implementation of 
a corporate culture. Young leaders outlined the key corporate values 
of the Company and identified indicators of them being used, 
summarising that supporting and encouraging of behaviours that 
correspond to these values was the most important. The most 
effective way to transfer corporate values was through the 
employees, who accept and share these values, both at  
work and in their everyday lives. 
Training opportunities for all of the Group’s employees continue to 
be monitored. Employee feedback systems and grievance handling 
procedures operate at all the Group companies.
The Board welcomes diversity at all levels; it believes that the right 
way to approach diversity is by putting competence first and seeking 
the right qualities for each and every appointment. Diversity 
becomes a distinct advantage with such an approach and is in line 
with the Company’s objective of promoting women at all levels of the 
Group. The Company facilitates promotion of women within its 
offices and operations, including hiring women in positions 
traditionally held by men. In 2017, the proportion of women working 
in the Group remained stable: 21% (2016: 21%); women represent 
22% of senior management positions (2016: 22%); and 42% of 
employees with vocational training or higher education (2016: 42%). 
Women representation at the Board level was 22% (2016: 22%) 
but with the recent appointment of Ms Kerr has increased to 27%. 
Regular monitoring of compliance in relation to the Diversity Policy 
is undertaken by the HR department, which also ensures that our 
internal procedures are implemented through all Group companies.
The Nomination Committee closely monitors the efforts of 
management in increasing diversity, paying special attention to 
more recent acquisitions in areas with a traditional male workforce. 
Further information on our steps to promote diversity in the 
Company is outlined in the Safety and Sustainability Report.

Board evaluation
The first externally facilitated Board evaluation took place in 2013. 
In accordance with corporate governance best practices, 
Polymetal carried out an externally facilitated Board evaluation in 
2016. Fidelio Partners, an independent Board Development and 
Executive Search consultancy, conducted the evaluation. 
The purpose of the evaluation was an in-depth review of Board 
effectiveness. The evaluation covered a number of aspects relating 
to the work of the Board and also provided suggestions and 
recommendations to further enhance Board effectiveness. 
Based on interviews with Board members and the review of various 
materials, Fidelio concluded that the Polymetal Board is aware 
of its duties, it demonstrates a strong commitment to good 
governance and best practice. The Board recognised the 
importance of the UK Code. The Chairman was considered to 
be skilled and effective in leading the Board and Board meetings; 
Board Directors were recognised as well prepared; and there was 
a general trend of improved reporting to the Board.
Fidelio highlighted several themes arising from the Board evaluation. 
These themes were forward-looking and provided a focal point 
for the Board as it considers greater Board effectiveness; 
recommendations and suggestions for the Board’s consideration 
were provided. Fidelio facilitated a discussion with all Board 
members summarising the evaluation and focusing on the 
themes for enhancing Board effectiveness. The Board discussed 
the evaluation and its findings in individual Committees and also 
at subsequent Board meetings. 
In 2017, the Board took steps to implement key recommendations 
from the external evaluation conducted by Fidelio in 2016. These are 
set out below. The Board and Committees conducted an informal 
internal evaluation in 2017.
Areas for Board focus Next steps for discussion Actions in 2017
Polymetal’s distinctive 
position – implications for 
the Board 
The Company operates in 
the emerging markets of 
the former Soviet Union 
with strong shareholder  
base in Europe and  
London premium listing.
More cohesive understanding of Board 
engagement and rounded understanding  
of views of all shareholders.
Given Polymetal’s London listing, the Board 
recognised that not having a UK/London 
based Board Member was a disadvantage. 
This addition to the Board could provide a 
greater awareness of how the investment 
community is thinking and also connectivity 
to key governance debates taking place in 
the UK.
As part of succession planning, the following 
appointments were made:
Mr Baizini. He has experience working in both  
Western and Eastern companies and is fluent in Russian.
Ms Kerr. She is London-based and has 30 years’ 
experience in the international mining industry,  
including safety and sustainability.
Mr Oliveira. He has over 16 years of experience in 
engaging with London-based institutional investors, 
including in the role of senior independent director  
of a large mining company.
Directors are regularly updated on investor  
feedback from the roadshows by the  
Group CEO and senior management.
The challenge of 
succession 
Recognised pressure for 
forthcoming Board 
refreshment, and importantly 
that Polymetal’s strong  
Group CEO would be  
difficult to replace.
The Nomination Committee has a 
good grasp of the views of institutional 
shareholders and proxy advisors, 
particularly ahead of Board refreshment. 
Skills review required today and experience 
that would be needed going forward.
Considering Board refreshment and 
creating succession pipeline. 
The strength of the Group CEO is seen 
as a major asset for Polymetal and this 
is recognised by investors and by the 
Board as a whole. 
The Board and senior management actively engaged 
with the shareholders on Board succession. 
Comprehensive Directors’ skills review was performed 
by the Nomination Committee, which included individual 
interviews with Directors. 
Three new non-executive Directors will offer themselves 
for election at the AGM 2018 and two non-executive 
Directors will step down. 
While there is no imminent Group CEO retention risk, the 
Board recognises its responsibility to investors to ensure 
structured succession planning.
Safety first
Aim to achieve zero fatalities.
The Board has clear concern regarding 
the level of fatalities and monitors the 
investigation process as well as the follow 
up safety measures.
Ensure clear communication between 
the Board and Safety and Sustainability 
Committee with focus on milestones and 
key initiatives. 
The Safety and Sustainability Committee continues to 
oversee and support the work of the Executive team in 
reducing fatalities through establishing safety culture. 
An annual plan for the Committee’s work has been drawn 
up in accordance with its terms of reference, internal 
processes and the relevant market practice.  
Ms Kerr joined the Committee as its member and subject 
to her being elected as a Director at the 2018 AGM, 
she will become the Chair of the Committee, bringing a 
wealth of relevant experience to the role.
Fidelio’s relationship with Polymetal focused only on  
Board effectiveness; Fidelio has not provided recruitment,  
search or other advisory services to Polymetal. 
In 2017, the Board and its Committees conducted informal  
internal evaluation. 
Re-election policies
In accordance with the UK Code, all Directors are subject to  
annual re-election. Full terms and conditions of the appointment 
of non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages 78-79. 
Following their performance evaluations, the Board and 
Chairman consider that each of the Directors standing for election 
or  re-election will continue to be an effective contributor to the  
Group’s success and demonstrates commitment to his or her role.  
The Board believes that the Chairman continues to be effective  
and to demonstrate commitment to his role.
Induction
To provide a thorough induction to new Board members, an 
induction data base has been generated and contained information 
about the Company, its current Board and Committee members, 
sector market update, corporate documents and Group policies. 
The Directors were also updated on the corporate governance rules 
and practices including those related to their role as non-executive 
Directors. As part of the induction process new Directors familiarised 
themselves with the Board and Committee meetings and site visits 
arrangements, along with existing remuneration and compensation 
procedures, Board and Committee meetings schedules and 
external training options for the next year. The results of the Board 
and Committees evaluation, D&O insurance policy, AGM results, as 
well as Company’s annual, interim and quarterly reports and 
sustainability reports have also been added to the induction data 
base to allow candidates to fully understand the Company’s and 
Board’s activities. 
Committee member induction included familiarising new Directors 
with associated policies, committee terms of references and relevant 
guidance on best practice. 
In addition to the data base, induction meetings were arranged,  
where new Directors could discuss appropriate issues with the fellow 
Directors and Committee members, Group CEO and the Executive 
team. Induction meetings took place at the beginning of 2018.
Access to all previous meeting materials and Board and Committee 
minutes has been provided upon appointment. 
Directors and Chairs of the Board Committees regularly receive 
updates on changes to corporate governance and regulatory 
requirements and other changes affecting the Company. The Board 
is kept informed of relevant developments in the Company by way of 
monthly management reports, including comprehensive information 
on operating and financial performance, and the progress of 
capital projects.
Board site visits
Annual site visits greatly improve the Board’s understanding of 
Polymetal’s operations and organisation, and contribute to the 
Board’s evaluation of the Group’s business plan and strategy. On a 
three-day visit to the Company’s operations in Armenia during 2017, 
the Board of Directors gained valuable first-hand insights into local 
management, challenges and opportunities. They met with key mine 
executives and employees, and were given a detailed tour of 
production facilities at the Kapan mine, including a visit to the 
underground operations. During 2016, the Board visited Company’s 
operations in Northern Urals, Russia, including the Voro mine, and 
North Kaluga exploration project. Since the IPO the Direcotrs have 
visited all key operations of the Company.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 86 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
Polymetal’s resilient operating and financial 
performance owes a great deal to the disciplined 
commitment to sound risk management and 
robust internal controls across the business.
Dear Shareholders
It is a given that both the precious metals market and the economies 
in which Polymetal operates are subject to volatility and sometimes 
significant shifts in commodity prices and exchange rates. However, 
the Audit and Risk Committee continues to focus on ensuring that 
the business has sound risk management and robust internal 
controls in place to adjust our exposure to these macroeconomic 
variables, as well as for changes in the regulatory and 
accounting frameworks. 
Performance evaluation and development
In 2017, we conducted an in-depth self-evaluation of the 
performance of the Committee, inviting input from the many parties 
with which we interact. While all parties agreed that in general the 
work of the Committee is effective, certain areas of focus and further 
development were identified. During the year a great deal of time 
was spent addressing these – we have already made certain 
improvements on issues raised and the few remaining outstanding 
matters have been factored into our work plan for 2018.
As a Committee, we should also evolve and develop so I am 
delighted to announce that Giacomo Baizini was appointed  
as a Committee member on 1 January 2018. His strong financial 
background and experience in our industry and of the Russian market 
will be a real asset. In addition, Ollie Oliviera will stand for election at 
the 2018 AGM. Existing Committee member, Russell Skirrow, will not 
be offering himself for re-election, having served on the Board for 
approximatly seven years since the IPO and I would like to thank him 
for the valuable contribution he has made. 
Effective, independent working relationships 
Of course, our effectiveness places great reliance on the excellent 
work and commitment of the internal audit and risk functions, which 
are promoting risk awareness and understanding of its impacts at  
all levels. Their particular focus this year (and ongoing) has as a 
consequence of the self evaluation exercise been the strengthening 
of the Group internal audit function and the quality of its reporting to 
and interaction with the Committee, with significant achievements 
already made.
The Audit and Risk Committee has to be prepared to take a robust 
stand on matters concerning the Company’s governance. We enjoy 
a frank and open working relationship with Polymetal’s Chairman, 
Group CEO, Chief Financial Officer, the external lead audit partner 
and head of internal audit – all key players in upholding good 
standards of corporate governance across the business. This and  
a high level of mutual respect on both sides enables us to address 
and deal effectively with any issues should they arise.
The Audit and Risk Committee is a fully independent body, 
consisting only of independent non-executive Directors with relevant 
skills and experience in financial reporting and risk management.
In 2017, the Audit and Risk Committee met six times with further 
business conducted by the Committee and approved by written 
resolution on five additional occasions. The Committee also held a 
joint meeting with the Safety and Sustainability Committee for an 
in-depth review of environmental and safety risks and of the results 
of the internal audit.
Our focus during 2017
The Audit and Risk Committee dealt with the following matters:
 • reviewed and recommended for approval financial and risk 
information included in the Annual Report 2016;
 • reviewed and recommended for approval Polymetal’s results  
for the six months to 30 June 2017;
 • supervised preparation of the longer-term viability statement  
for the Company for 2017;
 • supervised compliance with the Company’s anti-bribery  
and corruption, and whistleblowing policies and procedures;
 • approved significant transactions;
 • approved the terms of external audit engagement, including  
the scope of the audit and the Group’s external audit plan, and 
recommended for approval the interim and year-end audit fees;
 • reviewed the actual external audit fee in 2017 compared  
with the authorised amount;
 • reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the 
external auditor; 
 • recommended the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as 
external auditor;
 • reviewed the critical risks and exposures of the Group, 
including significant judgements, impairments and tax risks; 
 • reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan, internal audit charter 
and monitored the effectiveness of internal audit function;
 • performed an in-depth analysis of some of the Company’s 
main risks and jointly reviewed the environmental and safety 
risks and results of the internal audit with the Safety and 
Sustainability Committee;
 • reviewed the capability of the Group’s finance team;
 • performed an extended internal assessment of the Committee’s 
effectiveness and adopted an action plan for the areas that need 
enhancement or further development; 
 • closely monitored developments in cyber security threats and 
the management of cyber and information governance processes, 
recommended and reviewed external cyber risk evaluation carried 
out at the beginning of 2018. The Company does not consider 
cyber risk to be a principal risk for the Group;
 • discussed and approved the Committee work plan; and
 • reviewed corporate governance changes and planned for 
continued compliance in 2018.
Polymetal is committed to objectivity and transparency in its 
approach to corporate governance, which is also reflected in the 
integrity of our financial statements. By instilling a disciplined focus 
on consistent quality throughout our reporting, internal control and 
risk management processes across the business, we have resilient 
systems and processes in place that enable the Committee to 
successfully deal with the issues presented by market 
unpredictability and changes in legislation.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 88 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
Focus during 2017
During this year, the Audit and Risk Committee focused on:
 • evaluating the recoverability of goodwill and operating and 
development assets. The Committee examined the potential 
indicators of impairment (or impairment reversal, where 
appropriate) for each of the cash-generating units (CGUs) and the 
life-of-mine financial models used for assessing the fair value less 
costs to sell of the individual CGUs tested for impairment. The 
Committee examined and challenged the commodity price, 
discount rate and exchange rate assumptions used by 
management in its impairment tests;
 • evaluating the recoverability of metal inventories. The Committee 
examined the price assumptions used by management as well as 
unit costs and other internal assumptions used in determining the 
net realisable value of unfinished goods within metal inventories 
(ore and concentrate stockpiles);
 • evaluating the recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets. 
The Committee assessed management’s approach to determine 
whether the existing exploration and evaluation assets are likely to 
generate future economic benefits and whether any indicators of 
impairment had been identified;
 • reviewing tax exposures. The Committee evaluated management’s 
assessment of various tax risks and appropriateness of provisions 
made in the financial statements, where applicable;
 • internal controls and the risk of misstatement. The Committee 
reviewed reporting from internal audit in respect of its audit plan 
and discussed all significant findings as well as key controls for 
major financial reporting areas, and performed an in-depth  
review of one of the operations (Varvara) prepared by the internal 
control department;
 • reviewing the capital structure decisions and dividend policy; and
 • reviewing the longer-term viability statement, including the 
process and assessment of the Group’s prospects made 
by management, basis of preparation and the results of risk 
scenario analysis.
The Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee makes himself available 
to major institutional shareholders annually to discuss the 
Company’s annual reporting to shareholders as part of the 
Company’s investor days. He is also available for one-on-one 
meetings with key shareholders at their request.
Following the assessment of the Committee’s performance during 
the Board external evaluation in 2016, no threats to the effectiveness 
of the Committee were identified. At the same time, fellow Directors 
reported a high level of satisfaction with the Audit Committee.
In 2017, the Committee carried out a self-evaluation of its 
performance. The members of the Committee, CFO, external audit 
partner and head of internal audit completed a thorough 
assessment questionnaire on the work of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and other related issues, including external audit and the 
quality, experience and expertise of the internal audit function. 
Based on the assessment results, the areas that needed attention 
were aggregated and followed up by appropriate actions in 2017, 
including a Committee renewal programme, additional management 
reporting, internal audit department staffing review and a more 
in-depth understanding of the scope of external audit. Outstanding 
issues have been included in the 2018 Committee work plan. 
The Board considers that the Audit and Risk Committee complies 
with the provisions of the UK Code, FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees and Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control  
and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
External auditor appointment
The re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditor is 
reviewed annually by the Audit and Risk Committee. Deloitte LLP was 
appointed auditor in 2011, with Deloitte CIS having been auditor of 
JSC Polymetal since the last tendering process in 2007 . The Group 
has a policy of tendering the external audit at least every ten years. 
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditor’s performance 
and independence underpins its recommendation to the Board to 
propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as 
auditor until the conclusion of the AGM in 2019. Resolutions to 
authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine the auditor’s 
remuneration will be proposed at the AGM on 25 April 2018.
We intend to tender our external audit in 2019 for the 2020 audit, 
which will coincide with the completion of the five-year term of our 
current audit partner. At that point, Deloitte LLP will have been our 
auditor for 10 years, following our listing on the London Stock 
Exchange. It is our intention that Deloitte will be invited to participate  
in this tender process, along with other appropriately qualified 
international audit firms. The Company is in compliance with the 
provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation Order 2014.
Non-audit services by the external auditors
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditor relating to the provision of non-audit 
services to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are 
safeguarded. This is achieved by disclosure of the extent and nature 
of non-audit services (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial 
statements) and the prohibition of selected services being provided  
by the external auditor.
Following the introduction of new EU Audit legislation and changes 
to the UK Ethical Standard, which introduced new restrictions and 
prohibitions on non-audit services to the Public Interest Entities 
incorporated in the European Economic Area (EEA PIEs), the Audit 
Committee has chosen to voluntarily apply the new requirements  
as if Polymetal was a EEA PIE. The policy governing the provision  
of non-audit services by the external auditor approved by the 
Committee defines permitted audit and non-audit services. 
Pre-approval thresholds are in place for the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor, being: pre-approval by the Chief 
Financial Officer of JSC Polymetal if the services are provided to a 
Russian entity, Chief Financial Officers of Kazakh or Armenian 
business entities respectively, and by the Director of the Cyprus 
office of Polymetal International plc if the services are provided to 
other Group companies if below US$5,000; by the Chair of the 
Audit and Risk Committee if between US$5,000 and US$20,000; 
and by the Audit and Risk Committee if above US$20,000.
Certain permitted types of non-audit work may be undertaken by 
the auditor without prior referral to the Audit and Risk Committee up 
to a cumulative annual value of US$100,000. Any further non-audit 
work is subject to approval by the Audit and Risk Committee in 
further tranches of US$100,000. In the event that the cumulative 
value of non-audit fees exceeds US$500,000 in any given year, 
separate approval by the Audit and Risk Committee is required 
explaining why there is no threat to independence.
In 2017, non-audit fees were US$0.44 million of which US$0.42 
million were incurred for audit-related assurance services for the 
Group’s half-year review. Non-audit fees represented 38% of the 
2017 audit fee (2016: 40%). Non-audit fees excluding audit-related 
services amounted to US$0.01 million, or 1% (2016: 2%) of total 
fees for audit and audit-related services.
The Audit and Risk Committee has considered information 
pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and non-audit work 
for the Group in 2017, and concluded that the nature and extent of 
non-audit services provided do not present a threat to the external 
auditor’s objectivity or independence.
Auditor independence
The auditors are required each year to confirm in writing  
to the Committee that they have complied with the independence 
rules of their profession and regulations governing independence,  
and that they have complied with the requirements of the Company’s 
policy on provision of non-audit services. The external auditor is 
required to maintain appropriate records to provide reasonable 
assurance that its independence from the Company is not impaired.
A copy of the Policy on Independence and the Provision of  
Non-Audit Services is available on the Company’s website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com.
Review of the effectiveness of the external audit  
process and audit quality
The Audit and Risk Committee has adopted a formal framework in 
its review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit 
quality which focuses on the following areas:
 • the audit partners, with particular focus on the lead audit 
engagement partner. The Company has been working with 
the existing audit partner since 2015;
 • the audit team;
 • planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas  
of audit risk;
 • execution of the audit;
 • the role of management in an effective audit process;
 • communications by the auditor with the Audit and Risk 
Committee, and how the auditor supports the work of the  
Audit and Risk Committee;
 • how the audit contributes insights and adds value; and
 • the independence and objectivity of the audit firm and the quality 
of the formal audit report to shareholders.
An auditor assessment is completed annually by each member of 
the Audit and Risk Committee and by the CFO. Feedback is also 
sought from the Group CEO, other members of the finance team, 
divisional management and the head of internal audit.
The assessment tool adopted is comprehensive and includes 
detailed questions which are completed by way of a formal 
questionnaire every three years, while the key areas are reviewed 
every year. The feedback from this process is considered by the 
Audit and Risk Committee, and is provided both to the auditor and 
to management. Action plans arising are also reviewed by the 
Committee. The most recent comprehensive audit quality evaluation  
was performed in March 2017.
The effectiveness of management in the external audit process is 
assessed principally in relation to the timely identification and 
resolution of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and 
timeliness of papers analysing those judgements, management’s 
approach to the value of the independent audit, the booking of audit 
adjustments arising (if any) and the timely provision of draft public 
documents for review by the auditor and the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
Risk management and internal control
Risk management is the responsibility of the Board and is integral 
to the achievement of Group’s strategic objectives. The Board 
considered the Group’s management responsiveness to changes 
within its business environment. The Board is satisfied that there is 
an ongoing process, which was operational during the year,  
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report, for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principle risks faced by the Group.
The Board also takes account of material changes and trends in  
the risk profile and considers whether the control system, including 
reporting, adequately supports the Board in achieving its risk 
management objectives.
The Group enforces a responsible business culture throughout all 
Group entities to mitigate principle risks and to keep residual risk 
at an acceptable level. The Audit and Risk Committee assists the 
Board with its assessment of the Group’s principal risks and its 
review of the effectiveness of the risk management process. The 
Committee reviews reports on the status of Group-level risk profiles 
and controls in place during its meetings throughout the year.
The Company aims to ensure that all the components of its risk 
management system are embedded into day-to-day operations so 
that all principal risks are identified and managed on a timely and 
accurate basis. The process for identification and assessment of 
principal risks combines a top-down and bottom-up approach. 
The Group has implemented enterprise and operational policies 
and controls to manage risks that may affect achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives. Transaction-level internal controls are 
designed to enhance the value of operational-level objectives and 
accountability of new projects and initiatives.
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk 
management and internal control system (including financial, 
operating and compliance controls), the Board considers the key 
findings from the ongoing monitoring and reporting processes, 
management representations and independent assurance reports. 
Internal audit
The internal audit function supports Directors, through the Audit and 
Risk Committee, with an objective evaluation of the Company’s and 
the Group’s governance framework. The internal audit function also 
aims to raise levels of understanding and awareness of risk and 
control throughout the Group.
The head of internal audit reports to the Group CEO and, 
through the Audit and Risk Committee, to the Board of Directors. 
The internal audit function additionally reports its findings to 
members of the Group’s executive management.
The internal audit function’s annual work plan is approved by the 
Audit and Risk Committee. It is based on a risk tolerance evaluation 
that ensures the achievement of Group’s operating objectives and 
focuses on the principle risks of Group’s risk profile. 
In addition to the Audit and Risk Committee assessment,  
the internal audit function uses an annual self-certification process, 
which requires managers throughout the Group to personally 
confirm the testing of internal controls and compliance with Group 
policies within their business or function, as well as the steps taken 
to address actual or potential issues that are identified. The internal 
audit function also performs periodic external certification, the most 
recent of which took place in February 2016.
Management provides a timely response to issues raised by internal 
audit. Where possible, the issues are resolved within one reporting 
period. The results of the self-certification as well as management 
response thereto are provided to the Committee along with other 
reports on the internal audit activities.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 90 Internal control framework and activities
The management structure of the Group and internal policies and 
procedures are aimed at maintaining a robust control framework 
within the Group encourage the achievement of strategic objectives 
within the set risk tolerance levels.
This framework includes:
 • an appropriate tone set from the top (Board level),  
aimed at building the appropriate control environment  
and ethical climate;
 • management support of a comprehensive risk management 
system (for more detail please refer to  
pages 68-74);
 • strong segregation of duties including internal controls  
over sensitive transactions;
 • specific control activities implemented at all levels of the Group; 
and
 • a periodic review of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The governance framework reflects the specific structure and 
management of the Group, where authority and control are 
delegated by the Board to different levels, from senior management 
to the managers of the Group’s operating entities and then 
cascaded down to business and project managers as appropriate.
Within this framework, authority is delegated with clearly prescribed 
limits and decisions are escalated where either project size or risk 
profile require a higher level of authority. In addition to controls 
operating at transaction level (production, exploration, construction, 
procurement), the control framework also includes a set of general 
procedures for transaction approval, financial accounting, reporting 
and budgeting – see details on the next page.
The Board confirms that the actions it considers necessary have 
been or are being taken to remedy any failings or weaknesses in the 
Group’s system of internal controls. This has involved considering 
the matters reported to it and developing plans and programmes 
that it believes are reasonable in the circumstances. Based on 
the results of the review of risk management and internal control 
activities undertaken by the Board and the Audit and Risk 
Committee, the Board considers that the risk management and 
internal control systems are in accordance with the relevant 
principles and provisions of the UK Code and other 
applicable guidance.
Financial reporting systems
The quality of financial accounting and reporting is ensured 
through a set of control procedures in the following areas: 
accounting methodology, preliminary review of new transactions, 
documentation, accounting techniques and financial closing 
procedures. Accounting policies are developed centrally for 
each of the Group’s subsidiaries and are adapted for the specifics 
of each entity and Group-wide policies. Employees responsible 
for accounting and reporting functions have powers to review 
upcoming transactions and propose adjustments, where necessary, 
to ensure proper accounting and tax treatments. The use of a 
centralised Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in all major 
Group companies ensures the unification of the business and 
accounting processes. The Group implements a multi-level set of 
controls over financial and accounting data recorded in the system. 
These controls involve the accounting department of each 
subsidiary, senior management of the subsidiary and controls at 
the relevant headquarters level. In addition, the accounting and 
reporting data are regularly audited by internal and external auditors.
Procedures for approval of capital and current expenditures
The Group prepares annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets based on its current and strategic goals and objectives. 
In addition to periodic control of actual versus budgeted financial 
performance, a procedure of ongoing control and authorisation 
of expenses is in place. The current system of pre-approval of 
significant transactions, along with accounting procedures in 
the ERP system, achieves a level of control over the amount 
and appropriateness of expenses.
Treasury operations
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which is 
responsible for payments on behalf of all operating subsidiaries of 
the Group. Use of this centralised system achieves the best level of 
control over the payments function without compromising the speed 
and reliability of payments.
All transactions with banks on accounts maintenance, deposits and 
borrowings and foreign currency transactions are also performed at 
relevant headquarters level in compliance with the treasury policy 
approved by the Board.
Controls over IT systems used in financial accounting 
and reporting
The Group uses a 1C:Enterprise 8 ERP system for the automation of 
everyday enterprise activities. These include various business tasks 
within economic and management functions, such as management 
accounting, business accounting, HR management, supplier 
relationship management (SRM) and material requirements 
planning (MRP). The Group also uses the ERP system for budgeting, 
accounting, HR record-keeping and payroll, supply chain 
management, operational reporting and procurement.
The Group operates an IT management framework based on COBIT 
(Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology), which 
provides a complete set of high-level requirements to be considered 
for effective control of each IT process. At the beginning of 2018,  
an external audit of the IT controls was carried out, and no critical 
weaknesses of the control system and procedures were reviealed.   
The external audit was carried out by an independent Center for 
Cyber Security, Jet Infosystem. No other services were provided  
by Jet Infosystem.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The Company and its Directors are committed to ensuring 
adherence to the highest legal and ethical standards.  
This is reflected in every aspect of the way the Group operates. 
Bribery is a criminal offence in the countries in which the Group 
operates. Corrupt acts expose the Group and its employees to the 
risk of prosecution, fines and imprisonment, as well as endangering 
the Company’s reputation. The Group has a Code of Conduct in 
place, which refers to its Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy.
The policy extends across all of the Group’s business dealings in  
all countries and territories in which the Group operates and applies 
to Directors, managers and all employees of the Group, as well as 
relevant business partners and other relevant individuals 
and entities.
The Board attaches the utmost importance to this policy and applies 
a zero-tolerance approach to acts of bribery and corruption by any 
of the Group’s employees or by business partners working on 
the Group’s behalf. The policy prohibits the payment, offer or 
authorisation of bribes, the receipt or acceptance of a bribe, or 
the payment, offer or promise to pay any facilitating payments. 
Any breach of this policy is regarded as a serious matter by the 
Company and is likely to result in disciplinary action.
As part of implementation of internal procedures to comply with the 
UK Bribery Act, the Group has a formalised Whistle-Blowing Policy 
which defines the processes in place for staff to communicate, in 
confidence, concerns about possible improprieties, unethical or 
illegal activities and ensures that arrangements are in place for 
the independent investigation of such matters.
The Company affirms that it has not denied any personnel access 
to the Audit and Risk Committee and that it has provided protection 
to whistle-blowers from adverse personnel action.
All policies and procedures on prevention of bribery and corruption 
are annually reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee for any 
changes required to be recommended to the Board. The 
management reports to the Committee on the implementation of 
policies and procedures within the Group’s operations are reviewed 
on a regular basis as well.
The Code of Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and the 
Whistle-Blowing Policy are available on the Company’s website:

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 93
POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 92 REMUNERATION REPORT
The remuneration of Mr Nesis, Group CEO and the only Executive 
Director on the Board, includes a simple and clearly defined KPI-
component, derived from top-level strategic goals, encompassing 
operating and financial metrics that he can influence. In the same 
way the KPI structure for all our senior managers and key employees 
is tailored for individual responsibilities and performance. To reflect 
the aim of zero fatalities at our operations, the bonus calculation 
system for the Group CEO, some senior managers and mine 
management has a major focus on health and safety KPIs, 
adjusting bonus outcomes on all KPIs in the case of fatalities. 
The same remuneration principles are applied to our senior 
management team, which is composed of highly talented and 
committed professionals who deliver outstanding operating and 
financial performance under complex market conditions. We aim to 
ensure the corporate cohesiveness of the team as well as to support 
individual success and development.
The purpose and structure of the key elements of the Remuneration 
Policy is set out below:
 • The general structure of the executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy successfully achieves our top corporate goals.
 • The drivers of variable pay (KPIs) are stretching, well aligned with 
the Company’s strategic objectives and cascade throughout the 
organisation in a way that ensures our employees’ pay is aligned  
to Polymetal’s performance and to the wider principles of the policy.
 • The policy is consistent with UK market and governance practice 
including, but not limited to, in the following aspects:
 – Performance-related pay makes up a significant proportion of 
the remuneration package (53% and 71% of total remuneration 
for target and maximum performance scenarios, respectively), 
with an appropriate balance between reward for short- and 
long-term performance. 
 – Senior management interests are aligned with those of our 
shareholders and the Company’s long-term objectives. 
50% of the bonuses awarded each year to the Group CEO and 
the senior management team are deferred into shares in the 
Company through the Deferred Share Award plan (DSA) over a 
period of three years and clawback and malus provisions apply 
to the unvested awards. 
 – The Performance Share Plan (PSP) provides an additional 
focus for key employees of the Group on delivering superior 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR). Stringent PSP vesting 
conditions, based on above median relative TSR and 
underpinned by positive absolute shareholder returns,  
are therefore fully aligned with shareholder- value creation.  
 – A vesting period of four years under the PSP, over which 
clawback and malus conditions apply to the unvested awards, 
with an additional post-vest holding period of one year ensures 
that management focus on the long-term interests of the 
Company and of its stakeholders.
 – The Group CEO owns a shareholding equal to 8,780%, of his 
base salary, far exceeding minimum shareholding requirements 
of 500% of base salary.
The management KPIs include significant weighting towards 
sustainability metrics, with the Group CEO’s component 
purposefully focused on health and safety.
Key committee decisions
As communicated within last year’s Remuneration Report,  
and in accordance with the revised Remuneration Policy, and to 
bring it closer to the industry level, the salary of the Group CEO’s 
(in Roubles) was increased by 25% in 2017. 
The Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders last year included 
a three-year planned increase for the base salary of our Group CEO 
and senior management team base, after their remuneration had 
fallen significantly below peer benchmark as their salaries are 
denominated in Russian Roubles. The policy stated that the CEO’s 
salary would be increased (in Roubles) by up to 10 percentage points 
above the Russian domestic inflation rate in both 2018 and 2019, 
subject to a Committee review based on market conditions, exchange 
rates, the Company results or other considerations.
As per the policy, the Committee carefully reviewed whether  
this increase remains appropriate for 2018. Given the favourable 
economic environment in Russia throughout 2017, with a significant 
slowdown of domestic inflation and strengthening of the RUB/US$ 
exchange rate (58.3 RUB/US$ average rate, 15% appreciation 
compared with 2016), the Committee decided that there would  
be no additional increase to the Group CEO’s salary in excess of 
inflation rate. The approved salary increase will be 2.5%, which is  
in line with Russian inflation and the average increase for the rest of 
our workforce. The revised Group CEO base salary of US$434,662 
per annum (using 60 RUB/US$ exchange rate) is still below the 
peer group median (based on 2016 benchmarking performed by 
PwC). In 2019, the Committee will again carefully review whether 
a further above-inflation increase remains appropriate.
Non-executive Directors’ fees are reviewed on an annual basis. 
Any increase in non-executive Directors’ fees will normally be in 
line with UK inflation and market levels for similar roles in UK-listed 
entities, except where a change in the scope of the role occurs. 
Current fee levels are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
and have not been increased since 2011.
Corporate governance and approach to disclosure
As a FTSE 250 company listed on the London Stock Exchange, 
we comply with the strictest of corporate governance requirements. 
We remain committed to full adherence of all regulatory requirements 
and best practice as reflected in our Remuneration Policy, decisions, 
disclosure practices and requests for shareholder votes.
Moving forward
In 2018, our focus remains on careful oversight of the Remuneration 
Policy implementation as well as key corporate governance matters, 
including the smooth transition of new Committee members, gender 
pay and adjusting to what is likely to be far-reaching new regulatory 
and governance frameworks as they emerge. 
The Committee composition has changed due to the Board 
succession programme and we have welcomed Giacomo Baizini, 
who brings wealth of experience of working in both natural 
resources and large corporates in Russia and beyond. We are 
looking forward to working with Ollie Oliveira, our new Committee 
Director, with his strong background in finance and operational and 
strategic roles primarily in the mining and resource sector. Existing 
Committee member, Len Homeniuk, will not be offering himself for 
re-election having served on the Board for approximately seven 
years since the IPO. The new Directors are familiar with the current 
remuneration practices in similar environments and as a Committee 
we will facilitate the transfer of knowledge of remuneration matters 
and of the Group practices to our new colleagues.
Finally, 2018 will be the first year of potential PSP vesting with 
respect to 2014 grant, subject to vesting conditions being met. 
On behalf of the Committee and of the Board, I continue to welcome 
feedback from shareholders and look forward to receiving your 
support at the AGM.
Christine Coignard
Chair, Remuneration Committee
Throughout the company we aim at rewarding our 
people fairly in line with the Company’s strategic, 
operational and financial objectives in creating  
long-term sustainable stakeholders’ value.
Taking into consideration the key conclusions of the extensive external 
Board review undertaken in 2016, the Committee performed its own 
comprehensive effectiveness review in 2017 , including refining the 
Committee’s priorities. As a FTSE 250 company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, our forward-looking action plan includes measures 
to ensure that we stay on top of the increasingly complex and rapidly 
changing regulatory framework on remuneration matters. We are also 
working jointly with other Committees, largely in reviewing KPIs and 
general pay structure (the Safety and Sustainability Committee) as 
well as gender pay as part of the new broader gender agenda (the 
Nomination Committee). 
Remuneration principles and strategy
Our remuneration policy is underpinned by the Company’s strategy 
and is result-oriented. We aim to develop and operate in a safe 
and sustainable manner across high-grade mines in selected 
geographies within the CIS and to generate free cash flow in order 
to pay substantial and sustainable dividends. To achieve this, we 
have developed a competitive advantage with our hub-based 
system and refractory ore processing as well as applying a strict 
capital and project management discipline throughout the Group. 
Our Employment Policy is aligned with our strategy, as it calls for 
responsible behaviour and personal accountability, as well as a 
commitment to best practice in all matters and at all levels of the 
organisation. Our general approach is to motivate and compensate 
employees fairly and competitively for their contribution to the 
business and to promote an open, positive and co-operative 
attitude in the workplace. 
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee considers 
both the performance of the Company and the current environment 
surrounding executive pay, where there is a clear expectation of 
shareholder alignment and appropriate pay for performance.
Remuneration structure
Alignment with our corporate strategy is taken into consideration 
in all components of our remuneration structure which is based  
on a healthy balance between fixed and variable pay, use of the  
KPIs tailored to key strategic objectives, as well as the strict vesting 
conditions of our Performance Share Plan and substantial minimum 
shareholding requirements.
Dear Shareholders
Following the extensive review of our Remuneration Policy in 2016, 
we are delighted that 99.10% of shareholders approved the 
Company’s revised Remuneration Policy at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting, which applies for a period of three years until May 2020. 
Our Remuneration Report detailing remuneration outcomes for 
2016 also received strong support from 99.63% of shareholders.
As outlined in the Chairman’s Statement and reported in more detail 
in the Group CEO’s Review, Polymetal maintained its track record 
of solid operational delivery and project execution, meeting our 
increased production guidance for the sixth consecutive year. 
Over recent years, our management team further consolidated and 
improved the performance of existing assets and increased 
the resource base through exploration and acquisitions. This has 
led to good free cash flow generation, as reflected in the significant 
dividends of US$1,048 million paid to our shareholders since the 
IPO in 2011. At the year end, Polymetal had delivered a 4.4% 
dividend yield on a three-year average basis.
At the same time, the Company continues to meet the increasingly 
demanding requirements of a London premium-listed company, 
in terms of environmental, social and governance matters.  
Some 70 separate KPI metrics are included in the variable part of 
remuneration at all levels of the organisation to reward those 
employees who are able make a difference. Polymetal is included  
in the FTSE4Good, STOXX Global ESG Leaders and Euronext-Vigeo 
indices and supports the Carbon Disclosure Project as well as the 
UN Global Compact and Global Reporting Initiative.
Our ability to retain employees at all levels of the organisation 
remains high, despite strong competition for talent in our industry 
and regions of operation. The Company’s commitment to the 
highest ethical standards, its operational excellence and 
implementation of international best practice is reflected in 
our staff turnover, that has been steadily reducing over the  
last seven years and was 5.4% in 2017. 
In our 2017 Remuneration Report, we outline how the Committee 
supervised implementation of the approved Remuneration Policy, 
including planned base-salary increases, annual bonuses and the 
grant of performance shares. The Company performed well on all 
metrics and this was reflected in the Group CEO’s remuneration. 
The Committee applied no discretion in its decision.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Deferred Share  
Awards plan (DSA)
Deferral to encourage 
retention and alignment 
with shareholders.
50% of the annual bonus earned is 
paid in cash and the remaining 50%  
is compulsorily deferred into shares, 
which are released annually to the 
employee over the next three years in 
equal instalments.
Clawback and malus provisions apply  
for the unvested portion of the DSA; the 
Remuneration Committee may, at any 
time up to and including vesting, 
reduce the number of shares that vest, 
should it consider that a material 
misstatement, misconduct and/or a 
failure of risk management occurs.
Dividend equivalents will be received on 
vested shares, reflecting the value of 
dividends which have been paid during 
the period from the grant date to the  
vesting date.
Not applicable. Entitlement to this deferred 
component is subject to 
continued employment over 
the deferral period.
In normal circumstances, DSAs 
will continue until the normal 
time of vesting upon cessation 
of employment due to death, 
injury, ill-health, disability, 
redundancy, retirement, or any 
other circumstance which the 
Committee determines (Good 
Leaver Circumstances). 
Alternatively, the Board may 
determine that DSAs will vest 
immediately. In both 
circumstances there would be 
no pro-rating of the DSAs for 
the time from the award date 
until cessation of employment 
or for performance.
No performance conditions 
apply to the DSA shares as 
they have been subject to 
fulfilment of annual KPIs.
Performance Share 
Plan (PSP)
To provide long-term 
alignment with 
shareholders’ interests  
by delivering sustainable 
above-market  
shareholder returns.
Under the PSP, annual rolling 
conditional share awards are made  
with a four-year vesting period and an 
additional mandatory holding period  
of one year following vesting.
Stretching performance targets reward 
participants for delivering positive 
absolute and superior relative TSR 
performance against global peers over 
the performance period.
Clawback and malus provisions apply 
for the unvested portion of the PSP, 
whereby the Remuneration Committee 
may, at any time up to and including 
vesting, reduce the number of shares 
that vest, should it consider that a 
material misstatement, misconduct, 
and/or a failure of risk 
management occur.
Retesting of the performance 
conditions in future years is not 
allowed under any circumstances.
First grant under the PSP was made  
in  April 2014; first normal vesting –  
April 2018, subject to performance 
conditions being met.
Maximum grant permitted under 
the plan rules is 200% of salary.
Default grant level is expected  
to be 150% of base salary.
Threshold vesting is equivalent 
to 20% of the award.
Dividend equivalents will be 
received on vested shares, 
reflecting the value of dividends, 
which have been paid during the 
period from the grant date to the 
vesting date.
Vesting is based on relative 
TSR, measured against the 
constituents of the FTSE Gold 
Mines Index and also on the 
Company’s absolute TSR.
Peers are ranked and the 
Company’s position 
determines vesting:
 • 0% vests for below 
median performance;
 • 20% vests at median 
performance;
 • 100% vests at top decile 
performance and above. 
Vesting occurs on a linear line 
basis between median and top 
decile performance.
No award will vest if absolute 
TSR is negative, regardless of 
relative performance.
The Committee may substitute, 
vary or waive the performance 
targets if an event occurs 
which causes the Committee 
to consider that the target is no 
longer appropriate.
The Committee has discretion 
to vary the proportion of 
awards that vest to ensure that 
the outcomes are fair and 
appropriate and reflect the 
underlying financial 
performance of the Group.
Summary table
The Committee received shareholder approval of the following Remuneration Policy at the AGM on 16 May 2017. The new policy covers a 
period of three years from the date of approval – up to May 2020. 
Element and purpose/

Performance metrics used

Executive Director – Group CEO
Base salary
To attract and  
retain high-calibre 
executives.
The Committee reviews base salary 
on an annual basis, taking into 
account general economic and 
market conditions, underlying Group 
performance, the level of increases 
made across the Group as a whole, 
the remuneration of executives in 
similar positions in FTSE and global 
mining peers, and individual 
performance when setting base 
salary for the following year.
In accordance with the policy, the 
Group CEO’s salary increased (in 
Roubles) by 25% from 1 April 2017 , 
and may increase by up to 10 
percentage points above the 
Russian domestic inflation rate in 
2018 and 2019. 
The Committee will carefully review 
whether these increases remains 
appropriate in 2018 and 2019 based 
on the market conditions, exchange 
rates and the Company’s results or 
other relevant considerations, and 
suspend if they are not justified.
The annual base salary for the 
reporting year and the current year 
is set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and page 108.
Not applicable.
Pension
To provide funding 
for retirement.
The Group does not fund any 
pension contributions or retirement 
benefits, except contributions to the 
mandatory pension fund of the 
Russian Federation, as required 
by Russian law. 
The Group pays defined 
contributions to the mandatory 
pension fund. This permits retiring 
employees to receive a defined 
monthly pension for life from the 
statutory pension fund.
Does not exceed the mandatory 
contribution made to the pension 
fund of the Russian Federation. 
Currently 10% of total pay.
Not applicable.
Benefits The Group does not provide any 
benefits for its Group CEO.
Not applicable. Not applicable.
Annual bonus
To focus on achieving 
annual performance 
goals, which are 
based on the  
Group’s KPIs  
and strategy.
The annual bonus result is 
determined by the Committee after 
the year end, based on performance 
against defined targets.
Annual bonuses are paid three 
months after the end of the financial 
year to which they relate.
50% of the annual bonus earned is 
paid in cash and the remaining 50%  
is compulsorily deferred into shares, 
which are released annually to the 
employee over the next three years in 
equal instalments through the 
Deferred Share Awards plan. No 
clawback is applied to the cash part 
of the annual bonus, as this provision 
would contradict the labour law of 
the Russian Federation.
Details of the DSA are set out  
on the next page.
Maximum bonus opportunity –  
125% of base salary.
Target bonus opportunity –  
100% of base salary.
Threshold – nil annual bonus for 
threshold performance.
The annual bonus is earned based 
on the achievement of a mix of 
financial and non-financial measures. 
For 2017, performance metrics and 
associated weightings for each were:
• production (25%);
• total cash costs (25%);
• completion of new projects on 
time and within budget (25%); and
• health and safety (25%).
There is an additional penalty factor 
for fatal/severe cases for up to 50% 
of the annual bonus earned for 
non-safety related KPIs.
The Committee has discretion to

Notes to the policy table
Performance measures and targets
The Committee selected the performance conditions indicated in the policy table because they are central to the Company’s overall strategy, 
and include the key metrics used under the annual bonus and LTIP by the Group CEO to oversee the operation of the business.
Performance targets for all incentive plans are reviewed annually and, where appropriate, are typically set at a level that is in line with the 
Company’s forecasts.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan 
Following shareholder approval at the AGM in June 2013, the Company’s LTIP (as amended) was put in place. The key terms of the LTIP 
are described in the Remuneration Policy table above.
The Board believes that the LTIP ensures continued alignment of the executive team’s performance with shareholder interests and rewards 
superior long-term performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The Board also believes that the LTIP is in line with UK 
best practice and follows fully the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and other relevant guidelines, while also containing 
features which are superior to common practice in the UK, such as a positive TSR underpinning for vesting of the PSP.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The Remuneration Policy for other members of the executive team and broader management team within the Group is consistent in both 
structure and KPIs to that of the Group CEO. While the value of remuneration will vary throughout the Group, depending upon the individual’s 
role, significance to the business and level of responsibility, the remuneration of all senior executives consists of a base salary, an annual 
bonus and participation in the LTIP (the PSP and DSA).
Employees up to three levels below the Board (approximately 400 employees throughout the Group) participate in the PSP at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee. The PSP policy default grant level is 150% of base salary for the Group CEO, 100% for Executive 
Committee members and 50-100% for employees at the level below the Executive Committee.
Shareholding requirements are also set below the Board level. Operation of the DSA program for the most senior employees mirrors the 
executive Director’s arrangement set out for in the policy table, where 50% of the annual bonus is deferred into shares and released annually 
to the employees over a period of three years.
The Remuneration Policy for the wider group of employees is aimed at aligning pay with the achievement of targeted results for each 
employee. The Company’s policy on fair pay provides for the payment of additional remuneration for employees living in difficult climatic 
locations and the delivery of appropriate levels of pay for different levels of work. The bonus component of remuneration for mid-level 
management and operational staff is measured based on the achievement of production targets, increasing output, the level of justified cost 
savings and health and safety records. In terms of pension arrangements, the Company applies a consistent approach for the Group CEO 
and other employees and adheres to the mandatory pension contributions required under applicable laws.
Salaries are considered for annual increases based on the Company’s performance results, inflation rates and the competitive level of 
salaries versus the wider market.

The composition and structure of the remuneration package for the Group CEO under three performance scenarios (maximum performance, 
target performance and minimum performance) is set out in the chart below.
This chart shows that the proportion of remuneration delivered through short-term and long-term incentive schemes is in line with our 
Remuneration Policy and changes significantly across the three performance scenarios. As such, the package promotes the achievement of 
both short-term and long-term performance targets and drives the alignment of the Group CEO’s interests with the interests of shareholders.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay a competitive overall package, as appropriate, to attract and motivate  
the right talent for the role. If an executive is promoted to the Board from within the Company, any pre-existing awards or benefits that were 
made available to him or her prior to becoming a Director (and not in anticipation of an imminent promotion to the Board) will be retained  
and allowed to vest or be provided under the original terms.
The following table sets out the various components, which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, be set at a level 
consistent with the scope of the role (at a level not exceeding that of the Group CEO as set out in the Remuneration Policy table),  
and be subject to the same constraints as those of existing Directors performing similar roles, as shown below.
Area Policy and operation
Base salary  
and benefits
The base salary level will be set by taking into account the experience of the individual and the salaries paid  
in comparable co mpanies. Depending on the circumstances of any particular appointment, the Committee  
may choose to set the base salary below market median and increase the amount paid over a period of time  
to achieve alignment with market levels for the role (with reference to the experience and performance of the 
individual), subject to the Company’s ability to pay. In line with the Remuneration Policy, as set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy table, no benefits will be provided to recruited Directors.
Pension Pension contributions will be limited to the mandatory contributions required by Cypriot/Russian/Kazakh/
Armenian or any other applicable law, as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy table.
Annual bonus The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy table. The maximum annual opportunity is 125% of base salary. 50% of any bonus is 
deferred into shares under the DSA, as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy table.
Long-term incentives The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the PSP part of LTIP at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion and in line with the details set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy table. The maximum annual 
grant permitted under the scheme rules is 200% of base salary and the normal grant level is up to 150% of  
base salary. Performance measures would apply, as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy table. 
Replacement awards The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards so that overall they are no more generous in 
terms of quantum or timing than the awards to be forfeited as a consequence of the individual joining the 
Company. In determining the quantum and structure of any replacement awards, the Committee will seek  
to replicate the fair value and, as far as practicable, the timing, form and performance requirements of the 
forfeited remuneration. The maximum value of replacement awards is capped at 50% of the individual’s  
base salary, and at least 50% of any replacement award should be delivered in the Company’s shares.
Other Should relocation of a newly recruited executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with this 
relocation will be met by the Company. Such relocation support may include, but not be limited, to payment 
of legal fees, removal costs, temporary accommodation/hotel costs, a contribution to stamp duty and 
replacement of non-transferable household items. In addition, and in appropriate circumstances, the  
Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment of school fees and the provision of  
tax advice. The Company will reimburse the executive Director for all reasonable expenses, which he/she  
may incur while carrying out executive duties.

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 102 Policy on payment for loss of office
The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take into account individual circumstances,  
including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties and applicable share plan and pension scheme rules  
(including any relevant performance conditions).
Vitaly Nesis is an executive Director of Polymetal International plc and Group CEO of JSC Polymetal, a 100% subsidiary of the Group, 
incorporated in Russia. Further details are set out in the current Directors’ service contracts section on page 105.
The table below summarises the key elements of the executive Director policy on payment for loss of office.
Area Policy and operation
Notice period Polymetal International 
6 months from Company 
6 months from Director
JSC Polymetal  
With immediate effect from Company  
1 month from Director
Compensation for  
loss of office in  
service contracts
No entitlement in respect of directorship of Polymetal International.
Up to three times average monthly salary in respect of directorship of JSC Polymetal in accordance with 
provisions of the labour law of the Russian Federation.
Treatment of annual 
bonus awards
Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of the performance year, but before 
the payment of the annual bonus is made, the executive may be eligible for an annual bonus award for that 
performance year subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period. No award will 
be made in the event of gross misconduct. Where an executive Director’ s employment is terminated during 
a performance year, a pro-rated annual bonus award for the period worked in that performance year may be 
payable, subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period.
Treatment of unvested 
Deferred Share Awards 
under plan rules
In normal circumstances, DSAs will continue until the normal time of vesting upon cessation of employment 
in Good Leaver Circumstances. Alternatively, the Board may determine that DSAs will vest immediately. In both 
circumstances there would be no pro-rating of the DSAs for time from the award date until cessation of 
employment or for performance.
Treatment of unvested 
Performance Share  
Plan awards under  
plan rules
Any outstanding award will lapse at cessation of employment with the Group, unless the cessation is due to 
Good Leaver Circumstances, in which case the award will usually vest as normal in accordance with the terms 
of the award. Alternatively, the Committee may determine that the award will vest immediately.
The Committee will determine the proportion of the award that will vest, taking into account (where relevant) the 
extent to which the performance conditions have been met or are likely to be met at the end of the performance 
period, and any other factors the Committee may consider relevant.
Exercise of discretion Any discretion available in determining the treatment of incentives upon termination of employment is intended 
only to be relied upon to provide flexibility in unusual circumstances. The Committee’s determination will take 
into account the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure and the recent performance of the Group.
Corporate event In relation to PSP awards, in the event that the Company’s shares cease to trade on the London Stock 
Exchange or any other recognised stock exchange (Delisting) or the Directors of the Company pass a 
resolution to the effect that Delisting is imminent or where the Board determines that a ‘significant event’ 
has occurred, which may be a demerger, winding-up or compulsory acquisition of the Company, or any 
other event as determined by the Board, at the discretion of the Board and, where applicable, with the  
consent of the acquiring company, PSP awards will not vest but will be exchanged for new PSP awards.
In the event that the PSP awards are exchanged for new PSP awards:
• The award date of the new PSP award shall be deemed to be the same as the award date of the  
original PSP award.
• The new PSP award will be in respect of shares in a company determined by the Board which may  
include any acquiring company.
• The new PSP award must be equivalent to the PSP award and will vest at the same time and in the 
same manner as the PSP award.
• Where relevant, either the vesting of the new PSP award must be subject to any performance conditions 
which are, so far as possible, equivalent to any conditions applying to the PSP award, or no performance 
conditions will apply but the value of shares comprised in the new PSP award shall be the value of the 
number of shares which would have vested under the PSP award if they had not been exchanged for 
new PSP awards.
DSAs shall vest immediately and shall not be pro-rated for time or performance if any of the events referred to 
above occur.

Statement of consideration of shareholders’ views
The Company received shareholder approval of its Remuneration Policy at the AGM on 16 May 2017 to cover a period of three years 
(99.10% of votes in favour). The policy applies from the date of approval. The Directors’ annual Remuneration Report was put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM of the Company and received 99.63% vote. The Committee regularly consults with the Company’s major 
shareholders, and sought their feedback on the revised Remuneration Policy.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the group
In determining salary increases for the Group CEO, the Committee takes into account a range of factors, including overall base salary 
increases awarded to the wider employee population during the year. 
Polymetal is firmly committed to acknowledging and rewarding employees’ hard work and achievements. To help us attract and retain 
the best candidates, we offer competitive remuneration package and benefits which exceed regional averages in our areas of operation.  
We also aim to provide a pleasant and effective working environment as well as training or further education and other opportunities to our 
employees. In 2017, 10% average compensation increase for the general workforce was made; in accordance with the new payment policy 
approved by the shareholders and to bring the salary of the Group CEO’s closer to the industry level, a 25% increase was made to the Group 
CEO’s base salary (in Roubles). Hence, the average compensation increase for the general workforce in 2011-2017 has been equivalent to 
16% per annum in Rouble terms, compared with an average base salary increase of 10% per annum in Rouble terms for the Group CEO.
For 2018, in line with Russian inflation, a 2.5% increase for all employees was approved by the Committee. The Committee also carefully 
reviewed whether an increase to the Group CEO in excess of 2.5% was appropriate in accordance with the policy, however, considering the 
favourable economic environment in Russia and strengthening of the Russian Rouble throughout 2017, no additional increase to the Group 
CEO was recommended.

Under the PSP, a conditional award of 47,249 ordinary shares with no par value was made to Mr Nesis in 2017, making the total number 
of options outstanding under the PSP 236,087. It is exercisable following respective four-year vesting periods, subject to performance 
measures determined by Polymetal. For this award, vesting is based on relative TSR, measured against the constituents of the FTSE Gold 
Mines Index and also on the Company’s absolute TSR. Peers are ranked and the Company’s position determines vesting (0% vests for 
below median performance; 20% vests at median performance; 100% vests at top decile performance and above). No award will vest if 
absolute TSR is negative, regardless of relative performance.

Performance graph 
The graph on page 97 illustrates the Company’s TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
companies), of which the Company is a constituent, from the date of the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange in October 2011. 
To provide context to the Company’s performance in its specific sector of operation, we also provide an illustration of the Company’s TSR 
relative to the constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines Index.

Percentage change in Group CEO’s remuneration
Excluding the value of long-term incentives, the percentage change in total remuneration for the Group CEO was a 46% increase from 
US$$496,411 in 2016 to US$726,928 in 2017 following 25% base salary increase effective from 1 April 2017. It was also positively 
affected by 15% appreciation of Russian Rouble against US Dollar. The average percentage change in total remuneration for all employees 
in US Dollar terms in the same year was a 33% increase mainly driven by Rouble appreciation and general increase in workforce.
To ensure the comparability of this figure, and to minimise distortions, the all-employee remuneration figure is based on full-time  
permanent employees.
Relative importance of spend on pay
The chart below shows how employee remuneration costs compare with profit before tax and distributions made to shareholders in  
2017 and 2016.
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2018 
In 2018, the Committee intends to implement the Remuneration Policy for executive and non-executive Directors as follows:
GROUP CEO
Base salary
In accordance with the policy and following careful consideration by the Committee, the Group CEO’s salary will be increased (in Roubles)  
by a total of 2.5% in 2018 in line with the rest of the workforce. Base salary for the Group CEO for 2017 and 2018 is set out below:
2018 salary

2017 salary

% change
Group CEO RUB 26,079,690 RUB 25,443,600 2.5%
US$ 434,662 US$ 424,060 2.5%
1 
 Base salary for 2018 is translated at the budgeted exchange rate of Rouble to US Dollar for 2018.
The Committee also carefully reviewed whether an increase in excess of 2.5% for the Group CEO was appropriate as per the policy. 
However, considering the favourable economic environment in Russia and reasonably stable RUB/US$ exchange rate throughout 2017  
(58.3 RUB/US$ average rate, 15% decrease compared to 2016), no additional increase was recommended. 
The Committee will review whether a further above-inflation increase remains appropriate in 2019 based on the market conditions, exchange 
rates and the Company’s results or other relevant considerations. 
Pension and benefits
No pension or benefits plans are in place for 2018, except for the defined pension contributions to the mandatory pension fund of the 
Russian Federation.
Annual bonus
The prospective targets for annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive by the Board, particularly in the gold mining 
industry, because of the sensitivity of information that their disclosure may provide to the Company’s competitors, given that these are largely 
based outside the UK and hence are not subject to the same reporting requirements as the Company. Targets and outcomes will be 
disclosed retrospectively at the end of the performance year.

Deferred Share Awards Plan
The Committee intends to defer annual bonus awards earned for the 2018 performance period in line with policy.
Performance Share Plan
The Committee intends to make an award under the PSP to the Group CEO in 2018, in line with the policy disclosed on page 97. Vesting is 
based on relative TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines Index and on the Company’s absolute TSR. Peers are 
ranked and the Company’s position determines vesting:
TSR vs. FTSE Gold Miners Pay-out
Below threshold Below median performance 0%
Threshold Median performance 20%
Maximum Upper decile performance 100%
Straight-line vesting will occur between median and upper decile performance. No award will vest for performance below median, or if the 
Company’s absolute TSR performance is negative, regardless of relative performance.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises four independent non-executive Directors who have no personal financial interest, other than as a 
shareholder (where applicable), in the matters to be decided. Mr Homeniuk will not be offering himself for re-election at the 2018 AGM of the 
Company. Mr Oliveira will become a member of the Committee subject to him being elected as a director of the Company at the 2018 AGM. 
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is shown in the table below.
Name Role
Christine Coignard Chair 
Leonard Homeniuk Member 
Jonathan Best Member
Giacomo Baizini Member
The principal functions of the Remuneration Committee under its terms of reference are:
 • to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive management;
 • to determine, within agreed terms of reference, the remuneration of the Chairman and specific remuneration packages for each of 
the executive Director, the Company Secretary and members of senior management, including pension rights and any 
compensation payments;
 • to formulate suitable performance criteria for the performance-based pay of executive management;
 • to review and oversee all aspects of any executive share scheme operated by or to be established by the Company; and
 • to oversee and advise the Board on any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company or the Group.
The full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance section on the Company’s website: 
www.polymetalinternational.com.
In 2017, the Financial Reporting Council (the FRC) announced plans for a comprehensive review of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code, which is expected to include changes relating to remuneration matters. The Committee will closely monitor the development  
and implement any changes if required.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
In 2017, the Remuneration Committee had four meetings. Further business conducted by the Committee was approved by written 
resolutions on two occasions. The following key areas were covered:
 • KPI structure review with particular focus on the choice and applicability of a sustainability KPI;
 • review of KPIs for 2017;
 • approval of annual bonus and share deferral under the DSA;
 • approval of PSP grant (including target levels and results of the previous grants);
 • gender equality in pay;
 • comprehensive Committee-effectiveness review, including feedback from the senior management;
 • terms of reference review;
 • annual reimbursement policy review;
 • annual Remuneration Report review;
 • review peers’ disclosure of targets in remuneration reports; 
 • target KPI disclosure;
 • review of regulatory changes and development of the Directors’ remuneration reporting; and
 • monitoring of market practice and changes in investors’ expectations.
The Board considers that the composition and work of the Remuneration Committee complies with the requirements of the UK Code. 
In 2017, the Committee performed its comprehensive effectiveness review. It was based on an internally developed questionnaire, taking into 
account on the one hand external factors including our Group regulatory environment, applicable governance as well as internationally 
acknowledged best practice, and on the other hand internal factors relating to Group matters including the Remuneration Policy and its 
application together with Committee’s terms of reference, yearly agenda, ways of working and output. Both Remuneration Committee 
directors and senior management involved in remuneration matters took part in the exercise.
The review was a good opportunity to reflect on the Committee’s work and have an open discussion about areas for improvement.  
The outcome was positive, particularly in relation to shareholder votes and good working relationships with the Board and the Group CEO. 
The Committee’s remits, ways of working and priorities were clarified.
Statement of voting at AGM
At the AGM held on 16 May 2017, votes for the Remuneration report and Remuneration policy were as follows:
Votes for Votes against Withheld
Remuneration Report 296,298,722 (99.63%) 1,101,272 (0.37%) 0

Advisors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) provided Polymetal with information and support in relation to the general remuneration matters and 
implementation of the Company’s remuneration policy. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group (RCG) and a signatory 
of the RCG Voluntary Code of Practice, and incorporates the principles of the Voluntary Code of Practice into its engagement. No other 
services were provided by PwC during 2017 other than external assurance services for the Company’s Sustainability report and tax 
advisory. Fees paid to PwC in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee in 2017 totalled US$16,654 (2016: US$13,875), 
with fees quoted in advance and based on the level of complexity of the work undertaken. 
PwC was selected in 2013, after submitting a proposal to management, to carry out benchmarking as part of a competitive process,  
the results of which were presented to the Remuneration Committee for approval.
During its work in 2017, the Committee was aided by the Group CEO, and senior finance and human resources executives of the Company.

The Directors submit the Annual Report of 
Polymetal International plc together with the 
audited financial statements of Polymetal 
International plc for the year ended  
31 December 2017 .
Corporate governance
Refer to pages 75 to 85 for a description of the Group’s corporate 
governance structure and policies.
Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account 
of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, 
its borrowings and other available credit facilities, and its forecast 
compliance with covenants on those borrowings and its capital 
expenditure commitments and plans. As at 31 December 2017, 
the Group held US$36 million of cash and had net debt of  
US$1,420 million. At 31 December 2017, the Group has undrawn 
facilities of US$1,361 million, of which US$1,266 million were 
considered committed.
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, 
having taken account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months 
from the date of this report and that it is appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Longer-term viability statement
Management proposes the following long-term viability statement  
in 2017 Annual Report with reference to discussions on strategy, 
objectives and business model:
Viability statement
Based on key drivers and measures of success used within the 
business, the Board assessed the prospects of the Group, taking 
account of potential impact of the principal risks to the Group’s 
business model and ability to deliver its strategy, including solvency 
and liquidity risks during the reasonably reliable lookout period.
Lookout period
The period over which the Board considers it possible to form a 
reasonable expectation as to the Group’s longer-term viability, based 
on the stress testing and scenario planning process employed by 
the Group, is the three-year period to December 2020. This is within 
the Group’s existing medium-term forecasting performed on the 
annual basis and covering strategic and investment medium-term 
planning. The Board is confident that routine operational risks are 
being effectively monitored and managed within the three-year 
lookout period and corporate scenario planning is focusing primarily 
on plausible changing external factors with a reasonable degree of 
confidence whilst still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook.
Principal risks
The Board has continued to place great emphasis on risk 
management in 2017 taking into account material external economic 
and geopolitical challenges and considering the Group’s 
responsiveness to changes within its business environment. 
The detailed assessment of principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group is set out on pages 68 to 74 of this Annual Report.
The corporate planning process is underpinned by life-of mine 
plans and stress scenario testing. The stress tests are designed 
to evaluate the resilience of the Group to the potential impact of 
principal risks and the availability and effectiveness of the mitigating 
actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or 
occurrence of the underlying risks. In considering the likely 
effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board’s 
regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems,  
as discussed on pages 86 to 91, were taken into account.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions underpinning the Board’s assessment include 
gold and silver prices, production volumes, foreign exchange rates 
and the ability to roll forward borrowing facilities as they fall due in 
the ordinary course of business. The key assumptions made are 
consistent with those used for business planning purposes, and also 
for the assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability 
of ore stockpiles and heap leach work in progress.
In making forecasts, full consideration has also been given to 
all other principal risks to the business. These risks have been 
considered in our stress testing where appropriate, or are 
considered to be either immaterial or too remote to affect  
our viability over a three-year period.
The risks are considered individually and in aggregate, 
where appropriate.
Liquidity and solvency
The sources of funding available to the Group are set out in  
Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements. Our base case 
projections demonstrate that the Group should be able to operate 
within the currently available debt facilities and comply with all 
related covenants during the lookout period. The committed 
undrawn facilities of US$1,266 million noted above have an average 
period of maturity of four years. 
Our stress testing focuses in particular on significant adverse changes 
in market prices of gold and silver or foreign exchange rates and 
demonstrates that under reasonably possible downside gold and 
silver price and exchange rate assumptions, the Group will continue 
maintaining liquidity and covenant compliance.
Expectations
The Board confirms that taking into account the Group’s current 
position and based upon the robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and stress testing-based assessment of the 
Group’s prospects, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period to 31 December 2020.
Financial and business reporting
The Board believes that the disclosures set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 74 of this Annual Report provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Directors
The Directors, their status and Board Committee memberships 
are set out on pages 76 to 77 of the Report.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The Board may appoint a person who is willing to act as a Director, 
either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director and, in either case, 
whether or not for a fixed term. Irrespective of the terms of his or her 
appointment, a Director so appointed shall hold office only until the 
next AGM. If not re-appointed at such AGM, he or she shall vacate 
office at its conclusion.
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, remove any Director from 
office (notwithstanding any provision of the Company’s Articles or 
of any agreement between the Company and such Director, but 
without prejudice to any claim that he or she may have for damages 
for breach of any such agreement). No special notice needs to 
be given of any resolution to remove a Director and no Director 
proposed to be removed has any special right to protest against his 
or her removal. The Company may, by ordinary resolution, appoint 
another person in place of a Director removed from office.
Directors’ interests
Information on Directors’ interests in shares of the Company is 
set out in the Remuneration Report on page 106.
Directors’ indemnities
To the extent permitted by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company has indemnified every Director and other officer  
of the Company (other than any person (whether an officer or not) 
engaged by the Company as auditor) out of the assets of the 
Company against any liability incurred by him or her for negligence, 
default, breach of duty, breach of trust or otherwise in relation to the 
affairs of the Company. This provision does not affect any indemnity 
to which a Director or officer is otherwise entitled.
Political donations
The Company may not make a political donation to a political 
party or other political organisation, or to an independent election 
candidate, or incur any political expenditure, unless such donation  
or expenditure is authorised by an ordinary resolution of 
shareholders passed before the donation is made or the expenditure 
incurred. No such donations were made in 2017 (2016: none).
Capital structure
The structure of the Company’s share capital is detailed in Note 30 
to the financial statements. There are no specific restrictions on the 
size of a holding or on the transfer of shares, which are both 
regulated by the Articles of the Company and applicable legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of shares or on voting rights.
The Articles of the Company can be altered by a special resolution 
of the Company. A resolution is a special resolution when it is 
passed by three-quarters of the members who (being entitled to 
do so) vote in person, or by proxy, at a General Meeting of the 
Company. Pursuant to the Company’s Articles, the Directors have 
the power to allot Equity Securities (as defined in the Articles).
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company, such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements and employees’ share plans. 
None of these is considered to be significant in terms of their likely 
impact on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the 
Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company 
and its Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss 
of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Substantial shareholdings in the Company are disclosed on page 194.
Details of employee option schemes are set out in the Remuneration 
Report on page 97. There were no acquisitions of the Company’s 
own shares in 2017. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group and its subsidiaries held 
no treasury shares (31 December 2016: no shares).
As at 31 December 2017, the Company had shareholders’ 
authority to purchase up to 43,011,266 of its own ordinary shares. 
At the AGM of the Company held in 2017, the power to allot Equity 
Securities was renewed up to an aggregate number of 143,370,887 
ordinary shares, provided that the Directors’ power in respect of 
such an amount may only be used in connection with a pre-emptive 
issue (as defined in the Articles).
The Directors are further empowered pursuant to Article 12.4 of 
the Company’s Articles to allot Equity Securities for cash as if  
Article 13 of the Articles (Pre-emptive rights) did not apply and  
for the purposes of paragraph (b) of Article 12.4 of the Articles,  
the Non Pre-emptive Shares (as defined in the Articles) are an 
aggregate number of up to 43,011,266 ordinary shares.
The authorities above will, unless previously revoked or varied, 
expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM (or, if earlier,  
at the close of business on the date which is 15 months after the 
date of the resolution which granted them, being 16 August 2018).

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 112 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the 
European Union (IFRS). The financial statements are required by law 
to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set 
out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework 
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, the Directors are 
also required to:
 • properly select and apply accounting policies;
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
 • make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
reasonably reliable lookout period of three years.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK and Jersey governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 • the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 • the management report, which is incorporated into the strategic 
report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

in 2017 were US$376 million (2016: US$382 million). In August 2017,  
the Company declared an interim dividend of US$0.14 per share 
(2016: US$0.09 per share), which was paid in September 2017.  
The Directors have proposed the payment of a final dividend of 
US$0.30 per share (2016: US$0.18 per share).
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of shareholders of the Company will take place 
on Wednesday 25 April 2018 at 11 am (BST) to be held at 
etc. venues Monument, 8 Eastcheap, London, EC3M 1AE, UK.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval  
of this Annual Report confirms that:
 • so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and 
 • the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have  
taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the  
Group’s auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office  
as auditor and a resolution to re-appoint it will be proposed at  
the forthcoming AGM. The Audit and Risk Committee reviews  
both the level of the audit fee and the level and nature of non-audit 
fees as part of its review of the adequacy and objectivity of the  
audit process.
Having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought to  
the attention of the Board during the year into account, we are 
satisfied that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 114 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements:
 • give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); and
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991.
We have audited the financial statements of Polymetal International PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) which comprise:
 • the consolidated income statement;
 • the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
 • the consolidated balance sheet;
 • the consolidated statement of cash flows;
 • the consolidated changes in equity; and
 • the related notes 1 to 34.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as issued by the IASB.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 • Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets
 • Recoverability of ore stock piles and heap leach work in progress 
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was US$22 million (2016: US$21 million)  
which was determined on the basis of adjusted profit before tax.
Scoping All reportable segments were subject to a full scope audit with the exception of the Armenian component 
where specific procedures were performed. This represents a change from 2016 where the Armenian 
component was subject to a full scope audit. 
Significant changes  
in our approach
The recoverability of operating and development assets and goodwill is no longer considered a significant 
risk due to sustained stable operational performance of the assets and reduced volatility in gold, silver and 
copper prices.
Accounting for acquisitions is also no longer considered a significant risk as the acquisitions to which it 
related, being Kapan in Armenia for $38m and Komarovskoye in Kazakhstan for US$120 million, were made  
in the prior year.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
report, add or draw attention to in respect 
of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether they were 
consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the 
knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to 
add or draw attention to in relation to:
 • the Disclosures on pages 68-74 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
 • the Directors’ confirmation on page 112 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
 • the Directors’ explanation on page 112 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to the prospects of 
the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
report, add or draw attention to in respect 
of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets
Key audit matter 
description
At 31 December 2017, the Group held US$150 million in respect of exploration and evaluation (E&E) assets.
Recoverability of E&E assets is dependent on the expected future success of exploration activities. E&E costs, 
including geophysical, topographical, geological and similar types of costs, are capitalised into exploration assets if 
management concludes that future economic benefits are likely to be realised based on an assessment of exploration 
results and identified mineral resources. 
The evaluation of each asset’s future prospects requires significant judgement.  According to IFRS 6 Exploration for 
and evaluation of mineral resources, the potential indicators of impairment include: management’s plans to discontinue 
the exploration activities, lack of further substantial exploration expenditure planned, expiry of exploration licences in 
the period or in the nearest future, or existence of other data indicating the expenditure capitalised is not recoverable.
The group’s accounting policy relating to E&E assets is set out on page 131 of the annual report,  
along with the disclosure note on page 151, and the Audit Committee’s consideration of the risk on page 89.
How the  
scope of our  
audit responded 
to the key audit 
matter
We have reviewed and challenged management’s assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of the Group’s E&E 
assets, the most significant being the Bolshevik asset in the Kazakhstan segment. 
We have reviewed the Board minutes to ensure there are no plans to discontinue exploration activities and reviewed the 
Board-approved budget for 2018 to check that specific exploration project spend was identified where relevant.
We have assessed the recoverability of assets by meeting with operational management to discuss material E&E 
assets, reviewing drilling and other testing results in the year and confirming future development plans.
We have reviewed licence conditions to ensure there were no breaches of key terms, and no licences have expired or 
expire in the near term.
We have performed detailed testing to assess the validity of costs capitalised in the year. 
Key 
observations
No impairments of E&E assets were identified from the work performed.
Recoverability of ore stock piles and heap leach work in progress
Key audit  
matter 
description
At 31 December 2017 the Group held US$265 million in respect of ore stockpiles and heap leach work in progress. 
The write-downs of these metal inventories in the year ended 31 December 2017 were US$18 million.
The assessment of the recoverability of ore stockpiles and heap leach work in progress requires management 
judgement in the determination of expected quantities of metal to be recovered, costs to process into concentrate 
or Doré for sale, and in estimating future revenue to be realised on sale. 
The Group’s accounting policy relating to valuation of inventory is set out on page 132 of the annual report, 
along with the disclosure note on page 155, and the Audit Committee’s consideration of the risk on page 89.
How the  
scope of our  
audit responded 
to the key audit 
matter
We have attended inventory counts performed by management’s experts, performed roll forward testing from the 
count dates through to year end by testing management’s metal inventory models and assessed management’s 
experts’ methodology, expertise and objectivity.
To challenge management’s recoverability assessment, we have analysed the metal inventory balances to identify 
adverse changes in costs per unit, and reviewed the production reports specifically focusing on unusual variances in 
grades of ore extracted, stockpiled and processed, achieved recoveries and technical losses in comparison to prior 
periods and approved life of mine plans. 
Where a recoverability risk has been identified, we have recalculated the projected net realisable values based on 
expected commodity prices, technological recoveries and costs to complete. We challenged management’s 
assumptions against the achieved technological recoveries, actual processing costs in the year and the approved 
life of mine plans. 
We have also performed substantive analytical procedures on management’s inventory costing calculations. 
Key 
observations
No additional write-downs of ore stockpiles and heap leach work in progress were identified from the work performed.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality US$22 million (2016: US$21 million)
Basis for determining 
materiality
We used adjusted profit before tax as a key benchmark, supported by a range of other relevant financial 
metrics, for determining the Group’s materiality. This approach is consistent with our 2016 audit and has 
given a materiality figure which represents 4.9% of the adjusted profit before tax figure (2016: 4%).
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
The profit before tax is adjusted to exclude net foreign exchange gains and losses which could, if included, 
distort materiality year on year. The use of this metric is consistent with our 2016 audit and has been  
chosen on the basis that the adjusted profit before tax is a key benchmark for management and  
investors to appraise the group’s performance. The adjustment for US$10 million net foreign exchange 
loss (2016: US$65 million net foreign exchange gain) is not significant in 2017.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$1.1m (2016: US$0.42m) 
for the group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The group holds various mining assets in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Our audit scope focused primarily on nine identified components 
(Voro, Okhotsk, Dukat, Omolon, Varvara, Amursk-Albazino, Mayskoye, Kyzyl and another single component comprising the support function 
corporate entities) such that 96% of revenue (2016: 100%) and 98% of assets (2016: 97%) were subject to a full scope audit. 
In addition to above, we have performed specific procedures on the Armenian component that consisted of specified procedures on 
recoverability of E&E assets and on provisionally priced sales, and reviews of all other balances. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement in the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit.
The Group audit team was involved in the work of the component auditors at all stages of the audit process. The signing partner and senior 
members of the Group engagement team visited the head office in St. Petersburg regularly in the year and continued to follow a programme 
of regular planned visits to the Group’s other business units which included a site visit to the Kyzyl mine in Kazakhstan in October 2017. 
The Group audit team directed and reviewed in detail the work on significant risks performed by the component auditors. 
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component, which were between US$8.8 million and  
US$19.8 million (2016: US$10.5 million and US$18.9 million) INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in 
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of 
the other information include where we conclude that:
 • Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the annual report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 • Audit and Risk Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee; or
 • Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing 
to report in 
respect of these 
matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 • proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate  
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 • the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.

Going concern 
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, its 
borrowings and other available credit facilities, and its forecast compliance with covenants on those borrowings and its capital expenditure 
commitments and plans. As at 31 December 2017, the Group held US$36 million of cash and had net debt of US$1,420 million, with 
US$1,361 million of additional undrawn facilities of which US$1,266 million are considered committed. Debt of US$26 million is due for 
payment within one year. The Group’s cash generation and liquidity remains strong and the Group believes it will be able to operate within 
existing facilities, but could secure additional financing if and when needed. 
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date 
of this report and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
Basis of presentation
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value as of end of the reporting period and share-based payments 
which are recognised at fair value as of measurement date. 
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2017. 
Amended accounting standards adopted by the Group
The following amendments to IFRSs became mandatory effective during the year ended 31 December 2017. The amendments generally 
require full retrospective application, with some amendments requiring prospective application.
 • Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative;
 • Amendments to IAS 7 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses; and
 • Amendments to IFRS 12 included in Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle.
The Group has determined these amendments do not have significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
New accounting standards issued but not yet effective
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
(IFRS 15), which covers principles that an entity shall apply to report information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, 
timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. Application of the standard is mandatory for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted. The Group has determined the impact of 
IFRS 15 on its consolidated financial statements with the primary focus being understanding those sales contracts where the timing and 
amount of revenue recognised could differ under IFRS 15, which may occur for example if contracts with customers incorporate 
performance obligations not currently recognised separately, or where such contracts incorporate variable consideration. 
The Group’s revenue is primarily derived from commodity sales, for which the point of recognition is dependent on the contract sales terms, 
known as the international commercial terms (Incoterms). As the transfer of risks and rewards generally coincides with the transfer of 
control at a point in time under incoterms, the timing and amount of revenue recognised by the Group for the sale of commodities is not 
materially affected. 
For the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) and Cost and Freight (CFR) the seller must contract for and pay the costs and freight 
necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination. Consequently, the freight service on export commodity contracts with CIF/
CFR incoterms represents a separate performance obligation as defined under the new standard, and a portion of the revenue earned under 
these contracts, representing the obligation to perform the freight service, is deferred and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, 
along with the associated costs. 
The impact of applying the change during the year ended 31 December 2017 would be to reduce revenue and operating costs respectively 
by US$9 million with no impact on profit. There would be no effect on current assets and current liabilities as at 31 December 2017.
The Group plans to use the modified approach, so the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 will be recognised as an adjustment to 
the opening balance of retained earnings as of 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments. In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial instruments (‘IFRS 9’). This standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and permits early adoption. IFRS 9 provides a revised model for 
recognition, measurement and impairment of financial instruments. IFRS 9 also includes a substantially reformed approach to hedge 
accounting. The Group has determined the impact of IFRS 9 on its consolidated financial statements with the primary focus being on  
the application of the ‘expected credit loss’ model under which an entity calculates the allowance for credit losses by considering on a 
discounted basis the cash shortfalls it would incur in various default scenarios for prescribed future periods and multiplying the shortfalls  
by the probability of each scenario occurring. 
The impacts of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group results for the year ended 31 December 2017 are as follows:
 • Impairment: The impact of the introduction of an ‘expected credit loss’ model for the assessment of impairment of financial assets held 
under amortised cost would be to increase the Group’s operating costs by US$4 million and decrease the Group’s profit before tax by 
US$4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, and to reduce current assets by US$4 million at 31 December 2017.
 • Classification and measurement: The measurement and accounting treatment of the Group’s financial assets is unchanged on application 
of the new standard.
 • Hedge accounting: no impact as the Group does not elect to use hedge accounting.
As these effects are considered immaterial to the Group, the Group has elected not to restate prior period on adoption of the new standard 
in 2018. 
IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 replaces the following standards and interpretations: IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an 
Arrangement contains a Lease. The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model for the recognition, measurement, presentation 
and disclosure of leases. IFRS 16 applies to all leases including subleases and requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all 
leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating 
or finance. Application of the standard is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier 
application permitted. The Group is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor 
and its Associate or Joint Venture remove an inconsistency between the two standards on the accounting treatment for gains and losses 
arising on the sale or contribution of assets by an investor to its associate or joint venture. Following the amendment, such gains and losses 
may only be recognised to the extent of the unrelated investor’s interest, except where the transaction involves assets that constitute a 
business. In December 2015, the IASB has postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research 
project on the equity method accounting. The Group doesn’t expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of consolidations
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, from the date that 
control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively ceased. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity 
transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between 1) the aggregated  
fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2) the previous carrying amount of the assets  
(including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
Business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. When acquiring 
new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute an integrated 
set of activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant, and thus 
whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance provided in the standard. Acquisitions of businesses are 
accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the 
date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of  
the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Transaction costs incurred in 
connection with the business combination are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition may include an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred  
in a business combination. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition retrospectively with the 
corresponding adjustment against goodwill where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. Measurement period adjustments  
are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed 
at the acquisition date. The measurement period may not exceed one year from the effective date of the acquisition. The subsequent 
accounting for contingent consideration that does not qualify for as a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent 
consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not subsequently remeasured. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being 
recognised in profit or loss.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 • deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, respectively;
 • liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements  
of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2  
Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and
 • assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value 
at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in equity are 
reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest was disposed of. 
Goodwill and goodwill impairment
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount 
of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any),  
the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated  
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. 
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount  
of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition of mining licences
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent a business, 
it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and, accordingly, the transaction is accounted for 
as the acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost. Where asset acquisition is achieved in stages net assets 
acquired are accounted for sum of cost of the original interest acquired and the cost of additional interest acquired.
Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement. 
Significant influence constitutes the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not extend to 
a control or joint control over the enactment of those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the 
consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
A joint arrangement is defined as an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties 
sharing control.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather 
than by receiving a share of the results of trading. In relation to its interest in a joint operation, the Group recognises: its share of assets and 
liabilities; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the joint 
operation; and its share of expenses. 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement and is 
accounted for using the equity accounting method.
When entering in a new joint arrangement, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the parties that have joint control over the 
arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement (joint operation) or rights to the net assets 
of the arrangement (joint venture), using the guidance provided in the standard. When a joint arrangement has been structured through a 
separate vehicle, consideration has been given to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, 
when relevant, other facts and circumstances.
Equity method of accounting
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB). The functional currency of the Group’s entities located and 
operating in Kazakhstan (Varvarinskoye JSC, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLC, Inter Gold Capital LLC, Komarovskoye Mining Company LLC) 
is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT). The functional currency of the Group’s entity located and operating in Amenia (Kapan MPC CJSC) is the 
Armenian Dram (AMD). The functional currency of the parent company Polymetal International plc and its intermediate holding companies 
is US Dollar.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of 
an investee at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess 
of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after 
reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the  
Group’s investments. Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with an indefinite useful life, 
the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets 
(IAS 36) as a single cash generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal 
of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36.
When a Group entity transacts with its investees, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the investee are recognised in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate or the jont venture that are not related to the Group.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB). The functional currency of the Group’s entities located and 
operating in Kazakhstan (Varvarinskoye JSC, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLC, Inter Gold Capital LLC, Komarovskoye Mining Company LLC) 
is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT). The functional currency of the Group’s entity located and operating in Amenia (Kapan MPC CJSC) is the 
Armenian Dram (AMD). The functional currency of the parent company Polymetal International plc and its intermediate holding companies 
is US Dollars.
The Group has chosen to present its consolidated financial statements in U.S. Dollars (US$), as management believes it is a more 
convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it is a common presentation 
currency in the mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group entities from their functional currencies to the 
presentation currency is performed as follows:
 • all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date;
 • all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant transactions 
that are translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
 • resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as movements relating to the effect of 
translation to the Group’s presentation currency within the Translation reserve in equity; and
 • in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented are translated 
using exchange rates prevalent at those respective dates. All cash flows in the period are translated at the average exchange rates for  
the periods presented, except for significant transactions that are translated at rates on the date of transaction.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of 
control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that  
includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation),  
all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are  
reclassified to profit or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation,  
the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in  
the consolidated income statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in associates or jointly 
controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated 
exchange differences is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. 
Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
The Group translates its income and expenses in presentation currency on a monthly basis. During the years ended 31 December 2017 and 
31 December 2016 exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements were as follows:

The Russian Rouble, Kazakh Tenge and Armenian Dram are not freely convertible currencies outside the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan 
and Armenia, accordingly, any translation of Russian Rouble, Kazakh Tenge and Armenian Dram denominated assets and liabilities into  
US Dollar for the purpose of the presentation of consolidated financial statements does not imply that the Group could or will in the future 
realise or settle in US Dollars the translated values of these assets and liabilities.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates 
prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
transaction. Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which the most recent fair 
value was determined. Exchange differences arising from changes in exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Exchange differences generated by monetary items that forms part of the intragroup net investment in the foreign operation are recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements within foreign currency translation reserve.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are depreciated to their residual 
values using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable ore reserves according to the JORC Code, which is the basis on 
which the Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in proven and probable reserves are dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged 
on new mining ventures from the date that the mining asset is capable of commercial production. In respect of those mining assets whose 
useful lives are expected to be less than the life of the mine, depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. 
Mineral rights for the assets under development are included within Exploration and development. When a production phase is started, 
mineral rights are transferred into Mining assets and are depreciated as described below.
Capital construction-in-progress
Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets 
are ready for their intended use. 
Exploration and development assets
Mineral exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, geological and similar types of costs, are capitalised into 
exploration assets if management concludes that future economic benefits are likely to be realised based on current internal assessment 
of exploration results and identified mineral resources. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are transferred to development assets when commercially-viable reserves are identified, so that the 
entity first establishes proved-and-probable reserves in accordance with JORC Code and respective mining plan and model are prepared 
and approved. At the time of reclassisfication exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment based on the economic 
models prepared.
The costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred to as stripping costs, are capitalised 
as a part of mining assets when these costs are incurred.
Non-mining assets
Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When parts of an item of 
property, plant and equipment are considered to have different useful lives, they are accounted for and depreciated separately. Depreciation 
methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives are as set out below:
 • Machinery and equipment  5 – 20 years
 • Transportation and other assets 3 – 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the asset’s 
carrying amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Stripping costs
During the production phase of a mine when the benefit from the stripping activity is the improved access to a component of the ore body  
in future periods, the stripping costs in excess of the average ore to waste ratio for the life-of-mine of that component are recognised as a 
non-current asset. After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a systematic basis (unit-of-production method)  
over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body made accessible as a result of the stripping activity.
Estimated ore reserves
Estimated proven and probable ore reserves reflect the economically recoverable quantities which can be legally recovered in the future from 
known mineral deposits. The Group’s reserves are estimated in accordance with JORC Code.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Leases
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals arising under 
operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
An impairment review of property, plant and equipment is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recoverable amount of the 
asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The carrying amounts of all the cash-generating units are 
assessed against their recoverable amounts determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. Fair value is based on the 
application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash flows. The DCF method is attributable to the development of 
proved and probable reserves and certain resources where a relevant resource-to-reserve conversion ratio can be reasonably applied.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the 
consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the original carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods. Impairment loss may be subsequently reversed if there has 
been a significant change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
Inventories
Metal inventories
Inventories including refined metals, metals in concentrate and in process, doré and ore stockpiles are stated at the lower of production cost 
or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures incurred directly or indirectly in bringing 
inventories to their existing condition and location. Work in-process, metal concentrate, doré and refined metal are valued at the average 
total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production (i.e. the costs are allocated proportionally to unified metal where unified 
metal is calculated based on prevailing market metal prices). Ore stockpiles are valued at the average cost of mining that ore. Where ore 
stockpiles and work in-process are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are classified as non-current.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on forward metal prices for inventories which are expected 
to be realised within 12 months, and the flat long-term metal prices non-current inventories, less estimated costs to complete production and 
selling costs.
Consumables and spare parts
Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average moving 
cost. The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classified as a long-term asset in 
the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion 
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added 
to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement.
Financial Instruments Designated as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
A financial instrument other than a financial instrument held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 • such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
 • the financial instrument forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information 
about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
 • it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial instruments at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.  
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 28.
Effective interest rate method
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest income or 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including 
all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) 
through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) financial assets and 
‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial 
recognition. No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale and FVTPL.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans 
and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest income is determined 
by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets 
are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. For equity investments classified as 
AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
 • significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 • breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 • it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or
 • the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written-off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
through the consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed 
does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest 
in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.  
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised  
in the consolidated income statement.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the hybrid contracts are not measured at FVTPL. Further details of derivative financial instruments 
are disclosed in Note 28.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months 
or fewer, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, 
taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to 
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Environmental obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production of mining assets. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, 
discounted to their net present value using a risk-free rate applicable to the future cash flows, are provided for and capitalised at the start of 
each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over 
the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset in the cost of sales line and the unwinding of the discount on the provision in 
the finance costs line. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided 
for at their net present values and recognised in the consolidated income statement as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result from changes 
in the estimated timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted from the cost of the related 
asset in the current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised immediately in  
the consolidated income statement.
The provision for closure cost obligations is remeasured at the end of each reporting period for changes in estimates and circumstances. 
Changes in estimates and circumstances include changes in legal or regulatory requirements, increased obligations arising from additional 
mining and exploration activities, changes to cost estimates and changes to the risk free interest rate.
Employee benefit obligations
Remuneration paid to employees in respect of services rendered during a reporting period is recognised as an expense in that reporting 
period. The Group pays mandatory contributions to the state social funds, including the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and 
Kazakhstan, which are expensed as incurred.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed in accordance with 
the laws of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income 
statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated 
with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 
which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or  
the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when they relate to items that are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial 
accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
Uncertain tax positions
Provision for uncertain tax positions is recognised within current tax when management determines that it is probable that a payment will be 
made to the tax authority. For such tax positions the amount of the probable ultimate settlement with the related tax authority is recorded. 
When the uncertain tax position gives rise to a contingent tax liability for which no provision is recognised, the Group discloses tax-related 
contingent liabilities and contingent assets in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullions and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured at the fair 
value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.
Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper, gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor control over the goods sold, the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the 
Group. Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced value of metal shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT).
Sale of gold and silver bullion
The Group processes doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Okhotsk operations, Voro, Omolon, and Amursk-Albazino) into 
London Good Delivery Bars prior to sale. This final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four state-owned refineries. 
The Group sells gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price, as determined in the agreement, may be 
variable based upon the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot or fixed price, however the Group does not enter into fixed price 
contracts. For domestic sales, title passes from the Group to the purchaser at the refinery gate with revenue recognised at that point. For 
export sales, once the gold and/or silver bars have been approved for export by Russian customs, they are then transported to the vault of 
the purchaser, which is typically located in London. Title passes and revenue is recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are 
received by the purchaser.
Sales of copper, zinc, gold and silver concentrate
The Group sells copper, zinc, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted market 
prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices for the expected date of 
final settlement. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass to the buyer. Revenue is calculated 
based on the copper, zinc, gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) or 
London Metal Exchange (LME) price to the estimated final pricing date, adjusted for the specific terms of the relevant agreement. Until final 
settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue are made to take into account the changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information 
and assay. Revenue is presented net of refining and treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced.
The Group’s sales of copper, zinc, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded derivative that is 
required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrate at the 
forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL with 
changes in its fair value recognised within revenue in the consolidated income statement for each period prior to the final settlement.
Share-based compensation
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to account for share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies to recognise 
compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
The fair value of the awards granted under Performance Share Plan (as defined in the Remuneration report) is estimated using a  
Monte-Carlo model valuation (see note 31). 
Awards which are granted under Deferred Share Awards plan and are released over a period of three years, are measured at share price  
at a grant date and are prorated across periods to the different vest dates (see Note 31).
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general, administrative and selling expense over the vesting period with a 
corresponding increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Upon the exercise of the awards the amounts recognised within  
the share-based compensation reserve are transferred to stated capital account.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Earnings per share
Earnings-per-share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted 
earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise of dilutive stock 
options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed to be used in purchasing the 
Company’s common shares at their average market price for the period.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the course of preparing the financial statements, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that can have a significant 
impact on those financial statements. The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, 
current and expected economic conditions, and all other available information.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates 
are revised and in the future periods affected. The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or complexity are set out below. 
Critical accounting judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimation (which are dealt with separately below), made in the 
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements.
Accounting for joint arrangements 
When the Group enters into arrangements with other parties for the joint ownership of particular assets or developments, it must assess 
whether the arrangements constitute control, joint operations or a joint venture based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the 
joint arrangements (Note 2 sets out the related accounting policies). 
As at 31 December 2016, the Group held a 17.66% interest in JSC South-Verkhoyansk Mining Company (Nezhda) with a carrying value of 
US$21 million (see note 20 to the financial statements). At that time, the Group considered its associated rights and obligations, and 
concluded that it jointly controlled Nezhda.
In July 2017 Polymetal entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 7% in Nezhda for a cash consideration of US$8 million, from its 
joint venture partner. At the same time, the Group acquired an option to buy out the remaining 75.3% in Nezhda, which is exercisable 
between 1 February and 1 June 2018 at the Group’s discretion, with the option cost being US$12 million. The completion of the purchase of  
the additional 7% share in the JV and exercise of the option are subject to various Governmental approvals as noted below. The Group has 
determined that until it is able to complete these transactions, it remains in joint control over Nezhda, and accordingly the classification of  
the arrangements continue to meet the definition of a joint venture as per IFRS Joint arrangements. 
Assessment of indicators of impairment of operating and development assets
The Group is required to conduct an impairment test where there is an indication of impairment of an asset or a cash-generating unit. 
For goodwill, an annual impairment test is required. Judgement is required in the assessment of whether indicators or impairment  
(or its reversal) exist. 
Operating and economic assumptions, which could affect the valuation of assets using discounted cash flows, are updated regularly as 
part of the Group’s planning and forecasting processes. Significant judgement is required to determine whether any economic or operating 
assumptions represent significant changes in the economic value of an asset or CGU. Discounted cash flow models are prepared on the 
basis of such assumptions to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.
In addition, indicators for impairment reversal must be assessed for assets (other than goodwill) previously impaired. Any change to 
operational plans or assumptions, economic parameters, or the passage of time, could result in an impairment reversal, or further 
impairment, if an indicator is identified.
In making the assessment for impairment indicators, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate 
cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash inflows to 
appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation. 
Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could impact the carrying value of the respective 
assets. Refer to Note 19 for further information.
Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets include mineral rights and exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, 
geological and similar types of costs. Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised if management concludes that future economic 
benefits are likely to be realised and determines that economically viable extraction operation can be established as a result of exploration 
activities and internal assessment of mineral resources. 
According to IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, the potential indicators of impairment include: management’s plans 
to discontinue the exploration activities, lack of further substantial exploration expenditure planned, expiry of exploration licences in the 
period or in the nearest future, or existence of other data indicating the expenditure capitalised is not recoverable. At the end of each 
reporting period, management assesses whether such indicators exist for the exploration and evaluation assets capitalised, which requires 
significant judgement.
As of 31 December 2017 total exploration and evaluation costs capitalised amount to US$176 million (2016: US$140 million) with the  
most significant asset of US$60 million (2016: US$60 million) attributable to the Kyzyl project flanks and satellite deposit Bolshevik. 
The Group also has a significant interest in the Nezhda joint venture amounting to US$67 million (see Note 20) as noted above. 
The completion of the purchase of an additional 7% share in the JV and exercise of the option over the remaining equity are subject to 
approval by the Russian Federal Government’s Commission on Foreign Investments into Companies of Strategic Importance. The exercise 
of the option is also subject to approval by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. The Group has taken the judgement that it is likely 
that these approvals will be provided, but is also confident that it will be able to enter into revised arrangements or take alternative mitigating 
action if required to ensure that it can complete the acquisition of the Nezhda project. However, there remains a risk that the Group will 
not be able to exercise the option, in which case the management will reassess the recoverability of the investment which could lead to 
a material impairment charge. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that carry the most significant risk of material effect on next year’s accounts,  
being items where actual outcomes in the next 12 months could vary significantly from the estimates made in determining the reported 
amount of an asset or liability.
Cash flow projections for impairment testing
Expected future cash flows used in discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. They are 
significantly affected by a number of factors including ore reserves, together with economic factors such as commodity prices, exchange 
rates, discount rates and estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
 • Ore reserves and mineral resources – Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and resources 
in existence. Reserves and resources are incorporated in projected cash flows based on ore reserve statements and exploration and 
evaluation work undertaken by appropriately qualified persons (see below). Mineral resources, adjusted by certain conversion ratio, 
are included where management has a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction, despite additional evaluation still being 
required prior to meeting the required confidence to convert to ore reserves.
 • Commodity prices – Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources of information. 
Polymetal currently use a flat real long-term gold and silver price of US$1,200 per ounce (2016: US$1,200) and US$16 per ounce  
(2016: US$16), respectively.
 • Foreign exchange rates - Foreign exchange rates are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked with external sources of information 
for relevant countries of operation. Management have analysed RUB/US$ rate movements for the year ended 31 December 2017. RUB/
US$ exchange rate is estimated at 60 RUB/US$ (2016: 60 RUB/US$).
 • Discount rates – The Group used a post-tax real discount rate of 9.0% (2016: 9.0%). Cash flow projections used in fair value less costs of 
disposal impairment models are discounted based on this rate.
 • Operating costs, capital expenditure and other operating factors – Cost assumptions incorporate management experience and 
expectations, as well as the nature and location of the operation and the risks associated there with. Underlying input cost assumptions 
are consistent with related output price assumptions. Other operating factors, such as the timelines of granting licences and permits are 
based on management’s best estimate of the outcome of uncertain future events at the balance sheet date.
Ore reserves
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s properties. 
Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-of-production method; 
impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs. Also, for the purpose of 
impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs, management may take 
into account mineral resources in addition to ore reserves where there is a high degree of confidence that such resources will be extracted.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, including 
quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices, 
discount rates and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies  
to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill samples. This process may require complex and 
difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course of operations or 
if there are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect the Group’s financial results 
and financial position in a number of ways, including the following:
 • asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash flows;
 • depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the units-of-production method;
 • provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing of 
the payment of such costs;
 • carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value of the relevant assets 
and liabilities; and
• contingent consideration liabilities where these are determined by the future production levels.
Ore reserves are subject to the annual re-estimation (please refer to the Reserves and Resources section of the Annual Report). 
Based on the ore reserves estimate as of 1 January 2018, the depreciation charge for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease  
by US$15 million.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED
Recoverability of deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised (Note 16). There is an application of judgement in assessing the 
amount, timing and probability of future taxable profits and repatriation of retained earnings. These factors affect the determination of the 
appropriate rates of tax to apply and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. These judgements are influenced, inter alia, by factors such as 
estimates of future production, commodity lines, operating costs, future capital expenditure and dividend policies. If actual results differ from 
these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be 
negatively affected. 
Deferred tax assets arising from tax losses carried forward recognised as of 31 December 2017 amount to US$126 million (2016:  
US$105 million). Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by ZK Mayskoye 
LLC (Russian Federation), JSC Varvarinskoye and Bakyrchik Mining LLC (Kazakhstan). Each legal entity within the Group represents a 
separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes. The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other 
entities of the Group. Gross tax losses carried forward of US$448 million (2016: US$435 million), for which a deferred tax asset is 
recognised in JSC Varvarinskoye and Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLC are available during the period up to 2026, with the most significant 
portion expiring in 2025 (Note 16). The remaining gross tax losses have an indefinite life.
Recoverability of stockpiles and work in-process
The assessment of the recoverability of metal inventories requires judgement both in terms of calculating expected costs to process and 
refine ore stock piles to produce concentrate or doré for sale, and in terms of estimating future prices to be realised on sale (Note 21).  
The Group uses survey and assay techniques to estimate quantities of the ore stockpiled and ore stacked in heap leach pads, as well  
as the recoverable metal in the this material and work in-process. The amount of the recoverable metals, that will be available for sale,  
is determined based on technological recoveries, which are established for each deposit and extraction technology. Changes in these 
estimates can result in a change in mine operating costs of future periods and carrying amounts of inventories. 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group provided for net realisable value of metal inventories in the amount of US$16 million 
(year ended 31 December 2016: write-down of US$21 million).
The amount of inventories held at net realisable value at 31 December 2017 is US$60 million (31 December 2016: US$45 million).
The key assumptions used in determining the net realisable value of inventories at 31 December 2017 are consistent with those used 
for goodwill impairment testing.
Valuation of contingent consideration payable
The Group has recorded contingent consideration liabilities of US$62 million as at 31 December 2017 (2016: $76 million) related to 
various acquisitions made, as set out in Note 28 to the financial statements. Various estimates must be made when determining the  
value of contingent consideration to be recognised at each balance sheet date. The assumptions made are consistent with those  
made for impairment testing purposes (see above), and additional assumptions are included in Note 28. Significant changes in  
assumptions could cause an increase, or reduction, in the amount of contingent consideration payable, with a resulting charge  
or credit in the Group income statement. 
4. ACQUISITIONS
(a) Year ended 31 December 2017
Primorskaya GGK LLC
In May 2017 Polymetal purchased a 100% interest in Primorskaya GGK LLC, a company holding several licences for the silver-gold 
properties located in the Primorskiy region of Russia, from an unrelated party for a cash consideration of US$2 million.
The company does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 and thus it was accounted for as an acquisition of a group 
of assets. The Group has purchased mineral rights of US$2 million.
(b) Year ended 31 December 2016
Kapan
In March 2016 Polymetal entered into binding agreements with Dundee Precious Metals Inc (Dundee). for the acquisition of CJSC Dundee 
Precious Metals Kapan (DPMK), the holding company for the Kapan Gold Mine (Kapan) in the Republic of Armenia. 
On 28 April 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the shares of DPMK. 
The asset comprises a fully mechanised underground mine and a conventional 750 ktpa flotation concentrator and various infrastructure 
facilities. The mine produces gold, copper, silver and zinc concentrates sold to international markets. 
Kapan meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 and thus was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition method. 
Consideration transferred
The total consideration for the shares at completion comprised US$38 million consisting of US$14 million payable in cash (including post-
closing working capital adjustment amounting to US$5 million) and US$15 million paid through the issue of 1,481,785 new ordinary shares 
of the Company. In addition, Dundee receives a 2% NSR (Net Smelter Return) royalty on the future production from the Kapan Gold Mine 
capped at US$25 million.
The fair value of the 1,481,785 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Kapan was determined based on spot price as of 
acquisition date, being US$10.28, and amounts to US$15 million.
The net smelter return royalty described above meets the definition of contingent consideration. The fair value of the contingent 
consideration was determined based on the life-of-mine model of the Kapan mine by discounting projected cash flows to the acquisition 
date. The following metal price assumptions, consistent with the assumptions adopted for the long-term planning at the time of acquisition, 
were used for the fair value calculation: Au – US$1,250/oz, Ag – US$17/oz, Cu – US$4,500/tonne, Zinc – US$ 1,800/tonne, real post-tax 
discount rate of 9.04%. At the acquisition date, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration amounted to US$9 million. 
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition
As of date of finalisation of the interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2016 the fair value of the assets 
acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition was provisionally accounted for, as well as the amount of the post-closing 
working capital adjustment. A post-closing working capital adjustment of US$5 million was outstanding as of 31 December 2016 and 
was included in account payable. The amount was paid during the year ended 31 December 2017.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and its reconciliation to the provisionally 
accounting are set out in the table below:

carrying value.
Komarovskoye 
On 4 April 2016 Polymetal entered into a binding agreement with Kazzinc LTD, a subsidiary of Glencore International plc, for the acquisition  
of Orion Minerals LLC, the holding company for the Komarovskoye Gold Deposit (Komarovskoye) in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The asset comprises an active open pit mine and a 500 ktpa heap leach facility with grid power available on site. Polymetal aims to mine,  
deliver by rail and process at Varvara up to 2 Mtpa of ore with potential to increase Varvara’s annual production at lower cash costs. 
The acquisition of the Komarovskoye was completed on 1 August 2016, following receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
Management considers that the control over the Komarovskoye was obtained on the date of the deal completion.
Komarovskoye meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 thus it was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition method. 
The total consideration for Komarovskoye was US$100 million payable in cash. In addition, a deferred consideration contingent upon future 
production levels and gold price performance, will be paid to Kazzinc LTD. The royalty is calculated on a quarterly basis, based on contained 
gold in ore mined per relevant quarter and is payable at gold prices above US$1,250 per ounce. The royalty is capped at a total 
consideration of US$80 million.

4. ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
Consideration transferred
Deferred consideration described above meets definition of the contingent consideration. The fair value of the contingent consideration 
was determined based on the life-of-mine model of the Komarovskoye mine and calculated using Monte Carlo modelling. Projected cash 
flows were discounted to the acquisition date at a discount rate of 9.04%. Gold price volatility was assessed at 18.08%, average gold  
price for one quarter to the valuation date was US$1,291/ounce. As at acquisition date the estimated contingent consideration amounts  
to US$20 million. 
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition
As at 31 December 2016, purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Komarovskoye was not completed and mineral rights and 
environmental obligations were accounted for on a provisional basis. The Group completed the purchase price allocation review during 
the year ended 31 December 2017 and made no adjustments to the provisional calculation.
The management believes that this business acquisition does not give rise to goodwill and excess of consideration over identifiable net asset 
assets of the acquiree should be fully attributed the mineral rights. The amount recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed are set out in the table below:

Saum Mining Company LLC
On 2 December 2016 Polymetal International plc acquired an 80% stake in Saum Mining Company LLC, a licence holder for the Saum 
polymetallic deposit (Saum). Polymetal issued 1,120,690 new Company shares (Consideration shares), representing 0.26% of Polymetal’s 
total increased share capital in connection with the acquisition of an 80% stake in Saum from an unrelated party. The total transaction value 
is approximately US$10.7 million.
The Saum licence covers an area of 34.2 km
2
 in Russia’s Sverdlovsk region in the Ural Mountains and is located and approximately 240 km 
from Polymetal’s Voro processing plant. Polymetal plans to prepare an ore reserves estimate in Q4 2017. Further drilling is planned on the 
property in 2017 and 2018.
Saum does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3, as it represents acquisition of mining license through a non-operating 
corporate entity, and thus it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights of US$10 million 
and other current assets of US$1 million.
5. SEGMENT INFORMATION
During the year ended 31 December 2017 management has reviewed the segmental presentation of financial information it requires to 
assess performance and allocate resources. It now considers a more geographic-focused reporting format based on the location of 
operating activities to be more meaningful from a management and forecasting perspective, as well as aligned to the management structure, 
reporting and practices.
The Group has identified five reportable segments:
 • Magadan (Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC, Magadan Silver JSC, Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC);
 • Ural (Gold of Northern Urals CJSC);
 • Khabarovsk (Albazino Resources Ltd, Amur Hydrometallurgical Plant LLC, Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company LLC,  
Svetloye LLC);
 • Kazakhstan (Varvarinskoye JSC, Komarovskoye Mining Company LLC, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLC, Inter Gold Capital LLC); and
 • Armenia (Kapan MPC CJSC, Lichkvaz CJSC).
Reportable segments are determined based on the Group’s internal management reports, which are separated based on the Group’s 
geographical structure. Minor companies and activities (management, exploration, purchasing and other companies) which do not meet the 
reportable segment criteria are disclosed within corporate and other segment. Each segment is engaged in gold, silver or copper mining and 
related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. The Group’s segments are based in the Russian Federation, 
Kazakhstan and Armenia.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the CODM) use to evaluate the performance of the Group is 
segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, write-downs and reversals of 
inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, bad debt allowance, gains or losses arising 
on acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, finance 
income, finance costs, income tax expenses and tax exposure accrued within other operating expenses. The accounting policies of the 
reportable segments are consistent with those of the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS.
Revenue shown as corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories, spare parts and 
fixed assets, and rendering management services to the Group’s production entities. Intersegment revenue is recognised based on costs 
incurred plus a fixed margin basis. External revenue shown within corporate and other represents revenue from services provided to third 
parties by the Group’s non-mining subsidiaries. 
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore are not 
disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The segment adjusted EBITDA reconciles to the profit before income tax as 
shown on the next page.

Mining tax includes royalties payable in Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Mining tax in Russian Federation and Kazakhstan is 
calculated based on the value of the precious metals extracted in the period. This value is usually determined based on the realised selling price 
of precious metals or, in case if there were no sales during the period, cost of production of metals extracted (Russian Federation) or the 
average market price (Kazakhstan) during the period. The royalty payable in Armenia is calculated as a percentage of actual sales during the 
reporting period.
Mining tax in respect of the metal inventories produced or sold during the year is recognised within cost of sales, while the additional mining tax 
accruals in respect of various disputes with tax authorities are recognised within other expenses (see Note 12).
Idle capacities and abnormal production costs were expensed as incurred and relate to idle capacities when processing plants are stopped for 
general maintenance.

From 1 January 2017 Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC and Magadan Silver JSC are entitled to the decreased statutory income tax rate  
of 17% (2016: 18%) for the operations held in the Special Economic Zone of the Russian Far East, as well as decreased mining tax rate 
(paying at 60% of the standard mining tax rates). In return for obtaining this tax relief the members of the regional free economic zone are 
obliged to invest 50% of their tax savings each year in the Special Economic Zone Development Programme, amounting to US$12 million 
in the reporting year (2016: US$14 million). 
Additional mining taxes, VAT, penalties and accrued interest have been accrued in respect of various disputes with the Russian and 
Armenian tax authorities.  
Total provision for additional property taxes, mining taxes and VAT exposures, penalties and accrued interest as of 31 December 2017 is 
US$7 million (31 December 2016: US$14 million). During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group has paid US$6 million related to 
royalty provisions identified as of 31 December 2016 and released US$6 million of accrued penalties and interest due to settlement with tax 
authorities at Kapan. There were no other individually significant movement in tax provisions.
During the year ended 31 December 2016 following the favourable court decisions the Group has recognised the reversal of the previously 
recognised and paid additional mining tax charge at Magadan Silver JSC amounting to US$14 million. There were no other individually 
significant movement in tax provisions during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Exploration expenses include write downs of US$2 million (2016: US$1 million) recognised within Exploration and Development assets  
(Note 18). Operating cash flow spent on exploration activities amounts to US$16 million (2016: US$11 million).

during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts were calculated based on the Group’s general 
borrowing pool and by applying an effective interest rate of 3.96% and 4.33%, respectively, to cumulative expenditure on such assets.

The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20% for the Russian 
Federation, Kazakhstan and Armenia to profit before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax regulations, 
which disallow certain deductions which are included in the determination of accounting profit. These deductions include share-based 
payment expenses, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and administrative expenses, financing 
expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
As from 1 January 2017 Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC and Magadan Silver JSC are entitled to the decreased statutory income tax rate 
of 17% for the operations held in  the Special Economic Zone of the Russian Far East (2016: 18%), the rate of 17% was used in calculation of 
income tax provision and deferred tax positions for those entities. Since 1 January 2017 Svetloye LLC has received tax relief as a Regional 
Investment Project and is entitled to the statutory income tax rate of 0% up to 2021.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by the tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan 
and Armenia. Of the large operating companies of the Group, the tax authorities have audited Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company 
LLC up to 2014, Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC up to 2013, Gold of Northern Urals CJSC and Magadan Silver JSC up to 2012, 
Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC up to 2010, and Varvarinskoye JSC for the period up to 2010. According to Russian, Kazakhstan 
and Armenian tax legislation, previously completed audits do not fully preclude subsequent claims relating to the audited period.
Tax exposures recognised in income tax 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 and the year ended 31 December 2016 no individual significant exposures were indentified as 
probable and provided for. Management has identified a total exposure (covering taxes and related interest and penalties) of approximately 
US$5 million in respect of uncertain tax positions (31 December 2016: US$4 million) which relate to income tax.

16. INCOME TAX CONTINUED

The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$126 million at 31 December 2017, which is related to 
the tax losses carried forward, is more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and 
Kazakhstan and available tax planning strategies.
Effective from 1 January 2017 there are changes introduced to the Russian Federation tax law regarding loss carryforwards. Loss 
carryforwards will be limited to 50% of taxable profit in tax years 2017 through 2020. From 2021 the limitation will expire and it will be 
possible to fully utilise loss carryforwards against the corporate tax base in a given year. In addition to the above, the 10-year carryforward 
period for losses is eliminated, meaning that losses incurred from 2007 can be carried forward for an indefinite period until fully utilised.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2017. The Group has 
concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable income  
in the carry-forward period. 
Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by Mayskoye Gold Mining 
Company LLC, Varvarinskoye JSC and Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLC. Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying 
component for income tax purposes. The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group. 
Tax losses carried forward of US$448 million (2016: US$435 million), related to DTA recognised in Varvarinskoye JSC and Bakyrchik Mining 
Venture LLC are available during the period up to 2026, with the most significant portion expiring in 2025.
The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically 
developed. The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the Group will generate taxable 
earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios. The amount of the DTA considered realisable,  
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced due to delays 
in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve estimates, increases in environmental obligations, or reductions in precious metal prices. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of US$90 million (2016: US$96 million) as it is not considered probable that there  
will be future taxable profits against which the losses can be utilised. No deferred tax was recognised in relation to Svetloye tax losses, 
accumulated by 1 January 2016, were the entity has received tax relief as Regional Investment Project and is entitled to the statutory  
income tax rate of 0% up to 2021, thus will not be able to utilise accumulated losses. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 
US$30 million that mainly expire in 2025. Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely in accordance with enacted changes to  
Russian Federation legislation described above.
The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group subsidiaries have not been 
recognised as the Group has determined that the undistributed profit of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.  
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised,  
amount to US$2,737 million (2016: US$2,147 million).

The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed annually to determine whether it is in excess of its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit is determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. Fair value is based on the application of the 
Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash flows. The DCF method is attributable to the development of proved and 
probable reserves.
The DCF method used is based on proved and probable reserves and uses the following key assumptions:
 • production volumes;
 • commodity prices;
 • proved and probable reserves;
 • production costs; 
 • Rouble exchange rates; and
 • discount rates.
Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and resources in existence at the end of the year. 
Estimated production volumes are based on detailed life-of-mine plans and take into account development plans for the mines approved 
by management as part of the long-term planning process. 
The key assumptions used as at 31 December 2017 by the Group were as follows:
Commodity prices
Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources of information. In the impairment tests 
performed, the flat real long-term gold and silver of US$1,200 per ounce (2016: US$1,200), US$16 per ounce (2016: US$16), respectively. 
Discount rate
The Group used a post-tax real discount rate of 9.0% (2016: 9.0%).
Production costs
Production costs are based on management’s best estimates over the life of the mine, and reflect past experience.
Rouble exchange rates
Management have analysed RUB/US$ rate movements for the year ended 31 December 2017. For the purposes of the impairment test, 
RUB/US$ exchange rate is estimated at 60 RUB/US$ (2016: 60 RUB/US$).
Sensitivity analysis
For Dukat and Mayskoye management has performed an analysis as to whether a reasonably possible adverse change to any of the key 
assumptions would lead to impairment. 
The following scenarios were considered as reasonably possible and were used for this sensitivity analysis:
 • 10% simultaneous decrease in gold and silver prices over the life of mine;
 • 10% decrease in Rouble exchange rates;
 • 10% increase in operating expenses over the life-of-mine; and 
 • 0.5% increase in the discount rate applied.
Each of the sensitivities above has been determined by assuming that the relevant key assumption moves in isolation, and without  
regard to potential mine plan changes and other management decisions which would be taken to respond to adverse changes in existing 
management projections. An adverse change in a key assumption described above would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to 
exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating units, except for Mayskoye CGU, where a 10% decrease in gold and  
silver prices would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount by US$41 million.

JSC South-Verkhoyansk Mining Company
In December 2015 Polymetal International plc entered into a joint arrangement, under which Polymetal participates in advancing the 
development of the Nezhdaninskoye gold deposit (Nezhda) in Yakutia, Russia. On 19 January 2016 Polymetal obtained a 15.3% interest  
in the joint venture entity holding the 100% of the Company for the total cash consideration of US$18 million. It was determined that the 
arrangement meets definition of a joint arrangement as per IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, as joint control of two investors was established.  
As the arrangement is structured thorough the separate vehicle and the investors have rights for their share in net assets of the joint 
arrangement, it was concluded that joint arrangement meets definition of the joint venture and should be accounted for using equity  
method of accounting.
In November 2016 Polymetal increased its share in JSC South-Verkhoyansk Mining Company (Nezhda) to 17.66% for a cash consideration  
of US$3 million.

20. INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES CONTINUED
In July 2017 Polymetal has agreed to acquire an additional 7% in the JSC South-Verkhoyansk Mining Company (Nezhda) for a cash 
consideration of US$8 million, from its joint venture partner, Ivan Kulakov. Simultaneously, Polymetal has acquired an option to buy out the 
remaining 75.3% in Nezhda (the Call Option). The Call Option premium comprises US$12 million (Note 22) in cash payable upfront and is 
exercisable based on the following terms:
 • Following the preparation of the initial JORC-compliant ore reserve estimate for the open-pittable reserves, Polymetal will have the option 
to acquire the remaining stake for US$100 per ounce of attributable gold reserves (equivalent to US$75.3/oz multiplied by total reserve 
ounces). The total consideration shall not be less than US$105 million and not more than US$180 million. US$10 million of the 
consideration will be paid in cash and the remaining amount will be paid in the Polymetal’s shares.
 • The Call Option is exercisable between 1 February and 1 June 2018 entirely at Polymetal’s discretion.
 • Should Polymetal decide not to proceed with the exercise of the Call Option, Polymetal will have a put option to sell its 24.7% stake to  
Mr. Kulakov’s investment vehicle, Pallavicino Holdings Ltd, an unrelated party, at a notional cost of EUR1,000.
 • As of the reporting date, the completion of the sale and purchase of the additional 7% share in the JV and exercise of the Call Option are 
subject to approval by the Russian Federal Government’s Commission on Foreign Investments into Companies of Strategic Importance. 
The exercise of the Call Option is also subject to approval by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. 
The Group has determined that the increase in shareholding does not represent a significant change in circumstances that indicate a 
change in joint control and Nezhda continues to meet the definition of a joint venture. Cash consideration of US$8 million paid for the 
additional stake is accounted for as part of the net investment in the joint venture. The Group has a legal right to recovery of this US$8 million 
in the event that the associated transaction does not receive the required approvals. The Group has performed a fair value valuation of the 
Call Option at origination date and, as of 31 December 2017 (Note 28), has determined that its fair value approximates to its cost of US$12 
million (see Note 22). 
The Directors are confident that the necessary approvals will be received before the Call Option expires, and also believe that they will be 
able to extend the option by taking other mitigating actions if required. However, there remains a risk that the Group will not be able to 
exercise the Call Option, in which case management will reassess the recoverability of the investment which could lead to a material 
impairment charge.
Prognoz Serebro LLC
In January 2017 the Group entered into an agreement with Polar Acquisition Ltd (PAL), under which Polymetal will participate in the 
development of the Prognoz silver deposit in Yakutia, Russia (Prognoz). Under the agreement, Polymetal acquired a 5% interest in Prognoz 
for US$5 million (including US$2 million of related expenses) in cash through the purchase of 10% of Polar Silver Resources’ share capital, 
the entity holding a 50% interest in Prognoz, with the remaining 50% owned by a group of private investors. The arrangement allows 
Polymetal to acquire from PAL its remaining 45% interest in Prognoz for a consideration based on the JORC compliant reserves 
estimate upon completion of the technical study. The Group has determined that Prognoz constitutes a joint venture under  
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and therefore the investment was accounted for using the equity method. 
GRK Amikan
GRK Amikan is a production company which holds 100% interest in Veduga gold deposit in the Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation. 
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group purchased ore from GRK Amikan for the total amount of US$35 million (2016:  
US$11 million) (Note 32) and eliminated unrealised profit on inventories not yet processed against its share of net profit in GRK Amikan.
Aktogai Mys LLC
In June 2015 Polymetal purchased a 25% stake in the company Aktogai Mys LLC, which owns the Dolinnoye exploration licence in 
Kazakhstan Republic (including part of an intracompany loan) from the unrelated party. At the same time Polymetal also entered into an 
agreement to finance, organise and ensure the execution of exploration activities: to obtain permission and approvals for drilling from 
competent authorities, to perform no more than 20 km of exploration drilling; and to undertake technical research as well as a JORC 
feasibility study in exchange for a right to increase its share in the project up to 50% after the completion of these tasks. 
By 2017 the earn-in conditions had been satisfied by extensive exploration and the preparation of a JORC-compliant reserve estimate 
for the property. In June 2017 the earn-in arrangement between Polymetal and its partner was completed and Polymetal has acquired  
an additional 25% interest in the Aktogai Mys LLC for a net consideration of US$1 million. In September 2017 Polymetal contributed  
US$2 million to Aktogai Mys charter capital.
The Group has determined that Aktogai Mys LLC continues to constitute a joint venture under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and the 
investment is accounted for using the equity method.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group purchased ore from Aktogai Mys LLC for the total amount of US$3 million  
(2016: nil) (Note 32) and eliminated unrealised profit on inventories not yet processed against its share of net profit in Aktogai Mys LLC.
Proeks LLC
In November 2015 the Group acquired a 24.9% share in a diamond exploration project located in the north-west of the Russian Federation 
for the cash consideration of a US$2 million. During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group increased its share in Proeks LLC to 30% 
for the consideration of US$1 million. The Group determined that it has significant influence in the entity and the investment is accounted 
for using the equity method. 
Prognoz Serebro LLC, Aktogai Mys LLC and Proeks LLC do not represent equity method investments that are individually material.

assumptions for long-term stockpiles) were consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment review (Note 19). For short-term metal 
inventories applicable forward prices as of 31 December 2017 were used.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group provided for obsolete consumables and spare parts inventory in the amount of  
US$3 million (year ended 31 December 2016: write-down of US$6 million).
The amount of inventories held at net realisable value at 31 December 2017 is US$60 million (31 December 2016: US$45 million).

Contingencies
Operating environment
Emerging markets such as Russia and Kazakhstan are subject to different risks than more developed markets, including economic, political 
and social, and legal and legislative risks. Laws and regulations affecting businesses in Russia continue to change rapidly, tax and regulatory 
frameworks are subject to varying interpretations. The future economic direction of Russia and Kazakhstan is heavily influenced by the fiscal 
and monetary policies adopted by the government, together with developments in the legal, regulatory, and political environment.
Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. Management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transaction and activity of the companies of the Group may be challenged by the relevant 
regional and federal authorities and as a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain 
open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances 
reviews may cover longer periods.
During 2017 and 2016 the Group was involved in a number of litigations in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Management  
identified a total exposure (covering taxes and related interest and penalties) of US$7 million in respect of contingent liabilities  
(2016: US$13 million), including US$5 million related to income tax (2016: US$4 million).

28. FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,  
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows:
 • Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 • Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable  
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 • Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not  
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group held the following financial instruments:

During the reporting periods, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and short-term debt recorded at 
amortised cost approximate to their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Group’s 
debt, calculated using the market interest rate available to the Group as at 31 December 2017, is US$1,233 million, and the carrying value  
as at 31 December 2017 is US$1,456 million (see Note 24). Carrying values of the other long-term loans provided to related parties as at  
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 approximated to their fair values.
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales
The fair value of receivables arising from copper, gold and silver concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing mechanisms  
is determined using the appropriate quoted forward price from the exchange that is the principal active market for the particular metal.  
As such, these receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration liabilities

Omolon
In 2008, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 98.1% of the shares in Omolon Gold Mining 
Company LLC (Omolon). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a valuation model which simulates 
expected production of gold and silver at the Kubaka mine and future gold and silver prices to estimate future revenues of Omolon. This liability 
is revalued at each reporting date based on 2% of the life-of-mine revenues with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. The liability recognised as at 31 December 2017 was US$11 million, including current portion of US$4 million.
Kyzyl
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group completed the acquisition of the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan. The fair value of the 
related contingent consideration liability was estimated using the Monte Carlo model. The liability was revalued at the 31 December 2017 
using the same method with updated inputs as of reporting date and amounts to US$12 million (2016: US$19 million).
Primorskoye
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 100% interest 
in Primorskoye. Deferred conditional cash consideration, which is determined as the highest of US$13,333 per tonne of contained silver 
equivalent (translating into US$0.415 per silver equivalent ounce) based on the audited reserves estimate of the deposit, and US$8 million, 
was revalued at 31 December 2016 at US$8 million. Following the determination of the mineral resource estimate at March 2017, the 
deferred consideration was calculated at US$9.7 million and settled by 815,348 newly issued Polymetal International shares (Note 30).
Lichkvaz
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group completed the acquisition of Lichkvaz CJSC (Lichkvaz), the company owning the 
Lichkvaz exploration licence in Armenia (Note 4). The fair value of the related contingent consideration liability is calculated using a valuation 
model which simulates expected production of metals and future gold, silver and copper prices to estimate future value of the metals in the 
actually extracted ore. The liability recognised at 31 December 2017 was US$3 million.
Kapan
During the year ended 31 December 2016 the Group completed the acquisition of DPMK, the company owning the Kapan mine and 
processing plant in Armenia (Note 4). The seller is entitled to receive a 2% NSR (Net Smelter Return) royalty on future production from  
the Kapan Gold Mine capped at US$25 million. At the 31 December 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated 
at US$11 million, including current portion of US$1 million.
Komar
On 1 August 2016 the Group completed the acquisition of Orion Minerals LLP , the holding company for the Komarovskoye Gold Deposit (Komar) 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan (Note 4). The seller is entitled to the contingent consideration that was determined based on the LOM model of the 
Komarovskoye mine and calculated using Monte Carlo modelling. At the 31 December 2017 , the fair value of the contingent consideration was 
estimated at US$25 million (2016: US$18 million), with an increase due to the growth in ore reserves and change in the mine plan.
Assumptions used in the valuation of the Omolon, Kapan and Lichkvaz are consistent with those used in goodwill impairment test (Note 19), 
such as long-term metal prices and discount rates. Estimated production volumes are based on life of mine plans and are approved by 
management as part of the long-term planning process. 
Monte-Carlo modelling for Kyzyl and Komarovskoye contingent consideration liabilities was performed with following inputs:
 • Gold price volatility: 16.19% – 19.58% (2016: 16.23% – 18.23%)
 • Share price volatility: 40.5% (2016: 41.9%)
 • Constant correlation between gold and share price: 86% (2016: 90%)
 • Dividend yield: 2%.
Nezhda Call Option
The Group has valued the Nezhda Call Option (Note 20) using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, with share price volatility 
assumption approximating to 30%. Exercise price of the option was assessed based on the project NPV, calculated using Nezhda JORC 
ore reserves and mineral resources available and gold price and discount rates consistent with assumptions used for the goodwill 
impairment testing (Note 19). The fair value of the option approximates to its cost of US$12 million as of 31 December 2017.
The Directors consider that a reasonably possible change in a valuation assumption would not have a material impact on the financial 
statements for contingent considerations payable. 
Commodity forward contracts
The Group enters into forward contracts for the physical delivery of metals which will be priced according to the prevailing London Bullion 
Market Association or London Metal Exchange index. The Group’s policy is not to enter into fixed priced contracts. The forward sales 
contracts qualify for the normal purchase/sales or ‘own use’ exemption for accounting purposes and are outside the scope of IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

29. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy is to provide value to stakeholders 
by maintaining an optimal short-term and long-term capital structure, reducing cost of capital, and to safeguard the ability to support the 
operating requirements on an ongoing basis, continuing the exploration and development activities.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 24 offset by cash and bank balances as detailed 
in Note 23 and equity of the Group comprising the Stated Capital account, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in Note 30.
The Group’s committed borrowings are subject to certain financial covenants. Compliance with covenants is reviewed on a semi-annual 
basis and the Group’s Board is satisfied with forecast compliance with covenants on those borrowings. 
The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure of the Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the Board considers the 
cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Major categories of financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, derivatives, trade and other payables. The Group has various financial assets 
such as accounts receivable, loans advanced and cash and cash equivalents.

Foreign currency and commodity price risk
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions for the sale of its commodities, denominated in US Dollars. In addition, 
the Group has assets and liabilities in a number of different currencies (primarily Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge). As a result, the Group 
is subject to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not currently use derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies of the individual 
Group entities at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 were as follows:

Currency risk is monitored on a monthly basis by performing a sensitivity analysis of foreign currency positions in order to verify that potential 
losses are at an acceptable level.
The table below details the Group’s sensitivity to changes in exchange rates by 10% which is the sensitivity rate used by the Group for

Provisionally priced sales
Under a long-established practice prevalent in the industry, copper, gold and silver concentrate sales are provisionally priced at the time of 
shipment. The provisional prices are finalised in a contractually specified future period (generally one to three months) primarily based on 
quoted LBMA or LME prices. Sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent month. The forward price is a major 
determinant of recorded revenue.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is 
managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group does not currently hedge 
its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was 
outstanding for the whole period. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key 
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended  
31 December 2017 would have decreased/increased by US$9 million (2016: US$13 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s 
exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate debt instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to financial losses to the 
Group. The Group’s financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash 
equivalents and loans and receivables.
Accounts receivable are regularly monitored and assessed and where necessary an adequate level of provision is maintained. Trade accounts 
receivable at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 are represented by provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales transactions. 
A significant portion of the Group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable export trading companies. With regard to other loans and 
receivables the procedures of accepting a new customer include checks by a security department and responsible on-site management for 
business reputation, licences and certification, creditworthiness and liquidity. Generally, the Group does not require any collateral to be pledged 
in connection with its investments in the above financial instruments. Credit limits for the Group as a whole are not set up.

29. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES CONTINUED
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The major financial assets at the balance sheet date other than trade accounts receivable presented in Note 23 are cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 December 2017 of US$36 million (2016: US$48 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group’s liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed budgeting, cash 
forecasting processes and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities to help ensure that it has adequate cash available 
to meet its payment obligations.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables 
have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be

amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which

In January 2017 the Group increased its interest in Vostochny Basis LLC (holder of the licence for the Tarutinskoye copper deposit (Tarutin)  
by 25% (from 75% to 100%). The Group purchased the additional 25% from an unrelated party for a consideration of US$10 million, payable 
through the issue of 893,575 new Polymetal International plc shares. The Group has previously determined that Vostochny Basis LLC meets 
the definition of a subsidiary and therefore it was consolidated from the date of the 25% share acquisition. The increase in interest in Tarutin 
was recognised as an acquisition of the non-controlling interest and recognised interest within equity. As of 31 December 2017 and during 
the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 Tarutin did not not give rise to a significant non-controlling interest to be 
presented within equity, income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the available cash in the Company under Jersey law. As Russian, Kazakh 
and Armenian legislation identifies the basis of distribution of the dividends as accumulated profit, the ability to distribute cash up to the 
Company from the Russian, Kazakh and Armenian operating companies will be based on the statutory historical information of each stand-
alone entity. Statutory financial statements in the Russian Federation are prepared in accordance with Russian accounting standards which 
differs from IFRS, while Kazakhstan and Armenia have adopted IFRS from 1 January 2006 and 1 January 2011, respectively. However, 
current legislation and other statutory regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal interpretation; consequently, actual 
distributable reserves may differ from the amount of accumulated profit in accordance with statutory financial statements.
Weighted average number of shares: Diluted earnings per share
Both basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of outstanding common shares before/after dilution respectively. The calculation of the weighted average number 
of outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows:
Year ended 
31 December 
2017
31 December 
2016
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares 429,880,907 426,135,182 
Dilutive effect of share appreciation plan 5,830,775 259,452 
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution 435,711,682 426,394,634 
There were no adjustments required to earnings for the purposes of calculating the diluted earnings per share during the year ended  
31 December 2017 (year ended 31 December 2016: nil). 
At 31 December 2017 the outstanding LTIP awards issued under 2014-2017 tranches represent dilutive potential ordinary shares with 
respect to earnings per share from continuing operations as these are in the money as of reporting date (31 December 2016: all tranches 
represent anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares as these were out of money).
The awards issued under management bonus deferral award plan are dilutive as of 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 being 
contingently issued shares and are included in the calculation of diluted EPS based on the weighted average number of shares that  
would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.
31. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2017, share-based compensation in the amount of US$10 million including US$1 million of management 
bonus deferral award (2016: US$7 million and US$1 million, respectively) was recognised in general, administrative and selling expenses  
in the consolidated income statement (Note 11). As of reporting date the unrecognised share-based compensation expense related to

In February 2018 the Group entered into a legally binding agreement to increase its stake in the Prognoz Serebro LLC (Note 12) from  
5% to 50% through the acquisition of a further 45% ownership in the asset from Polar Acquisition Limited (PAL) for a total consideration 
of US$72 million to be paid in Polymetal shares. 90% of the consideration shares will be subject to a lock–up period of 180 days. 
Additionally Polymetal commits to pay PAL a net smelter return royalty of between 2% and 4% (pro rated by the 45% stake being acquired), 
which will be dependent on the applicable statutory mineral extraction tax rate at the time when the asset enters commercial production. 
The royalty agreement is subject to an agreed cap. The transaction is expected to close in first quarter 2018, subject to receipt of the 
required regulatory approvals.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Introduction
The financial performance reported by the Group contains certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) disclosed to compliment 
measures that are defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). APMs should be considered in addition to, 
and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide the readers with 
valuable information and an improved understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group’s industry. Therefore, the APMs used by the Group may not 
be comparable to similar measures and disclosures made by other companies. 
Purpose
APMs used by the Group represent financial KPIs for clarifying the true financial performance of the Company and measuring it against 
strategic objectives, given the following background:
 • widely used by the investor and analyst community in mining sector and, together with ifrs measures, apms provide a holistic view of 
the company;
 • applied by investors to assess earnings quality, facilitate period to period trend analysis and forecasting of future earnings, understand 
performance through eyes of management;
 • highlight key value drivers within the business that may not be obvious in the financial statements; 
 • ensure comparability of information between reporting periods and operating segments by adjusting for uncontrollable or one-off factors 
which impact upon ifrs measures;
 • used internally by management to assess financial performance of the group and its operating segments;
 • used in the group’s dividend policy; and
 • certain apms are used in setting directors and management remuneration.

Gold equivalent conversion ratio 
GE = Me/k
Where Me is the evaluated metal content (silver g/t, copper or zinc %)
Where k is the silver to gold equivalent conversion rate that is calculated considering the difference in metals value issuing the following formula:
For silver: k = ((Au price/31.1035 - (Au price /31.1035 - Treatment charge Au)*(Royalty Au)/100 - (Treatment charge Au))*(Recovery Au)/ 
((Ag price/31.1035 - (Ag price/31.1035 - Treatment charge Ag)*(Royalty Ag)/100 - (Treatment charge Ag))*(Recovery Ag)),  
for copper or zinc k = 100*((Au price/31.1035) - (Au price/31.1035 - Treatment charge Au)*(Royalty Au)/100 - (Treatment change 
Au))*(Recovery Au))/(((Me price) - (Me price - Treatment charge Me)*(Royalty Me)/100 - (Treatment charge Me))*Recovery Me)),  
where Royalty is the mineral extraction tax at applicable rate, recovery – the life-of-mine expected recovery of the respective  
metal in the processing technology applied.

Indicated resource 
That part of a resource for which tonnage, grade and content can  
be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based on 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are too widely or 
inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and/or grade continuity 
but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed
Inferred resource 
That part of a resource for which tonnage, grade and content can be 
estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological 
evidence and assumed but not verified geological and/or grade 
continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain  
quality and reliability
In-fill drilling 
A conventional method of detailed exploration on an already defined 
resource or reserve, consisting of drilling on a denser grid to allow 
more precise estimation of ore bodyparameters and location
Leaching 
The process of dissolving mineral values from solid into liquid phase 
of slurry
Measured resource  
That part of a resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical 
characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with 
a high level of confidence. It is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are spaced closely 
enough to confirm geological and grade continuity
Merrill-Crowe process
A technological operation for extraction of gold and/or silver after 
cyanide leaching. In the first step slurry containing gold and/or silver 
is separated into liquid and solid phases by washing the solids off in 
countercurrent decantation thickeners. In the second step pregnant 
leach solution (liquid phase of slurry) is filtered to remove impurities 
and deaerated. Finally, gold and silver are deposited onto the solid 
bed of claylike material where they replace zinc particles which pass 
into a solution. Merrill-Crowe is preferentially used for silver-rich ores
Mill

A mine that is entirely on the surface. Also referred to as open-cut or 
open-cast mine
Ore
The part of mineralisation that can be mined and processed profitably
Ore body 
A spatially compact and geometrically connected location of ore
Ore mined
Ore extracted from the ground for further processing
Ore processed
Ore subjected to treatment in a mineral processing plant
Ore stacked
The ore stacked for heap leach operations
Oxidised ore
Ore in which both ore minerals and gangue are fully or partially 
oxidised thus impacting its physical and chemical properties and 
influencing the choice of a processing technology
POX or pressure oxidation
A technological operation in which slurry is subjected to high  
pressure and high temperature in an autoclave with the goal to 
destroy sulphide particles enveloping gold particles and make  
slurry amenable to cyanide leaching
Precipitate
The semi-finished product of mineral processing by Merrill-Crowe 
process, normally containing very high concentrations of silver  
and/or gold
Primary ore
Unoxidised ore
Probable reserves
The economically mineable part of an indicated (and in some cases 
measured) resource, which has a lower level of confidence than 
proved reserves but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for 
a decision on the development of the deposit
Production
The amount of pure precious metals, measured in thousands 
of ounces for gold, millions of ounces for silver and tonnes for copper, 
produced following processing
Proved reserves
The economically mineable part of a measured resource, which 
represents the highest confidence category of reserve estimate. 
The style of mineralisation or other factors could mean that proved 
reserves are not achievable in some deposits
Pt
Platinum
Reclamation
The restoration of a site after mining or exploration activity 
is completed
Recovery or recovery rate
The percentage of valuable metal in the ore that is recovered 
by metallurgical treatment in the final or semi-finished product
Refractory
A characteristic of gold-bearing ore denoting impossibility 
of recovering gold from it by conventional cyanide leaching
Reserves
The economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated 
mineral resource. It takes into account mining dilution and losses. 
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and 
include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed 
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate 
at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. 
Reserves are subdivided in order of increasing confidence into 
probable reserves and proved reserves
Resources 
A concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic 
interest in or on the earth’s crust in such form, quality and quantity 
that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics 
and continuity of resources are known, estimated or interpreted from 
specific geological evidence and knowledge. Resources are sub-
divided in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, 
indicated and measured categories
SAG mill
A semi-autogenous grinding mill, generally used as a primary or first 
stage grinding solution
Step-out exploration drilling
Holes drilled to intersect a mineralisation horizon or structure along 
strike or down dip
Stope
A large underground excavation entirely within an ore body, a unit 
of ore extraction
Stripping
The mining of waste in an open-pit mine
Tailings
Part of the original feed of a mineral processing plant that 
is considered devoid of value after processing
Underground development
Excavation which is carried out to access ore and prepare it for 
extraction (mining)
Waste
Barren rock that must be mined and removed to access ore in 
a mine
