Prior year comparatives
The financial year to 2 March 2017 
was a 52-week year and the 
financial year to 3 March 2016 was 
53-week year. In order to provide  
a clearer comparison throughout 
this report, year-on-year growth  
in numbers relating to revenue, 
underlying profit and underlying 
earnings per share are shown 
using a 52-week comparative, 
which excludes the final week 
of the 2015/16 financial year. 
All other statutory comparatives 
and numbers shown at the balance 
sheet date reflect the financial 
statements and do not exclude 
the 53rd week of the prior year.
Performance measures  
The performance of the Group  
is monitored internally using  
a variety of statutory measures 
such as total revenue and profit 
before tax and alternative 
performance measures (APMs) 
such as underlying profit before  
tax, like for like sales and return  
on capital. APMs are not defined 
within IFRS and are used to  
assess the underlying operational 
performance of the Group.  
As such these measures should  
be considered alongside 
IFRS measures.

  Definitions of all APMs are 
included in the glossary on 
page 175.

Business overview
How our business works
We serve our customers in the UK and beyond through our two businesses:
Premier Inn & Restaurants
Premier Inn is the UK’s leading hotel business,  
with over 760 hotels and more than 68,000 
rooms across the UK. Our unique joint site model 
means that more than half of our hotels are  
located alongside our own restaurant brands. 
We also have hotels in  
the Middle East, and  
Germany, with more  
hotels in the pipeline.
Costa
Costa is the UK’s favourite coffee shop, with  
over 2,200 coffee shops in the UK, over  
1,300 stores in 29 international markets  
and over 6,800 Costa Express self-serve units.  
We have a multichannel strategy, with equity  
stores, franchise stores and stores operated  
by joint ventures, as well as a wholesale operation.
We create value for all our 
stakeholders through our 
Customer Heartbeat model: 
is the UK’s leading  
hospitality company
We have built two of the UK’s most 
successful hospitality brands, Premier Inn 
and Costa, through consistent operational 
excellence and providing a great customer 
experience. Our 50,000 team members 
deliver outstanding service to more than  
28 million customers every month across 
our hotels, coffee shops and restaurants.
We measure our progress  
through key performance  
targets included in our balanced  
scorecard (or Whitbread In  
Numbers – WINcard) for  
Winning Teams, Profitable 
Growth, Customer Heartbeat,  
Force for Good and Everyday 
Efficiency, which has recently 
been added to our model in  
order to reflect the importance of 
efficiency to our future success.

Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Although the modern day 
Whitbread is very different from 
the original brewing business 
founded by Samuel Whitbread in 
1742, we are immensely proud of 
our history and it is a great honour 
for me and my colleagues on the 
Board to play our own part in the 
Whitbread story. 
The links to our heritage remain strong. 
Our base is still in Bedfordshire and  
we are delighted to be able to welcome 
members of the Whitbread family to  
our Annual General Meeting each year, 
whilst our core values of investing in  
our Winning Teams and being a Force 
for Good in our communities remain as 
important to us today as they always 
have been.
We are very aware of our responsibility 
to ensure that this great British company 
continues to thrive and, as such, we are 
focused both on driving growth and 
managing risk to an appropriate level, 
whilst exhibiting excellent corporate 
governance. We operate a conservative 
approach to the management of our 
balance sheet and this provides us  
with a solid base in turbulent and 
changing times.
Our Winning Teams are the key to our 
success and I would like to thank our 
50,000 employees for the fantastic 
work they do in giving our customers  
a great experience. 
Consistent strategy
I explained this time last year that the 
fundamentals of our strategy, which  
is to provide sustainable long-term 
value for our shareholders by growing 
our successful Premier Inn and Costa 
brands, whilst delivering a good  
return on capital, were unchanged.  
This remains true today, as we continue 
undaunted by political upheaval and 
economic uncertainty.
We have a clear plan and we have  
made good progress against the three 
strategic priorities outlined by our  
Chief Executive, Alison Brittain, last 
April. These are to grow and innovate in 
our core UK businesses; to focus on our 
strengths to grow internationally; and  
to build the capability and platform to 
support future growth. More detail on 
our strategy can be found on pages  
10 to 13 and information on progress 
against our strategic objectives can  
be found on pages 41 to 45.
We have remained on course to deliver 
our objectives, whilst at the same time, 
refreshing our Board and the executive 
leadership team. I believe that the new 
team will enable Whitbread to enter  
the next phase of its life with renewed 
vigour and confidence.

The third new appointment to the Board 
this year is that of Adam Crozier, with 
effect from 1 April 2017. Adam is Chief 
Executive of ITV plc and has been Chief 
Executive of a number of public and 
private sector organisations over the 
last 21 years, in the media, logistics  
and retail sectors. Adam is a very high 
quality business leader, with a strong 
background in business transformations, 
brands, communication and marketing 
and his expertise will be of great value 
to the Whitbread Board as we continue 
to expand our successful Premier Inn 
and Costa brands.
Wendy Becker stepped down from  
the Board on 31 December 2016 after 
nine years of service to Whitbread and 
Stephen Williams, who has also just 
completed nine years of service, will  
step down immediately after the AGM  
in June. I would like to thank both 
Wendy and Stephen for their much 
valued contribution to the Whitbread 
Board during a very successful period 
for the Company. Wendy has played a 
significant role as a member of all three 
Board Committees, whilst Stephen has 
served both as Senior Independent 
Director and, more recently, as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee. I would 
also like to thank Stephen for extending 
his membership of the Board so as to 
provide handover support to Deanna  
as she takes on the leadership of the 
Remuneration Committee.
I look forward to seeing as many of you 
as possible at our AGM on Wednesday 
21 June 2017.
 
Richard Baker
Chairman

Force for Good
I believe that it is important that 
companies act as a Force for Good in 
their communities as well as being great 
employers and, of course, delivering on 
financial objectives for their shareholders.
This has always been a core value at 
Whitbread and, once again, we have 
made some great progress this year.  
I reported in last year’s report that we 
had raised £6 million for Great Ormond 
Street Hospital Charity towards a  
£7.5 million target. I am delighted to  
be able to report that this target was 
met in November 2016, with the new 
Premier Inn Clinical Building due to 
open later this year. Meanwhile, a  
further £1.8 million has been raised for 
the Costa Foundation during the year, 
with 72 school projects having been 
completed so far, bringing access to 
education to thousands of children  
in coffee-growing communities.
Modern slavery is a live topic this  
year, as companies begin to publish  
a statement on the subject on their 
websites. As you would expect, 
Whitbread has published its own 
statement, which can be found  
on our website. For us this is not merely 
about meeting a requirement though.  
I can assure you that it is a subject we 
take very seriously and we are in no  
way complacent. More information  
on our activities in this area can be 
found on pages 50 to 51.
Corporate governance
You will see in our remuneration  
report on pages 78 to 98 that we  
have proposed some updates to  
our remuneration policy. The current 
policy was approved in 2014 and we  
are required to put an updated policy 
to shareholders for approval at the 
AGM. The Remuneration Committee 
has taken the opportunity to ensure 
that our policy is well aligned to our 
strategy and has re-balanced the 
Annual Incentive Scheme so as to focus 
a little more on the leading indicators of 
future financial performance and a little 
less on in-year profit. It is proposed that 
LTIP targets be re-set so as to reflect 
the business plans and, in particular, the 
cost headwinds such as the National 
Living Wage, business rates, commodity 
price inflation and foreign exchange 
rates as well as planned investment  
of non-productive capital in Germany, 
China and IT.
I believe that our approach to 
remuneration is grounded and 
conservative and that we are sensibly 
positioned relative to other companies.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final  
dividend of 65.90 pence per share, 
making a total dividend of 95.80  
pence per share, up by 6.0%. The final 
dividend will be paid on 30 June 2017  
to shareholders on the register at the  
close of business on 26 May 2017.  
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan will 
continue to operate. Details of how to 
participate in this plan can be found on 
the Company’s website. Details of the 
Group’s dividend policy can be found 
on page 56 in the Group Finance 
Director’s review.
Shareholder benefits
Last year, having taken account  
of feedback from shareholders on  
the previous electronic system, we 
introduced a new shareholder benefits 
card. I’m pleased that the new card 
appears to have been well received by 
shareholders and has, for the most part, 
worked well. I have certainly noticed  
a significant reduction in correspondence 
on the subject. Shareholders who 
received the card last year, should so  
do automatically this year, providing 
that they still hold the required 64 
shares in Whitbread. Any shareholder 
who holds this number of shares, who 
did not register for a card last year and 
would like to do so, can find further 
details on page 173.
The Board
As I mentioned earlier in this statement, 
there have been a number of Board 
changes during the year, as well as 
changes to the senior executive team, 
which Alison reports on in her review  
on page 7.
Two new independent non-executive 
directors, David Atkins and Deanna 
Oppenheimer joined the Board on  
1 January 2017. David is the Chief 
Executive of Hammerson plc, a major 
UK property business with interests 
across a number of European markets. 
Whitbread has a clear growth strategy, 
which is underpinned by an extensive 
property portfolio, and David’s 
experience in the European retail 
property sector will provide the 
Whitbread Board with invaluable 
insights as we expand both in the  
UK and overseas.
Deanna is a highly experienced 
executive, with a strong background  
in mass consumer retail, and will bring 
her experience of having worked with  
a broad range of leading edge digital 
businesses in her role at CameoWorks 
to the Whitbread Board. In addition, 
Deanna’s experience of chairing the 
Tesco Remuneration Committee  
makes her well placed to succeed 
Stephen Williams as Chair of our  
own Remuneration Committee.
I believe that it 
is important that 
companies act as a 
Force for Good in 
their communities 
as well as being 
great employers.”
Strategic report Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 06
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review
Whitbread has had another year  
of strong growth and continued 
investment with total Group sales 
increasing 8.2% to £3.1 billion  
and underlying basic earnings  
per share increasing by 6.0%, 
demonstrating the strength of our 
core brands. Total basic earnings 
per share increased by 7.3%.
Strategic priorities
In 2016/17 we made good progress  
in delivering on our three strategic 
priorities: to grow and innovate in our 
core UK businesses; to focus on our 
strengths to grow internationally; and  
to build the capability and infrastructure 
to support long-term growth.
Premier Inn’s strong sales growth 
benefitted from the 3,816 gross new  
UK rooms we opened this year and the 
accelerated maturity of the c.9,000 
rooms we have opened over the last 
two years. We delivered high customer 
satisfaction by leading the market on 
quality and value, achieved occupancy 
of over 80% with record levels of direct 
bookings at 94%, all of which supported 
our strong return on capital.
Costa opened 255 net new stores 
worldwide and we continue to roll  
out our successful and fast growing 
Costa travel formats. Costa Express  
had a great year installing over  
1,500 machines of which 248 were in 
international markets. We are innovating 
to drive our sales growth and are 
pleased with the investment we are 
making to introduce ‘finer’ coffee 
concepts, leveraging our new state  
This is a significant year  
in Whitbread’s history  
as we celebrate our  
275th anniversary
I am delighted to be leading this great 
British company at this historic time and, 
with such a long and successful history,  
it is right that we take a long-term view 
of our business in order to safeguard  
the Company’s future for many  
more years to come.

of the art Roastery and delivering 
fresher food that our customers will 
enjoy later this year. 
Internationally, in Germany we grew  
our hotel pipeline to five hotels and  
our Frankfurt hotel received great  
guest feedback. We continue to have 
success with our profitable joint venture 
in the Middle East while our phased 
withdrawal from South East Asia is on 
plan. China remains an exciting platform 
of growth for Costa and we have a clear 
plan to enhance our business. We have 
launched five new concept stores,  
the results of which give us further 
confidence that we can capitalise  
on this market opportunity and grow  
to significant scale.
During the year we continued to 
strengthen our capabilities to support 
our long-term growth, including 
developing the senior team with a 
number of new hires and promotions.  
In November we announced a £150 
million cost efficiency programme  
to help offset investment and sector 
cost pressures. We have made good 
progress this year in areas such as 
procurement, supplier consolidation  
and labour scheduling, which has 
helped maintain margins.
In the year ahead we will continue  
to focus on organic growth and 
investing in our customer proposition. 
This, together with our efficiency 
programme and disciplined capital 
management gives us confidence  
in delivering another year of  
good progress, in line with overall 
expectations. Whilst we are only seven 
weeks into our new financial year 
Premier Inn has had a good start  
to the year and Costa has also seen 
positive like for like sales growth, 
although we remain cautious and 
expect a tougher consumer 
environment than last year. 
In the longer term we remain confident 
that, with our significant structural 
growth opportunities, the power  
of our brands and the investments  
we are making, we will continue to 
deliver strong returns and sustainable  
long-term growth for our shareholders.
More detailed information on our three 
strategic priorities can be found on 
pages 8 to 13.
2016/17 performance
Group underlying profit before tax rose 
6.2% to £565.2 million and underlying 
basic earnings per share increased 6.0% 
to 246.48 pence. Profit for the year was 
up 7.4% to £415.9 million and total basic 
earnings per share were up 7.3% to 
231.39 pence.
Premier Inn & Restaurants’ underlying 
operating profit was up 7.4% to  
£468.0 million. Premier Inn grew total 
sales by 9.0% and the number of rooms 
available by 9.3%, as we opened 3,816 
gross new UK rooms during the year, 
whilst achieving high total occupancy  
of 80.2%. Like for like sales grew by 
2.3%, benefitting from good RevPAR 
growth of c.1.4% in catchments where 
we did not add capacity and from our 
hotel extension programme which,  
as expected, diluted our like for like 
RevPAR by c.2%, but overall grew our 
like for like sales by c.1%. 
Restaurants’ total sales increased 1.2% 
benefitting from the eight net new sites 
opened during the year and like for like 
sales declined by 0.3%, slightly ahead  
of our competitor set.
Costa’s underlying operating profit  
was up 5.3% to £158.0 million, with total 
sales growth of 10.7%. This was driven 
by UK like for like sales growth of 2.0%, 
255 net new stores worldwide and an 
acceleration in our roll-out of Costa 
Express machines, with 1,585 net new 
installations. Margins were down  
0.8% pts, slightly ahead of our previous 
guidance due to the phasing of 
investments into 2017/18.
As we align our business towards our 
three strategic priorities we incurred  
a net non-underlying charge of  
£49.8 million (2015/16: £58.6 million), 
predominately relating to the estimated 
cost of Premier Inn International’s 
withdrawal from India and South East 
Asia and re-organisation costs 
associated with our cost efficiency 
programme.
The executive team
As Richard Baker mentioned in his 
statement, there has been some 
significant change to the executive  
team over the last couple of years and  
I am grateful to Nicholas Cadbury and 
Louise Smalley for the stability they  
have provided, which has enabled  
our leadership team to be refreshed  
so seamlessly.
I reported this time last year that 
Dominic Paul would be joining the  
team as Managing Director, Costa 
Coffee. Dominic joined us in June 2016, 
before which he was responsible for  
the success of Royal Caribbean outside 
the US. Dominic has hit the ground 
running, injecting energy and putting 
his personal stamp on our strategy  
for Costa.
In order to structure ourselves to  
meet our strategic objectives I took  
the decision to remove the Whitbread 
Hotels & Restaurants divisional 
infrastructure, with the aim of bringing 
the leadership team closer to the 
customer and enabling a leaner,  
more agile business, with faster 
decision-making. This led to a number 
of changes to my executive team.
Simon Jones was promoted to 
Managing Director of both Premier Inn 
& Restaurants and joined the Executive 
Committee. Simon joined Whitbread  
in 2011 and, since then, has been pivotal 
to the Premier Inn story, leading on key 
initiatives such as network planning, 
pricing and marketing.
Another internal promotion was  
Mark Anderson, who has been with  
the business for ten years and has led 
our property function since 2008.  
Mark now reports directly to me, which  
I believe appropriately reflects the 
importance of property to our business 
and the significant potential for value 
creation in this area. Mark also became 
Managing Director, Premier Inn 
International.
Our values
At Whitbread we believe that it is  
not just what you achieve, but how  
you achieve it. We aim to deliver great 
financial results for our shareholders, 
have a positive impact on communities, 
create fantastic career opportunities for 
our employees and great experiences 
for our customers, in a safe and 
welcoming environment. 
We intend to ensure that everyone  
who plays a part in delivering the 
products and services that our 
customers love is treated with respect 
and paid appropriately for their work. 
This applies not only to our 50,000 
team members, but also to the many 
people working across the world who 
contribute to Whitbread’s success.
I want to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone who makes Whitbread the 
company it is for their effort and 
commitment throughout the year  
and I am confident that we will work 
together to deliver on our strategic 
objectives in the years ahead and that 
we will do so in a way that will make  
us all proud.

Strategy
Both of our core brands, Premier Inn

opportunity. Our brands are market-leading,  
our customers are loyal, and our financial  
approach is disciplined and prudent. 
Our strategy for 
long-term growth
Our strategy builds on the 
Company’s core strengths and  
its proven brands and business 
models. It also adds a number  
of new elements to enhance our 
capability. These come in the form 
of increased pace and agility, a 
focus on innovation, technology 
and efficiency and a clear strategy 
for our property portfolio. 
• We will continue to invest, to  
capture the growth opportunities 
available in both coffee and budget 
branded hotels. 
• We will improve and innovate 
our customer offers to retain our  
market-leading brand positions. 
• We will focus on our strengths  
to grow internationally and across  
the whole business. 
• We will create an efficient  
and productive infrastructure,  
building capability to support  
our long-term growth. 
Our leasehold and freehold property 
portfolio provides the core long-term 
infrastructure and competitively 
advantaged access to the best sites  
and provides operational and cost 
advantages for our business. We will 
continue to proactively manage this  
key asset to ensure we have the best 
locations and to capture freehold 
development profit. 
We take a long-term view of our 
business. Whitbread has a 275-year 
history and, with that, comes a 
responsibility to protect the long-term 
interests of all our stakeholders: our 
shareholders, our employees and 
pensioners and our customers. We  
will continue to focus on growing 
earnings and dividends, whilst 
maintaining a good return on capital.
On 29 November 2016 we held a Capital 
Market Day, in which we reported the 
following highlights: 
• for Premier Inn, we have clear line of 
sight to our 2020 milestone of 85,000 
UK rooms and have identified an 
extended growth runway beyond 
100,000 UK rooms;
• for Costa, we again have clear line  
of sight to our 2020 milestone of  
£2.5 billion of system sales and have 
identified an extended runway in the 
UK to at least 3,000 UK stores;
• we continue to see great potential in 
our international business. Germany 
has strong market fundamentals  
and is a fabulous fit for the Premier 
Inn brand. We see a tremendous 
long-term opportunity for Costa 
China and, at Costa Express, we are 
constantly challenging ourselves to 
accelerate and double-up;
• to help us offset cost headwinds,  
from factors such as increases in 
business rates and the National Living 
Wage as well as FX-related price 
inflation, we have established a 
Group-wide efficiency programme 
and are targeting £150 million of  
gross savings over five years; and
• we operate a unique property model 
which is balanced and creates unique 
competitive advantage. Our property 
strategy directly supports our 
structural growth ambitions and we 
have recently valued our freehold 
property portfolio in the range of  
£4.2 billion to £5.1 billion. 
As a result of our strong fundamentals, 
we have the flexibility to continue to 
make progress despite evolving political 
and economic uncertainties. We have 
done extensive scenario modelling, are 
confident in our baseline plan and in our 
ability to make decisions with pace and 
agility if and when required. 
Financially we are in a strong position, 
with strong cash generation, a secure 
balance sheet and a pattern of 
reinvestment in organic growth,  
at good returns.
On the following pages you will see 
more detail of our structural growth 
opportunity, together with further 
information on the three strategic 
priorities introduced this time  
last year:
1  Grow and innovate  
in our core UK  
businesses
2  Focus on our strengths  
to grow internationally
3  Build the capability  
and platform to  
support future growth
Strategic report Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 09
Structural growth 
opportunity
Premier Inn today has 762 UK  
sites and a 9.5% share of the total 
UK hotel market. Premier Inn has 
opened around 4,000 UK rooms 
per year for the past four years. 
Meanwhile Costa has 3,532  
stores and 6,801 Costa Express 
machines globally.
At Premier Inn, our growth continues to 
be at high returns, and can be described 
as structural for three reasons:
• the significant ‘independent’ hotel 
segment is in structural decline. 
Running a hotel is becoming more 
complex and costly. Proprietors must 
manage to ever higher customer 
standards and increasingly must also 
be digital entrepreneurs, competing 
with online travel agents and 
disrupters as well as traditional  
local competition; 
• the budget branded sector is 
capturing the growth, reflecting 
customers’ increasing desire for 
quality and value for money and  
the structural shift to value brands 
looks set to continue; and
• Premier Inn is the UK’s Number 1  
hotel company. The business model  
is clearly advantaged and well-placed 
to capture the shift to value brands  
as location and value for money are 
customers’ top choice. We have the 
largest network, the most compelling 
value for money proposition and loyal 
guests who give us the highest 
customer ratings. Our distribution 
model is direct, and our operating 
DNA delivers consistent quality. We 
also have a joint site and property 
strategy that gives us a unique 
competitive advantage, to be able  
to access the best sites at good value.
Meanwhile, we are tremendously 
fortunate to operate in the coffee 
industry. There aren’t many consumer 
product categories that can point  
to a global consumer lifestyle tailwind, 
habitual purchase behaviour and a  
6% global growth forecast. Coffee  
has recently overtaken tea as the  
UK’s beverage of choice and 
international comparisons show  
a lot more headroom for growth.
The strength of the category has 
attracted a plethora of brands, 
independents and non-specialists to  
the sector. Our UK business is stepping 
forward to meet this challenge head  
on. We start from a position of great 
strength, as customers’ choice is still 
dominated by convenience and coffee 
quality, where we are a clear winner  
in the UK. We are by far the UK’s 
Number 1 coffee chain, with the 
strongest network and the best  
brand perception in the market.

Strategy continued
We are confident in our 2020 
milestones, but we also have 
considerable growth potential 
beyond 2020 and our advantaged 
business models leave us best able 
to capture this market opportunity.
However, we have decided not to  
create further milestones from these 
opportunities. How and when we take 
our opportunities will be a matter for  
us, based on sustaining good returns, 
delivering earnings growth and 
managing the business with flexibility 
and agility. 
Our Premier Inn network is formidable. 
We have 40% more sites than  
our nearest competitor and our 
consistency of customer satisfaction  
is a core strength. Our market-leading 
occupancy and direct distribution 
translate to good profit generation and 
a strong return on capital. We achieve 
over 13% returns across the Premier Inn  
& Restaurants portfolio, which is 
substantially above our cost of capital.
Our ability to deliver growth is proven. 
We open around 4,000 UK rooms per 
year, which roughly translates to three 
new hotels every month. Our network 
plan is based on quantitative analysis, 
and has been subject to continuous 
scrutiny and refinement, taking account 
of the long-term UK growth in GDP  
and the effect we think disrupters will 
have on the market. We remain on  
track for our 2020 milestone and have 
identified a growth runway beyond 
100,000 UK rooms.
During the year we conducted an 
extensive strategic review of Costa UK, 
and there remains considerable 
headroom for growth.
Costa is a proposition for the whole  
of the country. We operate in all types 
of location from high streets to retail  
parks and Drive Thrus, and through 
both equity and franchised models. 
Across this diverse estate Costa is the 
clear Number 1 preferred coffee shop, 
reflecting our exceptional coffee, our 
loved brand, our formidable network, 
and our Winning Teams. 
Coffee in the UK is a hive of innovation. 
Branded coffee shops, new 
independents, non-specialists and 
product innovators all want to 
participate in the category growth,  
but we plan to maintain our position  
of leadership.
Our plans are to enhance the UK offer, 
through improvement of the customer 
proposition, including building on our 
coffee credentials and delivering ‘finer 
food’, and smarter thinking about how 
we segment and optimise the estate. 
Delivering this programme will provide 
us with long-term, sustainable like for 
like growth.
The structural growth of coffee is 
expanding the scope of operations for 
coffee shops. In addition to traditional 
high street and retail locations, we see 
extensive opportunity for Drive Thru 
coffee and believe we can access more 
of the best transport locations and  
retail parks. Our network plan shows 
opportunity for at least 3,000 stores  
in the UK compared to just over  
2,200 today.

Germany is a structurally attractive 
market for Premier Inn. 
The German customer appreciates  
a high quality sleep experience at a 
great price and, crucially, can pay an 
economic rate to enjoy it. The market is 
in steady growth, currently dominated 
by independents and with the largest 
brands at a fraction of our UK scale. 
Our first hotel in Frankfurt is enjoying 
excellent customer feedback. Being  
one of the top Frankfurt hotels on 
TripAdvisor is a great endorsement of 
our potential and we are maturing the 
hotel without using online travel agents. 
We have secured five additional sites  
in outstanding locations in key cities  
to roll out on this template. Over the 
long-term, we believe that Premier Inn 
can replicate its UK success in Germany, 
and create long-term shareholder  
value growth.
In order to focus on Germany and the 
Middle East we took the decision to 
withdraw Premier Inn from India and 
South East Asia and our exit plans are 
progressing well.
For Costa, China is a large market with  
a growing consumer middle class and 
coffee culture and has the potential  
to provide a significant future growth 
engine. We believe that our current 
operations represent a platform to 
unlock the potential in China and to 
establish a Number 2 position in the 
market. We recognise that we have 
more work to do to get the proposition 
right in China and to re-invigorate  
the brand. However, we are given 
confidence by the fact that, outside  
a tail of underperforming stores, site 
performance is credible. We have 
learned valuable lessons from our 
experience to date and we have now 
developed a clear plan to succeed  
in the market.
Costa has a growing international 
footprint and we intend to make it  
work harder for us. We will focus on the 
markets with the highest potential, with 
a lean regional infrastructure to support 
local market growth. We will leverage 
our capital light franchise model and 
skill in successful partner selection to 
replicate and build on our success.
As part of this focus, we have taken  
the decision to withdraw from our 
equity business in France and to focus 
on a franchise model.
Costa Express represents a significant 
international growth opportunity.  
Costa bought Coffee Nation in 2011 and, 
since then, performance has exceeded 
our expectations. Costa Express is a 
technologically advantaged business, 
both at the front-end in the coffee,  
and at the back-end through its 
infrastructure. It succeeds in the UK, 
and is starting to succeed overseas  
too. We are excited by the prospects  
of Costa Express internationally and 
constantly looking to accelerate our 
growth and double-up.

Strategic report
Strategy continued
Outlined in the previous pages  
is a multi-faceted growth plan,  
with multiple brands operating  
in multiple territories and  
ambitious plans to develop  
our key propositions. 
It is essential that we build the capability 
to support our long-term growth.  
We have identified four themes  
under this heading:
Property
To grow at around 4,000 or more rooms  
and continue the significant growth in our 
coffee shop estate, it is essential that we can 
efficiently access both freehold and leasehold 
site opportunities at a good return on capital. 
Property is a key part of the story. Over 60% of 
Premier Inn rooms today are freehold, and we 
have spent considerable time understanding 
the nuances of both our property portfolio and 
strategy. We have a unique model, which 
creates a competitive advantage.
Organisation
To grow as a business and succeed on  
more fronts we must enhance our 
organisation and culture. Culturally speaking, 
we need dynamic leadership with  
clear executive accountability,  
and relentless customer focus  
supported by agile decision making. 
Strategic Priority
3 Build the 
capability 
and platform 
to support 
future growth
Efficiency
We have an opportunity and a need to  
drive efficiency through our business.  
The UK consumer sector is facing a mixture of 
macroeconomic uncertainty and mandated cost 
inflation. Strong returns are a non-negotiable part  
of the Whitbread story, so we have commenced  
an overarching efficiency programme. We plan  
to deliver significant efficiency savings, worth  
£150 million, over a five year period, to help  
mitigate sector cost pressure.
Technology
We must take a proactive approach  
to our technology and our platform. 
Technology touches all stages of the 
customer journey, online, at site and across 
our support centre and supplier network.  
We will develop scalable platforms, create  
a centre of digital excellence and embed  
data insight across the business. 
Strategic report Competitive advantage in property
Property
The rationale for property ownership  
is balanced and interconnected, so  
to understand one element you need  
the bigger picture. This is captured  
in the virtuous circle on this page  
and described below.
• Our property strategy is centred on  
a balanced portfolio with Costa as  
an asset-light leasehold model and 
Premier Inn a majority freehold estate. 
We are focused on achieving good 
returns under all models. This 
provides us with a strong covenant.
• Our strong covenant gives us 
preferential access to freehold and 
leasehold sites, at lower cost and at 
lower rents than would be available  
to competitors. We are agile in local 
markets and can manage planning 
risks with confidence. We are the 
preferred partner for many vendors, 
developers and landlords.
• Our balanced portfolio creates strong 
operating cash flows and protection  
in the downturn via lower fixed costs.  
Our cash flows fund our growth,  
and our portfolio also provides  
an alternative funding source that 
adds flexibility. Our covenant, 
underpinned by freehold, lowers  
our borrowing costs.
•  Finally, we continuously achieve 
freehold value creation through 
development profits, extensions  
and other asset opportunities. 
Maintaining this majority freehold 
base continually supports our 
covenant, which is the critical  
element to ensure our access  
to the best sites – both freehold  
and leasehold.
We have reviewed our portfolio, and 
estimate our freehold interests to be 
worth £4.2 billion to £5.1 billion. 
Valuations are dependent on a number 
of factors, including the location type, 
trading outlook, rent cover and lease 
terms. This value has been based on  
a rent cover of 2.25x which we believe 
to be a suitable ratio in a cyclical  
sector to maintain our market-leading 
strengths through the cycle. We have 
also used an initial net yield of 4.5%  
to 5.5% based on individual sale and 
leaseback transactions. 
To reach these assumptions, we worked 
with a large property consultancy  
who conducted a desktop valuation, 
sampling 37% of sites and extrapolating 
across the estate. Sites were assessed 
individually based on available local 
benchmarks for rental values and their 
trading performance.
The yields quoted are strong and 
represent a robust business with a  
good trading outlook. Importantly, 
these yields reflect our covenant 
strength, so that moving away from  
a majority freehold estate would 
weaken our covenant, which would 
push up both our rental yields and  
costs of capital substantially. This  
in turn would reduce the value of  
the property.
The good yield assumes we optimise 
the rate of supply of Premier Inn 
freeholds placed into the market.  
The greater the supply into the market 
at a given time, the higher the yield  
and the lower the value we would be 
able to achieve.
We have already shown tremendous 
value creation through hotel extensions,  
and aim to broaden this through more 
active management of our property 
portfolio. We will pursue small scale sale 
and leaseback transactions to reinvest 
capital and demonstrate our covenant to 
prospective landlords, but Premier Inn’s 
objective is to remain a majority 
freehold business.
Currently 64% of our Premier Inn  
estate is freehold, but this will reduce  
to around 60% as the pipeline is built 
out. Retaining a majority freehold estate 
is important to maintain Premier Inn’s 
structural growth story.

Strategic report
Key performance indicators
Behind each of these headings are  
clear and measurable targets which 
together make up our balanced 
scorecard or WINcard as we call it 
(Whitbread In Numbers). It is used 
throughout the Company. Every hotel, 
restaurant and coffee shop has its  
own WINcard. All support centres,  
each business and the Group as  
a whole have their own WINcard. 
Every month the results are published 
throughout the Group so that everyone 
knows exactly how they are doing 
against the key targets, both financial 
and non–financial, for the year. As these 
are key strategic measures a number  
of them form an important part of the 
incentive schemes for our teams. Details 
of how the executive directors are 
rewarded for their performance are 
described in the remuneration report  
on pages 78 to 98. 
The WINcard targets are set at the 
beginning of each year and agreed  
with the Remuneration Committee. 
They are usually set above the level 
achieved in the previous year to target 
improved performance. 
The table on this and the following 
pages has been designed so as  
to provide greater transparency  
for shareholders. 
For each measure, the table shows 
whether the measure was incentivised 
in 2016/17 as well as whether it will  
be incentivised in 2017/18. For all 
incentivised measures the target for 
2016/17 is disclosed in the table.
As explained in last year’s report  
the family synergies and market 
performance measures were removed 
from the list of key performance 
indicators for 2016/17.
Whitbread’s business model, which  
can be found on pages 14 and 15  
shows how we create value for our 
stakeholders. The model’s foundation  
is the Customer Heartbeat schematic  
— Winning Teams, Customer Heartbeat, 
Profitable Growth, Force for Good and 
Everyday Efficiency. 
The progress we’re making
What the colours generally 
indicate:
A green WINcard is achieved 
where the performance is 
better than both previous 
year and target.
An amber score is for 
performance which is better 
than the prior year, but 
below target.
A red score is for a result below 
the previous year and target.
Team engagement
Our annual ‘Your Say’ survey 
provides us with insightful analysis  
on employee engagement and 
enablement. This is a key leading 
indicator of future performance, 
because it is our Winning Teams 
that make everyday experiences 
special for our customers so  
that they come back time and  
time again.
Team turnover
We measure the percentage of team 
members who leave the business 
during the year, with the aim of 
keeping team turnover as low as 
possible in order to have more settled 
and consistent teams, to provide a 
better service to our customers and to 
help us to keep the cost of recruitment 
and training low.
Health and safety
Nothing could be more important 
than the safety of our teams and 
customers. Independent audits are 
carried out throughout the year  
to check that standards are being 
maintained, with certain key areas 
resulting in automatic failure if they 
are not met.
Brand performance
With our aim to make everyday 
experiences special, it is vital that we 
have a robust way of measuring how 
our customers rate our performance 
in terms of recommendations and 
preference over other brands.  
This is a leading indicator of future 
performance.

a gateway to incentives rather than  
a hurdle, which will have the impact 
of increasing the importance of 
health and safety performance  
to incentive payouts. This is because 
all incentive payments will be at  
the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee in the event of  
a red score.

The Group Customer Heartbeat 
measure for 2017/18 will be a 
combination of Restaurants net 
recommend, Costa net recommend 
and Premier Inn brand health  
score, all of which are leading 
indicators of future performance.  
In each case a green score would 
require improvement beyond the 
2016/17 outcome.

Team engagement
Our annual ‘Your Say’ survey 
provides us with insightful analysis  
on employee engagement and 
enablement. This is a key leading 
indicator of future performance, 
because it is our Winning Teams 
that make everyday experiences 
special for our customers so  
that they come back time and  
time again.
Team turnover
We measure the percentage of team 
members who leave the business 
during the year, with the aim of 
keeping team turnover as low as 
possible in order to have more settled 
and consistent teams, to provide a 
better service to our customers and to 
help us to keep the cost of recruitment 
and training low.
Health and safety
Nothing could be more important 
than the safety of our teams and 
customers. Independent audits are 
carried out throughout the year  
to check that standards are being 
maintained, with certain key areas 
resulting in automatic failure if they 
are not met.
Brand performance
With our aim to make everyday 
experiences special, it is vital that we 
have a robust way of measuring how 
our customers rate our performance 
in terms of recommendations and 
preference over other brands.  
This is a leading indicator of future 
performance.

Key performance indicators continued
Underlying profit  
before tax
As with all businesses, we measure 
our financial success by the profits 
we make through growing our 
brands and operating our businesses 
efficiently. A budget is agreed 
annually with the Board each year, 
which sets a profit target.
Like for like sales growth
While we are investing in the organic 
growth of our hotels, restaurants and 
coffee shops, it is important that we 
closely watch how the mature parts  
of our business are performing.  
This enables us to make better 
investment decisions. 
Brand expansion
We have shown that we are able to 
create significant shareholder value 
by growing our successful brands. 
Growing, both in the UK and overseas, 
is integral to our strategic priorities 
and it is important that we measure 
our progress against the targets  
we have set.
Returns on investment
Our investors want to be able to  
judge how well we are investing  
their money in comparison to other 
investments they could make. We also 
want to compare the performance  
of our businesses and assets in order 
to focus our own plans. Measuring 
returns helps us to do this.
Premier Inn occupancy/ 
Costa total system sales
The expansion of our successful 
Premier Inn and Costa brands is  
a key strategic goal. We measure 
total Premier Inn occupancy in 
order to ensure that we are filling 
our rooms and Costa total system 
sales is a measure of Costa’s 
worldwide growth.
Electricity consumption
Companies have a responsibility  
to reduce their impact on the 
environment, which we fully endorse. 
There are also clear economic 
benefits in reducing electricity 
consumption, primarily through 
reduced energy bills. Being a Force 
for Good in our communities is 
important to our stakeholders.

Strategic report
As detailed in the Winning Teams 
Section (pages 24 to 29 of this 
report) throughout 2016/17 we 
have continued to invest in building 
and developing our people, from 
our customer-facing teams to our 
most senior executives. 
Aligned to Whitbread’s strategic  
goal to build a bigger and better 
Whitbread, significant ongoing focus 
has been placed on building our 
leadership capability to support future 
growth. Over the course of the year  
we have made progress against our  
key performance measures, which 
underpin our business plan through: 
• inspiring Winning Teams;
• developing leadership; and
• creating a ‘no limits to ambition’ 
environment.
Our culture remains strong and our 
people consistently report that they 
enjoy working at Whitbread, which  
was highlighted by an engagement 
score of 78% in our annual ‘Your Say’ 
engagement and enablement survey.  
In testament to these results, we have 
been recognised as the eighth ‘Best Big 
Company to work for’ in the prestigious 
Sunday Times listing of best companies 
and as a ‘Top Employer’ by the Top 
Employers Institute for the seventh  
year running. 
Developing leadership
Over the last year we have strengthened 
our leadership teams at every level and 
increased the quality of support behind 
our business strategies. Focus has been 
placed on bringing the leadership team 
closer to the customer and enabling  
a leaner and more agile business with 
faster decision making. To further 
evolve our portfolios, significant effort 
has been made to promote talent 
moves that broaden our leadership 
perspectives and capability and provide 
stretching career moves. We continue 
to recruit and develop our leaders to 
achieve the best talent for a strong 
future pipeline. 
In our operations we hired over 20,000 
employees, and offered over 500 of  
our team members the opportunity to 
become a site manager and run their 
own business with full accountability  
for profit and loss. 
Whitbread has had  
another strong year 
building Winning  
Teams across all of our  
businesses and markets
Our success is delivered every day through 
our people, so ensuring our teams are

to develop their careers is at the core of  
our strategy.

In our support centre we have focused 
on developing very specific capabilities 
including change and transformation, 
and we have enhanced the programme 
and project management teams  
who will deliver significant change 
programmes to support our business 
plans. Focus has also been placed  
on strengthening our commercial 
capability, from category management 
through to specialised procurement.  
We have also taken steps to develop  
our IS and digital teams, establishing 
digital firmly as a core shared service 
across Whitbread. 
Creating a ‘no limits to ambition’ 
environment 
In 2016/17 we have increased our focus 
on diversity and inclusion and made 
further progress towards our internal 
targets for nationality mix, gender  
and minority ethnic representation.  
At senior levels, gender representation 
continues to be a key priority across  
the Group and we know we need  
to continue to work hard to ensure  
that women and men are more  
equally balanced across our senior 
leadership teams. 
We have undertaken analysis into  
equal pay and gender pay and we  
are confident that we offer equal  
pay for equal work across the Group.  
Our early analysis indicates that we 
operate with gender imbalances at 
senior levels, with more men than 
women in senior roles. We are actively 
committed to addressing this and  
we continue to use every available 
opportunity to improve our gender 
balance at senior levels, including 
working with other organisations that 
have similar challenges to share best 
practice. We are proud that over  
50% of all our senior hires have been  
women, and we have worked with 
teams throughout the Company to 
sponsor and celebrate women coming 
through the business.
In the finance function we have 
launched a sponsorship scheme, 
listening groups and increased part-time 
and job sharing opportunities with the 
focus of addressing gender imbalance. 
We also proactively sponsor initiatives 
such as the ‘Women in Construction’ 
agenda, where we are extremely proud 
to say that our very own Alison Lindsay, 
Head of Architecture, was awarded the 
‘Lifetime Achievement’ award. 
In addition, our focus on creating a  
‘no limits to ambition’ environment has 
seen us continue to drive leadership 
awareness on the importance of 
diversity and promoting respect and 
inclusion in teams where everyone  
can achieve their potential. 
A breakdown of the directors of 
Whitbread, senior managers and all 
Whitbread employees, split by gender 
as of 2 March 2017, is set out  
on this page.
Reinforcing our values 
Our culture and leadership hold at the 
core that our people are treated fairly, 
empowered to develop their talent and 
listened to when they are concerned. 
Our Code of Conduct is a critical 
reinforcement of how we think and talk 
about ethical considerations, and every 
employee is required to read and 
acknowledge the code every year. 
We have recently published our first 
modern slavery report in compliance 
with the Modern Slavery Act. The full 
report outlines what we are doing to 
mitigate the risk of modern slavery 
taking place in our global supply chain 
and across our sites. With regard to  
our team members, we have a number 
of policies in place, including our  
right to work in the UK policy, which  
is supported by a comprehensive 
compliance programme. We also have  
a human trafficking policy which is 
available to all employees as well as 
‘Speaking Out’ and grievance policies 
enabling our team members to report 
any concerns they may have.

30-year career with Whitbread.

Winning Teams
Across the Group we employ  
over 50,000 people. It is our 
Winning Teams that make 
everyday experiences special for 
our customers so they come back 
time and time again and that’s 
why investing in our people is 
so important to us.
Our promise to our Winning Teams
Across our brands we have embedded 
promises to our people that underpin 
the Whitbread vision. This helps us 
attract and retain our employees  
and highlights what we stand for  
as an organisation. 
We know our team members make  
the single biggest difference by ‘helping 
our guests have a great night’s sleep’  
in Premier Inn; by ‘serving up great 
memories’ in our restaurants and by 
‘being passionate about making people 
smile and determined to impact the 
world’ in Costa. 
We want to make sure that all of our 
team members feel valued, recognised 
and have the opportunity and support 
to reach their full potential. That is why, 
in our restaurants, we are committed  
to making sure our teams feel they are 
‘the main ingredient’ in our recipe for 
success; why we strongly believe that 
our hotel teams make Premier Inn  
‘a place made by them’; and why we 
encourage our Costa teams to ‘bring 
their unique blend’ to all that they do.
‘Shaping your future and ours’ is our 
commitment to our hotel teams at  
hub by Premier Inn and reflects the 
innovation and tech savvy experience 
these hotels offer.
Our promise to our Winning Teams was 
highlighted through Whitbread being 
recognised as a ‘Top Employer’ for  
the seventh year running by the Top 
Employers Institute and as one of  
the ‘Best Big Companies to work for’, 
ranking eighth in the prestigious  
annual Sunday Times listing of best 
companies. We are very proud of  
these achievements as not only do they 
strengthen our promise to our Winning 
Teams, but they help us attract and 
retain our employees and showcase  
our values to our customers.
Our approach
• We recruit, reward, train and develop our team members to  
build highly engaged teams who deliver a great experience  
to our customers.
• We offer jobs and an industry-leading apprenticeship programme 
to grow talented leaders and we provide exciting international 
career prospects.

Listening to our Winning Teams
We understand that giving our people  
a voice is critical to ensuring that  
we are giving them the support they 
need and desire. Our 2016 ‘Your Say’ 
survey which used a tested measure  
of ‘engagement and enablement’  
was completed by over 39,000 people, 
which is 83% of eligible employees.  
In Costa we have seen a small decrease 
in engagement from last year, which we 
believe is due to organisational changes 
and a tougher trading environment.  
To drive higher levels of engagement 
over the next 12 months, we will be 
focusing on our communications 
strategy to ensure we build our teams’ 
understanding of our five year plan  
and the progress achieved against  
this. In addition, we will be focusing  
on our store managers’ capability 
through a store manager development 
programme. Overall Whitbread 
maintained its engagement score  
of 78% which, despite positioning 
us favourably against external 
comparisons, did not quite meet  
our 79% target and highlights further 
opportunities to improve. The results 
still pay fantastic testament to  
our commitment to improve overall 
working conditions and create  
Winning Teams, but we recognise  
that there is more to do.
Following feedback from our 2016 
survey, we know that we need to  
focus on enablement across our 
support centre. As a result we have  
built robust action plans to improve 
working environments, technology  
and explore more collaborative ways  
of working both within the support 
centre and across our brands.

Retaining our Winning Teams
We recognise and understand the 
importance of retaining our teams  
and team retention has replaced team 
turnover as a key performance indicator 
for 2017/18. We are delighted to say  
our efforts to challenge ourselves to 
outperform relative to our industry in 
improving retention have continued. 
We have continued to build on the 
positive momentum from last year and 
introduced further initiatives to engage, 
motivate and retain our teams. We are 
proud that each of our brands operates 
robust and tailored ‘Pay for Progression’ 
schemes that give team members  
the chance to develop their skills and 
progress through fair and transparent 
pay rates. We strongly believe that  
such initiatives are encouraging team 
members to stay and develop their 
careers with Whitbread and, as a result, 
we have seen increases in the number 
of our employees who have more than 
12 months’ service.
It is important however, that we remain 
proactive in our approach in order  
to maintain our momentum.
Developing our Winning Teams
We know that our teams are more 
engaged when they have access to 
career opportunities and they feel more 
enabled when they are given the chance 
to learn and develop. At Whitbread  
we are committed to developing our 
employees and actively seek to create 
opportunities to strengthen our teams. 
Over the last year we have launched 
exciting development programmes 
across the Group.
In Costa, a number of training and 
development programmes were 
developed with the aim of enhancing 
line manager capability across the 
globe. We continued to develop and  
roll out ‘Talent Camp’ which focused  
on enhancing support centre line 
managers’ understanding of recruitment 
and developing potential. Over 100  
of Costa’s line managers successfully 
completed ‘Talent Camp’. 
Costa also focused on maintaining 
essential coffee and core skills training 
to ensure we continue to meet our 
customers’ expectations and remain  
the UK’s favourite coffee shop chain. 
In Premier Inn we have launched a new, 
cross-functional senior management 
leadership programme targeted at 
strengthening our pipeline to senior 
leadership roles. This programme is 
enabling us to attract, retain and 
develop exceptional talent across  
our commercial functions.
In Premier Inn operations we have 
updated a suite of leadership 
development programmes and have 
continued to build a coaching culture 
through up-skilling multi-site managers 
and providing one to one coaching and 
peer to peer learning.
In our Restaurants, we are continuing 
core development activity by giving 
teams the opportunity to progress  
their careers using an online skills  
matrix and through our ‘Progressing 
Into’ management development 
programmes.
We have also focused on skill-based 
training for kitchen managers and  
chefs at one of our three food and 
beverage academies.

Rewarding and recognising our 
Winning Teams
Rewarding and recognising our Winning 
Teams continued to be a key focus 
throughout 2016/17. In addition to 
running central incentives, we have 
worked hard to implement specific 
initiatives that are tailored to suit and 
engage our different brands and teams 
to create relevant and meaningful total 
reward packages.
Throughout Premier Inn & Restaurants 
continued emphasis was placed on 
encouraging our managers to recognise 
their teams through our ‘My Rewards’ 
platform and local recognition. To 
support this, over £1 million was 
uploaded to the ‘My Rewards’ platform 
to be awarded to our Premier Inn & 
Restaurants team members. During 
2016/17, over 70% of team members 
registered on the platform received an 
award. However, we need to work even 
harder to ensure that a greater number 
of our team members are recognised,  
as the local recognition of our Winning 
Teams is at the heart of our 
engagement strategy.
Across Premier Inn we also continued  
to celebrate teams who achieved  
an ‘All Green’ WINcard by rewarding  
an additional week’s salary when all  
key performance indicators are met.  
In Restaurants we have built on the 
momentum of last year’s ‘Kitchens  
of Excellence’ event and continued  
to provide kitchen teams with a 
dedicated scorecard to help them 
achieve excellence in their sites. The 
number of kitchens meeting this 
standard improved significantly this 
year and these were rewarded on a 
quarterly basis through ‘My Rewards’. 
The very best kitchen teams were also 
selected to compete to represent their 
brand at the highly regarded ‘Kitchens 
of Excellence’ final. 
In Costa, the existing team member 
reward platform was broadened to 
create an employee benefits portal  
Strategic report Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 27
to provide access to information  
on all employee benefits. UK based 
employees can now benefit from 
discounted gym membership  
across a number of the UK’s leading 
gym companies. 
Costa celebrated its 11th ‘Barista of  
the Year’ competition culminating in  
a two-day global final, which was an 
opportunity to celebrate and recognise 
the pride, passion and personality  
of those at the very heart of our 
business, as individuals competed  
to be crowned the global Costa 
‘Champion of Champions’.
Work placements and apprenticeships 
for our Winning Teams
Whitbread created WISE (Whitbread 
Investing in Skills & Employment)  
in 2012 to create employment 
opportunities and support people’s 
entry into employment and onto 
apprenticeships, by connecting with  
the education system. 
WISE is a structured and quality assured 
programme with bold targets that 
educates, engages and employs people 
who are often from difficult backgrounds, 
supporting them into the world of  
work through:
1.   Work experience placements and 
school visits for 11-18 year olds. 
2.   Employment placements – for 
people of all ages who are not in 
education, employment or training.
3.   Apprenticeships and functional  
skills – for team members who  
want to gain nationally recognised 
qualifications.
Whitbread’s commitment to 
apprenticeships was recognised 
through being ‘Highly Commended’  
at the 2016 National Apprenticeship 
Awards.
The achievements of our WISE 
programme have helped create 
accessible local community work  
routes through community partnerships 
that support young people. 17% of  
WISE apprentices have progressed  
to management and we are proud to  
say that 25% of our hotel managers 
were previous apprentices. We are 
committed to the ongoing support and 
development of our WISE programme 
to improve the well-being, self-esteem, 
confidence and employability of  
people not previously in education, 
employment or training.
During 2016/17 across Whitbread WISE 
successfully achieved:
 Over 800
Apprentices in learning
Over 400
Work placements
Almost 300
Work experiences
Building on the success of WISE in 
Premier Inn, during 2016/17, Costa 
launched its own WISE programme. 
Since launch over 200 adult work 
placements have been completed  
with each graduate receiving  
a Level 1 Introduction into Hospitality 
qualification, credible work experience 
with Costa, a reference and interview 
experience. To demonstrate the  
impact of this programme, almost  
100 graduates of the scheme were 
recruited into the business during the 
year representing a 46% conversion  
into employment.
2016/17 was a great year for the  
WISE team in Costa and they are  
proud to have attracted almost 200 
apprentice’s nationally with many  
more in the pipeline to graduate.  
The apprenticeship provides a credible 
alternative to education as well as an 
attractive career with Costa. 
In addition to the suite of apprenticeships 
offered in Premier Inn, work has been 
completed for Costa to launch its 
advanced level apprenticeship next 
year. This has been designed to nurture 
all the necessary skills to become an 
assistant manager. Plans are also in 
place to introduce the higher level 
apprenticeship, geared at developing 
the skills required to grow into a Costa 
store manager.
I love the job I do and winning 
this competition has really 
made me strive to do  
better and teach others.”
Giorgio Ventisei  
Costa Barista of the Year 2016
 Barista of the Year 
Barista of the Year is integral to 
Costa: coffee is at the heart of our 
business and baristas are at the 
heart of our operations – inspiring 
our customers to love great coffee 
every day of the year.
The search for our 11th Costa Barista 
of the Year began in June through  
a series of store heats all around the 
world. After months of heats that 
grew in difficulty at each stage, nine 
finalists were crowned business unit 
champions and invited to our annual 
final – designed to crown the very 
best barista in the Costa world. 
Giorgio Ventisei claimed our revered 
trophy and was crowned ‘Champion 
of Champions 2016’.

Winning Teams

Diversity and inclusion in our  
Winning Teams
Across all of Whitbread we promote, 
respect and value differences to create 
an inclusive environment. There are  
no barriers to entry and no limits to 
ambition. Our ability to grow as an 
organisation depends on our ability  
to attract, develop and retain diverse 
teams as we believe that a diverse 
organisation encourages better 
innovation and decision making. As  
an equal opportunities employer, not  
only do we value, grow and celebrate 
people who have diverse perspectives 
whatever their age, gender, sexuality, 
ethnicity, disability or religious belief,  
we believe it gives us greater 
connectivity with our customers  
and a commercial advantage.
Across Whitbread, promoting diversity, 
respect and inclusion is a local, line 
management accountability as well as  
a corporate activity. Over 2016/17 we 
have been successful not only through 
Group-led activity but also through 
local initiatives and through employees’ 
personal passion.
Flexible working
We have explored ways to increase 
flexible working to allow roles to be 
accessible to a broader range of 
employees. In Costa, part-time working 
was integrated into the role of the area 
manager to suit flexible working needs.
Gender balance
Focus has continued on the promotion 
of gender balance, particularly at  
senior levels and in functions where 
there has been a gender imbalance. 
Efforts have been made to ensure we 
provide gender balanced shortlists in 
recruitment and that our succession 
pools include a strong mix, ensuring we 
provide quality stretching opportunities 
for individuals to grow their careers.
Learning difficulties and disabilities
In early 2017 we opened the Premier Inn 
training centre within Derwen College 
for young people with learning 
difficulties and disabilities. The training 
centre is fitted out to the specifications 
of a Premier Inn hotel and allows 
students to develop their skills in 
housekeeping and reception. The 
training centre aims to build students’ 
confidence and self-esteem, providing 
opportunity to gain work experience 
and move into paid employment with 
Premier Inn.
GLOW
Momentum of the GLOW (Gay & 
Lesbian Out at Whitbread) network  
has been further leveraged through 
internal social channels to boost  
team engagement and enhance 
community activity. We are proud to 
have celebrated a member of our Costa 
leadership team being recognised in the 
OUTstanding & Financial Times Leading 
LGBT+ Ally Executives list. In further 
support of the LGBT community, we 
invited world-class barista Mason 
Salisbury to train UK Costa baristas to 
make Rainbow Flat Whites in selected 
stores. The Rainbow Flat Whites were  
a huge success and were served in four 
cities over the summer aligned with 
Pride events. 
Ethnicity
We have focused on improving the  
level of data capture on ethnicity within 
our recruitment processes in order to 
strengthen insight on our workforce 
demographics. We need to place 
further focus on ethnic diversity in  
order to ensure that we are a truly 
diverse and inclusive organisation.
Over the course of the next 12 months 
and beyond, we will continue our 
commitment to create and develop  
a diverse and inclusive working 
environment where everyone has the 
opportunity to reach their full potential. 
We want to create an inclusive culture 
where everyone feels that they can 
bring their whole self to work, as the 
energy and desire of our teams play  
a key role in our future success.
Graduate schemes 
We have continued to operate our 
award winning graduate schemes, 
across both operations and support 
centre, attracting over 2,000 
applications to our schemes that 
commence in autumn 2017. 
Our operational graduate schemes  
are designed for commercially focused 
graduates, offering exposure to various 
roles and operational areas. Not only 
have these schemes helped develop our 
internal talent pipeline, but the training 
on offer equips our graduates with  
a deep understanding of how our 
businesses work from the ground up. 
These schemes have also provided our 
graduates with the skills and attributes 
needed to successfully lead a Winning 
Team within one of our Costa stores  
or Premier Inn hotels.
Our functional programmes cover  
HR, finance, IS, marketing, property  
and procurement. The experience  
has helped our graduates to develop 
their skills, build a network of contacts 
and gain exposure in a range of areas

enrolling on our Advanced Apprenticeship in Hospitality Management,  
earning while learning at work. Paige valued the structured programme, 
support system of regular reviews and feedback about her performance at 
Leeds Premier Inn. Paige demonstrates the opportunities to develop and

Our graduates have acquired  
function-specific experience, technical 
training and support for the professional 
qualifications they wish to work towards.
Our international Winning Teams
Our Costa International markets have 
continued to focus on acting upon 
feedback from our employees through 
our annual ‘Your Say’ survey, specifically 
paying attention to growing capability 
and creating attractive reward packages 
for team members.
In Costa Poland, focus is centred on 
developing internal talent pipelines, 
introducing efficiency driven pay, 
benefits for baristas and development 
of leadership skills. 
Costa has continued to invest in  
building international experience 
through moving talent and has created 
a dedicated business development 
team located in South East Asia. 
Significant focus has also been placed 
on working with our partners on  
social initiatives that are important  
for our customers as well as building 
capability within barista and store 
manager populations.
2,000
Our graduate schemes across both 
operations and support centre,

Costa China continued to grow 
capability within stores and over  
500 store employees graduated from 
‘Learning Journey’ programmes. These 
employees now form the internal talent 
pipeline for future leadership roles 
within our store teams. Costa China  
also invested in advanced level coffee 
knowledge training for the ‘Hot  
House’ team members to build their 
knowledge, skills and confidence  
around coffee. The new and exciting 
‘Hot House’ store format enabled 
formulisation and trial of a new  
incentive scheme that allows store  
team members to share in extra profit  
that the store generates.
Following the successful opening of  
our first Premier Inn site in Germany, our 
team is still new but growing. Increasing 
occupancy and sales have allowed us to 
increase the number of team members 
and we have proactively sought to 
recruit a diverse workforce through 
supporting the organisation ‘Joblinge’ 
which helps to bring young refugees in 
to the workplace. Since September, we 
have offered internships and permanent 
employment through this partnership. 
We are focused on ensuring our teams 
are happy and engaged and we are 
proud to have already achieved positive 
feedback in our annual ‘Your Say’ 
engagement and enablement survey.
A successful year
2016/17 has been a successful year  
with continued focus on creating an 
environment where our Winning

opportunity and we have strong plans 
in place to continue this momentum 
through 2017/18 and beyond.

Customer Heartbeat
Another award winning year
In the past year our leading brands, 
Premier Inn and Costa, have cemented 
their positions as the UK’s favourite 
hotel chain and coffee shop chain 
respectively. For the seventh year in  
a row Costa was voted the Nation’s 
Favourite Coffee Shop Brand by Allegra.
Premier Inn was named the UK’s  
Top Rated Hotel Chain for a second 
consecutive year in the Which? Hotel 
Chain Survey, and for the first time, 
picked up the award for Travel Brand  
of the Year in the 2016 Which? Awards. 
These accolades are especially 
significant as they are voted for by 
Which? members and the general 
public and Premier Inn was recognised 
for providing a ‘first class experience’  
at ‘very competitive prices’. 
Premier Inn also featured heavily  
in the TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice 
Awards and the Premier Inn London 
Bank took the No. 1 slot for Best  
Family Hotel in the UK. 621 hotels 
received a TripAdvisor Certificate  
of Excellence Award.
Our individual brand guest satisfaction 
surveys provide us with a valuable tool 
to find out what is important to our 
customers and how we can improve 
upon their experience. These surveys 
show that our teams are already doing  
a great job serving our customers,  
with nine out of ten Premier Inn guests 
saying they will definitely consider 
staying again and 87% of Costa 
customers saying they are likely to 
revisit but, of course, we recognise  
there is always more we can do to 
deliver even better experiences for our 
customers, as evidenced by the targets 
that we set ourselves.
We use YouGov Brand Index and  
Brand Preference trackers to monitor 
our progress against competitors

With over 3,500 Costa stores around 
the world and 762 Premier Inns in the 
UK alone, we are able to be everywhere 
our customers need and want us to be. 
To ensure our products and services 
meet customers increasingly high 
expectations, we invest significantly  
in maintaining the quality of our stores, 
hotels and restaurants.
In 2016/17 we refurbished 4,450  
Premier Inn rooms, whilst in our 
Restaurants business we converted 
three Table Table sites to Beefeater,  
and all our Taybarns sites to Brewers 
Fayre. In Costa we have been rolling  
out a re-imaging programme with 169 
stores getting a new look in the year. 
Our Drive Thru stores are proving  
very popular with customers and we 
opened 16 sites in the year and now 
have 52 around the UK. Following  
a successful 13 store trial, the Costa 
Pronto format will be rolled out more 
widely in 2017/18. Costa Pronto stores 
are specially designed to meet the 
increasing demand for ‘on the go’ 
coffee, with specially designed counters 
to enable our baristas to improve  
the speed of service and avoid lengthy 
customer queues.
As shown on TV
2016/17 has been an exciting year for 
Premier Inn and Costa as they both 
launched brand new TV advertising 
campaigns. Costa’s biggest ever 
campaign went live in October during 
the first X Factor Live show and 
celebrated the promise of ‘never a dull 
cup’, showcasing Costa’s reputation  
for delivering quality handcrafted 
barista-made coffee. 170 baristas got 
the opportunity to take part in the 
humorous advert as members of an 
enthusiastic audience watching a highly 
unorthodox motivational speaker.
September 2016 saw the launch of 
Premier Inn’s bold new multi-channel 
advertising campaign, ‘A Great Place  
to Start’, with the first in a series of  
four TV commercials. The campaign 
featured different storylines showing 
how Premier Inn provided a great start 
to the day for their guests, whether 
that’s a family celebrating Great Aunt 
Mabel’s birthday or a group of ladies 
getting ready for a night out. 
China is an important market for Costa, 
where we currently have over 400 
stores. We are trialling an innovative 
new store format in five Shanghai 
stores, involving a completely new store 
design and food and drink offer. The 
stylish new interior gives more focus  
to the counter and food display, which 
includes freshly made sandwiches,  
and the use of natural woods and soft 
fabrics and lighting help to create a 
warm, welcoming environment. The 
new food range includes freshly made 
sandwiches and premium desserts 
whilst Costa’s coffee credentials are 
brought to the fore with new brewing 
methods such as single origin hand 
pouring coffee and Old Paradise Street 
blends. Initial customer feedback has 
been promising with over 80% saying 
they would be likely to return and we 
plan to roll the design out to more 
stores in the year ahead.

Innovating our coffee
Since being founded by brothers  
Bruno and Sergio Costa in 1971, Costa 
has been at the forefront of Britain’s 
growing love affair with coffee, and  
we are on a mission to inspire the  
world to love great coffee. Britain  
is now undoubtedly a nation of  
coffee lovers, but at Costa we believe  
there is much more to do to bring  
new premium coffee experiences  
to customers. As part of Costa’s 
commitment to create exciting coffee 
experiences for customers, our ‘never  
a dull cup’ campaign promoted the 
delights of a Cortado and Flat White 
and was supported by nationwide 
coffee masterclasses.
In October, we opened a new  
concept store in Wandsworth in 
London, promising to deliver new  
coffee and food experiences in a  
stylish environment. The concept  
store responds to evolving appetite  
for fresh ways to enjoy coffee and a 
flavoursome new range of coffee beans 
and brews is on offer including three 
slow drip, single origin blends from 
Sumatra, Kenya and Colombia, all 100% 
Arabica beans. Also available is a cold 
brew coffee, which is steeped for 20 
hours and served over ice to create  
a delicious and refreshing drink. An 
enhanced food menu is also available  
at the Wandsworth store featuring 
delicious additions such as avocado  
on toast, macarons and an antipasti 
sharing plate.
customer selects from the chiller 
cabinet, which is then lovingly blended 
and prepared in front of them by their 
barista. They come in three refreshing 
flavours from a mix of pineapple, melon, 
passionfruit, apple, kiwi, strawberries 
and grapes and contain one of your  
‘five a day’.
Our stores in White City London and 
Milton Keynes are exploring how to 
deliver an enhanced food offer to 
customers displaying products in a new 
counter display with some products 
prepared fresh on site. Costa Poland  
is also addressing consumer trends for 
healthy fresh food with the opening  
of its new concept store at the Chopin 
Airport in Warsaw. The store has a 
number of dishes suitable for vegetarians 
and vegans and serves a wide range  
of savoury food including freshly made 
baguettes, French pastries and cookies 
that are all baked in the store. 
Innovating our food offer in Costa
Increasing customer demand for  
an enhanced food offer with greater 
choice of lighter, fresher and healthier 
options is driving our food development. 
We are doing this through a mix of 
reformulating existing products and  
the introduction of new items including 
healthy wraps and salads, as well as a 
trial of Costa’s ‘It’s All Good’ range in 
selected stores.

Innovating in Premier Inn  
& Restaurants
‘hub by Premier Inn’ is a new generation 
of smartly designed hotels, perfect for 
people who want to be in the heart of 
the city at an affordable price. With  
five hub hotels now open across London 
and Edinburgh, technology features 
heavily throughout the hotels’ cleverly 
crafted compact rooms. To celebrate 
the opening of the Brick Lane hub in 
June and to showcase its connectivity 
credentials, the launch event featured 
rapper, Tinchy Stryder, who challenged 
himself to create a track using inspiration 
from the digital surroundings of the 
hotel and the vibrant areas of Brick 
Lane, all produced from his hotel room. 
In March 2016, Whitbread launched  
its first ever Bar + Block steakhouse 
restaurant in the centre of Birmingham, 
followed by two more openings in 
London’s Kings Cross and Whiteley 
shopping centre in Fareham. Like 
Beefeater, Bar + Block has quality  
steak at its core and offers a distinctive 
‘Butcher’s Block’ which offers a range  
of rotating unique special cuts, all  
hand cut to order. An informal all-day 
dining destination, Bar + Block has  
been specifically designed to thrive in 
high street and city centre locations 
alongside a Premier Inn. The stylish and 
contemporary interiors make a feature 
of the large open kitchen and central 
bar, serving innovative cocktails and  
a specially curated wine list.
For our Beefeater guests we have 
introduced some exciting new dishes 
and drinks that complement the stylish 
new interiors with great dishes like 
Smokehouse style Duo of Beef, our 
Craft Guild of Chefs award winning 
Crispy Tabasco Chicken Burger and  
a new range of premium milkshakes  
and cocktails. In Brewers Fayre we have 
launched new menu categories and 
dishes in partnership with beverage 
brands, such as the Jack Daniel’s 
category which offers a special  
Jack Daniel’s burger, ribs and Beef & 
Doom Bar pie. A new range of cask ales 
is also proving popular with customers. 
We are encouraging new guests to  
experience our restaurants with 
promotional partnerships and new 
communication channels.
To address consumer trends for 
healthier, fresher food as well as 
supporting Government goals to 
improve the nation’s health we have 
developed a nutrition strategy, focused 
on four key pillars. These are to provide 
customers with greater choice of 
healthier, lighter dishes; to ensure 
transparency of nutritional information 
to enable customers to make an 
informed choice; to reformulate those 
dishes that are high in saturated fats, 
salt and added sugar; and to ensure that 
our advertising, especially to children,  
is responsible and that we are promoting 
healthier dishes. Examples of this 
strategy in action include greater choice 
of healthier foods in our spring 2017 
menus, better access to nutritional 
information and enhanced children’s 
menus with more healthy dishes to 
choose from and reformulation of top 
selling favourites, such as spaghetti 
bolognese, with reduced levels of salt 
and sugar. We are committed to doing 
more to improve the nutritional content 
of our menus and playing our role in 
improving the nation’s health.

Delighting customers with  
digital services
Our products and services are 
increasingly delivered digitally. Whether 
that is searching for the hotel closest  
to where you need to be, booking a 
hotel room from your mobile phone or 
pre-ordering your cup of coffee so it is 
ready to collect. Customers have high 
expectations of how digital technology 
will make their day to day lives easier 
and at Whitbread we are investing 
significantly in building core expertise  
in our in-house digital teams to ensure 
we continually delight customers with 
innovative new products and services. 
At Premier Inn over 80% of all bookings 
are made online at premierinn.com  
and in 2016/17 we made some exciting 
new developments to our digital and 
mobile offer including the launch of  
a new mobile site. The new site has 
been designed to make the customer 
search and booking journey as easy  
and enjoyable as possible to boost 
conversion rates. In the year, we also 
launched a new German website  
www.premierinn.de on a platform that  
is scalable to support our international 
expansion and we relaunched the 
Beefeater website in line with the  
new Beefeater brand proposition.

Building customer love  
through loyalty
Our customers enjoy added value 
through being a member of our  
brand loyalty programmes. Costa 
Coffee Club now has over five million 
active members and enjoyed significant 
increase in usage in the year, driven 
primarily by a new data-driven retention 
programme. Over 20% of registered 
Costa Coffee Club customers now 
transact using the Costa Coffee Club 
app and over the year the digital team 
has made a number of improvements, 
including simplification of the registration 
process, which has led to a 15% increase 
year on year in people actively using the 
app. The team is also working on lots  
of new and exciting features to deliver 
an even more engaging app experience 
to Costa Coffee Club holders in the  
year ahead.
Across our restaurant brands loyalty 
programmes we now have 1.9 million 
card holders, up 12% in the year. Loyalty 
card members spend around 7 – 11% 
more with us than non-card holders and 
41% of active members have redeemed 
their vouchers over the course of the 
year, enjoying the benefits that 
membership provides.
For Premier Inn corporate customers 
who want to book directly, we have 
developed our Business Booker tool.  
It has its own website, where customers 
can manage their account and enjoy 
added value services, including 
preferential commercial terms and 
smart reporting. Current corporate sales 
customers have been moved onto this 
platform and it will be made widely 
available to the UK SME market in 2017.
The Costa digital team has been 
working on an exciting new app feature 
that allows customers to pre–order their 
coffee and come to collect it in store. 
When a customer arrives in store their 
coffee is ready and waiting for them on 
the Costa Collect counter with no need 
to queue. Costa Pay & Collect has been 
trialled in ten London stores and has 
received positive customer feedback 
along with key learnings that we will use 
to enhance the app and create a great 
in-store experience for customers and 
baristas. The new enhanced service will 
be piloted in 2017/18 with plans to roll 
out more widely across the estate 
towards the end of the year.
Across our brands we continue  
to grow our social media presence  
and enjoy high levels of engagement  
in the content that we post. Costa  
has 1.5 million Facebook fans and 
c.224,000 Twitter followers and 211,000

Profitable Growth Profitable Growth
During 2016/17 Premier Inn and 
Costa delivered organic expansion 
combined with like for like sales 
growth resulting in a Group total 
sales increase of 8.2% to £3.1 billion. 
Group underlying profit before tax 
which rose by 6.2% to £565.2 
million and profit for the year 
increased 7.4% to £415.9 million. 
Whitbread is highly cash 
generative with cash generated 
from operations of £860.1 million 
which supports our dividend and 
capital investment programme. 
Our total cash capital investment 
for 2016/17 was £609.8 million as 
we maintained our market leading 
position through re-investment  
in our estate and by delivering 
organic growth. Our continual 
focus on returns and disciplined 
financial management enabled us 
to deliver a good return on capital 
of 15.2% (2015/16: 15.3%).
Operational review and progress on 
strategic priorities
In April 2016, we outlined our three 
strategic priorities to deliver long-term 
sustainable growth and shareholder 
value. Since then, we have made 
positive progress across all three areas.
1.  Grow and innovate in our core UK 
businesses;
2.  Focus on our strengths to grow 
internationally; and 
3.  Build capability and infrastructure  
to support long-term growth.
Details on our progress are provided  
on the following pages.
Our approach
• We invest in high returning, profitable sites
• We innovate with new formats to provide further growth 
opportunities
• We are growing in selected international markets
• Our Premier Inn & Restaurants joint site model provides efficiency 
and creates incremental returns
• Costa uses a number of ownership models, including equity stores, 
franchise and joint venture

Strategic Priority
1 Grow and 
innovate in 
our core UK 
businesses
In 2016/17, we opened 25 net new hotels 
taking our total number of hotels in the 
UK to 762, over 200 more than our 
nearest competitor. During this period 
Premier Inn UK has grown total sales by 
8.9% and total rooms available by 9.3%, 
whilst retaining high occupancy. Our 
unrivalled network coverage means  
we bring our customers closer to their 
destination, a key consideration for  
both leisure and business guests.
Quality and value for money
We focus on delivering a consistent, 
quality product across our network 
through our systematic refurbishment 
programme and, by the end of the year, 
over 80% of our estate were our most 
recent designs, c.14% more than two 
years ago. We prioritise high occupancy 
and value for money to build long-term 
customer loyalty and this approach  
has resulted in Premier Inn growing its 
occupancy to 80.2% and enabled us  
to achieve consistently high scores for 
both quality and value from YouGov. 
Automated Trading Engine
In June this year we launched our  
new Automatic Trading Engine (ATE)  
to build on our value for money 
credentials, as well as optimising  
our rate, occupancy and new hotel 
maturity going forward.
We are very much in the 12-18 month 
‘test and learn’ phase. However, we 
expect ATE to drive our total sales 
growth as we focus on further 
occupancy growth, optimising rate  
to match the demand and accelerating 
the maturity of our new rooms. 
Direct distribution
Our focus on providing our guests  
with the best digital booking platform 
has been vital to our success. We have 
grown our direct digital distribution 
from 77% in 2013/14 to 88% in 2016/17, 
driving incremental revenue and 
reducing our reliance on third party 
distribution. Not only does direct 
distribution provide our lowest cost 
booking channel, it also enables a direct 
relationship with our customers, helping 
to build loyalty over time. Our total 
direct distribution now stands at  
a record 94%.
The London Opportunity
Our share of the London hotel market 
remains relatively low at c.8% providing 
a substantial growth opportunity.  
Over the last three years we have 
increased our rooms available by 49.4%, 
compared with 12.5% for the Midscale 
and Economy market, and grown 
accommodation sales by 43.7% 
compared with 21.4% respectively as  
we continue to win market share. Our 
London sites mature rapidly with new 
hotels reaching occupancy of c.80% in 
their first year whilst at the same time 
maintaining the total London estate’s 
occupancy at over 85%. 
Our compact city centre hotel concept 
‘hub by Premier Inn’ has been a great 
success giving us access to profitable 
city centre locations with high property 
costs, delivering a good return on 
capital, whilst offering customers  
great value, high quality rooms in  
great locations.
The UK is our largest market and we  
will continue to invest in our people,  
our brands and our systems to capture 
the significant growth opportunities 
available in both coffee and branded 
budget hotels. 
In the UK hotel market, the independent 
sector which accounts for c.50% of the 
market is in decline, while the budget 
branded sector is benefitting from 
continued growth, reflecting customers’ 
desire for quality and value for money. 
The coffee sector has a high growth 
forecast benefitting from a global 
consumer lifestyle trend, demand for 
quality coffee and habitual purchase 
behaviours.
Premier Inn UK
As the UK’s number one hotel company 
our business model is clearly well placed 
to capture the shift to value brands with 
our compelling proposition, loyal guests, 
direct distribution model and focus on 
operational excellence. Our network 
strength gives customers the greatest 
choice of locations and we offer the 
best value for money which results in 
our high occupancy across the estate, 
and 94% of our guest bookings direct 
with Premier Inn. Our market leading 
occupancy and direct distribution 
means our growth continues to be at 
high returns with our committed UK 
pipeline expected to achieve similar 
returns to the c.13% achieved today.
Network strength
Premier Inn is the leading hotel brand in 
the UK with 68,081 UK hotel rooms and 
some 9,000 rooms opened during the 
last two years. Our committed hotel 
room pipeline is strong and stands at 
c.14,500 rooms, and we are well on 
track to achieve our 2020 milestone  
of c.85,000 UK rooms, with line of sight 
to 100,000 rooms.

We now have four hub hotels open in 
London and one in Edinburgh, with a

next three years. Customer feedback  
on the proposition has been excellent, 
with 4.5/5 TripAdvisor score across all 
sites and 89% of guests rating hub an 
“excellent” or “very good” experience. 
Furthermore, occupancy has been 
c.85% for our hub sites in London,  
which are expected to deliver returns  
in line with our existing Premier Inn 
estate at maturity.
UK Regions
Over the last three years we have 
increased our rooms available by 22.0% 
and grown accommodation sales by 
38.3%, compared with growth in the 
Midscale and Economy sector of 6.7% 
and 30.5% respectively, as we continue 
to win market share. 
Our new hotels continue to perform 
well, maturing fast and becoming 
profitable with occupancy of c.75%  
in the first year, reaching full maturity  
in 3-4 years. We continued to achieve 
high occupancy in the total regional 
estate of c.80%.
Further growth with good returns
Our UK committed pipeline has grown 
to 14,500 rooms, of which c.5,900 are in 
London and c.8,600 are in the regions. 
Moreover, our extension programme 
has been driving incremental like for like 
sales growth and good returns and 
constitutes c.20% of our committed 
pipeline outside of London.
Food and beverage offering for 
Premier Inn customers
Our joint site restaurants continue  
to play an important role in serving 
Premier Inn guests and delivering higher 
RevPAR and returns. Restaurants grew 
total sales by 1.2%, with a marginal 
reduction in like for like sales of 0.3%, 
albeit we continued to perform ahead  
of our competitor set. We continue to 
focus on our guests and our teams, with 
high customer satisfaction scores and  
a significant reduction in team turnover, 
achieved with the help of investment 
initiatives such as our new labour 
scheduling tool.
We continue to make good progress  
in rejuvenating our restaurant brands, 
converting a further 53 restaurants  
to our modern ‘Orange Cow’ Beefeater 
concept and are on track to complete 
the remaining conversions in the  
first half of 2017/18. Our new 
contemporary city centre restaurant 
format, Bar + Block, is trading well  
and receiving very high customer 
satisfaction scores. We now have one 
open in London, one in Birmingham  
and one in Fareham, with five planned 
to open during 2017/18.
Costa
In Costa we offer the largest network  
of coffee shops in the UK and, with our 
strong brand, we are in a great position 
to capitalise on future market growth 
opportunities, growing from 2,218 stores 
today to over 3,000 stores in the 
medium-term. 
Costa has been named as the UK’s 
favourite coffee shop chain for the 
seventh year in a row, underpinned by 
our relentless focus on quality coffee 
and on achieving high customer 
satisfaction scores.

stores increasing by 2.0%. 
Investing to drive like for like growth
The market and competitive landscape 
continue to evolve with more food-led 
operators now offering coffee and, 
while convenience and coffee quality 
remain the top decision criteria, 
customers are becoming more 
demanding in the way their priorities  
are met. 
At Costa we are focused on meeting 
this challenge and serving the best 
quality coffee and fresher food via  
more tailored store designs, with a 
complementary digital experience. 
During the year we invested in new 
MerryChef ovens and microwaves 
across the estate, which will facilitate 
the roll-out of new hot food ranges 
during 2017/18, starting with the launch 
of our new better breakfast offering 
during the first half. We also recently 
extended our coffee range through new 
initiatives in the Cortado family and will 
build on this innovation with the launch 
of cold brew and new single origin 
blends during this year. 
Investing in the brand and  
digital capability
We continue to invest in our digital 
capability and our new till system will be 
installed during 2017/18, enabling faster 
service and new functionality to provide 
the platform for further Pay & Collect 
trials towards the end of this year and  
a wider roll-out thereafter.
To increase our engagement with our 
c.5.2 million active Costa Coffee Club 
members we are enhancing our app  
to enable a better customer experience 
and more targeted offers, as well  
as gaining a much richer source of 
customer data, habits and insight.  
The new-look app will be released  
in the first half of 2017/18.
Pipeline weighted towards high 
performing channels
Future growth will also be underpinned 
through diversification of our channels 
and formats as we recognise that 
customer requirements differ by 
location. For example, our Pronto 
format is optimised to sell our hand-
crafted coffee quickly in high footfall 
locations, such as travel hubs at peak 
times, taking advantage of the volume 
opportunity presented. Drive Thrus are 
also delivering very high sales volumes 
and returns and, together with travel 
channels, are our fastest growing 
category and will become a greater 
proportion of our estate going forward.

using successful initiatives including 
fresher food, innovative drink ranges 
and new store formats. We reached 
profitability in 2016/17 and see potential 
to significantly increase the number  
of stores in this market. We also have 
259 Costa Express machines in Poland, 
which are performing well.
We continue to see strong growth in  
our profitable franchise business with  
a total of 731 stores across 23 countries. 
Our franchise business has grown 
rapidly over a number of years through 
our successful business model of great 
partnerships, efficient logistics and  
a focus on localisation and customer 
demographics. Going forward we will 
select target markets with the highest 
potential for us to grow profitably  
and win market share.
In France we have decided to pursue a 
franchise only strategy resulting in the 
recent closure of our five equity stores. 
Costa Asia 
China is a large market with a 
burgeoning middle class and the 
propensity to drink coffee is on  
the rise. This presents an exciting 
opportunity for Costa to become  
the clear number two in the market.  
We have built a solid foundation from 
which to grow, but will take a more 
strategic approach as we narrow our 
focus across ten top tier cities to build 
scale and a brand presence. We will  
also exit or turnaround poor performing 
stores to improve the overall profitability 
of our estate. We will enhance our  
brand awareness through digital media, 
build our coffee credentials and create 
the meeting place of choice for our 
target customer through improved 
store formats. 
During the year we opened 63 gross 
new stores and exited 37 stores in 
China. In addition, we have introduced 
five new-look concept stores with an 
improved customer proposition and, 
although early days, results have been 
promising, and we aim to add additional 
new concept stores over the course  
of 2017/18. The success of these stores 
so far gives us greater confidence  
in our ability to build scale successfully 
in this growing market and look for 
opportunities to accelerate our strategy.

Costa Express
Costa Express is an exciting global 
growth engine for Costa and we see 
potential to double the size of this  
part of the business. This year we 
installed 1,585 net new machines 
bringing our total to 6,801, including 
740 internationally. As well as renewing 
our key UK customer contract, we  
also embarked on our entry into  
a number of new markets with  
plans to roll out in 2017/18.
We are upgrading our machines with 
new management systems, which will 
enhance our scalability and allow us  
to monitor and control the machines 
and their content remotely. This will  
be important to the success of our 
international roll-out.
We are upgrading the customer screens 
to bring the best quality experience and 
benefit our partners by enabling options 
such as site specific advertising.
In November we announced c.£150 
million of cost efficiencies over five 
years to help offset investment and  
cost pressures facing our sector, such  
as National Living Wage and business 
rates. Through this we will become  
a leaner and more agile business, 
sustaining good margins as we grow.
During the year we have made good 
progress against these initiatives with 
the renegotiation and consolidation  
of key supplier contracts and the 
implementation of new labour 
management tools across Costa  
and Restaurants, to facilitate better 
scheduling and communications  
with team members. We have also 
completed the in-sourcing of our digital 
teams and will shortly commence the 
roll-out of new tills across Costa. 
As part of our plan to build a better 
infrastructure, in March we opened  
our new state of the art Roastery  
to drive innovation and efficiency, 
facilitating Costa’s global growth for  
the next 20 years. This £38 million 
investment will increase roasting 
capacity from 11,000 tonnes to 45,000 
tonnes a year and use fully automated 
systems to achieve increased 
productivity and sustainability.

Force for Good
Working together to 
make a better future
At Whitbread, we are building a long 
term sustainable business. How we  
do things is just as important as what  
we do. People are at the heart of our 
business, whether it be the way we look 
after our colleagues, how we protect 
the environment or how we support the 
communities in which we operate. We 
have a responsibility to act as a Force 
for Good for all our stakeholders, and 
we take this responsibility seriously.
We break our sustainability programme 
into three pillars:
• Team and community;
• Customer wellbeing; and
• Energy and environment.
Each pillar has its own individual goals 
and targets set.
Whitbread is a great place to work,  
and we are committed to ensuring  
that our 50,000 employees have the 
opportunities they need to succeed  
in whatever they do. We have over  
800 apprentices in learning. Our WISE 
programme focuses on getting young 
people into training, whether or not  
they are in education, training or 
employment, and we invest significant 
sums each year in our various schemes.

Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity
During 2016/17, the partnership 
between Premier Inn & Restaurants  
and Great Ormond Street Hospital 
Charity has continued to achieve 
outstanding results. Through building 
on the momentum of the last four years, 
we have raised over £2.8 million for  
the charity in 2016/17. 
Premier Inn & Restaurants had 
committed to raising £7.5 million in  
five years towards a new Premier Inn 
Clinical Building. We were delighted  
in November 2016 to announce that  
the fundraising total had been achieved 
one year earlier than anticipated. The 
fundraising targets set have been 
embraced by our team members, 
customers and suppliers across  
the country. 
Costa Foundation
During the year, the Costa Foundation 
has completed 11 new school projects.  
It has also funded projects to expand  
six established Costa Foundation 
schools in Guatemala and Uganda.  
The total amount raised in 2016/17  
was £1.8 million. 
The Costa Foundation has been  
active since 2007. During the last  
ten years, 72 different school  
projects have been completed in nine 
coffee-producing countries around  
the world and provided over 30,000 
places for children to access a safe  
and quality education.
The Costa Foundation has inspired 
thousands of Costa employees to make 
a difference through their daily work. 
2016 saw the tenth Costa Foundation 
Three Peaks Challenge fundraising 
event. Since 2007 hundreds of the 
wider Costa team have risen to the 
gruelling challenge of climbing the 
highest mountains in Scotland, Wales 
and England in one continuous journey 
to raise money for the Foundation.
We also ran our first collaborative 
partnership with Allegra’s Project 
Waterfall as part of the UK Coffee 
Week. Costa raised over £81,000, which 
was used to support water projects 
delivered by the Costa Foundation  
on behalf of Project Waterfall. This 
included new water harvesting tanks 
supporting the increased growth  
in student enrolment at ten Costa 
Foundation high schools in Uganda. 
Costa community programme
The Costa community programme has 
gone from strength to strength with the 
aim of empowering our team members 
to make an active contribution to  
their local communities. In 2016 over 
12,000 hours were volunteered by team 
members across Costa to good causes 
where they live and work. 
With 28 million customers welcomed 
every month, we must ensure that  
they are buying products and services 
they can trust and that we provide a 
great choice of food and drink, which  
includes healthier options. Animal 
welfare is important to us, which is why 
we recently committed to achieving 
cage free status on all whole shell eggs 
by 2020 and all ingredient eggs by 
2025. We also announced a target in 
Costa to reduce added sugar in drinks 
by 25% by 2020. But we know there  
is more to do.
During the year, our teams have 
continued to passionately support 
charitable and local causes. To date  
we have raised over £8 million for  
Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity 
and over £11 million for the Costa 
Foundation. This includes over 
£250,000 raised from the annual  
Three Peaks Challenge and I was 
delighted to take part in the 2016  
event myself.
Our innovative work to build sustainable 
buildings continues and, as a result,  
we won the prestigious Asda 
Environmental Leadership Award at  
the BITC Responsible Business Awards.  
This year we also participated in the  
Dow Jones Sustainability Index  
for the first time, scoring best in  
class in Governance, Philanthropy  
and Eco-efficiency. We have been 
identified in their Sustainability 
Yearbook as leaders in our sector.

Our reformulation programme to 
reduce salt, sugar and saturated fat 
without compromising the quality  
and taste of our food has progressed 
well during the year and we have made 
significant reductions in the amount 
of sugar in our starters, desserts and 
sauce accompaniments. 
Sugar reduction has also been a key 
priority for Costa and we are committed 
to reducing added sugar across our 
beverage range by 25% by 2020. 
Significant reductions have been made 
in many of our drinks range. These 
include 15% less added sugar in our 
Costa Ice and 41% in a medio Chai Latte. 
Our Costa food range also includes 
products which are less than 250 kcals 
per portion including healthier options 
such as fruit pots and whole and dried 
fruit. In addition, we have been working 
to a target of reducing salt in our 
sandwiches by 5% by the end of 2017.
Responsible sourcing
We have published our first modern 
slavery report this year. The full  
report can be found at www.whitbread.
co.uk/corporate-responsibility and 
provides details of our modern slavery 
risk assessment and due diligence 
strategy, which we are implementing 
across our global supply chain.
With a vast and varied supply chain,  
we understood the first step to tackling 
these issues was to understand where 
our most significant risks lie. Working  
in partnership with leading UK human 
trafficking charity, Stop The Traffik, 
we undertook a heat mapping exercise 
to identify which suppliers and which 
parts of our global supply chain are 
most at risk of modern slavery taking 
place. The process we followed involved 
This year we established a partnership 
with the Police Community Clubs of 
Great Britain to run our first Costa 
Reading Week, whereby hundreds of 
our store teams donated educational 
books on environmental issues to local 
schools. Book club events were hosted 
in store to encourage parents and 
carers to spend one to one time reading 
with their children. 
Costa also supported Keep Britain 
Tidy’s (KBT) ‘Clean for the Queen’ 
Campaign, Britain’s largest ever litter 
pick event, as part of our commitment 
to work towards tackling the issue of 
litter. This was the second year that 
Costa has acted as a principal retail 
sponsor for KBT’s national anti-litter 
campaigns. Over 600 of our stores  
took part in the event.
In recognition of the hard work and 
commitment that our teams have 
delivered to their communities, the 
Costa Community Programme received 
Gold in the “Corporate Engagement 
Awards” and a Highly Commended  
in the “Corporate Comms Awards.” 
We continue to work on enabling our 
teams to make an active contribution  
to their communities across Whitbread.

wellbeing
We have continued to recognise  
the ongoing concern that childhood 
obesity presents to our society. We are 
committed to working in partnership 
with the UK Government and industry 
partners to ensure progress continues 
on this important issue. 
We are actively working to reformulate 
dishes where possible, review our 
portion sizes and provide choice and 
transparency. We have a strategy in 
place to do this, but recognise there  
is more to do. 
With over 600 restaurants and over 
2,200 coffee shops in the UK, we 
believe that our scale enables us  
to make a significant and positive 
contribution in driving change through 
our work on:
• the reformulation of the food and 
drink that we serve;
• introducing credible healthier  
choices; and 
• providing clear, meaningful and  
easily accessible information for  
our customers.
We have already taken action and 
during the year have continued to  
make good progress. 
To date, the majority of dishes on our 
restaurants’ children’s menus provide 
children with one of their five a day 
requirement and we offer more fruit 
options in desserts. A review was 
undertaken of the drinks offered to 
children and this has led to the removal 
of all added sugar drinks. Our children’s 
food and drink offering has been 
positively received by the Soil 
Association in its ‘Out to Lunch’ survey 
where Beefeater and Brewers Fayre 
were recognised for improvements to 
the quality and nutrition of the food 
offered. We continue to work with the 
Soil Association so that we can build  
on this achievement.

at source and chain geographies. We 
are now working through the results to 
develop a response for each supplier 
identified as a higher risk, following the 
Ethical Trading Initiative’s human rights 
due diligence framework.
Product
We have made good progress towards 
ensuring the products that we buy are 
sustainable. In relation to our critical 
commodities:
Coffee – 100% of our coffee is 
Rainforest Alliance certified; 
Fish – All of the fish that we now  
buy directly is sustainably sourced.  
This year, we are very proud to have 
achieved the Chain of Custody Marine 
Stewardship Council (MSC) certification. 
This makes us the largest restaurant 
chain in the UK to serve MSC certified 
fish, demonstrating to our customers 
that the fish they are served has 
been caught in a sustainable and 
responsible way.
Eggs – In September 2016, we 
announced our commitment to go cage 
free on whole shell eggs across Costa 
and Premier Inn & Restaurants by 2020 
and ingredient eggs by 2025. We are 
already taking significant steps in 
meeting that target. 
We also have plans and targets in  
place in relation to cotton, meat, palm 
oil and timber.
Our pillars
3 Energy and 
environment
Targets
This year we are pleased to have 
achieved our 2020 carbon reduction 
target. We will be working to reset our 
environmental targets early in 2017/18, 
continuing our commitment to reduce 
our environmental impact. 
UK electricity generation has become 
more efficient in 2016/17, reducing 
emissions per kWh generated. This 
improvement and our continued 
investment in efficiency has enabled  
us to reduce our emissions beyond  
our 15% 2020 target.
During the year we continued  
our programme of annual capital 
investment to reduce our energy 
consumption. 
We opened a further hub by Premier 
Inn site in 2016/17 as part of our strategy 
for sustainable development in urban 
environments. These developments 
have incorporated the environmental 
initiatives and lessons from the success 
of our first hub by Premier Inn site  
in 2015, which achieved a BREEAM 
Outstanding rating, and we will continue 
this work as we accelerate the roll out  
of the format in 2017/18.
Investing in efficiency and  
renewable energy
We have continued to invest in 
renewable energy generation in our new 
Premier Inns. We now have solar photo 
voltaic generation capacity on over  
90 hotels. In addition as of April 2017,  
all of the electricity we buy for our  
UK operations will be 100% renewable.
On 13 March 2017, Costa opened its  
new £38 million Roastery in Basildon.  
As well as quadrupling Costa’s roasting 
capacity and being one of the largest 
roasteries in Europe, it is also one of  
the world’s most sustainable. On-site 
renewable energy generation reduces 
the building’s carbon footprint, with  
the roof hosting a 249kW solar PV 
system, which will provide power  
for the Roastery. In tandem with  
the rainwater harvesting system,  
this will also generate hot water for  
the building. Already achieving a 
BREEAM Outstanding (to latest 
standards) during its design stage 
assessment, the Roastery was 
shortlisted for the 2017 BREEAM 
Awards and is aiming to receive a 
further ‘Outstanding’ certification  
at the final stage assessment.
Recycling and resource management
We are committed to minimising  
our environmental footprint from bean 
to cup, and in February 2017 Costa 
launched a nationwide recycling 
scheme across over 2,000 stores in 
order to recover and guarantee the 
recycling of its iconic takeaway cups. 
In addition to this, Costa is funding 
research with the University of Sheffield 
to further understand the barriers to 
cup recycling. We are also supporting 
consumer-facing campaigns to raise 
awareness of cup recyclability.
Moving from recycling cups to coffee 
grounds, Costa has also partnered  
with award-winning clean technology 
company bio-bean to recycle coffee 
grounds into low carbon fuel sources. 
Over 800 stores nationwide are now 
recycling an estimated 3,000 tonnes  
of coffee grounds a year.
Awards
During the year, we won the 
Environmental Leadership Award from 
Business in the Community. The award 
recognises the pioneering sustainability 
efforts of both Premier Inn and Costa 
for tackling climate change and saving 
energy through two trail-blazing 
environmental projects – the Costa 
Eco-Pod in Telford and the hub by 
Premier Inn, St. Martin’s Lane hotel. Both 
projects demonstrate that sustainable 
buildings and efficient new space are at 
the core of our environmental strategy.

Revenue
Premier Inn & Restaurants’ revenue rose 
to £1,907.9 million, up 6.6%. Within this, 
Premier Inn achieved total sales growth 
of 9.0% to £1,349.1 million and grew  
its market share through new hotel 
openings and good like for like sales 
growth in the UK. Premier Inn’s new UK 
hotels contributed 6.4% to sales growth, 
and like for like sales grew 2.3%. Like for 
like sales growth was driven by the good 
performance of hotels in catchments 
where we did not add capacity and by 
our strong returning hotel extension 
programme. Our hotel extensions as 
previously indicated, together with new 
hotels diluted our like for like RevPAR  
by c.2.0%, resulting in a decline of 0.6%.  
In 2017/18 we expect new hotels to 
contribute around 5-6% to total sales 
growth and extensions to contribute  
net c.1.0% to like for like sales growth.
Restaurants’ total sales grew by 1.2% 
with like for like sales down 0.3%. Eight 
net new restaurants were opened during 
the year.
Costa’s revenue grew by 10.7% to 
£1,201.7 million. Costa’s UK sales grew to 
£1,054.0 million, up 10.0%, with equity 
like for like sales increasing by 2.0% and 
184 net new coffee shops opened during 
the year. International sales grew to 
£147.7 million, up 16.3% (7.1% in constant 
currency) with 71 net new stores. Costa 
Express delivered a strong performance 
with 1,585 net coffee machines installed 
taking the total to 6,801, of which 740 
are overseas. In 2017/18, we expect  
our Costa initiatives to drive positive  
like for like sales growth, with the 
investments we are making in the first 
half delivering benefits in the second 
half. We do, however, expect the 
consumer environment to be tougher 
than last year.

Profit before tax was £515.4 million, up 
5.7%, and after taxation, statutory profit 
for the year was £415.9 million, up 7.4% 
on last year. 
Premier Inn & Restaurants’ profits grew 
to £468.0 million up 7.4%, with UK 
profits of £471.5 million, up 7.0%. Within 
this, rent costs increased by 15.8% to 
£139.8 million, reflecting the high level  
of leasehold openings across the last 
two years. Our depreciation and 
amortisation charge increased by 19.3% 
to £144.3 million as we continued to 
invest in enhancing our hotels and 
restaurants and upgrading our systems. 
In line with previous guidance, margins 
held steady at 24.5% compared to 
2015/16, benefitting from like for like 
sales growth and our cost efficiency 
programme that offset inflation, and  
our increased investments.
International hotel losses reduced to 
£3.5 million (2015/16: loss of £4.6 million). 
In July last year we announced that 
Premier Inn will focus its international 
strategy on continuing to grow its 
businesses in Germany and the Middle 
East and will commence a phased 
withdrawal from its operations in India 
and South East Asia. The associated 
costs of withdrawal are detailed in the 
non-underlying items section. 
Costa’s profits increased 5.3% to  
£158.0 million, with good growth in our 
UK retail business and continued strong 
growth from Costa Express. Costa’s 
margins were down 0.8% pts year on 
year on a 53 week basis, to 13.1%, due to 
the National Living Wage, investments in 
refurbishments and IT and increased 
investment in brand marketing. This was 
slightly better than previous guidance 
due to investment re-phased into 
2017/18.
Costa International made a profit of  
£3.7 million (2015/16: £2.5 million), with  
a good performance in our international 
franchise business and in Poland. 
Looking forward, our sectors continue  
to face a number of cost headwinds 
from the National Living Wage, business 
rates, commodity price inflation and 
foreign exchange rates. We are incurring 
additional rent from the sale and 
leaseback transactions we successfully 
completed last year and are planning to 
carry out this year. We are also investing 
in line with our strategy of improving  
our customer proposition and building 
digital and IT capabilities and 
infrastructures that will enable the 
delivery of long-term sustainable 
growth. Over time these costs will be 
partially offset as we benefit from: the 
cost efficiency programme announced 
in November 2016, which plans to 
deliver c.£150 million of savings over five 
years; the investments we are making; 
our dynamic pricing model; and through 
the scale benefits of our organic growth. 
In 2017/18 we expect margins in Costa  
to reduce by around 1.2% pts which is  
in line with previous guidance, including 
the re-phasing of investments from 
2016/17. In Premier Inn & Restaurants  
we expect margins to reduce between 
0% to 0.2% pts, again in line with 
previous guidance.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items, including tax 
related adjustments, amounted to  
a charge of £30.2 million (2015/16:  
£42.9 million).
This includes a £30.0 million charge in 
respect of Premier Inn International’s 
withdrawal from India and South East 
Asia, comprising impairment of assets, 
the costs of exiting contracts, and the 
closure of regional offices. Also included 
in non-underlying items are one-off 
restructuring costs of £36.1 million 
relating to reorganisation costs in the  
UK as part of our cost efficiency 
programme and a charge in respect  
of the strategic review and resulting 
restructuring of Costa’s international 
operations in France and China. The 
restructuring in China is on-going and 
there are expected to be further closure 
costs in the next financial year. In 
addition an impairment charge of  
£7.5 million was recognised relating 
principally to underperforming stores. 
These charges are partially offset by:  
a net gain of £19.3 million on the disposal 
of property, plant and equipment and 
property reversions, a significant part  
of which relate to our strategy to carry 
out moderate sale and leaseback 
transactions; a net gain of £11.8 million 
on the disposal of our investment in 
associate (a hotel in Edinburgh); and  
a £5.3 million refund on the settlement 
of a historic VAT claim. 
Non-underlying items also include 
amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets (£2.5 million) and the IAS 19 
pension finance charge (£9.4 million).
Full details are set out in note 6 to the 
financial statements. Our policy on 
underlying performance measures that 
defines what items may be classified as 
non-underlying is set out in note 2.

Group Finance Director’s review continued
Net finance costs
The underlying net finance cost for  
the year was higher than last year at 
£27.2 million (2015/16: £22.5 million)  
due to an increase in average net debt, 
as a result of our continued capital 
investments detailed below. In 2017/18 
we expect underlying interest to 
increase to around £32 million as  
a result of the incremental cost of the 
recent US private placement loan notes.
The effective interest rate on average 
borrowings decreased from 4.7%  
to 3.8%. 
Total net finance costs, including 
non-underlying finance costs, were 
£37.3 million (2015/16: £40.4 million) 
including the IAS19 pension finance 
charge of £9.4 million (2015/16:  
£17.2 million). 
Taxation
Underlying tax for the year amounted  
to £119.1 million at an effective tax rate of 
21.1% (2015/16: 21.3%). The statutory tax 
expense for the year was £99.5 million 
(2015/16: £100.4 million).
Further details are set out in note 9  
to the financial statements. 
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share  
for the year were 246.48 pence, up  
6.0% on last year, and underlying diluted 
earnings per share for the year were 
245.95 pence, up 6.5% on last year.  
Full details are set out in note 10 to  
the financial statements.
Dividend 
The Group’s dividend policy is to  
grow the dividend broadly in line with 
earnings across the cycle.
The recommended final dividend is 
65.90 pence, an increase on last year  
of 6.5%, making the total dividend for 
the year 95.80 pence, a growth of 6.0%. 
With the final dividend, we will offer our 
shareholders the option to participate  
in a dividend reinvestment plan. Further 
details are set out in note 11 to the 
financial statements.
Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from operations was 
strong at £860.1 million, an increase of 
10.0% on last year. 
Cash capital expenditure in total was 
£609.8 million (2015/16: £724.9 million), 
with further details set out below whilst, 
on an accruals basis the Group’s capital 
expenditure was £615.8 million (2015/16: 
£751.8 million). Capital expenditure  
is split between expansionary (which 
includes the acquisition and development 
of properties) and product improvement 
and maintenance.
Premier Inn & Restaurants’ cash capital 
expenditure was £485.5 million (2015/16: 
£622.3 million), with expansionary 
expenditure of £337.6 million (2015/16: 
£455.2 million) as we opened 4,763 
gross new rooms and continued to 
invest in our hotel room pipeline 
including freehold property purchases. 
We maintained our gross UK pipeline  
at c.14,500 rooms, including c.5,900  
in London. Our freehold pipeline is  
now c.34% of the total pipeline 
compared to 52% at the end of 2015/16. 
Expansionary cash expenditure includes 
£69.6 million acquisition of freehold 
properties, which includes £28.3 million 
on expansion in Germany, and £268.0 
million on freehold and leasehold hotel 
and hotel extension construction. 
Non-expansionary product improvement 
and maintenance cash capital 
expenditure in Premier Inn & Restaurants 
was £147.9 million (2015/16: £167.1 
million). This was a decrease on the 
previous year due to the successful 
roll-out of lower cost full room 
refurbishments, reactive maintenance 
efficiencies and savings, as we annualised 
the roll-out of air-conditioning units and 
new beds across the estate last year.
Costa’s cash capital expenditure was 
£124.3 million (2015/16: £102.6 million) 
with the increase from last year 
principally due to the construction of our 
new Roastery and a higher number of 
Costa Express machines. Expansionary 
cash capital was £65.8 million as we 
opened 255 net new coffee shops and 
installed 1,585 net new Costa Express 
machines. Costa’s non-expansionary 
product improvement and maintenance 
expenditure was £58.5 million (2015/16: 
£47.7 million), with the increase driven  
by investment in the new Roastery to 
create more capacity for future growth.

In addition to capital expenditure, our 
future leasehold commitments increased 
by £242.0m to £3,138.7 million with 
Premier Inn & Restaurants at £2,681.3 
million (2015/16: £2,567.6 million) and 
Costa at £430.9 million (2015/16:  
£282.0 million).
Net proceeds of £186.2 million were 
received from the successful sale and 
leaseback of our hub hotel in Kings 
Cross, our hub hotel in Tothill Street, 
Westminster, and our Premier Inn hotel 
in West Smithfield, Farringdon. Proceeds 
from cash disposals of £20.8 million 
include £14.1 million for the disposal  
of our investment in associate.
In 2017/18, we expect our gross cash 
capital expenditure to be between  
£650 million and £700 million and 
around £500-600 million net of the 
proceeds of around £100-150 million 
from sale and leaseback transactions. 
Premier Inn & Restaurants’ spend is 
expected to be c.£500-550 million, with 
around 4,200 room openings. Premier 
Inn & Restaurants’ non-expansionary 
product improvement and maintenance 
investment will be maintained, as we 
continue to improve our customer 
experience and competitive edge and 
continue to improve our digital and 
systems capabilities. Costa cash capital 
expenditure is expected to be a similar 
level to 2016/17 at around £140 million, 
with around 60% being expansionary 
capital, which will include larger stores 
such as Drive Thrus, and the remainder 
comprising refurbishments, systems, 
product improvement and innovation. 
Costa is planning to open a similar level 
of coffee shops and to install c.1,250 
Costa Express machines.
Pension payments totalled £90.3 million, 
in line with the schedule of contributions 
agreed at the last triennial review in 
March 2014. 
Dividend payments amounted to £167.1 
million (2015/16: £155.1 million), with the 
6.0% increase in the full year dividend of 
95.80 pence consistent with the Group’s 
basic underlying earnings per share 
growth of 6.0%.
Corporation tax paid in the year was 
£86.8 million (2015/16: £85.1 million).
Other cash items of £58.7 million 
(2015/16: £34.2 million) include 
payments of £22.3 million principally 
relating to last year’s provision for 
onerous leases on historically disposed 
businesses, £7.1 million for the acquisition 
of our interest in Healthy Retail Ltd, 
(trading as ‘Pure’), and foreign exchange 
movements on net debt.
We maintained our adjusted net debt  
to EBITDAR ratio (see financial status 
and funding) with net debt as at  
2 March 2017 of £890.0 million (2015/16: 
£909.8 million).
Return on capital
Return on capital is a prime focus for 
Whitbread. In the year, the Group’s 
return on capital of 15.2% (2015/16: 
15.3%) continued to deliver a good 
premium to our cost of capital. Costa 
continued to deliver excellent returns  
at 45.4% but were down 4.5% pts  
on last year, after increasing for six 
consecutive years, principally due  
to the higher capital spend on the new 
Roastery. Premier Inn & Restaurants’ 
returns were up 0.1% pt at 13.0% 
(2015/16 year end: 12.9%). Excluding  
the investment in freehold developments 
under construction totalling more than 
£200 million, returns in Premier Inn & 
Restaurants would have been 1.6% pts 
higher at 14.6%.
Pension 
As at 2 March 2017, there was an IAS19 
pension deficit of £425.1 million (2015/16: 
£288.1 million). The main movements 
during the year were the reduction in 
the discount rate from 3.70% to 2.60%, 
driven by the ongoing volatility in 
corporate bond yields, partly offset by 
the payment of the cash contribution  
of £90.3 million.
The recovery plan schedule of Company 
contributions is £80 million per annum 
for 2017 to 2021 and £2.6 million in 2022. 
The payments will be accelerated by up 
to £5 million per year where increases  
in ordinary dividends exceed RPI. The 
Company also makes payments of 
c.£9-10 million per year into the pension 
fund through the Scottish Partnership 
arrangements.
Financial status and funding
Whitbread aims to maintain its financial 
position and capital structure consistent 
with retaining its investment grade debt 
status. To this end, we work within a 
financial framework aimed at keeping 
net debt to EBITDAR (pension and lease 
adjusted) not greater than 3.5 times.  
The net debt to EBITDAR for 2016/17 
was 3.2 times, providing us with 
comfortable headroom.
Our majority freehold hotel estate  
also provides us with significant capital 
flexibility, with the pace of freehold 
acquisition and construction and hotel 
extensions within our control. Freehold 
hotel properties, compared to leasehold, 
also reduce profit volatility and provide 
Whitbread with a flexible source of 
capital funding through sale and 
leaseback transactions.
The Group has sufficient facilities to 
finance our short and medium-term 
requirements with total committed 
facilities of c.£1.9 billion, compared  
to net debt as at 2 March 2017 of  
£890.0 million. Committed debt facilities 
include US Private Placement loans  
of £258 million (at the hedged rate),  
a £450 million bond with a coupon of 
3.375% which matures in October 2025 
and a syndicated bank revolving credit 
facility (“RCF”) of £950 million. During 
the year the maturity of the RCF facility 
was extended to September 2021,  
with the option of a further one year 
extension potentially taking the facility 
to September 2022.
On 1 March 2017, the Group successfully 
secured a further £200 million US 
Private Placement loan notes in pounds 
sterling. These loan notes were issued in 
two series with a ten year maturity fixed 
at c.2.6%. The proceeds will be drawn 
during the year, in May and August.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Understanding and  
responding to risks
Risk management
Risk arises from the operations of,  
and strategic decisions taken by, every 
business. It is not something that can  
be avoided but should be harnessed  
in pursuit of business objectives.
The Board has ultimate responsibility  
for risk management throughout the 
Group and determines the nature and 
extent of the risks Whitbread is willing  
to take to achieve its objectives to 
determine its risk appetite. Risk is 
managed proactively by the Executive 
Committee. Certain responsibilities,  
such as overseeing the systems of risk 
management and internal control, have 
been delegated to the Audit Committee, 
which completes an annual review of the 
effectiveness of these processes.
The structure and governance of the risk 
management process at Whitbread is 
shown on page 59 and, during the year, 
a robust bottom–up assessment of risks 
was completed.
Both the Premier Inn & Restaurants  
and the Costa businesses complete  
an annual review of the risks to the 
achievement of their strategic goals, 
whilst also taking into account the key 
operational risks, which are updated 
regularly. A top–down risk assessment  
is also completed to capture the Board’s 
views on the principal risks facing 
Whitbread, considering risk appetite. 
Actions required to manage these  
risks are monitored and reviewed  
on a regular basis. The principal risks 
identified, together with a summary  
of key mitigations, are summarised  
on pages 60 and 61.
Risks and uncertainties
The Directors have reconsidered the 
principal risks and uncertainties of  
the Group and added two new risks 
reflecting the risks around the  
extensive programme of change we 
have embarked upon and business 
interruption risks for services managed 
by third parties. The risk of a wider 
macro-economic effect as a result of  
the UK leaving the EU, including foreign 
exchange and interest rate fluctuations, 
is addressed by the Group’s existing 
economic climate risk. Going forward, 
we will closely monitor and evaluate any 
potential areas of risk. 
Viability statement
The Corporate Governance Code 
requires that the directors have 
considered the viability of the Group 
over an appropriate period of time 
selected by them, in this case a  
three–year period. In making this 
assessment, the directors took into 
account the current financial and 
operational positions of the Group  
and the potential impact of the risks  
and uncertainties as outlined on pages 
60 and 61.
The business planning process reviewed 
by the Board, as part of the annual 
strategic planning process, is over  
a five–year timeline, with the Board 
acknowledging that there is significantly 
more certainty over the first three years 
of the plan in light of fluctuations in  
the global economy, the entry of new 
competitors and customer preferences. 
Therefore the directors have determined 
a three–year period is an appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability 
statement. In making the viability 
statement, the Board carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten  
the business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. Scenario 
modelling and sensitivity analysis was 
applied to forecasted cash flows to 
model the potential effects should  
the principal risks actually occur  
and consideration was given to the 
availability and likely effectiveness of 
mitigating actions that could be taken  
to avoid or reduce the impact or 
occurrence of the identified risk.
In particular, it should be noted that the 
Group is currently spending a substantial 
part of its cash from operations on 
discretionary growth capital (c.30%  
on average) which allows the Group 
considerable flexibility to manage cash 
flows and would provide significant 
mitigation if required.
Based upon this assessment, the 
directors confirm that they have 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation  
and to meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three–year assessment period.
Understanding and responding to risks  
in our operations means we can make 
informed decisions that enhance our  
capacity to build value. Strategic report Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 59

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Principal Risks
Risks Key mitigations Change
Cyber and data security
Cyber and data security remains  
a key risk as it could reduce the 
effectiveness of our systems or 
result in a loss of data. This in  
turn could result in loss of income 
and/or reputational damage.
We have a series of IT security controls in place, including up-to-date 
antivirus software across the estate, network/system monitoring and 
regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities. A continuous 
security improvement programme is in place improving security and 
data controls. Specifically, during the year we have strengthened our 
perimeter protection with improved firewall and denial of service 
protection and have moved significant systems to new, more secure, 
data centres. 
IT Infrastructure
IT infrastructure is unable to 
adequately support our business 
growth objectives. Although 
improvements have been made  
in our infrastructure. 
A strong IT leadership team is in place together, with Group governance 
structures, to help prioritise, coordinate and deliver our business plans 
and the IT investment in an efficient way so as to minimise disruption.  
We are also significantly increasing our investment in the upgrade of our 
systems infrastructure, increasing the capacity, resilience and stability  
of our core systems and our digital proposition.
Innovation and brand strength
A long–term decline in the 
customer perception of our 
brands would impact our ability  
to grow and achieve appropriate 
levels of return.
To ensure we maintain and improve the strength of our brands, we 
continually complete market research and monitor opinion with focus 
groups and net guest scores to ensure we maintain the right levels of 
investment and innovation in our customer offerings. We are also 
increasing the rate and level of investment in the refurbishments of our 
Premier Inn and Costa stores to help improve our net promoter scores.
Change
Our ability to execute the 
unprecedented volume of  
change is recognised as  
a new risk this year.
We have embarked on an extensive programme of change to replace  
our legacy systems and infrastructure, upgrade our digital capability  
and improve our customer propositions, enabling Whitbread to deliver  
its growth plans over the coming years. To help ensure the successful 
delivery of these change projects, we have significantly enhanced our 
internal project delivery expertise and capability and put in place a robust 
assurance management framework coupled with regular reporting to  
the Executive Committee for all major projects.
New
Economic Climate
Uncertain/volatile economic 
climate results in GDP decline fall 
in RevPAR and inflation impacting 
growth plans.
There is a rigorous business planning process in place which considers 
many scenarios with responses to these. We also have strong site 
selection teams with well-established processes in place based on market 
and economic fundamentals, both at a macro and micro level. These  
are supported by sensitivity analysis and a robust investment appraisal 
process to help deliver good levels of return. We have also embarked on 
an efficiency programme that aims to deliver £150 million of savings over 
five years. 
Engagement and retention
Failure to maintain staff 
engagement and retention in  
a tightening labour market.
The success of our businesses would not be possible without the passion 
and commitment of our teams. Team engagement is fundamental. We 
monitor this closely through our annual engagement survey ‘Your Say’, 
the results of which are reviewed by the Executive Committee and the 
Board, with trends analysed and appropriate actions reviewed and 
agreed. Team turnover is also a key component of our WINcard and 
Annual Incentive Scheme.
Strategic report Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 61
Risks Key mitigations Change
Pandemic/terrorism
The risk of a pandemic or 
terrorism on the safety and 
security of our customers, staff 
and the consequent impact 
on trading.
The safety and security of our customers, employees and suppliers is  
of utmost importance. Failure to prevent or respond to a major safety  
or security incident could adversely impact our operations and financial 
performance. We invest site level training to help identify hostile 
reconnaissance activities and to ensure we have an appropriate response 
should such events take place. The executive team also hold regular crisis 
management exercises to ensure we are prepared for such events.
Talent and succession
Insufficient leadership capability 
and succession in place to deliver 
growth ambitions.
Talent and succession planning takes place regularly to ensure top talent 
is identified and succession plans exist for key roles. Talent gaps are 
addressed through recruitment, training and development to grow our 
management capability. The Group offers key employees appropriate 
levels of reward and recognition in order to retain them.
Food safety and hygiene
The preparation or storage  
of food and/or supply chain 
failure results in food poisoning 
and reputational damage.
The health and wellbeing of our customers is fundamental to our 
business. We have stringent food safety and sourcing policies with 
traceability and testing requirements in place in respect of meat and 
other products. Independent food safety audits are also completed 
regularly at our hotels, restaurants and coffee shops and the results are 
closely monitored. We also invest considerable resources in employee 
training in the storage, handling and preparation of food. 
Health and safety
Health and safety risk, death  
or serious injury as a result of 
Company negligence.
The safety of our guests and employees is of paramount importance. 
NSF, an independent company, carries out health and safety audits on 
every site and we have a programme of fire safety training for our 
employees. Health and safety is a measure on the WINcard and acts

are provided to the Executive Committee and the Board.
Third party arrangements
Business interruption as a result  
of the withdrawal of services/
support or reputational damage 
as result of supplier practices is 
recognised as a new risk this year. 
Whitbread has a number of key supplier relationships that help ensure 
the efficient delivery of our multi-site and support centre operations. The 
failure or withdrawal of services from one or more of these suppliers may 
result in some business interruption. To ensure against this, we continually 
review our suppliers and business continuity arrangements. We expect 
our suppliers’ practices to be in line with our values and standards. 
Suppliers are thoroughly vetted before we enter into any arrangements  
to ensure they are reputable and then monitored though our supplier 
management arrangements.

Counsel on 24 April 2017.

Governance
Corporate governance
I am pleased to present the Board’s annual report 
on corporate governance, which confirms that the 
Company has fully complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout the year. 
The Board is committed  
to ensuring that corporate 
governance is an integral part  
of our organisation. It is key  
to how we interact with our  
investors, employees, suppliers  
and other stakeholders. 
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board has reviewed the Company’s 
performance against the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) and has 
concluded that the Company complied 
with the Code throughout the 2016/17 
financial year. A copy of the Code is 
available from www.frc.org.uk. As part 
of our annual corporate governance 
review, the Board also considered the 
new provisions contained within the 
2016 Corporate Governance Code, 
which applies to the Company with 
effect from the 2017/18 financial year. 
I am pleased to confirm that we already 
comply with these new provisions. 
Board membership
The Board welcomed David Atkins and 
Deanna Oppenheimer as independent 
non-executive directors during the year. 
Since the end of the financial year, we 
have also welcomed Adam Crozier as  
an independent non-executive director. 
Each of these individuals brings skills 
and experience to aid the Board’s 
discussions. Further details of the 
appointment of the new non-executive 
directors is provided in the Nomination 
Committee report on pages 75 to 77.
As announced during the year, Wendy 
Becker retired from her position as a 
non-executive director of the Board in 
December 2016 following her nine year 
tenure. I would like to thank Wendy for 
her contribution and commitment to the 
Board and we wish her well for the 
future. Also, as previously announced 
Stephen Williams will retire from the 
Board following the conclusion of the 
Company’s 2017 AGM. We are grateful 
to Stephen for remaining on the Board 
to ensure an orderly transition of the 
leadership of the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Shareholder engagement 
The 2016/17 financial year has been  
one of significant engagement with  
our shareholders. We held a Capital 
Market Day in November 2016,  
which was attended by our major 
shareholders, at which executives 
presented details of our strategy.  
We have twice consulted investors  
in connection with the Company’s 
remuneration policy and further details 
of these consultations are provided in 
the remuneration report on pages 78  
to 98. I would like to thank all those 
investors that have taken the time to 
engage with us, whether by responding 
to the consultations, attending the 
Capital Market Day or meeting with 
Company representatives throughout 
the year. Your input is much appreciated.
I also very much enjoyed meeting a 
number of our shareholders at our AGM 
last year and I look forward to doing so 
again at this year’s AGM on Wednesday 
21 June 2017.

Board responsibilities
The Board is responsible for the  
long–term success of the Company and 
ensures that there are effective controls 
in place which enable risk to be assessed 
and managed. All Board members have 
responsibility for strategy, performance, 
risk and people. 
The Chairman and Chief Executive have 
clearly defined roles which are separate 
and distinct. The specific duties and 
division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive have 
been agreed by the Board and are set  
out below, together with information  
on the roles of the Senior Independent 
Director, the executive directors and  
the non-executive directors.
Chairman
• Leadership of the Board and setting 
its agenda including approval of the 
Group’s strategy, business plans, 
annual budget and key areas of 
business importance.
• Maintaining appropriate contact with 
major shareholders and ensuring  
that Board members understand their 
views concerning the Company.
• Ensuring a culture of openness and 
debate around the Board table.
• Leading the annual evaluation of the 
Board, the committees and individual 
directors.
• Ensuring, through the General 
Counsel, that the members of the 
Board receive accurate, timely and 
clear information.
Chief Executive
• Optimising the performance of  
the Company.
• Day–to–day operation of the business.
• Ensuring effective communication  
with shareholders and employees.
• The creation of shareholder value  
by delivering profitable growth and  
a good return on capital.
• Ensuring the Company has a strong 
team of high–calibre executives, and 
putting in place appropriate 
management succession and 
development plans.
• Leading and motivating a large 
workforce of people.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director provides 
a sounding board for the Chairman and 
supports him in the delivery of his 
objectives. The Senior Independent 
Director is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns which the normal 
channels have failed to resolve or which 
would be inappropriate to raise with the 
Chairman or the executive team. He also 
leads the annual evaluation of the 
Chairman on behalf of the other directors.
The Senior Independent Director can  
be contacted directly or through the  
General Counsel.
Executive directors
The executive directors are responsible for 
the day–to–day running of the business 
and for implementing the operational 
and strategic plans of the Company.
Non-executive directors
The non–executive directors play a  
key role in constructively challenging 
and scrutinising the performance of  
the management of the Company  
and helping to develop proposals  
on strategy.

the financial limits set by the Board.
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
•  formulation of strategy for 
recommendation to the Board;

accordance with strategy and 
budgets;
• talent and succession;
• risk management;
• capital investment decisions (where

Board activities during  
the year
In advance of each Board meeting,  
a set of Board papers, including monthly 
financial and trading report, is circulated 
so that directors have sufficient time to 
review them and arrive at the meeting 
fully prepared.
The Board has a rolling forward agenda  
which sets matters to be considered 
throughout the year ahead. Two 
strategy days are held each year. In 
2016/17, one considered the long–term 
strategy and the other considered  
the five-year strategy. Following  
these sessions, the Board agreed the 
significant topics to be discussed at its 
meetings during the year. The rolling 
agenda is then updated to ensure that 
there is a structured approach to the 
consideration of topics and that 
recurring issues are evenly spread  
across the calendar. The Board gives its 
attention to each area of the business in 
turn so that a strong understanding of 
the entire Company is maintained. The 
rolling agenda is regularly reviewed and 
updated and is circulated as part of  
the General Counsel’s report before 
each meeting.
The agenda for each Board meeting is 
agreed with the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive on a monthly basis so that 
current events and potential future 
issues can be discussed alongside the 
regular reports. Standard items for each 
meeting are a review of progress on 
action points, reports from the Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director, 
the Managing Directors of Premier Inn 
& Restaurants and Costa together with 
General Counsel’s report. The General 
Counsel keeps minutes of the meetings 
and produces a list of agreed actions 
for each meeting.
At the meetings during the year, the 
Board discharged its responsibilities and 
considered a range of matters as shown 
in the table at the bottom of this page.
Board processes and topics to be 
discussed are continually reviewed to 
ensure that the correct focus is given  
to the key issues highlighted at the 
strategy days.
The Chairman meets with the  
non–executive directors without  
the executives present after  
Board meetings.
There is a schedule of matters  
reserved exclusively to the Board;  
all other decisions are delegated to 
management. Those matters reserved 
exclusively to the Board include:
• approval of Group financial statements 
and the preliminary announcement  
of half and full–year results; 
• changes relating to the Group’s capital 
structure; the annual budget and the 
Group’s business plan; 
• approving capital projects, 
acquisitions and disposals valued at 
over the limit set out in the matters 
reserved to the Board; 
• approval of interim dividends and 
recommendation of final dividends; and
• establishment of Board committees. 
The schedule of matters reserved  
was reviewed at the February 2017 
Board meeting and again in April 2017, 
and is available on our website  
(www.whitbread.co.uk).

Board meetings and attendance
The Board generally holds meetings at 
monthly intervals during the year and on 
an ad hoc basis as and when required. 
Ten meetings were held during the year 
and attendance at meetings by the 
directors is set out below.
Members of the executive team 
attended Board and committee 
meetings as appropriate. 
Insurance cover
The Company has appropriate  
directors’ and officers’ liability  
insurance in place. In addition to this,  
the Company provides an indemnity  
for directors against the costs of 
defending certain legal proceedings  
and generating claims over and above 
those covered by insurance. These  
are reviewed periodically.
Board and Committee
It is believed that the Board and its 
committees have the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, diversity, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company to enable them to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively. The 
Board has a majority of independent 
non–executive directors. After assessing 
independence against the Code, the 
Board considers all non–executive 
directors to be independent in 
judgement and character, and also 
considered the Chairman to be 
independent on appointment. 
During the year, there has been  
a number of changes to the Board. 
David Atkins and Deanna Oppenheimer 
were appointed as non-executive 
directors of the Company on 1 January 
2017, with Adam Crozier being 
appointed as a non-executive director 
since the year-end, on 1 April 2017. 
Following the completion of her nine 
year term as a non-executive director, 
Wendy Becker resigned from the  
Board on 31 December 2016. Finally, as 
previously announced, Stephen Williams 
will step down from the Board following 
the completion of the 2017 AGM on  
21 June 2017. 
Details of the appointment procedures 
can be found in the report of the 
Nomination Committee on pages 75

Board Performance evaluation
An evaluation of the Board, its 
committees, individual directors and 
the Chairman is carried out each year.
An externally facilitated Board 
evaluation was carried out in 2015/16. 
The next externally facilitated  
Board evaluation will be conducted 
during the financial year ending  
28 February 2019.
The 2015/16 evaluation identified 
opportunities for improvement in the 
following areas:
• further clarity on the international 
strategies of both Premier Inn and 
Costa;
• more structured and regular focus on 
risk management and risk appetite; 
and
• greater discussion on certain aspects 
of talent management and succession 
planning, at middle management level 
as well as at Board level.
The issues identified in 2015/16 in 
relation to strategy did not re-emerge, 
suggesting that the actions taken to 
address those points were effective.

Commitment
During the year all directors including 
the non-executive directors, committed 
significant time to the Company in 
accordance with the requirements 
specified in their service contracts and 
letters of appointment. On behalf of the 
Board, the Nomination Committee has 
reviewed the extent of other interests of 
the non-executive directors. The Board 
is satisfied the Chairman and each of  
the non-executive directors commit 
sufficient time to their duties and fulfil 
their obligations to the Company. During 
the year, particular consideration was 
given by the Board to the appointment 
of Sir Ian Cheshire to the Board of 
Barclays Bank PLC and it was agreed 
that Sir Ian continued to commit 
significant and appropriate time to his 
role as the Senior Independent director 
of the Company. 
No executive director has taken on more 
than one non–executive directorship  
in a FTSE 100 company. 
Induction process
On appointment, all directors receive a 
full and formal induction that is tailored 
to their specific needs. David Atkins and 
Deanna Oppenheimer joined the Board 
on 1 January 2017 as non-executive 
directors. As part of their induction each 
non- executive director met with the 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director 
and the members of the Executive 
Committee. We ensure that each  
new member of the Board has the 
opportunity to visit Premier Inn & 
Restaurant together with Costa sites. 
Training and development
Directors attend external training events 
to update their skills and knowledge. 
Training was undertaken by Board 
members during the year on a range  
of issues including:
• anti-bribery;
• data protection;
• cyber security; and
• travel security.
Investor relations and market updates 
were also presented to the Board 
together with regular updates from  
each of the brands are made to the 
Board. In addition, Slaughter and May, 
provided directors with training on the 
new Market Abuse Regulation. ‘Deep 
dive’ sessions were also held on certain  
issues, such as Costa China. Some Board 
meetings were held at Premier Inn hotels 
and restaurants in order to give the 
Board the opportunity to gain a deeper 
understanding of the business.
All directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. Directors serving on the Board 
and committees confirmed that they 
were satisfied that they received 
sufficient resources to enable them to 
undertake their duties effectively. Each 
director has access to the General 
Counsel for advice on governance.
The General Counsel prepares a  
monthly report that includes updates on 
secretariat and legal matters, along with 
governance, compliance and insurance. 
This report is presented and discussed 
at each Board meeting.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are required to disclose any 
conflicts of interest immediately as and 
when they arise throughout the year. In 
addition, a formal process is undertaken 
in January each year when all directors 
confirm to the Board details of their 
external interests including any other 
directorships which they hold.
These are assessed by the Board  
to determine whether the director’s 
ability to act in the best interests of  
the Company could be compromised.  
If there are no such potential or  
actual conflicts, the external interests  
are authorised by the Board. All 
authorisations are for a period of 12 
months. No director is counted as  
part of a quorum in respect of the 
authorisation of his or her own conflict.
It is recognised that all organisations are 
potential customers of Whitbread and, 
in view of this, the Board has authorised 
all directors’ current external directorships.
2016/17 Internal Evaluation
In 2016/17, the Board conducted the 
annual evaluation of its performance, 
and that of its three main committees, 
by using an online evaluation tool.  
Each director completed a questionnaire 
and the General Counsel collated  
and presented the responses of the 
evaluation for consideration by  
the Board.
The outcome of the evaluation was  
such that the directors considered that 
the Board is operating effectively  
and has been able to develop clear 
objectives of its future strategy. 
Identified areas
Although no significant concerns  
were raised, some opportunities  
for improvement were identified.  
These included:
• to provide opportunities for the 
non-executive directors to spend 
more time in the business, outside  
of the formal Board meeting cycle;
• to increase the level of Board 
awareness of customer perceptions 
and developments in the markets  
in which we operate, whilst ensuring  
that the Company’s performance  
is adequately monitored against its 
peers; and
• to further increase focus on key risks 
and mitigation plans. 
Whilst progress has been made  
on risk management, the latest 
evaluation shows that further action  
is required to address this point. 
Individual directors
The Chairman has one–to–one  
meetings with all directors to discuss 
their performance and to identify 
whether they continue to contribute 
effectively to the Board and 
demonstrate commitment to the role.
Chairman
The Senior Independent Director  
meets with the non–executive 
directors, without the Chairman 
present, to discuss the performance 
of the Chairman. The Senior 
Independent Director also speaks 
with the executive directors to gain 
their views before discussing the 
results with the Chairman.

Shareholder relations
In accordance with the Code, the Board 
recognises that it has responsibility for 
ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue 
with shareholders takes place and any 
major shareholders’ issues and concerns 
are communicated to the Board through 
the Chairman.
In addition to the regular contact  
with shareholders, during the year, we 
undertook two shareholder consultations 
in respect of the proposed new 
remuneration policy and proposed 
changes to LTIP targets. The opportunity 
to discuss the new policy with a number 
of our shareholders was appreciated 
and the feedback provided was 
constructive and helpful. Further details 
of the new remuneration policy can be 
found in the remuneration report on 
pages 78 to 98.
The Company communicates with both 
the institutional and private shareholders 
through the following means:
Interaction with all shareholders
• The Company’s website  
(www.whitbread.co.uk), where 
information and news is regularly 
updated.
• The Annual Report, which sets out 
details of the Company’s strategy, 
business model and performance over 
the past financial year and plans for 
future growth.
• The AGM, where all shareholders can 
vote on the resolutions proposed and 
to put questions to the Board and 
executive team.
• Presentations of full–year and interim 
results to analysts and shareholders, 
that are also available on the

The Annual General Meeting
The AGM provides all shareholders with 
the opportunity to communicate directly 
with the Board which encourages their 
participation at the meeting. 
In accordance with the Code, the Notice 
of AGM and related papers are sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. The Company 
proposes a separate resolution on each 
substantially separate issue including  
a specific resolution to approve the 
Report and Accounts. For each 
resolution, proxy appointment forms 
provide shareholders with the option to 
vote in advance of the AGM if they are 
unable to attend in person. All valid 
proxy votes received for the AGM are 
properly recorded and counted by 
Whitbread’s registrars.
As in previous years, all voting by 
shareholders at this year’s AGM will be 
by poll using electronic handsets. The 
voting results, including proxy votes 
received, will be displayed on a screen at 
the end of the meeting. In addition, the 
audited poll results will be disclosed on 
the Company’s website following the 
meeting, and announced through the

Accountability and internal control
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management, and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
They can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s principal risks.  
This process was in place throughout the 2016/17 financial year and up to the date of this report. The process is reviewed 
by the Board and accords with the internal control guidance for directors in the Code. A report of the principal risks, 
together with the viability statement, can be found on pages 58 to 61.

responsibilities to the Committee in 
accordance with the Code. The key 
responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
are to: 
• monitor and review the integrity of the 
Group’s financial results and the

relation to the external auditor.
Further details on the Committee’s 
responsibilities are in the Committee’s 
terms of reference on the Group’s 
website: www.whitbread.co.uk.
Main activities during the year
In 2016/17, the Audit Committee’s  
work included internal controls, risk 
management, internal audit, external 
audit and financial reporting.  
The specific details of the matters 
discussed included:
• the quality and integrity of accounting 
policies and practices;
• the clarity of the disclosures and 
compliance with financial reporting 
standards and relevant financial and 
governance reporting requirements;
• material areas in which significant 
judgements have been applied or 
where there has been discussion with 
the external auditor;
• whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the  
Group’s performance, business  
model and strategy;
• the regulatory announcements  
of the results;
• a going concern assessment; 
• a long-term view of the Group’s going 
concern basis;
• a review of the ‘Speaking Out’ reports 
submitted in accordance with the 
Group’s whistleblowing policy;
• a review of the Committee’s 
effectiveness and terms of reference; 
and
• a review of the Group Finance systems 
upgrade programme.
To aid its review, the Committee 
considers reports from the Group 
Finance Director, the Group Tax Director, 
the Director of Internal Audit, the 
General Counsel and also reports from 
Deloitte LLP as the external auditor on 
the outcomes of their half-year review 
and annual audit. The Committee looks 
for constructive challenge from Deloitte 
as external auditor.
The key areas of judgement and 
estimation considered by the 
Committee, in relation to the 2016/17 
accounts were:
Defined benefit pension
The Committee reviewed, considered 
and exercised judgement on the 
assumptions used to calculate the 
pension scheme assets and liabilities 
under IAS 19, to satisfy itself that 
appropriate consideration and balance 
had been given to all macroeconomic 
factors. The principal assumptions used 
and the sensitivities around them were 
considered and the consistency in 
approach from 2015/16 to 2016/17 was 
assessed, concluding with the same 
estimates as reached by management.
Impairment
A full asset impairment review is 
undertaken every year and the 
Committee is provided with information 
on how the impairment values have 
been derived. Areas of judgement 
around the calculation of the discount 
rate used, the growth rates applied,  
the sensitivities of the judgements and  
the impairments booked are discussed 
and challenged. The impairment values 
presented by management were noted 
and agreed by the Committee.
Non-underlying items 
Consideration was given to the 
appropriateness of disclosure for  
all of the items classified as  
non-underlying. This included the  
nature of the items and whether they 
met the criteria as defined by the 
accounting policy. In addition, the 
Committee was provided with details 
around the restructuring provisions 
created within non-underlying and in 
particular around the exit of the hotel 
operations in South East Asia. Regular 
updates have been provided in relation 
to the progress of the exit and the level 
of provisioning has been challenged 
accordingly to ensure that it is sufficient 
to meet the potential obligations. 
Taxation
The method of calculating the  
Group’s tax expense and liability  
and the provisioning for potential  
tax liabilities were considered. 
Assumptions are made around  
the assets which qualify for capital 
allowances (determined ultimately via 
the aid of a third–party expert), the level 
of disallowable expenses, provisions for 
uncertain exposures or recoveries, the 
extent of rolled over gains, indexation 
thereon and the tax base into which  
they have been rolled. All have an 
impact on both deferred and current 
tax. These were reviewed and challenged 
with the judgements being noted and 
agreed. The Committee also reviewed 
the judgements exercised on tax 
provisioning as part of its annual  
review of key provisions.

Governance
Fair, balanced and understandable
In order to confirm to the Board  
that the Annual Report and Accounts,  
taken as a whole is fair, balanced  
and understandable, there has been  
a thorough verification and approval 
process using the Committee’s 
knowledge of the Group, as  
outlined below:
• the Annual Report is drafted by the 
appropriate senior management with 
overall coordination by the Secretariat 
team to ensure consistency;
• comprehensive reviews of the drafts 
of the Report and Accounts are 
undertaken by management, the 
Executive Committee and me, as the 
Audit Committee Chairman;
• a final draft is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee prior to consideration  
by a committee of the Board; and
• formal approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts is given by a committee 
of the Board.
Based upon this review, the Committee 
determined that the Annual Report is 
fair, balanced and understandable.
Internal control and risk management
The Audit Committee monitors the 
systems of risk management and 
internal control. In addition, the 
Committee completes an annual review 
of the effectiveness of these systems in 
March, assessing the risk management 
framework and policy, management’s 
risk assessment and review process,  
and the monitoring and reporting of risk. 
This review is completed in conjunction 
with an internal control effectiveness 
review from Internal Audit and Group 
Finance, and considers all material 
controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The system 
and processes were considered to be 
robust and no significant weaknesses 
were noted. A robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company was 
carried out, considering risk appetite, 
and each risk was assessed and the level 
of assurance required was determined. 
Further details of the principal risks 
identified and agreed by the Company 
can be found on pages 60 and 61.
‘Speaking Out’ facility
In accordance with the Code, the 
Committee has continued to review  
the Company’s whistleblowing function, 
known as ‘Speaking Out’. The system  
is operated by two external third-party 
providers, Hospitality Action in the UK 
and Navex Global internationally, and 
allows employees to report anonymously 
and in confidence. During the year the 
Committee reviewed the re-launch of 
the policy, processes and reporting 
structure for ‘Speaking Out’, and agreed 
that appropriate arrangements are in 
place for proportionate and independent 
investigations. The Committee receives 
regular reports from the General Counsel 
on the operation of this function. 
Internal audit
The Audit Committee monitors  
and reviews the scope, extent and 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function. Regular presentations 
and updates were given to the 
Committee by the Director of Internal 
Audit and private discussions were held 
with the Director of Internal Audit as  
and when necessary.
External auditor
On behalf of the Board, the Committee 
overseas the relationship with the 
external auditor. Deloitte was reappointed 
as auditor of the Company at the  
2016 AGM following a tender process 
undertaken in 2015. The effectiveness  
of the external audit process is 
dependent on appropriate audit risk 
identification at the start of the audit 
cycle. We received from Deloitte a 
detailed audit plan, identifying their 
assessment of these key risks. 
These risks were reviewed and they, 
together with the work done by the 
auditor, were challenged to test 
management’s assumptions and 
estimates around these areas, as well  
as other areas reported upon. The 
effectiveness of the audit process was 
assessed in addressing these matters 
through the reporting we received  
from Deloitte at both the half–year  
and year–end. In addition, feedback  
was sought from management on the 
effectiveness of the audit process and 
targeted and tailored questionnaires 
were completed. The points raised  
were taken into account in this year’s  
year-end process. As part of our  
review process, the Committee will be 
assessing the work of the year-end audit 
once finalised and formal discussions  
of the effectiveness review will take 
place at the Audit Committee meeting  
in July 2017. 
Audit tender
Deloitte was appointed as the Group’s 
auditor in 2015. The Committee confirms 
compliance with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive  
Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, as published 
by the UK Competition and Markets 
Authority. The Group intends to put  
the external audit out to tender every  
10 years in the future.
Auditor independence
To safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor, 
the Committee’s terms of reference  
set out the non–audit services that  
are permitted in certain circumstances 
and those not permitted at all. This 
prevents the auditor being able to 
provide certain services such as internal 
audits. For certain specified audit and 
audit–related services, the Group can 
employ the external auditor without 
reference to the Audit Committee, 
subject to a specified fee limit. For  
the services permitted in certain 
circumstances, agreement must  
be sought from me, as Chairman of  
the Committee where fees are less  
than the limit specified, or with full  
Audit Committee approval where  
fees are anticipated to be greater.  
A tender process would be held  
where appropriate.
Deloitte are engaged to provide 
independent assurance over the 
systems transformation programme 
governance and deep dive reviews in  
to the high risk stages of the project, as 
permitted by the policy on non-audit 
services. This was approved by the 
Audit Committee. Independence is 
maintained as they are not designing  
the system or its controls but reviewing 
and reporting to assist the wider 
programme governance required  
for a successful go-live.
Following a review of the services 
provided by our external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP, and taking into 
consideration the ratio of non-audit  
to audit fees of 0.25, we can confirm 
that it continues to be independent.

The Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that Board and committee 
membership is progressively refreshed 
and that there is no undue reliance on 
any one individual. This is reviewed at 
the annual meeting in February.
Board appointments and diversity 
Appointments to the Board are based 
on merit against objective criteria.
Diversity and equality have always  
been core values at Whitbread. The 
Board believes that diversity is of  
utmost importance, ensuring the 
effectiveness of the Board and the 
Company and its continued success. 
Whitbread appoints members of the 
Board on the basis of performance  
and the ability to continually contribute 
to the Board, on the grounds of the 
knowledge, skills and experience 
required. We are committed to an  
active policy of equal opportunities  
and embraced diversity at all levels.
The appointment of new directors
The Committee annually evaluates  
the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on  
the Board, preparing a description  
of the role and capabilities required  
for a particular appointment and 
consider a matrix of skills and 
competencies of the Board.

We use external search consultants  
to engage and identify a number of 
candidates, ensuring equal representation, 
aligned with the role and capabilities 
required for the appointment. Selected 
candidates meet with the Committee  
and further interviews take place before 
an appointment is made.
Board changes during the year
Following a review of the composition  
of the Board, it was determined that the 
Committee should appoint three new 
non-executive directors. Zygos was 
appointed by the Board as the adviser  
to the Committee in the search for 
external candidates. Zygos has no  
other connections to the Company.
When appointing new directors, the 
Committee reviewed a matrix of Board 
skills and considered which skills  
were required, taking into account the 
strategic development of the Company.
Following this, a detailed specification 
was prepared for each non-executive 
role and a preliminary list of candidates 
was prepared for consideration.
Following the interview and assessment 
process, Deanna Oppenheimer and 
David Atkins were appointed as  
non–executive directors, joining the 
Board on 1 January 2017. Deanna has  
a strong background in mass consumer 
retail and her experience of having 
worked with a broad range of leading 
edge digital businesses will add 
significant value to the Whitbread 
Board. Deanna also replaced Stephen 
Williams as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee from 1 March 2017. 
As the CEO of a major UK business with 
interests across a number of European 
markets, David also has significant 
experience in the European retail 
property sector that will provide the 
Whitbread Board with invaluable 
insights as we continue to expand  
both in the UK and overseas. 
The Committee followed the same 
process for the appointment of Adam 
Crozier as a non-executive director,  
joining the Board on 1 April 2017. Adam 
has a strong background in business 
transformations, brands, communication 
and marketing. His expertise will be of 
great value to the Board as we continue to 
expand the Premier Inn and Costa brands. 
Our approach to the annual  
re–election of directors
As required by the Code, all directors 
will be subject to re–election at the  
next AGM. As part of my individual 
performance review of each  
non-executive director, I reviewed their 
contribution and time commitment  
to the Company. All directors are 
proposed for reappointment at this 
year’s AGM. Details setting out why  
each director is deemed to be suitable 
for reappointment will be included  
with the AGM papers circulated to  
all shareholders.
As mentioned, Stephen Williams will  
be stepping down from the Board in 
June 2017 after serving nine years as  
a non-executive director.

Remuneration report
I am delighted to have joined the Whitbread 
Board at the beginning of 2017, and to have 
succeeded Stephen Williams as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee on 1 March 2017. 
2016/17 was a busy year for the Committee. 
Deanna Oppenheimer
Chair, Remuneration Committee
Our philosophy
The updated remuneration policy 
reflects our philosophy that executives 
should be paid fairly, that they should  
be incentivised to achieve outstanding 
results, rewarded for doing so and that 
targets should be stretching enough so 
as to avoid large payouts for mediocre 
performance. The Committee is very 
aware of the significant attention on 
executive remuneration and of our 
responsibilities to all Whitbread’s 
stakeholders. We are also aware of the 
need for Whitbread to be competitive  
in the employment market, so that  
the Company is able to attract and 
retain high-calibre executives with 
appropriate experience.
I believe that we have the right balance 
and this is demonstrated by the fact  
that rewards under the Annual Incentive 
Scheme this year are slightly less than 
50% of maximum, when Whitbread  
has once again achieved a good 
performance, with underlying profit 
before tax increasing by 6.2% to  
£565.2 million.
Shareholder engagement
The Committee has consulted with 
Whitbread’s major investors, along with 
Glass Lewis, ISS and the Investment 
Association, twice this year. The first 
consultation was in relation to the 
revised structure of the Company’s 
remuneration policy and the second  
was in connection with changes to the 
LTIP performance conditions. These 
consultations have been very helpful  
to us as we have formulated both policy 
and targets for the future and I would 
like to thank all those who responded  
to the consultations for their time  
and input. Following feedback, as 
mentioned above, we have decided to 
improve the disclosure in relation to the 
targets, particularly in relation to the 
Annual Incentive Plan. We have also 
taken the opportunity to extend the 
circumstances in which clawback and 
Introduction
The remuneration policy, which was 
approved by shareholders in 2014, is 
reaching the end of its three-year life. 
Coupled with Alison Brittain announcing 
the three strategic priorities for the 
Group this time last year, the time was 
right for a detailed review of Whitbread’s 
remuneration policy.
I would like to thank Stephen for his 
work chairing the Committee over the 
last three years and for the support he 
has provided to me as I take on the role. 
Stephen has kindly agreed to remain  
on the Board and the Remuneration 
Committee until the AGM and both  
he and I will be available to answer 
shareholders’ questions on remuneration 
at the meeting. This will provide us with 
a six-month period during which we will 
both be members of the Committee.
I fully support the outcome of the policy 
review and, while much of the work on 
the new policy took place before I joined 
Whitbread, I attended the Committee 
meetings since January at which the 
feedback from our shareholders was 
carefully considered and the updated 
policy agreed. Having completed our 
consultation with our major investors, 
we will be putting the updated policy  
to shareholders for approval at the AGM 
in June 2017.
The new policy is an evolution of the 
existing policy and we have only made 
changes where we believe they are 
essential in the context of the strategic 
priorities of the business. Our philosophy 
is to align remuneration directly with the 
Company’s strategy and its business 
plans. Importantly, there will be no 
changes to maximum award levels or 
holding periods, and both malus and 
clawback clauses will continue to apply 
to both incentive schemes.
Governance Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 79
malus conditions would apply to include 
a situation where material damage is 
done to the Company’s reputation. 
More details on these consultations 
can be found in the sections below.
Greater transparency
As I mentioned above, during the  
recent consultations, a number of our 
shareholders stressed the importance 
of good disclosure and transparency. 
As a result of the feedback we received, 
we have decided that wherever possible, 
we will disclose the incentivised targets. 
Last year, for the first time, we 
retrospectively disclosed our profit 
target and committed to disclose the 
2015/16 target in this report. This 
disclosure can be found on page 88.  
As a result of the shareholder feedback, 
we have given some thought to how  
we can improve the transparency of  
our targets still further and have now 
decided to disclose our 2016/17 profit 
target in addition to 2015/16 target.  
This can also be found on page 88. 
We have also included a new table  
in the section of the report on key 
performance indicators on pages 16 to 
19, which brings greater clarity to the 
targets set for incentivised measures.
Updated policy
During the past year, the Committee’s 
activities have been dominated by  
a detailed review of Whitbread’s 
remuneration policy. The review started 
at the beginning of 2016 and, shortly 
afterwards, Alison Brittain set out her 
three strategic priorities for the Group:
• to grow and innovate in the UK;
• to focus on Whitbread’s strengths  
to grow internationally; and
• to build the capability and platform  
to support future growth.
(See pages 8 to 13 for more information 
on Whitbread’s strategy.) 
The Committee set out to propose  
a policy, which is designed to align 
remuneration structures directly with 
strategy, while retaining the key 
measures which shareholders have 
indicated are most critical to them.  
With this in mind, the Committee  
agreed certain changes to the incentive 
schemes in order to align them more 
closely to the longer-term strategy, 
taking account of the business context 
in which we are operating, and to 
simplify their operation.
In particular, we identified that the 
Annual Incentive Scheme was weighted 
too heavily towards in-year profit and 
that the LTIP performance measures 
were overly complex. During the latter 
part of 2016, Stephen Williams wrote  
to our 20 largest shareholders as well  
as a number of proxy advisers in order 
to get their views on the proposed 
changes to the remuneration policy. 
Respondents were generally pleased 
with the simplification of the LTIP 
and accepted the rationale for the 
re-alignment of the Annual Incentive 
Scheme to include greater focus  
on the longer-term strategy.
The changes that we propose  
to the existing scheme structures  
are as follows:
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Annual Incentive Scheme will  
be rebalanced, such that executives  
are focused as much on driving the 
longer-term strategic aims as they are 
on in-year profit. This is particularly 
important for Whitbread as the 
Company invests significant capital into 
maintaining the strength of its brands.  
It is proposed that 50% of the annual 
incentive be payable based on in-year 
profit, with the remaining 50% split 
equally between: 
• financially orientated, objective  
and measurable individual strategic 
objectives, linked to Whitbread’s 
measurable long-term goals; and 
• objectively determined WINcard 
measures, to include team retention 
and customer measures, which are all 
critical leading indicators of the future 
financial performance of the Group.
We received a number of questions 
during the consultation with shareholders 
about the kind of strategic measures 
which we will adopt for the executive 
directors. Shareholders were keen to 
make sure that the targets were clear 
and tangible and closely linked to the 
delivery of profit in the business. The 
Remuneration Committee agrees that 
the targets must be tangible, stretching 
and objectively measurable and aligned 
with the three-point strategy for the 
Group referred to earlier. A table 
showing these changes is set out  
below, using Alison Brittain’s strategic 
objectives as an example. Information  
on the strategic objectives for all of  
the executive directors is provided on 
page 97.
We do not propose to make any 
changes to the quantum of awards 
and clawback and malus clauses will 
continue to apply. We propose that 
50% of all short-term incentives will be 
deferred in shares, which are released 
after a three-year period (the deferral 
amount currently varies depending on 
the measure, and in recent years has 
been around the 50% mark).
Long Term Incentive Plan
We plan to simplify the scheme by 
removing the matrix relationship 
between the two LTIP measures and 
moving to two equally weighted and 
independently measured components  
of EPS and ROCE. Again, we do not 
propose that there be any increase  
in the maximum level of award.  
The awards will still be subject to a 
two-year post-vesting holding period 
and clawback and malus clauses will 
continue to apply. 
Whitbread is investing substantial  
sums of capital in its business to provide 
strong future growth. ROCE remains  
a critical measure of performance for 
shareholders, and no changes to the 
ROCE ranges, which will remain at 13% 
to 18%, are proposed.

Chair, Remuneration Committee

In relation to the EPS measure, the 
current range in the policy is RPI + 4% 
at threshold to RPI + 10% at maximum 
payout. As articulated earlier in the 
Annual Report, Whitbread has 
benefitted from a period of sustained 
growth in the last five years. While the 
Group plans to continue growing for  
the long term, as outlined in detail to 
shareholders at the Capital Market Day 
in November 2016, current investment  
is required to deliver long-term growth 
and the Committee has reflected those 
financial plans in setting the LTIP targets. 
In addition, as we move into a period  
of more economic uncertainty, the 
Committee believes that having RPI as 
part of the calculation will introduce 
undue volatility into the measure and 
could result in extreme upside or 
downside impact on payouts, which 
bear no correlation to the underlying 
performance of the business. For these 
reasons, we believe now is the right time 
to move away from using RPI as part  
of the EPS measure. Having carefully 
considered the business plans of the 
Group and current consensus estimates, 
we propose to leave the range at 4% to 
10% EPS growth. For more information 
on the background to this proposal, 
please see the Chairman’s statement on 
page 5, the strategy section on pages 8 
to 13 and the Group Finance Director’s 
review on page 55.
Set out below is a table which summarises 
the proposed new structure of the LTIP 
performance conditions:
LTIP Measure Target Range
Entitlement  
(% of max)
EPS growth 4% to 10% CAGR 50%
Return on 
Capital 
Employed
13% to 18% 50%
We have also removed the ability to 
provide an additional joining award of  
up to 200% of salary on recruitment  
and limited any awards to those needed  
to compensate a joiner for the loss of 
awards from the previous employer. 
Other remuneration
No changes have been made to the 
policy approved in 2014 in relation  
to the base salary, pension or benefits  
of executive directors.

For executives, our approach continues 
to be designed so as to:
• align with the business strategy and 
the achievement of planned business 
goals;
• support the creation of sustainable 
long–term shareholder value;
• provide an appropriate balance 
between remuneration elements  
that attract, retain and motivate the 
highest calibre of executive talent; and
• encourage a high–performance 
culture by ensuring performance–
related remuneration constitutes a 
substantial proportion of the 
remuneration package and by linking 
maximum payout opportunity to 
outstanding results.
The policy table below provides  
more detail on each key element of 
remuneration, including the maximum 
potential value of each element, a brief 
summary of how it works and details  
of any performance metrics.

Base 
salary
• Base salaries are set to 
be sufficient to attract 
and retain the calibre 
of executive talent 
needed to support the 
long–term interests of 
the business.
Salaries are reviewed annually 
taking account of:
• the salary review across the 
Group;
• trading circumstances;
• personal performance, 
including against agreed 
objectives; and
• market data for an 
appropriate comparator 
group of companies.
• Annual salary increases would 
normally be in line with the average 
increases for employees in other 
appropriate parts of the Group. 
• On occasion, increases may be 
larger where the Committee 
considers this to be necessary. 
Circumstances where this may 
apply include growth into a role,  
to reflect a change in scope of role 
and responsibilities, where market 
conditions indicate a level of 
under-competitiveness and the 
Committee judges that there is  
a risk in relation to attracting or 
retaining executives. 
• Where the Committee exercises  
its discretion to award increases 
above the average for other 
employees, it will do so in 
accordance with policies applying 
across the Group and the resulting 
salary will not exceed the 
competitive market range.
• None
Benefits • Benefits are intended 
to be competitive in 
the market so as to 
assist the recruitment 
and retention of 
executives.
• Executive directors are 
entitled to benefits relating 
to car, healthcare/personal 
insurances. 
• In exceptional 
circumstances, such as the 
relocation of a director, or 
for a new hire, additional 
benefits may be provided 
in the form of a relocation 
allowance and benefits 
including tax equalisation, 
re-imbursement of 
expenses for temporary 
accommodation, travel and 
legal financial assistance.
• In 2016/17 the benefits received by 
the executive directors amounted 
to between 2.8% and 5.4% of 
salary. We do not anticipate that 
the maximum payable would 
exceed 10% of salary. However, the 
Committee may provide benefits 
above this level in certain situations 
where it deems it necessary. This 
may include, for example, the 
appointment of a director based 
overseas or a significant increase  
in the cost of the benefits.
• None

Normally around 25% of the maximum 
incentive is paid for threshold 
performance, with around 50% paid 
for on target performance and the  
full incentive payment being paid  
for delivering stretch performance. 
These vesting levels may vary from 
year to year.

With the exception of base salary, 
benefits, pension and participation  
in the Sharesave scheme, all other 
elements of the remuneration packages

to performance.
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Annual Incentive Scheme has been 
designed to incentivise outstanding 
performance across a number of key 
stakeholder measures and it rewards 
approximately 90 executives with  
both a cash payment and an award of 
deferred shares. The scheme operates 
over a four–year period as follows:
• performance in the first year  
is measured against the three 
performance areas to determine  
the level of awards;
• measures are set by the Remuneration 
Committee so that on–target 
performance is challenging;
• at the end of the first year, cash 
payments are made and any deferred 
shares are awarded as appropriate;
• there is a three–year deferral period 
for the deferred shares before they 
vest to the executive; and
• malus provisions apply to the deferred 
share awards in the event of a material 
misstatement of results, with clawback 
provisions applying to cash awards. 
There are three types of measure used 
to determine the level of awards under 
the scheme. There is a profit measure,  
a number of WINcard measures (or 
other stakeholder measures as may be 
deemed appropriate by the Committee) 
and some personal strategic objectives. 
The strategic individual objectives will  
be quantitative measures linked to 
individual responsibilities in the context 
of our strategic objectives, and will be 
reviewed in advance by the Committee. 
Targets are set taking into account the 
business plan, and the link between 
targets and the Group’s strategy can

Long Term Incentive Plan
For the LTIP, the performance conditions 
will be structured as follows:
• 50% of maximum awards are 
dependent on EPS growth over the 
three–year performance period;
• 50% of maximum awards are 
dependent on ROCE performance 
achieved in the final year of the 
performance period;
• awards will be subject to clawback 
and malus provisions, applying in 
circumstances such as a material 
misstatement of results; and
• a two–year post-vesting holding 
period will apply.
These performance conditions were 
selected because the Committee 
believes that they closely align the LTIP 
with the strategic aims of the Group; to 
grow its leading brands whilst delivering 
returns in excess of the cost of capital in 
order to create significant shareholder 
value. The performance targets for 
awards to be made in future years will 
be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the time each award is 
made taking account of available 
information at that time, including 
internal budget forecasts, external 
expectations and market practice,  
and the need to ensure that targets 
remain motivational.
Changes to the remuneration policy  
in 2016/17
With the exception of the changes to 
the Annual Incentive Scheme and the 
LTIP, which are outlined on pages 79 and 
80 and will form part of the policy to be 
put to shareholders for approval at the 
AGM in June, no significant changes  
to the remuneration policy have been 
made during the year. Other minor 
changes have been made in order to 
provide greater clarity and to improve 
the operation of the policy.
Service contracts and external 
appointments
The key terms of the executive directors’ 
service contracts are as follows:
• notice period – six months by the 
director and 12 months by the 
Company;
• termination payment – see policy on 
payment for loss of office below;
• sickness – full salary for a maximum of 
12 months in any three–year period or 
for a maximum of nine consecutive 
months; and
• non–compete – for six months after 
leaving.
The dates of the executive directors’ 
service contracts, which can be  
found on the Company’s website  
(www.whitbread.co.uk/global/
download-centre/corporate-
governance.html), are as follows:
Alison Brittain 21 May 2015 
Nicholas Cadbury 3 September 2012 
Louise Smalley 25 October 2012
The executive directors are entitled to 
retain fees from external directorships. 
Policy on payment for loss of office
Base salary and contractual benefits
All of the executive directors have a 
rolling service contract with a 12–month 
notice period from the Company. The 
Company may make a payment in lieu  
of notice to include up to 12 monthly 
payments of base salary and the cash 
equivalent of pension contributions.  
The Company may either allow for 
contractual benefits to continue during 
this time or, at its sole discretion, pay  
the value of those benefits on a monthly 
basis. Neither notice nor payment in lieu 
of notice would be given if a director left 
by reason of gross misconduct. 
A director is under a contractual duty  
to mitigate his or her position by actively 
seeking an alternative remunerated 
position and the Company will make  
a corresponding reduction in any 
payment made for loss of office.  
Where a payment in lieu of notice is not 
applicable, the payment of salary and 
contractual benefits would cease on the 
individual’s leaving date.
The Committee reserves the right to 
make any other payments in connection 
with a director’s cessation of office or 
employment where the payments are 
made in good faith in discharge of  
an existing legal obligation (or by  
way of damages for breach of such an 
obligation) or by way of settlement of 
any claim arising in connection with  
the cessation of a director’s office or 
employment. Any such payments may 
include but are not limited to paying any 
fees for outplacement assistance and/or 
the director’s legal and/or professional 
advice fees in connection with his 
cessation of office or employment.
Annual Incentive Scheme
If a director leaves the Company for a 
‘permitted reason’ under the rules of the 
scheme (or if the Committee decides to 
apply ‘good leaver’ status in accordance 
with the discretion outlined on page 86 
of this report), the default position 
would be that deferred shares would 
vest on the date of leaving and a  
pro–rated cash award would be made 
for the incentive year. No new deferred 
shares would be awarded and the 
director would receive a pro–rated  
cash payment in lieu of the deferred 
shares. Notwithstanding the above, the 
Committee has the discretion to make a 
deferred shares award for the incentive 
year, with such award due to vest at the 
same time as the awards made to 
continuing employees for that year.
If a director leaves the Company for any 
other reason, 25% of an outstanding 
award of deferred shares would vest if 
the leaving date was between one and 
two years from the date of grant and 
50% of an outstanding award would 
vest if the leaving date was between two 
and three years from the date of grant. 
Any other unvested deferred shares 
would lapse on the date of leaving. The 
director would receive no cash incentive 
payment for the financial year in which 
they leave and no deferred shares would 
be awarded. 
In the event that a director was to  
leave the Company by reason of gross 
misconduct, or in circumstances in 
which the reputation of the Company  
is materially damaged, the malus 
provisions may be applied, in which 
case, no deferred shares would vest.
Long Term Incentive Plan
If a director leaves the Company for  
a ‘permitted reason’ under the rules of  
the plan (or if the Committee decides  
to apply ‘good leaver’ status in 
accordance with the discretion outlined 
on page 86 of this report), the default 
position would be that any unvested 
LTIP awards would be pro–rated for time 
served. Performance would be tested  
at the end of the standard three–year 
performance period and the pro–rated 
awards would vest at the same time as 
for continuing employees. No LTIP 
award would be made in the final year  
of employment if the Company was 
aware that the director would be leaving 
at the point that awards are made.
If a director leaves the Company for any 
other reason, any unvested LTIP awards 
would lapse at the date of leaving. 
Vested, but unexercised, LTIP awards 
(including those subject to a holding 
period) would be exercisable for the 
latter of six months from the date of 
leaving or six months from the end  
of the holding period. 
In the event that a director was to  
leave the Company by reason of gross 
misconduct or in circumstances in  
which the reputation of the Company is 
materially damaged, the clawback and/
or malus provisions may be applied. 
Remuneration policy report continued
Governance Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 85
Approach to remuneration  
on recruitment
Our approach to recruitment is that 
remuneration should be set in line with 
the policy table on pages 81 and 82. 
Whilst we would not seek to vary this 
approach there may be circumstances  
in which it is necessary to do so.
On the appointment of a new executive 
director, base salary levels will be set 
taking into account a range of factors 
including experience and expertise, 
internal salaries, market levels and cost. 
If an individual is appointed on a base 
salary below the market positioning 
contingent on individual performance, 
the Committee retains the discretion to 
realign base salary over the one–to–three 
years following appointment which may 
result in a higher than normal rate of 
annualised increase, with any such 
increase aligned to internal policies. If 
the Committee intends to rely on this 
discretion, it will be noted in the first 
directors’ remuneration report following 
an individual’s appointment. 
Other elements of annual remuneration 
will be set in line with the policy set out 
in the policy table. As such, variable 
remuneration will be capped at 167%  
of salary under the Annual Incentive 
Scheme and an award of up to 200%  
of salary under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan. The following exceptions will apply:
• in the event that an internal 
appointment is made, the Committee 
retains the discretion to continue with 
existing remuneration provisions 
relating to pension and benefits;
• as deemed necessary and appropriate 
to secure an appointment, the 
Committee retains the discretion  
to make additional payments linked  
to relocation; and
• the Committee may also make an 
additional award of cash or shares on 
appointment of a new director in 
order to compensate for the forfeiture 
of an award from a previous employer. 
Such awards would be on a 
comparable basis, taking account of 
performance, the proportion of the 
performance period remaining and 
the type of award. The Committee  
will normally set appropriate 
performance conditions and vesting 
would generally be over a similar 
timeframe to awards forfeited. The 
Committee would take into account 
the strategy at Whitbread and may 
also require the appointee to purchase 
shares in Whitbread to a pre–agreed 
level prior to vesting.
Service contracts will be entered  
into on terms similar to those for the 
existing executive directors, summarised 
in our service contract policy section. 
However, if necessary the Committee 
would authorise the payment of a 
relocation allowance and repatriation,  
as well as other associated international 
mobility terms or agree terms 
appropriate to the local market for  
a director based overseas.
With respect to the appointment  
of a new Chairman or non–executive 
director, the approach will be consistent 
with that currently adopted. Variable 
pay will not be considered and as such 
no maximum applies. With respect to 
non–executive directors, fees will be 
consistent with policy at the time of 
appointment. If necessary, to secure  
the appointment of a new Chairman  
not based in the UK, payments relating 
to relocation and/or housing could  
be considered.
A timely announcement with respect  
to any director appointment will be 
made to the regulatory news services 
and posted on Whitbread’s website.
Comparison of executive remuneration 
policy with wider employee population
This section of the report describes  
each element of the executive 
remuneration package and explains  
the extent to which those elements  
are made available to the wider 
employee population. The Committee 
consulted with employees in relevant 
roles when developing the directors’ 
remuneration policy.
Base salary
All employees, including the executive 
directors, receive an annual review  
of base salary. Under normal 
circumstances the annual increase  
in salary for an executive director will  
be in the same range as the increase  
for employees across the Group. 
Benefits
Approximately 1,000 employees across 
the Group are entitled to a company car 
or cash in lieu of a company car. The 
scheme is structured so that the level  
of the allowance is on a sliding scale with 
employees on higher grades receiving a 
larger allowance. The executive directors 
are no longer entitled to a company car 
under this scheme, but are entitled to 
receive cash in lieu of a car. 
Approximately 2,600 employees are 
entitled to participate in the Group’s 
private healthcare scheme, with 1,100 of 
these, including the executive directors, 
entitled to family cover. In addition,  
a small number of senior executives, 
including the executive directors, are 
entitled to annual health screening.
All employees receive discounts on 
Company products, but the directors 
have waived their right to this benefit. 
Employees, including the executive 
directors, have access to subsidised 
restaurants within the Company’s  
offices in Dunstable and Luton and  
to free Costa coffee within the 
Company’s offices.
Whitbread’s Sharesave scheme is  
a standard HMRC approved SAYE 
scheme. It is offered to all UK 
employees, including the executive 
directors, on equal terms. The Company 
has shareholder approval to extend  
its share schemes overseas and the 
Remuneration Committee retains  
the discretion to establish a Sharesave 
scheme outside of the UK in the future.
Annual Incentive Scheme
Approximately 6,250 employees are 
eligible to receive an annual incentive 
payment linked to the achievement of 
profit and WINcard targets. The majority 
of participants are entitled to earn  
a maximum annual incentive payment  
of 10% of salary paid in cash. As 
employees progress into more senior 
roles, the maximum payment that can 
be achieved rises to 40%. Approximately 
90 executives, including the executive 
directors, are entitled to participate  
in the Annual Incentive Scheme, with 
maximum payouts split between  
cash and deferred shares, ranging  
from 60% to 167%. 
Approximately 200 employees, 
including the executive directors, are 
given individual strategic objectives  
in addition to the profit and WINcard 
targets mentioned above.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Approximately 50 executives, including 
the executive directors, participate in  
the LTIP. This scheme is not available  
to the wider employee population, 
although the Sharesave scheme 
provides employees with a form  
of long-term incentive.
Governance Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 86
Governance
Pension
Like all employees, the executive 
directors are entitled to participate  
in the Company’s pension scheme.  
The scheme is a defined contribution 
scheme. The levels of contribution from 
the Company vary depending on the job 
grade of the individual, with employees 
at the entry level able to choose a 5% 
contribution level, of which 2% is paid by 
the employee and 3% by the Company. 
Contribution level choices rise with 
seniority. Approximately 45 executives 
receive between 15% and 20% of basic 
salary from the Company, which can be 
allocated to pension or taken as cash. 
Employees who do not choose to 
participate may be automatically 
enrolled with contributions in line with 
the automatic enrolment regulations.
The policy on pension contributions for 
executive directors is that there is an 
upper limit for Company contributions 
of 27.5% of salary. In 2013, the upper limit 
for new joiners was reduced to 25%. This 
contribution can be allocated to pension, 
or taken as cash.
Consideration of shareholder views
We contacted our twenty largest 
investors, as well as Glass Lewis, ISS and 
the Investment Association, in October 
2016 to consult on proposed changes  
to our remuneration policy. A further 
consultation was carried out in February 
2017 in relation to the proposed LTIP 
targets for the 2017 awards.
The responses received to both 
consultations were broadly positive and 
supportive and, as a result, no changes 
were made to the original proposals 
although, as a result of shareholders 
feedback, we have improved our 
disclosure of targets.
Legacy matters
The Committee reserves the right to 
make any remuneration payments and/
or payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to  
it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line 
with the policy set out above where the 
terms of the payment were agreed (i) 
before 17 June 2014 (the date the 
Company’s first shareholder-approved 
directors’ remuneration policy came  
into effect); (ii) before the policy set  
out above came into effect, provided 
that the terms of the payment were 
consistent with the shareholder-
approved directors’ remuneration policy 
in force at the time they were agreed;  
or (iii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a director of the 
Company and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not  
in consideration for the individual 
becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes 
the Committee satisfying awards of 
variable remuneration and, in relation to 
an award over shares, the terms of the 
payment are “agreed” at the time the 
award is granted.
Remuneration Committee discretion
The Remuneration Committee retains 
the discretion to apply ‘good leaver’ 
terms to leavers in respect of both the 
Annual Incentive Scheme and the  
LTIP. In exercising its discretion, the 
Committee must consider the individual 
circumstances in the particular case and 
must not exercise its discretion in a  
way which would be discriminatory on 
grounds of sex, race, age or any other 
protected characteristic within the 
meaning of Section 4 of the Equality 
Act 2010. 
The Committee must also, so far as it  
is able to do so, exercise its discretion  
in a way which is consistent as between 
individuals who are in the same position.
Under the rules of the Annual Incentive 
Scheme, if ‘good leaver’ terms apply, any 
deferred share awards vest in full on the 
date of leaving and may be exercised 
within six months. Under the rules of the 
LTIP, the award would vest subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, 
at the end of the performance period. 
The number of shares vesting would be 
on a pro–rata basis taking account of the 
proportion of the performance period 
that the individual had been employed 
within the Group. The vested award 
would be exercisable for a period of  
six months from the date on which  
the award is declared to be vested.  
On occasions where the Committee 
exercises this discretion the participant 
would be expected to continue to meet 
the shareholding requirement until the 
award vests and failure to do so would 
result in the lapsing of the award. No 
LTIP grants will be made within the  
last 12 months of employment to any 
employee who has requested, and  
been granted, ‘good leaver’ status.
In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee has a number of discretions 
relating to the appointment of new 
directors as outlined on page 85.
In exceptional circumstances, the 
Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to amend the profit range 
(normally between 95% and 110% of 
target) as well as the split between  
the awards based on profit measures, 
individual strategic objectives and other 
stakeholder measures, and the split 
between awards paid in cash and 
deferred shares, for a new incentive year 
under the Annual Incentive Scheme.
The Committee sets the performance 
targets for the LTIP and the Annual 
Incentive Scheme on an annual  
basis. The Committee may change a 
performance target from time to time  
in the event that it considers it fair and 
reasonable to do so. Any change to an 
existing performance target must not 
have the effect, in the opinion of the 
Committee, of making the target 
materially easier or materially more 
difficult to achieve than it was when  
the award was initially granted.
The Chairman and non–executive 
directors’ fees
Although the fees paid to the  
non–executive directors are not a matter 
for the Remuneration Committee, details 
are provided in this report in order to 
comply with regulations. The Chairman 
receives an annual fee and the  
non–executive directors receive a base 
fee, with additional fees for acting as 
the Senior Independent Director or 
for chairing, or being a member of, the 
Audit or Remuneration Committees. 
The fees are reviewed every two years 
by the executive directors taking into 
account a range of factors including  
the time commitment required of the 
directors, the responsibilities of the  
role and the fees paid by other  
similar companies. 
The Chairman and non–executive 
directors are entitled to claim all 
reasonable expenses, and the Company 
may settle any tax incurred, but do not 
receive any other fees or remuneration in 
connection with their roles at Whitbread.
Neither the Chairman nor any of the 
non–executive directors has a service 
contract. Non-executive directors have 
letters of appointment setting out their 
duties and the time commitment 
expected of them. Appointments are  
for an initial term of three years after 
which they are reviewed and their 
appointment can be terminated by 
either party on three-months’ written 
notice. Non-executive directors have  
no entitlement to compensation on 
termination. All directors submit 
themselves for re-election annually.  
The letters of appointment are available 
for shareholders to view at the 
Company’s registered office.

2 Fees for part of the year
Details of each of the elements included in the table above are as follows:
Base salary
Annual salary increases across the Group are effective from 1 May each year. The base salary numbers shown in the table 
therefore include two months’ pay based on the director’s salary from 1 May 2015 and ten months’ pay based on the director’s 
salary from 1 May 2016. Christopher Rogers’ basic salary is shown up to his leaving date. Alison Brittain’s basic salary for 2015/16 
was from the date of her appointment in September 2015.
Benefits
The benefits received by each executive director include family private healthcare and a cash allowance in lieu of a company 
car.
Annual Incentive Scheme
The Annual Incentive Scheme payments shown above include both a cash payment to be made in May 2017 and deferred 
shares to be issued in April 2017. The awards were calculated as described below. 
Awards based on profit measure
The profit target for 2016/17 was £562.5 million and the result was £565.2 million, which was 100.5% of target. The profit range 
was between 95% of target at threshold and 110% of target at maximum.

1 Christopher Rogers had a 2016/17 profit target made up of a mixture of Group and Costa profit (20% Group, 80% Costa), which resulted in a lower payout than 
that for the other executive directors. The Costa target was £161.7 million.
The profit target for the 2015/16 financial year was £563.2 million and the result was £557.1 million, which was 98.9% of target. 
The profit range was between 95% of target at threshold and 110% of target at maximum. The profit target for 2015/16 excluded 
the cost of Premier Inn Germany, which was in its first year of start up. The result was also adjusted for a change in the asset life 
of freehold property, which was not considered when the target was initially set. The profit target for Christopher Rogers was  
a mixture of Group and Costa profit (40% Group, 60% Costa). The Costa target was £154.3 million.
Awards based on WINcard and leadership succession measures
The WINcard targets in 2016/17 were appropriate to the director’s role and consisted of Group targets, some of which were  
a combination of the Costa and Premier Inn & Restaurants measures.

phasing of room openings was taken and communicated at the Capital Market Day. As a result the brand expansion measure was red for the purpose of 
incentive payments to the executive directors, but is amber in the key performance indicators on page 18.
3 These results are those for the current executive directors. Christopher Rogers had targets relating to Costa. He received five green scores, which were worth  
a total of 17.5% of salary, two amber scores, which were worth a total of 3% of salary, and one red score.
More information on the actual targets and outcomes for these measures can be found on pages 16 to 19.
Each executive was also entitled to earn a maximum of 5% of salary based on the achievement of personal leadership 
succession targets. The results achieved were such that Alison Brittain will receive 5% of salary and each of the other executive 
directors will receive 3% of salary based on these measures.
As a result, the awards to be made based on WINcard and leadership succession measures are as follows:

The deferred shares will, under normal circumstances, vest on 1 March 2020, subject to continued employment within the 
Group. No further performance conditions apply to these awards. Malus provisions apply to the deferred share awards in the 
event, for example, of a material misstatement of results with clawback provisions applying to the cash awards. The share price 
used to calculate the awards was the average closing price of a Whitbread share for the five business days preceding 
1 March 2017 (i.e. 3,822.2 pence). 
The number of deferred shares awarded to each director will be as follows:

Long Term Incentive Plan
The amounts shown in the table on page 88 refer to the value of the LTIP awards made in 2014 and vesting in 2017. 
The value given for the LTIP awards is based on the average market value over the last quarter of the financial year 
(3,844.4 pence), as the awards will not vest until after the date of this report.
The LTIP awards made to executives in 2014 were subject to EPS and ROCE measures on a matrix basis as shown below:
ROCE 2016/17
EPS growth above  
RPI per annum
Threshold Sliding scale Maximum
12% 13% 14% 15% 16% 17% 18%

Maximum 10% 0% 75% 75% 82% 89% 96% 100%
The actual EPS growth achieved was RPI plus 9.4% with the 2016/17 ROCE, which is calculated using an average of the previous 
13 months’ net assets, being 15.3%. As a result, 76.5% of the shares awarded under the 2014 LTIP will vest. The awards vesting to 
the executive directors, each of which are subject to a one-year holding period (except for the award vesting to Alison Brittain, 
which is subject to a two-year holding period) are as follows:

The percentage of salary or pension allowance received by the executive directors in pension contributions is shown in the 
table below.
Director % of salary
Alison Brittain 25.0
Nicholas Cadbury 25.0
Christopher Rogers 27.5
Louise Smalley 25.0
Executives are able to elect to receive a monthly amount in cash (less an amount equal to the employer’s national insurance 
contribution) in lieu of the pension contribution. Christopher Rogers and Alison Brittain elected to receive a cash payment, 
while Nicholas Cadbury and Louise Smalley each receive a pension contribution and a cash supplement representing the 
balance over and above the annual allowance set by HMRC for pension contributions. The percentage of salary or pension 
allowance received by Nicholas Cadbury and Louise Smalley will rise to 27.5% on 1 December 2017 and 1 November 2017 
respectively. This is as a result of grandfathered terms.
Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited information)
The Committee believes that the shareholding requirements for executives play an important role in the alignment of the 
interests of executives and shareholders and help to incentivise executives to deliver sustainable long–term performance.
The Chief Executive is required to build and hold a shareholding at least equal to 200% of salary, whilst the other executive 
directors are expected to reach a holding to the value of 125% of salary and other senior executives 75% of salary. Until they 
reach this level, executives are expected to retain 100% of vested awards (after the deduction of income tax, national insurance 
contributions and dealing fees). In addition, a newly appointed executive director is expected to build a shareholding in the 
Company in advance of any share awards vesting. The failure to adhere to these requirements may lead to the executive being 
excluded from participation in future share scheme awards. It should be noted that any vested LTIP awards subject to a holding 
period will not be counted for the purpose of calculating whether an executive has met his or her requirement. When 
determining whether a director has met the requirement, both the current market price and the price at the point the shares 
were acquired will be taken into consideration. 
All of the executive directors except for Alison Brittain, who was appointed in September 2015, have already met the 
requirement. Alison has invested in excess of £1 million in the Company’s shares from her own resources. Her first share scheme 
award is partially vested in April 2017, but is subject to a two-year holding period.
During 2014/15, shareholding requirements were introduced for the Chairman and the non–executive directors. They are each 
required to build a holding to the value of 100% of their annual fee over a three–year period.

2 Alison Brittain received two LTIP awards on joining the Company, each to the value of 175% of salary. The performance conditions for the first of these awards 
are aligned to the awards made to other executives in 2014 and the second of the awards have performance conditions aligned to the awards made to other 
executives in 2015. Although the awards were actually made on 11 December 2015, under the rules of the LTIP, the technical date of both awards is 1 March 2015 
and the market price at award shown in the table above is therefore the price on 1 March 2015. The price used to calculate the awards was the average Whitbread 
share price for the five business days immediately preceding Alison’s first day of employment, which was 4645.2 pence.
3 Christopher Rogers stepped down from the Board on 19 April 2016 and left the Company on 1 July 2016. He exercised his 2013 LTIP award over 24,254 shares on 
3 May 2016 at a price of 3865.0 pence per share. His 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards lapsed when he left the Company. He now has no LTIP awards outstanding.

2 Under the rules of the Scheme awards cannot vest during a close or prohibited period. The normal release dates for the 2013 awards would have been 1 March 
2016. However, as this date was during a prohibited period, the 2013 awards actually released on 3 March 2016.
 The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to the director remaining an employee of Whitbread at that 
date. If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or 
some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full. If the director ceases to be an employee of 
Whitbread for any other reason the proportion of award which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date the director ceases to be 
an employee. If the director leaves within the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and 
between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.

During the year, it was announced that Christopher Rogers would step down from the Board on 19 April 2016 and leave the 
Company on 1 July 2016. The Committee exercised its discretion, in accordance with the approved policy, to apply partial ‘good 
leaver’ terms to Christopher. A disclosure under Section 403(2B) of the Companies Act 2006 was made on the Company’s 
website and the details are as follows:
All payments are in line with the Company’s stated remuneration policy for a good leaver (published in the Annual Report for 
2013/14) and approved by the shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
Salary and benefits 
Christopher will continue to receive normal salary and benefits, as provided under his service agreement, up to and  
including 1 July 2016. 
Share awards for past and future performance
Directors Incentive Scheme: Christopher ’s deferred shares will vest on their ordinary vesting date, being three years from the date 
of grant. He was granted 9,028 deferred shares in 2014 and 8,304 in 2015. These deferred shares were awarded as a result of 
performance under incentive schemes in prior years. He also will be entitled to a cash and deferred share award, subject to 
performance, for the 2015/16 financial year, to be agreed by the Remuneration Committee in April 2016, and for the part of the 
2016/17 financial year for which he is employed, which will be agreed by the Remuneration Committee in 2017. Any new deferred 
shares awarded in 2016 or 2017 will not vest until 2019 or 2020 respectively. 
LTIP: Unvested awards granted in 2014 and 2015 will lapse. The Remuneration Committee will determine in April 2016  
the level at which the LTIP grant made to Christopher in 2013 (24,953 shares) will vest. No further grants will be made to 
Christopher under the LTIP.
Payments to past directors (audited information)
With the exception of regular pension payments and dividends on Whitbread shares and the exercise of share awards as 
permitted under the rules of the Annual Incentive Scheme, the LTIP and the Savings-related Share Option Scheme, no other 
payments were made during the year to past directors.
Chief Executive’s remuneration 
The Chief Executive’s remuneration (including base salary, benefits and annual incentive payment) decreased by 6.1% in the 
year, compared with an increase of 5.3% for the Group’s employees as a whole.
The following table shows the Chief Executive’s pay over the last eight years, with details of the percentage of maximum paid

Relative importance of spend on pay
The graph below compares the change in total expenditure on employee pay during the year to the changes in profit after tax 
and dividend payments.
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2016/17
Base salary
The executive directors will each receive a salary increase of 2%, which is in the same range as the general increase being given 
to employees across the Group.
The base salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 May 2017 will be as follows:
Director
Base salary at 
1 May 2017
£’000

1 May 2016

Louise Smalley 362 357
Benefits
The benefits received by each executive director will continue to include family private healthcare and a cash allowance in lieu 
of a company car.
Annual Incentive Scheme
As explained earlier in the report, some changes have been made to the way in which the Annual Incentive Scheme will operate 
in 2017/18. The overall quantum of awards available to the executive directors has not changed and remains at 167% of salary  
at the maximum.
To be eligible to receive incentive payments there are ‘gateway’ requirements relating to both performance and leadership 
behaviour. Any incentive payments will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee in the event that either profit 
performance is below 90% of target or the health and safety score is red on the WINcard. The expectation is that our leaders’ 
actions reflect Whitbread’s values and code of conduct, including our approach to health and safety. Keeping our team and 
customers safe is not an incentive lever but a core responsibility that earns the right to earn further incentivised rewards.
In 2017/18, half of the total incentive available will be based on performance against a Group underlying profit before tax target. 
As explained on page 18, this profit target is commercially sensitive and, for that reason, is not disclosed in advance. The 
Committee intends to disclose the target retrospectively in the 2017/18 report.

Each executive director will be able to earn up to an additional 25% of the maximum based on WINcard measures. One 
measure will be operational team retention and the other will be a combination of Customer Heartbeat measures, made up  
of Premier Inn brand health, Costa net recommend and Restaurants net recommend. Only half of the maximum available in 
respect of these measures will be available for a ‘green’ WINcard score, with 75% of maximum payout available for achieving  
a stretch target beyond green and maximum payout requiring a new ‘excel’ level, to be achieved.
Each executive director also has three personal strategic objectives. They will be eligible to receive up to 25% of the maximum 
incentive opportunity based on the delivery of these objectives. Each objective will carry an equal weighting within that and 
achievement of the approved objective outcomes have been aligned to a payment level that would be recognised as stretch 
performance. The objectives are quantifiable and linked to the business plan and future financial performance. The table below 
shows a summary of the personal strategic objectives for each of the executive directors, together with details on which of the 
three strategic priorities (see pages 8 to 13) each objective is linked to:
Strategic 
Priority
Alison Brittain
Objective 1: Growth in Premier Inn rooms, Costa stores and Costa Express machines and like for like sales growth. 1
Objective 2: Growth in German hotel pipeline and progress in Costa China. 2

Long Term Incentive Plan
The awards to be made in 2017 will be based on 200% of base salary for Alison Brittain and 125% of base salary for the  
other executive directors, calculated by reference to the average of the closing price of a Whitbread share for the five  
business days preceding 1 March 2017 (i.e. 3,822.2 pence). They will vest in April 2020, subject to the director’s continued 
employment within the Group and satisfaction of the performance conditions. The awards will be subject to a two–year  
holding period post vesting. 
The 2017 awards to the executive directors will be made following the AGM in June 2017.
In the event that the updated policy is approved, the awards will be subject to two independently operating performance 
conditions. 50% of each award will be dependent on the Group ROCE in 2019/20, with the threshold being 13% and maximum 
payout at 18%, with a sliding scale operating in between. 
A further 50% of each award will be linked to an EPS growth target operating on a sliding scale between 4% per annum at 
threshold to 10% per annum at maximum.
The number of shares awarded under the LTIP to each director will be as follows:
Director
Number of  
shares awarded
Value of  
award

The base annual fee for non–executive directors is £57,000. The fees for the chairmanship of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee are £20,000. The fee for the Senior Independent Director is £15,000 and the fees for membership  
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are £5,000.

a result of a takeover bid.
Directors’ share interests
Details regarding the share interests of 
the directors in the share capital of the 
Company, including with respect to 
options to acquire ordinary shares, are 
set out in the remuneration report on 
pages 78 to 98.
Share capital
Details of the issued share capital can  
be found in Note 25 to the accounts.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled  
to attend and speak at general meetings 
of the Company, to appoint one or more 
proxies and, if they are corporations, 
corporate representatives to attend 
general meetings and to exercise voting 
rights. Holders of ordinary shares may 
receive a dividend and on a liquidation, 
may share in the assets of the Company. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled  
to receive the Company’s Annual Report 
and Accounts. Subject to meeting 
certain thresholds, holders of ordinary 
shares may requisition a general 
meeting of the Company or the proposal 
of resolutions at AGMs.
Voting rights
On a show of hands at a general 
meeting of the Company, every holder 
of ordinary shares present, in person or 
by proxy and entitled to vote, has one 
vote (unless the proxy is appointed by 
more than one member in which case 
the proxy has one vote for and one vote 
against if the proxy has been instructed 
by one or more members to vote for the 
resolution and by one or more members 
to vote against the resolution) and on  
a poll every member present in person 
or by proxy and entitled to vote has  
one vote for every ordinary share held. 
Voting rights for any ordinary shares 
held in treasury are suspended. None  
of the ordinary shares carry any special 
rights with regard to control of the 
Company. Electronic and paper proxy 
appointments and voting instructions 
must be received by the Company’s 
registrars not later than (i) 48 hours 
before a meeting or adjourned meeting 
(excluding non–working days),  
or (ii) 24 hours before a poll is taken, if 
the poll is not taken on the same day as 
the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Unless the directors decide otherwise,  
a shareholder cannot attend or vote at 
any general meeting of the Company or 
at any separate general meeting of the 
holders of any class of shares in the 
Company or upon a poll or exercise any 
other right conferred by membership in 
relation to general meetings or polls if he 
or she has not paid all amounts relating 
to those shares which are due at the 
time of the meeting.
Where a shareholder with at least a 
0.25% interest in a class of shares has 
been served with a disclosure notice in 
relation to a particular holding of shares 
and has failed to provide the Company 
with information concerning those 
shares, those sharews will no longer  
give that shareholder any right to vote  
at a shareholders’ meeting.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are the following restrictions on 
the transfer of shares in the Company:
• certain restrictions which may from 
time to time be imposed by laws and 
regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws);
• pursuant to the Company’s share 
dealing code, the directors and senior 
executives of the Company require 
approval to deal in the Company’s 
shares;

has failed to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests

not be transferred without the prior 
written consent of the directors;

agreements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of shares or on voting rights.

are entitled to receive an annual  
non–cumulative preferential dividend 
calculated at a rate of 75% of six month

holders of the B shares and C shares are 
not entitled in their capacity as holders 
of such shares, to receive notice of any

Whitbread has a range of employment 
policies covering such issues as diversity, 
employee wellbeing and equal 
opportunities.
The Company takes its responsibilities 
to the disabled seriously and seeks not 
to discriminate under any circumstances 
(including in relation to training, career 
development and promotion) against 
current or prospective employees 
because of any disability or for any 
other reason. Fair and full consideration 
is given to applications for employment 
made by disabled persons, having 
regard to their aptitudes and abilities. 
Employees who become disabled 
during their career at Whitbread will  
be retained in employment wherever 
possible and given help with 
rehabilitation and training.
Employee involvement
The importance of good relations and 
communications with employees is 
fundamental to the continued success  
of our business. Each of the Group’s 
operating businesses maintains 
employee relations and consults 
employees as appropriate to its own 
particular needs. In addition, our 
employee opinion survey, ‘Your Say’,  
is conducted twice a year to provide 
insight into the views of employees.
Our employees are actively encouraged 
to take part in our Sharesave scheme, 
which is available to all employees  
and offers an option price discounted 
by 20%.
Regular internal communications are 
made to all employees to ensure that 
they are kept well informed of the 
performance of the Group and of 
financial and economic factors that may 
affect the Company’s performance.
Further information on employee 
involvement can be found in the 
Winning Teams section on pages 24  
to 29.
Mandatory Green House Gas Reporting 
In order to comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 we have amended our 
environmental reporting accordingly. 
We have considered the six main  
GHGs and report in CO
2
e for our  
Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) 
CO
2
 emissions. We have used the  
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard methodology 
to calculate our emissions and  
DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors  
for Company Reporting. 
Scope 1 includes emissions from the 
fuels we use in our hotels, restaurants, 
offices and coffee shops such as natural 
gas and liquid petroleum gas.  
It also includes CO
2
e from owned 
vehicles which include company  
cars but excludes logistics as  
this is an outsourced operation. 
Refrigerant gas, F-Gas, losses are 
captured for UK operations only  
due to reporting capabilities.
Scope 2 relates to the indirect emissions 
associated with the generation of the 
electricity consumed in our sites. 
When defining the scope of our data we 
do not report on operations under Joint 
Venture agreements where we do not 
have operational control such as Costa 
Beijing and Premier Inn (UAE). For 
reasons of materiality, small, one man, 
offices in Australasia and the Far East 
have been excluded. All other sites 
throughout the world are included. 
Where possible we have reported billed 
or AMR data which now represents 88% 
of our total global emissions. For those 
operations which are currently beyond 
our reporting capabilities, such as Costa 
Shanghai, we have used an estimation 
approach using known sales data and 
local conversion factors. For further 
information about our estimation 
techniques and the number and location 
of Whitbread sites please view the 
corporate responsibility pages on our 
website www.whitbread.co.uk.

Amendment of the Company’s Articles 
of Association 
Any amendments to the Articles of 
Association of the Company may be 
made in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 by way of 
special resolution.
Significant agreements
The Company’s facility, bond and private 
placement loan notes agreements, 
details of which can be found in Note 19 
to the accounts, contain provisions 
entitling the counterparties to exercise 
termination or other rights in the event 
of a change of control of the Company.
Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual 
arrangements with numerous third–
parties in support of its business 
activities, none of which are considered 
individually to be essential to its business 
and, accordingly, it has not been 
considered necessary for an 
understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Group’s 
business to disclose information about 
any of those third–parties.
Financial instruments
Information on the Company’s use of 
financial instruments, financial risk 
management objectives and policies 
and exposure is given in Note 22 and 
Note 23 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Political donations
The Company has not made any political 
donations during the year and intends  
to continue its policy of not doing so  
for the foreseeable future.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP has expressed its 
willingness to continue in office as 
auditor of the Company and a resolution 
proposing its reappointment will be put 
to shareholders at the 2017 AGM. After 
proper consideration, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that Deloitte LLP 
continues to be objective and 
independent of the Company. In coming 
to this conclusion the Audit Committee 
gave full consideration to any non–audit 
work carried out by Deloitte LLP, and 
has concluded that certain services will 
not be carried out by Deloitte LLP, as 
outlined in the Committee’s terms of 
reference. 
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors have taken all reasonable 
steps to make themselves aware of 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditor is aware of that 
information. The directors are not aware 
of any relevant audit information which 
has not been disclosed to the auditor.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the strategic report on 
pages 4 to 61. The financial position of 
the Company, its cash flows, net debt 
and borrowing facilities and the maturity 
of those facilities are set out in the 
Group Finance Director’s review on 
pages 54 to 57. In addition there are 
further details in the financial statements 
on the Group’s financial risk management, 
objectives and policies (Note 22) and on 
financial instruments (Note 23).
A combination of the strong operating 
cash flows generated by the business 
and the significant headroom on its 
credit facilities supports the directors’ 
view that the Group has sufficient funds 
available for it to meet its foreseeable 
working capital requirements. The 
directors have concluded that the going 
concern basis remains appropriate.
The viability statement can be found  
on page 58.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts in accordance with applicable 
UK laws and regulations. UK company 
law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, the directors 
have prepared the Group financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and applicable  
UK law. Further, they have elected 
to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 
'Reduced Disclosure Framework' 
and applicable UK law.
Under company law, the directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.
In preparing the Group financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors, and then 
apply them consistently;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner which 
presents relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other  
events and conditions on the Group's 
financial position and financial 
performance;
• state that the Group financial 
statements comply with IFRS, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the consolidated financial 
statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in 
its business.
In preparing the Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
disclose, with reasonable accuracy  
at any time, the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, with regard to the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for the system of internal 
control for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the strategic report (including 
the corporate governance report)  
and the directors' remuneration report 
and the directors' report in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable regulations, including the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
A copy of the financial statements 
of the Group is posted on the Group’s 
website. The directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Annual Report included on  
the website. Information published  
on the Group’s website is accessible  
in many countries with different  
legal requirements. Legislation in  
the UK governing the preparation  
and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, the names and 
functions of whom are set out on 
pages 64 and 65, confirms that, to  
the best of their knowledge, they have 
complied with the above requirements 
in preparing the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable accounting 
standards and that the financial 
statements give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and result of the Group. In addition,  
each of the directors confirms that the 
strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the 
Group and together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
The directors are responsible 
for preparing the Annual Report in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Having taken advice 
from the Audit Committee, the Board 
considers the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and that 
it provides the information necessary for 
the shareholders to assess the Group's 
and Company's performance, 
business model and strategy.

prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice involving FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’;
• the financial statements have been

Going concern and the directors’ 
assessment of the principal risks 
that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we  
have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the 
going concern basis of accounting 
contained within the directors’ report on 
page 102 and the directors’ statement 
on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the strategic report 
on page 58.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• revenue recognition;
• valuation of the defined benefit obligation; and
• classification and presentation of  
non-underlying items.
Within this report, any new risks are identified with 
and any risks which are the same as the prior year 
are identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year 
was £26.0m which was determined on the basis  
of 5% of profit before tax.
Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on 
all significant trading entities at both Premier Inn  
& Restaurants and Costa, and the Group head office. 
These locations represent the principal business units 
and account for 99% of the Group’s revenue, 101% of 
the Group’s profit before tax and 97% of the Group’s 
net assets.
Significant 
changes in  
our approach
In the current year, we have included a risk surrounding 
the classification and presentation of non-underlying 
items due to an increased number of adjusting items 
and the judgement and complexity in accounting for 
the restructuring, sale and leaseback transactions 
and the costs incurred in exiting the Premier Inn 
operations in South East Asia and India.
The risk of management override of controls has 
been removed in the current period as this had a 
lower effect on the allocation of resources in the 
second year of our audit.
We are required to state whether we 
have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the directors' confirmation on page 58 
that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 58 to 61 that 
describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement within the 
directors’ report on page 102 about 
whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and 
their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on page 58 
as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’  
adoption of the going concern basis 
of accounting and we did not identify 
any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Governance Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 105
Revenue recognition 
Risk – Revenue 
recognition
As described in the Accounting policies and Revenue disclosures in notes 2 and 3 to the 
financial statements, the Group generates revenues from three revenue streams, totalling 
£3,106.0m in the current year (2015/16: £2,921.8m). The main revenue streams comprise a high 
volume of low level transactions from accommodation (sale of services), restaurant and food 
and beverage sales (sale of goods).
There are manual adjustments made to revenue, outside of core transactional processes, for 
example in respect of reclassifications, other income streams, loyalty schemes and franchise 
income, which represent the key areas of focus for the audit due to their significance and 
certain estimates required in accounting for these items, e.g. redemption rates within loyalty 
schemes and deferred revenues for franchisees.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We have performed the following procedures to address this audit risk:
• profiled the manual journal entries posted to revenue, assessed the impact of these on revenue 
and tested a sample of these journal entries by verifying to supporting documentation to confirm 
the entry was valid and appropriate;
• for loyalty schemes, tested the redemption rate calculation, agreed the number of loyalty points 
outstanding to third party evidence and re-performed the liability calculation; and
• for franchise income, recalculated the deferred revenue with reference to agreements 
with franchisees.
We also performed the following procedures to test the revenue balance:
• controls testing: tested the controls over revenue including those in the IT systems that 
support the recording of revenue;
• analytical reviews: performed substantive analytical procedures on the major revenue 
streams with reference to store and hotel and restaurant data; and
• tests of detail: utilised analytical software to perform substantive tests of detail for a sample of the 
revenue balance by reconciling source data for each sample to the general ledger and cash receipts.
Key observations Following our audit procedures we found that revenue had been recorded appropriately.
Valuation of the defined benefit obligation 
Risk description As described in the Audit Committee report on page 73, the Accounting Policies (note 2) and 
the Retirement Benefits note (note 29), the Group has a defined benefit pension scheme, which 
is closed to new members and to future accrual. At 2 March 2017, the Group recorded a net retirement 
obligation of £425.1m (2016: £288.1m), including £2,808.2m of liabilities (2016: £2,220.4m) and 
£2,383.1m of assets (2016: £1,932.3m).
The pension valuation is dependent on market conditions and key assumptions made, in particular 
relating to investment markets, discount rate, inflation expectations and life expectancy assumptions. 
The setting of these assumptions is complex and requires the exercise of significant management 
judgement with the support of third party actuaries. As such, it continues to represent a key audit risk.
Independence
We are required to comply with the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors and confirm 
that we are independent of the Group 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with  
those standards.
We confirm that we are independent 
of the Group and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those standards. We 
also confirm we have not provided any 
of the prohibited non-audit services 
referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material 
misstatement described below are those 
that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in 
the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.
In the current year, we have included 
a risk surrounding the presentation 
and classification of non-underlying 
items due to the judgement and 
complexity in accounting for certain 
of these items.
The risk of management override 
of controls has been removed in the 
current period as this had a lower 
effect on the allocation of resource 
in the second year of our audit.

Valuation of the defined benefit obligation 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
To address this audit risk, we have performed the following procedures:
• Actuarial assumptions: engaged our internal pension specialists to review the key assumptions 
used, and considered the methodology utilised to derive these assumptions. Futhermore, 
we have benchmarked these assumptions against external market data to assess their 
appropriateness in calculating the scheme assets and liabilities; and
• Reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements, considering the IAS 19 report prepared 
by the actuary.
Key observations From the work completed, we are satisfied that the methodology and assumptions applied 
in relation to determining the pension valuation are appropriate.
Classification and presentation of non-underlying items 
Risk description As described in the Audit Committee report on page 73 and the Accounting Policies (note 2), the 
recognition and presentation of income and costs within adjusted performance measures (‘APMs’) 
(to derive ‘Underlying profit before tax’) under IFRS, is judgemental, with IFRS only requiring the 
separate presentation of material items. Judgement is exercised by management in determining the 
classification of items as non-underlying. In addition, the accounting for certain of these items is more 
complex this year. As such, it has been recognised as a key area of audit focus.
In the current year, adjustments totalling £49.8m (2015/16: £58.6m) have been made to statutory 
profit before tax to derive underlying profit before tax of £565.2m (2015/16: £546.3m). The definition 
of underlying is described in the Accounting Policies (Note 2) and the reconciliation between 
statutory profit before tax and underlying profit before tax is included in note 6 to the financial 
statements.
The most significant items classified as non-underlying in 2016/17 are:
• Premier Inn India and South East Asia business exit of £30.0m;
• UK Restructuring costs of £21.6m;
• Costa international restructuring of £14.5m;
• Impairment of property, plant and equipment (net of reversals) of £7.5m; and
• Property, plant and equipment disposals and property reversions resulting in a gain of £19.3m. 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We have performed the following procedures to address this audit risk:
• Classification as non-underlying: evaluated the appropriateness of the inclusion of items, 
both individually and in aggregate, within non-underlying profits, including assessing the 
consistency of items included year on year and compliance with the accounting policies. 
In addition, we also assessed one-off items identified through the course of the audit, 
but which had been recognised within underlying profit before tax; and
• For each of the items identified above: obtained and assessed management’s accounting papers 
and considered the judgements and assumptions used in these. For each of these, agreed on a 
sample basis to supporting evidence where possible, recalculated the provisions in place where 
relevant and understood and challenged the key assumptions applied by management through 
benchmarking, re-calculation and agreement to third party support (e.g. discount rate used 
within the impairment model); and
• For the disclosures, reviewed the consistency of the presentation of non-underlying 
measures throughout the Annual Report and the information included in note 6 to the 
financial statements.
Key observations From the work performed, we are satisfied that the items recognised within non-underlying 
have been appropriately accounted for and that their presentation is in line with the definition 
included within the accounting policies and consistent with prior year.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Governance Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 107
At the parent entity level we also tested 
the consolidation process and carried 
out analytical procedures to confirm  
our conclusion that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated financial information 
of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified 
account balances.
The Group audit team followed a 
programme of planned visits that has 
been designed so that a senior member 
of the audit team visits each of the 
locations where the Group audit scope 
was focused at least once every two 
years and the most significant of them 
at least once a year. In the current  
year, we performed testing in the UK  
for Premier Inn UK, Costa UK and the 
Group audit and visited Costa Poland.  
In years where we do not visit a 
significant component, we will include 
the component audit team in our team 
briefing, discuss their risk assessment, 
attend their closing meeting and review 
documentation of the findings from  
their work.

all audit differences in excess of £1.3m 
(2016: £0.5m), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative

Committee on disclosure matters that 
we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by 
obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including 
Group-wide controls and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused 
our Group audit scope primarily on the 
audit work at four components: Premier 
Inn & Restaurants UK, Costa UK, Costa 
Poland and Costa Shanghai. These were 
subject to a full audit where the extent of 
our testing was based on our assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement  
and of the materiality of the Group’s 
operations at those locations. These 
locations represent the principal business 
units and together account for 99% of  
the Group’s revenue, 101% of the Group’s 
profit before tax and 97% of the Group’s 
net assets. They were also selected 
to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address 
the risk of material misstatement 
identified above.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude  
of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable  
that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced.  
We use materiality both in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, 
we determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole 
as follows:
Group 
materiality
£26.0m 
(2016: £25.0m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
5% of profit before 
tax of £515.4m 
(2016: £487.7m) was 
used to determine 
our materiality in the 
current year. This is 
consistent with the 
prior year.
Rationale 
for the 
benchmark 
applied
In determining 
our final materiality 
based on our 
professional 
judgement, we have 
considered profit 
before tax to be the 
most appropriate 
measure for business 
performance. The 
materiality applied 
also represents 
5% of profit before 
tax, less than 1% 
of revenue and 1% 
of equity.

Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
• the information given in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ 
report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable 
legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and its 
environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified any 
material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received 
and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we 
are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or 
the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited is not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are 
also required to review part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance 
with certain provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.
Our duty to read other information 
in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider 
whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have not identified 
any such inconsistencies or misleading 
statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim  
to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood 
and applied. Our quality controls 
and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team 
and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state  
to them in an auditor’s report and for  
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 2 March 2017
1 Authorisation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 2 March 2017 were authorised for issue by the 
Board of Directors on 24 April 2017. Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England 
and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office 
is given on page 172.
The significant activities of the Group are described in Note 4, Segment information, and in the strategic report on pages 
4 to 61.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments 
that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period and the defined benefit pension scheme, as explained 
in the accounting policies below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Further detail is contained in the 
viability statement included in the strategic report on page 58.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred 
thousand except when otherwise indicated. The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 2 March 2017 (prior financial year: 
53 weeks to 3 March 2016).
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 3 March 2016, except for the 
adoption of the new standards and interpretations that are applicable for the year ended 2 March 2017. The significant 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group has adopted the following standards and interpretations which have been assessed as having no financial impact 
or disclosure requirements at this time:
• The IASB’s annual improvement process, 2012–2014;
• IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1;
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38;
• IAS 16 and IAS 41 Bearer Plants – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41;
• IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements – Amendments to IAS 27;
• IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception – Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 
and IAS 28; and
• IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations – Amendments to IFRS 11.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with 
the Group’s share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associate incorporated using the equity method of 
accounting. These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies. The financial statements of 
significant trading subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company except for Yueda Costa 
(Shanghai) Food & Beverage Management Company Limited which has a year-end of 31 December as per Chinese legislation.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary 
which significantly affect the subsidiary’s return, so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000/01, which was accounted for using merger 
accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised 
as an intangible asset. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from, or up to, the date that control passes respectively. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed 
for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be 
impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part of 
a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other legal 
rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset as follows:
• trading licences have an indefinite life;
• reacquired franchise rights are amortised over the life of the acquired franchise agreement;
• IT software and technology is amortised over periods of three to six years;
• acquired customer relationships are amortised over 15 years; and
• operating rights agreements are amortised over the life of the contract.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not  
be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and 
any impairment in value. Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that 
the assets are available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
as follows:
• freehold land is not depreciated;
• freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years; and
• plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The residual values are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Any impairment in the values of property, plant 
and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and carrying 
amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into, or acquiring, leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases are amortised on  
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped, for impairment assessment purposes, 
at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups 
of assets (cash generating units or CGUs). If such indication of impairment exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not 
generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which 
the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating costs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU, on a pro-rata basis.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the CGU’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimated future cash flows used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future 
periods to allocate the asset’s carrying amount, less any residual value, on a straight-line basis over its remaining useful life.
Consolidated accounts 2016/17   Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 117
2 Accounting policies continued
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on 
management’s view of the consumption of the asset. Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, 
which is at strategic business unit level. The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying 
amount is not greater than its recoverable amount. In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates 
that the fair value, less the costs of disposal, of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable 
amount is determined from value in use calculations. An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the 
recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment
For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment, the Group considers each trading outlet to be 
a separate CGU.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset either from independent sources or, 
in conjunction with, an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Investments in joint ventures
The Group assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is 
compared with its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment 
is written down to its recoverable amount.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present 
condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. 
Such assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value, less the cost to sell, and are not depreciated 
or amortised.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out 
and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs to sell.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is 
considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under 
the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Warranties
Provisions for the expected costs of warranty obligations arising on the acquisition or disposal of a business are 
recognised at the date of the relevant transaction, at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the Group’s obligation.
Restructuring costs
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan and has raised a valid 
expectation, in those affected, that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its 
main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures 
arising from the restructuring which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not 
associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.

Non-underlying items and use of underlying performance measures
We use a range of measures to monitor the financial performance of the Group. These measures include both statutory 
measures in accordance with IFRS and alternative performance measures (APMs) which are consistent with the way that 
the business performance is measured internally.
The term underlying profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures 
reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, statutory measurements of profit. 
Underlying measures of profitability are non-IFRS because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts 
that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.
We report underlying measures because we believe they provide both management and investors with useful additional 
information about the financial performance of the Group’s businesses.
Underlying measures of profitability represent the equivalent IFRS measures adjusted for specific items that we consider 
hinder comparison of the financial performance of the Group’s businesses either from one period to another or with other 
similar businesses.
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax. 
Underlying earnings per share is calculated using underlying profit after tax attributable to parent shareholders.
The adjustments made to reported profit in the consolidated income statement, in order to derive our underlying results, 
may include:
• Profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and onerous leases. On occasion 
we may dispose of properties, either as part of a sale and leaseback transaction or because the property is no longer 
required in our ongoing business. In addition, the Group may recognise liabilities in respect of lease obligations on 
properties which have been previously disposed of but where the lease obligations have reverted to the Group under 
privity. Profits or losses on these items may be significant and are not reflective of the Group’s ongoing trading results;
• Profit or loss on the sale of a business or investment. These disposals are not part of the Group’s ongoing trading 
business and are therefore excluded;
• Significant one-off restructuring costs, resulting from a strategic review of the Group’s businesses or operations, 
the inclusion of which would distort the year on year comparability of the Group’s trading results;
• Impairment of assets as the result of restructuring or closure of a business and impairment of sites which are 
underperforming or are to be closed, the inclusion of which would distort the year-on-year comparability of the Group’s 
trading results;
• Amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of a business combination or other transaction outside of the 
ordinary course of business;
• Finance charge/credit for defined benefit pension scheme. These costs are non-cash and do not relate to the Group’s 
ongoing activities as the scheme is closed to future accrual;
• Finance costs resulting from the unwinding of discounts on provisions created in respect of non-underlying items; and
• Significant and one-off tax settlements in respect of prior years including the related interest and the impact of changes 
in the statutory tax rate, the inclusion of which would distort year on year comparability, as well as the tax impact of the 
non-underlying items identified above.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted 
at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency (generally sterling) at average rates of exchange for the year. 
Day-to-day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in 
which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate. Translation 
differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement. The differences that arise from translating the results of 
foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate 
component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that 
particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement. All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in 
the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non-sterling functional currency. The financial performance and end 
position of these entities are translated into sterling in the consolidated financial statements. Balance sheet items are 
translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date. Transactions reported in the income statement are translated 
using an average rate for the month in which they occur.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of the goods or services provided have transferred to the 
buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with 
the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable from the sale of goods and services to third parties 
after deducting discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and other promotional activities. Revenue includes duties 
which the Group pays as principal, but excludes amounts collected on behalf of other parties, such as value added tax. 
All sales between Group businesses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue of the Group comprises the following streams:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of food, beverages and merchandise is recognised at the point of sale, with the exception  
of wholesale transactions which are recognised on delivery.
The Group operate some customer loyalty programmes. Where award credits are granted as part of a sale transaction, 
a portion of revenue equal to the fair value of the award points earned is deferred until redemption. The fair value of points 
awarded is determined with reference to the discount received upon redemption and the level of redemption; 
Rendering of services
Revenue from room sales and other guest services is recognised when rooms are occupied and as services are provided; and
Franchise fees
Revenue from fees received in connection with the franchise of the Group’s brand names is recognised when earned.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Finance revenue
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs 
incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits
In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. The cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Re-measurements are recognised in full in the period 
in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods.
For defined benefit plans, the employer’s portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, 
with net interest costs reported within finance costs. In addition, all administration costs, other than those relating to the 
management of plan assets or taxes payable by the plan itself, are charged as incurred to operating costs in the income 
statement. Net interest is calculated by applying the opening discount rate to the opening net defined benefit obligation 
taking into account the expected contributions and benefits paid.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Group’s defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the 
curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled transactions
Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. The cost of these equity-
settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they 
are granted. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the period in which the performance conditions or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date. 
Except for awards subject to market-related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions, at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, 
and is adjusted to reflect the directors’ best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period. If options are subject to market-related conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted 
for the likelihood of these targets being met. Instead, these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not 
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. Where an equity-settled award is forfeited, the related expense 
recognised to date is reversed.

Cash-settled transactions
The cost is fair-valued at grant date and expensed over the period until the vesting date, with recognition of a corresponding 
liability. The liability is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date, up to and including the settlement date, with changes 
in fair value recognised in the income statement for the period.
Tax
The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profit for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax 
base of the Group’s assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts that have originated but have not been reversed by the 
balance sheet date. No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability, in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all, or part of, the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are charged 
or credited directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are held by the Group (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual 
rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them 
to be joint ventures.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying  
a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, 
including acquisition charges associated with the investment. After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and 
associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks 
and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset. The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. On initial recognition 
these assets are recognised at fair value. Subsequent measurement is also at fair value, with changes recognised through 
finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or 
available-for-sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money 
is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised 
or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for 
doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, cash in hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist 
of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

Derivative financial instruments 
The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest and currency risks associated with underlying 
business activities and the financing of those activities. Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair 
value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates. The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by 
discounting all future cash flows by the applicable market yield curves at the balance sheet date. Cash flow hedges mitigate 
exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability or a forecast transaction. Fair value hedges mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset  
or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the 
hedging relationship, it meets the Group’s risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected 
to be highly effective.
The portion of any gains or losses on cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined 
to be effective, is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income. The gains or losses relating to the 
ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The change in fair value of derivatives designated as part of a fair value hedge, is recognised in the income statement in 
finance costs. The change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, that is attributable to the hedged risk, is also 
recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time 
the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included 
in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow 
hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in 
which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement. When  
a fair value hedge item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any directly associated issue costs. 
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and 
the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported as assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported as revenues and 
expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates. In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements 
and estimates which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Key accounting judgements
Residual values and asset lives
The residual value is the net realisable value of an asset at the end of its useful economic life. The Group has taken an 
assessment of the residual values that are appropriate for the business and reviews this assessment annually. Note 13 
provides details of the value of fixed assets capitalised.
Intangible asset capitalisation – IT software and technology assets
The amount capitalised includes the total cost of any external products or services as well as any internal costs directly 
attributable to the development of the assets. Management judgement is involved in determining whether projects 
meet the criteria for capitalisation. Note 12 provides details of the value of IT software capitalised.
Non-underlying items
During the year certain items are identified and separately disclosed as non-underlying. Judgement is applied as to 
whether the item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed earlier in this note. Note 6 provides 
information on all of the items disclosed as non-underlying in the current year financial statements.
Areas of estimation uncertainty
Impairment
An impairment test of tangible and intangible assets is undertaken each year using both an EBITDA multiple and  
a discounted cash flow approach. Note 14 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity 
to changes in key assumptions.
Consolidated accounts 2016/17   Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 122
Consolidated accounts
2 Accounting policies continued
Asset lives
Asset lives are based upon management’s estimation at the point of capitalisation. Periodically these are reviewed to ensure 
that the estimated lives of the assets remain appropriate and if not the assets are re-lifed prospectively. Notes 12 and 13 
provide details on the depreciation and amortisation booked.
Defined benefit pension
Defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit credit method. 
Note 29 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Restructuring provisions
Restructuring costs are provided for using the best information available to management at the balance sheet date. 
This includes estimates of future costs and judgements on the likely outcome/timing of restructuring activities. Note 21 
provides details of the value of the provisions carried.
Taxation
The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of 
certain items, where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax 
authority. The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material income statement and/or cash flow variances.
Corporation tax is calculated on the basis of income before taxation, taking into account the relevant local tax rates and 
regulations. For each operating entity, the current income tax expense is calculated and differences between the accounting 
and tax base are determined, resulting in deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Assumptions are made around the tax net book value of assets to which capital allowances apply, the level of capital 
allowances, the extent of rollover gains, indexation thereon and the tax base into which they have been rolled.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses 
and these affect the income tax calculation. Provisions may be made for uncertain exposures or recoveries, which can have 
an impact on both deferred and current tax.
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses, pension deficits and unused tax credits 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused 
tax credits can be utilised.
Details of the carrying value of corporation and deferred tax can be found in Note 9.
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) not effective for the current year and not 
early adopted by the Group
The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, subject 
to EU ratification, become effective after the current year-end and have not been early adopted by the Group:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. IFRS 9 covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, 
together with a new hedge accounting model and a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment. The new 
standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption. The Group 
has undertaken an initial impact assessment which indicates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact 
on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014. The new standard provides a single, five-step 
revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised 
when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. It replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under 
current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption. The 
Group has undertaken an initial impact assessment which indicates that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have a material 
impact on its consolidated result and financial position, but is likely to result in additional disclosure requirements.
IFRS 16 Leases
The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring 
lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has 
a low value. It replaces the existing leasing Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations and becomes effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU adoption. The Group has determined that the application 
of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial result and financial position. This includes recognition  
of interest and amortisation expense in place of fixed rental expense in the income statement and the recognition of right 
of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating lease portfolio on the balance sheet. There is no net cash flow impact  
on application of IFRS 16. The Group is currently undertaking a detailed assessment to determine the full impact of IFRS 16 
on its consolidated results and financial position.

IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative – Amendment to IAS 7
The IASB issued the amendment in January 2016. The improvements to disclosure relate to the statement of cash flows 
and require companies to provide information about changes in their financing liabilities. This amendment is a response to 
requests from investors for information that helps them better understand changes in a company’s debt. The amendment 
will help investors to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes from cash flows 
and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses) and becomes effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2017, subject to EU adoption. The Group has determined that the impact of IAS 7 will be limited 
to disclosure and will have no impact on its consolidated result and financial position.
Whilst the following standards and interpretations are relevant to the Group, they have been assessed as having minimal 
or no financial impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time

4 Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units (Premier Inn & Restaurants and Costa) 
based upon their different products and services:
• Premier Inn & Restaurants provide services in relation to accommodation and food; and
• Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee outlets.
The UK and International Premier Inn & Restaurants segments have been aggregated on the grounds that the 
International segment is immaterial.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions 
about allocating resources and assessing performance. Segment performance is measured based on underlying operating 
profit. Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are the costs of running the public 
company. The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances (held and controlled by the central treasury 
function), taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment, centrally held provisions and central working  
capital balances. 
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the Premier Inn & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation. 
Transactions were entered into on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding business 
operating segments for the years ended 2 March 2017 and 3 March 2016.

6 Non-underlying items
As set out in the policy in Note 2, we use a range of measures to monitor the financial performance of the Group. These 
measures include both statutory measures in accordance with IFRS and APMs which are consistent with the way that  
the business performance is measured internally. We report underlying measures because we believe they provide both 
management and investors with useful additional information about the financial performance of the Group’s businesses. 
Underlying measures of profitability represent the equivalent IFRS measures adjusted for specific items that we consider 
hinder the comparison of the financial performance of the Group’s businesses either from one period to another or with 
other similar businesses.
Previously this note was reported as exceptional items and non-underlying adjustments. The definition and policy has been 
simplified in 2016/17 to refer to non-underlying items only. There has been no change in definition or metric and therefore 
presentation is reflected in the comparative disclosure without any restatement of values.

1 During the year, the Group made a net gain on asset disposals of £26.0m through three sale and leaseback transactions. The balance relates to changes 
in onerous contract provisions in the UK of £2.4m, Poland release of £(0.4)m and Singapore of £2.9m and minor disposals in the year of £1.8m.
2 On 13 July 2016, the Group announced its intention to exit hotel operations in South East Asia. This has resulted in the recognition of impairment losses 
on assets of £11.0m, investment in joint ventures of £0.9m and goodwill of £3.0m as well as the recognition of a restructuring provision of £15.1m for costs 
of exiting management agreements and closure of regional offices.
3 During the year, Costa has undertaken a strategic review of its international operations. This has led to the decision to exit its French equity business and to 
restructure its Chinese operations. In France this has resulted in the recognition of impairment losses of £1.5m, store closure costs of £0.8m and restructuring 
costs of £6.8m (including a restructuring provision of £6.6m for redundancy and lease exit costs). In China the review has led to impairment losses of £3.2m, 
store closure costs of £1.6m and onerous lease provisions of £0.6m. The restructure is ongoing and there are expected to be further closure costs in the next 
financial year. The share attributable to the parent shareholders is £2.7m.
4 During the year, the Group undertook significant operational reorganisation of support centre operations. This restructuring has resulted in costs of £12.4m, 
including staff redundancy and consultation costs, asset impairments of £2.9m as well as the recognition of a restructuring provision of £6.3m covering staff 
redundancy and consultation costs.
5 During the year, the Group received a refund on settlement of a historic VAT claim.
6 During the year, the Group disposed of its investment in Morrison Street Hotel Limited resulting in a net gain of £11.8m.
7 Following a review of IT software and technology assets during the prior year, additional amortisation of £10.1m was recognised in the income statement 
in respect of systems for which there was no future economic benefit.
8 Net impairment losses arising on sites which are to be closed or are underperforming. Further details are provided in Note 14.
9 The finance cost arising from the unwinding of the discount rate within provisions is included in non-underlying finance costs, reflecting the non-underlying 
nature of the provisions created.

The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against 
future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose. The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability 
of these losses and does not think it is appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax asset. If the Group were to 
recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by £16.5m (2016: £10.7m), of which, the share 
attributable to the parent shareholders is £13.9m (2016: £8.9m).
At 2 March 2017, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2016: £nil) for taxes that would be payable on any unremitted 
earnings, as all such amounts are permanently reinvested or, where they are not, there are no corporation tax consequences 
of such companies paying dividends to parent companies.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to £1.8m (2016: £2.0m).
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years
The Finance (No 2) Act 2015 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 
2020. The effect of these rates was included in the financial statements in 2015/16. The Finance Act 2016 further reduced the 
main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. The effect of the new rate is a reduction of the deferred 
tax liability by a net of £2.7m comprising a credit of £5.2m to the income statement, a charge of £3.2m to the statement of 
consolidated income and a reserves movement of £0.7m. The rate changes will also impact the amount of the future cash tax 
payments to be made by the Group.

10 Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share (EPS) figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders, therefore before non-controlling interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue  
during the year after deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership 
trust (ESOT).
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted 
average number of options outstanding during the year. Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option 
price, the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation. The number of such options was nil (2016: nil).
The numbers of shares used for the earnings per share calculations are as follows:
2016/17
million
2015/16
million
Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 182.2 181.4
Effect of dilution – share options 0.4 1.4
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 182.6 182.8
The total number of shares in issue at the year-end, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of 
ordinary shares, was 195.4m, less 12.1m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 1.0m held by the ESOT (2016: 195.2m, less 
12.6m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.9m held by the ESOT).

Premier Inn & Restaurants 110.4 113.4

Total 177.1 180.0
The carrying amount of goodwill at 2 March 2017 comprised £110.4m for Premier Inn & Restaurants and £66.7m for Costa. 
The Premier Inn & Restaurants CGU and the Costa CGU are also operating segments and represent the lowest level 
within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The customer relationships asset arose with the acquisition of Coffee Nation in a previous financial year. It is being 
amortised over a period of 15 years.
IT software and technology assets have been assessed as having finite lives and are amortised under the straight-line 
method over periods ranging from three to six years from the date the asset became fully operational.
Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and territory fees, reacquired franchise rights, Costa Express 
operating rights agreements and development costs.
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of £1.6m (2016: £1.6m), are deemed to have indefinite lives as there is 
no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to contribute to the Group’s net cash inflow. The operating 
rights agreements are being amortised over ten years and have a carrying value of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m). Development costs 
have a carrying value of £1.9m (2016: £2.6m) and are being amortised over six years. The reacquired franchise right arose 
from the acquisition of Life Coffee Cafes Limited in 2014/15 and is being amortised over five years and has a carrying value of 
£5.2m (2016: £7.2m). The balance of £0.4m (2016: £0.4m) relates to territory fees which are being amortised over 20 years.
Capital expenditure commitments
Capital expenditure commitments in relation to intangible assets at the year-end amounted to £8.2m (2016: £10.9m).

In addition to the capital expenditure commitments disclosed above, the Group has also signed agreements with certain 
third parties to develop new trading outlets within the Premier Inn & Restaurants strategic business unit as part of its 
pipeline. These developments are dependent upon the outcome of future events, such as the granting of planning 
permission, and consequently, do not represent a binding capital commitment at the year-end. The directors consider 
that developments likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of £670.0m over the next five years 
(2016: £500.0m).
Capitalised interest
Interest capitalised during the year amounted to £8.9m, using an average rate of 3.6% (2015/16: £10.0m, using an average 
rate of 3.9%).
Assets held for sale
During the year, seven property assets with a combined net book value of £5.7m (2015/16: £nil) were transferred to assets 
held for sale. Eight sites with a net book value of £6.0m (2016: one site with a net book value of £0.3m) continued to be 
classified as held for sale at the year-end. No sites were sold during the year (2016: two) and an impairment loss of £nil 
(2016: £nil) was recognised in the year. In addition, as a result of the decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East

Property, plant and equipment
The Group considers each trading site to be a CGU and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. 
Where indicators of impairment are identified an impairment assessment is undertaken.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value, less costs of disposal and its value in use. In the absence of any 
information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 7.0% in the 
UK (2015/16: 8.1%), 7.1% in France (2015/16: 8.1%), 7.2% in China (2015/16: 8.4%), 6.5% in Singapore (2015/16: 7.5%) and 7.5% 
in Poland (2015/16: 8.8%). The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five-year 
period. These business plans and forecasts include management’s most recent view of medium-term trading prospects. 
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using long-term growth rates for the relevant country, ranging from 2.0% 
to 3.5% with the UK, the most significant country, being 2.0% (2015/16: 2.0%).
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of £28.1m are set out below:
Premier Inn & Restaurants
As a result of the decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East Asia, impairment losses of £10.2m have been 
recorded to bring asset values in line with realisable values.
As part of the UK operational restructure seven restaurant sites were converted to Brewers Fayre leading to an impairment 
of £2.9m. In addition, seven restaurant sites were transferred to assets held for sale resulting in an impairment of £3.9m. 
The remaining £1.6m impairment arose on sites which are to be closed or are underperforming.

Costa
The Costa international restructuring has resulted in impairment losses of £1.5m in France and £3.2m in China. The remaining 
impairment charge includes £2.8m in the UK, £0.9m in Singapore and £1.1m in Poland, where stores are to be closed or are 
underperforming.
Impairment reversals
Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously 
impaired sites, reversals of £2.8m have been recognised, £2.6m in Premier Inn & Restaurants and £0.2m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the 
discount rates applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to 
the growth rates used in the five-year business plans and in the pre-tax discount rates would be an incremental impairment 
charge of:

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the 
level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In the absence of a recent market 
transaction, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations. The future cash flows are based on 
assumptions from the business plans and cover a five-year period. These business plans and forecasts include management’s 
most recent view of medium-term trading prospects. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth 
rate (2015/16: 2.0%). The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.0% (2015/16: 8.1%).
The resultant impairment review required £3.0m impairment of goodwill allocated to the Premier Inn & Restaurants CGU 
(2015/16: £nil) as a result of the decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East Asia. No impairment was required 
for goodwill allocated to the Costa CGU (2015/16: £nil).
Intangible assets
The decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East Asia resulted in an impairment of intangible assets of £0.8m 
(2015/16: £nil).

Short-term borrowings
Short-term borrowings are typically overnight borrowings, repayable on demand. Interest rates are variable and linked 
to LIBOR.
Revolving credit facility (£950m)
The committed revolving credit facility (RCF) terms give a total available committed credit of £950m which runs until 
September 2020 with options over two one-year extensions, subject to agreement by the banking partners, that will 
potentially extend the maturity to September 2022. In November 2016, the first extension option was activated, extending 
the loan maturity date to September 2021. Loans have variable interest rates linked to LIBOR. The facility is multi-currency.

The Group entered into a number of cross-currency swap agreements in relation to the loan notes to eliminate any foreign 
exchange risk on interest rates or on the repayment of the principal borrowed. These swaps expire in line with the loan notes 
and are discussed in Note 23.
On 1 March 2017 the Group entered into agreements securing funding of £200.0m from new private placement loan notes 
which will be drawn down in two tranches of £100.0m on 16 May 2017 and 16 August 2017. The funds have a maturity of 
16 August 2027 and a coupon of between 2.54% and 2.63%.
Senior unsecured bonds
The Group issued £450.0m 2025 bonds with a coupon of 3.375% on 28 May 2015.

The maturity analysis is grouped by when the debt is contracted to mature rather than by repricing dates, as allowed under IFRS.
There are £50.0m of swaps (2016: £50.0m) with maturities beyond the life of the current RCF (2021), which are in place to 
hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold.
The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings is denominated in sterling and US dollars.
At 2 March 2017, the Group had available £880.0m (2016: £800.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect 
of revolving credit facilities on which all conditions precedent had been met.

Restructuring
Restructuring provisions have been recognised as a result of the Group’s decision to exit certain markets and restructure 
its operations.
On 13 July 2016, the Group announced its intention to exit hotel operations in South East Asia. This resulted in the recognition 
of a restructuring provision of £15.1m for costs of exiting management agreements and closure of regional offices.
The Group has also recognised restructuring provisions of £12.9m resulting from decisions to exit the Costa equity market 
in France and the reorganisation of support centre operations. The restructuring provisions are expected to be used within 
one year.
Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions relate primarily to property reversions. Provision is made for rent and other property related 
costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible. Where the property is deemed likely to be 
assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by 
both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the estimated cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% (2016: 3.74%) based on an approximation for the 
time value of money.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variation. The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both 
internal and external property experts to determine the provision held. Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period 
of up to 18 years.
Other
Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses. These are expected to be used within one year.

22 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, senior 
unsecured bonds, cash, short-term deposits, trade receivables and trade payables. The Group’s financial instrument policies 
can be found in the accounting policies in Note 2. The Board agrees policies for managing the financial risks summarised below:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations. 
Interest rate swaps are used where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk, in 
line with the Group treasury policy. Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, cross-currency 
swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only. At the year-end, £761.2m (90.3%) of Group debt was fixed 
for an average of 6.29 years at an average interest rate of 4.0% (2016: £776.2m (88.9%) for 7.29 years at 4.1%).
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by 
changes in interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio 
of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 2 March 2017 and 3 March 2016 
respectively. Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then 
ended. The following assumptions were made:
• balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt 
and deposits does not change as interest rates move;
• gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2; and
• cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Group’s net debt position at the year-end, a 1% pt change in interest rates would affect the Group’s profit 
before tax by approximately £0.8m (2015/16: £1.0m), and equity by approximately £7.3m (2016: £13.1m).
Liquidity risk
In its funding strategy, the Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility 
through the use of overdrafts and bank loans. This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to 
avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit where maturity is fixed at no more than 
three months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 2 March 2017 and 3 March 2016

22 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. This is 
minimised by dealing with counterparties with good credit ratings. The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and any known 
factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required. The Group’s maximum exposure on its 
trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 17.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, 
the Group’s exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of 
these instruments. The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading 
investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Group’s banks get into financial difficulty, the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of 
currently undrawn committed facilities. This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group. Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan 
notes, these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk. Sensitivity analysis has therefore 
not been carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities 
as and when they are required.
Capital management
The Group’s primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern 
and has sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders. The Group seeks to maintain  
a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants. See pages 54 to 57 of this 
report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Group’s credit facilities 
and financing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets. 
The management of equity through share buy-backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework 
balanced against the funding requirements of future growth. In addition, the Group may carry out a number of sale and 
leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Group’s financing is subject to financial covenants. These covenants relate to measurement of EBITDA against 
consolidated net finance charges (interest cover) and total net debt (leverage ratio, on a not-adjusted-for pension and 
property lease basis). The Group has complied with all of these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes. 
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Group’s dividend policy and funding strategy.
23 Financial instruments
Fair values
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 24 are 
considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the 
balance sheet date using level 2 techniques.
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source 
of inputs used to derive the fair value. The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2
Other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
Level 3
Techniques which use inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, that are not based on observable 
market data.

Hedges
Cash flow hedges
At 2 March 2017, the Group has interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of £50.0m (2016: £100.0m) whereby 
it receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 
5.190% (2016: 5.145% and 5.372%). These swaps have maturities beyond the current life of the revolving credit facility (2021) 
and are in place to hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold. The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure 
to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt. The Group also has cross-currency swaps in place whereby it 
receives a fixed interest rate of between 3.92% and 4.86% (2016: 3.92% and 4.86%) on a notional amount of US$250.0m 
(2016: US$250.0m) and pays an average of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of £158.2m (2016: 4.72% on £158.2m).
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 2 March 2017 and a net unrealised gain of £0.2m (2015/16: net 
unrealised loss of £6.5m) has been recorded in other comprehensive income. The ineffectiveness recorded within finance 
costs in the income statement for 2016/17 was nil (2015/16, a debit of £1.0k).
Fair value hedges
At 2 March 2017, the Group has cross-currency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% (2016: 5.23%) 
on a notional amount of US$75.0m (2016: US$75.0m) and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% (2016: 1.715% and 
1.755%) over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of £50.1m (2016: £50.1m).
The fair value hedges were also assessed to be highly effective at 2 March 2017. An increase in the fair value of the interest 
rate swap of £6.5m (2016: an increase of £5.4m) offset by a loss in the fair value of the hedged items of £6.6m (2016: loss 
of £5.2m) led to a debit of £0.1m recorded within finance costs in the income statement (2016: a credit of £0.2m in finance 
revenue in the income statement).
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown 
in Note 22.

26 Reserves
Share premium
The share premium reserve is the premium paid on the Company’s 76.80p ordinary shares. The issue of shares in lieu 
of cash dividends was treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share 
premium account.
Capital redemption reserve
A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Group’s B and C preference shares (Note 25) and also 
includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings
In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under UK law.
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
consolidated financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.

Hedging reserve
This hedging reserve records movements for effective cash flow hedges measured at fair value.
27 Commitments and contingencies
Operating lease commitments
The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Premier Inn & Restaurants and Costa businesses. The leases 
are non-cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases various 
plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a 
factor that changes other than with the passage of time (e.g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price 
indices or future market rates of interest).
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases, on an undiscounted basis, are as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Due within one year 247.0 214.5
Due after one year but not more than five years 850.8 724.6
Due after five years but not more than ten years 742.0 675.4
Due after ten years 1,298.9 1,282.2
3,138.7 2,896.7
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes £13.7m in relation 
to privity contracts (2015/16: £40.5m). Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the 
onerous contracts provision (Note 21). Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce 
this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 11.7 years 
(2016: 12.3 years).
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties. The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received 
under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 2 March 2017 are £25.8m (2016: £49.5m) of which £14.5m (2016: £36.6m) 
relates to privity contracts.
Contingent liabilities
There are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in the year ended 2 March 2017 (2016: £nil).

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group. Vesting of all shares under the scheme will depend 
on continued employment and meeting earnings per share (EPS) and return on capital employed (ROCE) performance 
targets over a three-year period (the vesting period). Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen 
in the remuneration report on pages 78 to 98. The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows:
2017

Outstanding at the end of the year 623,643 685,426
Exercisable at the end of the year 26,855 9,963
Deferred equity awards
Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004/05. The awards are 
not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date. 
If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally 
three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason 
considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full. If employment ceases for 
any other reason, the proportion of awards which vest depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date 
that employment ceased. If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the awards vest, between 
the first and second anniversary, 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary, 50% vests.

The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, 
in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employee share ownership trust (ESOT)
The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP. The ESOT held 1.0m shares at 2 March 2017 
(2016: 0.9m). All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a contracted-in defined contribution scheme under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund. 
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested, trustee-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution scheme, and 
thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the scheme. The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined 
contribution scheme in the year was £8.6m (2015/16: £8.1m).
At the year-end, 30,344 employees (2016: 29,307) were active members of the scheme, which also had 11,772 deferred 
members (2016: 6,181).
Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit (final salary) section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, 
was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009. The Whitbread Group 
Pension Fund is set up under UK trust law, registered with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and regulated by the 
Pensions Regulator. The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is governed by a corporate trustee which operates the scheme 
in accordance with the requirements of UK pensions legislation.
At the year-end the scheme had no active members (2016: nil), 21,942 deferred pensioners (2016: 22,792) and 16,581 
pensions in payment (2016: 16,647).
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The IAS 19 pension cost 
relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice 
from, and calculations provided by, Lane Clark & Peacock, using the projected unit credit method. The present value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high 
quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. As the scheme is closed to future accrual, there  
is no future service cost.
Under the governing documentation of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be 
returnable to Whitbread PLC by a reduction in future contributions. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect 
of IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 18.0 years 
(2016: 16.5 years).

Funding
Expected contributions to be made in the next reporting period total £92.6m (2016: £82.1m). In 2016/17, contributions were 
£88.1m with £78.2m from the employer, £9.1m from Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) and £0.8m of benefits settled 
by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme (2015/16: £82.0m, with £73.0m from the employer, £8.9m from Moorgate SLP 
and £0.1m of benefits settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme). In addition, Whitbread paid £2.2m (2015/16: 
£2.3m) of investment manager expenses.
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the 
Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2014. A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the 
scheme remains in deficit, have been agreed with the Trustee. The Group made payments of £75.0m in 2016/17 and will 
make the following payments to the Fund: £80.0m in 2017/18; £80.0m in 2018/19; £80.0m in 2019/20; £80.0m in 2020/21; 
£80.0m in 2021/22 and £2.6m in 2022/23. For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the 
Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding 
recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower. Until the next valuation, the Trustee has also been given a promise 
of accelerated payments of up to £5.0m per annum where increases in ordinary dividends exceed RPI and the right  
to consultation before any special distributions can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the 
income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate SLP, which was established by the Group 
in the year ended 4 March 2010 (the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid). The 
partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership (SP), which was also established 
by the Group during 2009/10. Property assets with a market value of £221.0m have been transferred from other Group 
companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited. The Group retains 
control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties. However, the Trustee has first charge 
over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of £228.0m. The Group retains control over 
both partnerships and, as such, they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership 
over the next eight years. At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, 
depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up  
to a value of £150.0m (2016: £150.0m).
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan 
asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the pension deficit position in these consolidated 
financial statements does not reflect the £190.2m (2016: £165.8m) investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
During the year ended 28 February 2013, the Group entered into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited over 
properties with a market value totalling £180.0m at that date. The charge was to secure the obligations of the Group to make 
payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit. This, together with the properties secured 
as a consequence of the arrangement surrounding the partnerships, secures properties totalling £408.0m in favour of the 
Pension Scheme.
Risks
Through its defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to the IAS 19 deficit, the most 
significant of which are detailed below:
Risk Description
Principal impact on assets  
and obligation reconciliations
Market volatility The defined benefit obligation is linked to AA-rated corporate bonds 
whilst scheme assets are invested in equities, gilts, bonds, property 
and cash. This exposes the Group to risks including those relating 
to interest rates, equity markets, property markets and foreign 
exchange. Changing market conditions, in conjunction with discount 
rate fluctuations, will lead to volatility in the Group’s net pension 
liability on the balance sheet, pension expense in the income 
statement and re-measurement movements in other 
comprehensive income.
Return on plan assets
Inflationary risk Due to the link between the scheme obligation and inflation, 
an increased rate of inflation will lead to higher scheme liabilities.
Actuarial movements in 
financial assumptions
Accounting 
assumptions
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by projecting the 
future cash flows of the scheme for many years into the future. 
Consequently, the assumptions used can have a significant impact 
on the balance sheet position and income statement charge. 
In practice, future Scheme experience may not be in line with 
the assumptions adopted. For example, an increase in the life 
expectancy of members would increase scheme liabilities.
Discount rate: interest income on 
scheme assets and cost on liabilities
Mortality: actuarial movements 
in demographic assumptions

The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as 
at 31 March 2014 of the UK scheme to 2 March 2017 for IAS 19 purposes were:
At  
2 March  
2017
%
At  
3 March  
2016
%
Pre-April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.10 2.80
Post-April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.10 2.00
Pension increases in deferment 3.10 2.80
Discount rate 2.60 3.70
Inflation assumption 3.20 2.90
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The 
assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.3 years (2016: 21.3 years) if they are 
male and for a further 24.5 years (2016: 24.4 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2036 at age 65, the 
assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.8 years (2016: 22.8 years) after retirement if they are male 
and for a further 26.0 years (2016: 25.9 years) after retirement if they are female.

During the year, the accounting deficit increased from £288.1m at 3 March 2016 to £425.1m at 2 March 2017. The principal 
reasons for this deterioration were a decrease in the discount rate and an increase in expected future inflation.

The assumptions in relation to discount rate, mortality and inflation have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme 
liabilities. The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions:
(Increase)/decrease  
in liability
2017
£m
2016
£m
Discount rate
0.25% increase to discount rate 125.0 88.0
0.25% decrease to discount rate (134.0) (94.0)
Inflation
0.25% increase to inflation rate (97.0) (69.0)
0.25% decrease to inflation rate 94.0 66.0
Life expectancy
Additional one-year increase to life expectancy (95.0) (75.0)
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity 
of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (projected unit credit method) has 
been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet. The methods and types of 
assumptions did not change.

At 2 March 2017
1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 2 March 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 24 April 2017. The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 2 March 2017 (prior financial year: 53 weeks 
to 3 March 2016).
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK Accounting 
Standards. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting 
Requirements’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly, in the year ended 3 March 2016, the 
Company underwent transition from reporting under UK GAAP to FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. The financial 
statements are therefore prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in 
relation to share-based payments, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, presentation 
of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, 
impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. The carrying value of investments are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Shareholder FAQs
Where can I find information 
about B and C shares?
As outlined in the original circulars, 
the Company made two separate 
purchase offers for the B and C shares. 
There will be no further purchase offers. 
The Company does have the right to 
convert the B and C shares to ordinary 
shares, but there is no current intention to 
do so. The B and C shares will continue 
to attract an annual dividend payment.
How can I find the current 
share prices?
You can keep up to date with the 
current share price at the Company’s 
website www.whitbread.co.uk.
I have lost my share certificate, 
how can I get a replacement?
If you have lost your certificate please 
contact the Company’s registrars, 
Capital Asset Services, on the 
shareholder helpline +44 (0)344 855 
2327. They will be able to assist you in 
arranging a replacement.
Am I entitled to shareholder benefits?
Shareholders with a holding of 64 
shares or more are eligible to receive 
a shareholder benefits card. Those 
shareholders who registered to receive 
offers in 2016 should automatically 
have received the card with the Annual 
Report mailing. Shareholders who 
wish to register for a card can do so 
by contacting Capita, whose contact 
details are shown on page 172.

the use, by outside organisations, of 
information obtained from Whitbread’s

the organisation concerned pays the 
appropriate statutory fee.

Warning to shareholders – 
boiler room scams
In recent years, many companies have 
become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from 
overseas based ‘brokers’ who target 
UK shareholders, offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless 
or high risk shares in US or UK 
investments. There operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent 
and extremely persuasive. The Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) has found 
that the average amount lost by 
investors is around £20,000, with 
around £200m lost in the UK each year. 
Even seasoned investors have been 
caught out, with the biggest individual 
loss recorded by the police being 
£6 million.
It is not just the novice investor that 
has been duped in this way; many 
of the victims had been successfully 
investing for several years. Shareholders 
are advised to be wary of unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a 
discount or offers of free company 
reports. If you receive any unsolicited 
investment advice:
• make sure you get the correct name 
of the person or organisation;
• check that they are properly 
authorised by the FCA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fca.org.uk/
firms/financial-services-register and 
contact the firm using the details on 
the register;
• report the matter to the FCA either 
by calling 0800 111 6768 or visit  
scamsmart.fca.org.uk;
• if the calls persist, hang up; and
• REMEMBER if it sounds too good 
to be true it probably is!
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, 
you will not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things 
go wrong. The FCA can be contacted 
by completing an online form at  
www.fca.org.uk/scams or you can 
call the FCA Consumer Helpline on  
0800 111 6768 or Action Fraud  
0300 123 2040.
Details of any share dealing facilities 
that the Company endorses will be 
included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or 
similar activity can be found on the
