We	 have	 expanded	 beyond	 our	 core	 business	
of	 brokering	 chartered	 flights	 for	 private	 and	
commercial	 jets	 and	 freight.	 We	 have	 incorporated	
aircraft	 remarketing	 and	 safety	 consultancy	 and	
training	 through	 our	 acquisitions	 of	 Cabot	 Aviation	
and	 Baines	 Simmons,	 and	 have	 recently	 added	 the	
dynamic	 skills	 of	 Clockwork	 Research	 with	 its	
innovative	 approach	 to	 fatigue	 management.	 The	
Group	 remains	 committed	 to	 expanding	 the	 range	
of	 services	 we	 offer	 to	 our	 customers	 as	 we	 aim	
to	 fulfil	 our	 long-term	 aims.	 Alongside	 this,	 we	 are	
reconfiguring	 and	 reinvigorating	 our	 brand	 as	
well	 as	 investing	 in	 our	 infrastructure	 to	 facilitate	
this	 change.
At	 the	 heart	 of	 this	 are	 people:	 our	 customers	
and	 our	 staff.	 We	 continue	 to	 attract	 and	 retain	
the	 best	 people	 –	 those	 capable	 of,	 and	 dedicated	
to,	 providing	 our	 customers	 with	 the	 highest	 levels	
of	 knowledge,	 expertise	 and	 customer	 service.	
This	 creates	 value	 both	 for	 our	 shareholders	
and	 our	 stakeholders	 and	 gives	 purpose	 and	
distinctiveness	 to	 our	 brand.	
Moving	 into	 2017	 and	 beyond,	 we	 are	 creating	 the	
platforms	 and	 the	 infrastructure	 that	 are	 leading	
the	 Group	 steadily	 towards	 greater	 visibility,	
higher	 earnings	 capacity	 and	 the	 ability	 to	 create	
long-term	 value.
Air	 Partner	 is	 on	 a	 journey:	 	
an	 exciting	 journey	 of

Overview
Transforming the skies
Seldom,	 since	 our	 foundation	 in	 1961,	 has	 there	 been	 a	 year	
with	 more	 political	 upheaval	 and	 ensuing	 economic	 uncertainty	
than	 2016.	 But	 the	 skies	 are	 increasingly	 busy,	 and	 our	 balance	
of	 services	 means	 we	 have	 much	 to	 offer.
2016	 certainly	 qualifies	 for	 the	 description	 ‘interesting	 times’.	
The	 challenges	 we	 have	 all	 faced	 this	 year	 are	 sufficiently	 well	
known	 not	 to	 have	 to	 itemise	 them	 here.	 Yet	 the	 Group	 has	
steadfastly	 progressed	 in	 such	 ‘interesting	 times’	 and	 is	 set	
to	 continue	 to	 do	 so.	
Air	 Partner,	 with	 our	 balance	 of	 aircraft	 charter	 and	 consulting	
and	 training	 services,	 is	 in	 many	 ways	 configured	 to	 counter	
the	 ups	 and	 downs	 of	 world	 events.	 Economic	 uncertainty	 may	
pose	 challenges	 to	 our	 standard	 broking	 business,	 but	 we	
can	 balance	 that	 by	 meeting	 out-of-the-ordinary	 commercial	
requirements,	 helping	 support	 disaster	 relief	 and,	 of	 course,	
offering	 the	 safety	 management	 services	 without	 which	
aeroplanes	 could	 not	 fly.	 Our	 focus	 on	 offering	 customers	
a	 range	 of	 services,	 all	 over	 the	 world,	 is	 helping	 ensure	 that	
in	 good	 times	 and	 bad,	 Air	 Partner	 is	 in	 demand.

Overview
Chairman’s statement
The	 Group	 has	 a	 clear	 long-term	 strategy	 to	 become	 a	 world-class	 global	
aviation	 services	 group.	 Great	 progress	 has	 been	 made	 since	 we	 began	 this	
transformation	 in	 2014,	 and	 the	 period	 under	 review	 has	 been	 no	 exception.	
Indeed,	 it	 has	 perhaps	 been	 the	 most	 active	 and	 successful	 period	 we	 have	
experienced	 during	 my	 12	 years	 at	 Air	 Partner.
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 report	 a	 strong	 performance	 for	 the	 year	
ended	 31	 January	 2017.	 Gross	 profit	 rose	 by	 16.3%	 to	 £31.7m,	
underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 increased	 by	 17.2%	 to	 £5.1m	
and	 reported	 profit	 before	 tax	 by	 38.6%	 to	 £4.3m.
As	 I	 have	 mentioned	 in	 prior	 reports,	 in	 2014	 we	 took	
a	 thoughtful	 and	 critical	 look	 at	 our	 industry	 to	 evaluate	
not	 only	 our	 own	 market	 position,	 but	 the	 challenges	 and	
opportunities	 that	 lie	 ahead.	 As	 part	 of	 that	 process,	 we	
undertook	 an	 extensive	 programme	 of	 engagement	 with	 our	
staff	 and	 customers	 to	 understand	 not	 only	 their	 needs,	 but	
their	 expectations	 of	 us.	 No	 stone	 was	 left	 unturned	 and	 we	
looked	 far	 into	 the	 future	 to	 assess	 what	 we	 wanted	 to	 be,	
where	 we	 wanted	 to	 be,	 and	 just	 as	 importantly,	 where	 we	
did	 not	 want	 to	 be.	
We	 formed	 a	 long-term	 strategy	 that	 places	 the	 customer	
first	 and	 has	 the	 power	 to	 transform	 our	 business	 model,	
reducing	 volatility	 and	 improving	 the	 overall	 quality	 of	 our	
earnings.	 This	 year,	 the	 results	 of	 this	 long-term	 strategy	 are	
beginning	 to	 emerge.
Maintaining a progressive dividend
We	 are	 proposing	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 3.6p,	 taking	 the	 full	
year	 dividend	 to	 5.2p,	 an	 increase	 of	 7.2%	 and	 equivalent	 to	
1.3	 times	 dividend	 cover.	 Our	 policy	 is	 to	 target	 cover	 between	
1.5	 and	 2.0	 times	 underlying	 earnings	 per	 share.	 Cover	 this	
year	 is	 below	 that	 range,	 due	 to	 a	 £0.4m	 prior	 year,	 one-off	
adjustment	 for	 tax.	 Subject	 to	 approval	 at	 the	 AGM	 on	 28	 June	
2017,	 we	 expect	 to	 pay	 the	 final	 dividend	 on	 5	 July	 to	 those	
shareholders	 on	 the	 register	 at	 close	 of	 business	 on	 9	 June.	
Board changes
During	 the	 period,	 we	 completed	 the	 alignment	 of	 our	 Board	
to	 reflect	 the	 direction	 of	 our	 long-term	 strategy.	 Accordingly,	 we	
welcomed	 Amanda	 Wills	 CBE,	 Shaun	 Smith	 and	 Richard	 Jackson	
to	 the	 Board,	 effective	 20	 April,	 1	 May	 and	 8	 September	 2016	
respectively.	 Having	 overseen	 these	 changes,	 we	 announced	 on	
2	 February	 2017	 that	 I	 would	 be	 standing	 down	 as	 Chairman	 at	
the	 next	 AGM	 on	 28	 June	 2017	 after	 12	 years	 as	 a	 non-executive	
director.	 I	 am	 delighted	 that,	 following	 a	 formal	 selection	 process,	
Peter	 Saunders,	 our	 current	 Senior	 Independent	 Director,	 will	
replace	 me	 as	 Chairman	 effective	 from	 that	 date,	 subject	 to	 his	
re-election	 at	 the	 AGM.	 Peter	 has	 played	 an	 important	 role	 in	
our	 transformation	 and	 I	 trust	 will	 continue	 to	 both	 support	
and	 challenge	 the	 Executive	 team	 in	 the	 years	 ahead.
Thank you
Air	 Partner	 is	 a	 unique	 company.	 Our	 plc	 status	 is	 a	 key	
strength:	 it	 offers	 customers,	 employees	 and	 shareholders	 –	
indeed,	 all	 our	 stakeholders	 –	 reassurance	 that	 we	 operate	
to	 the	 highest	 standards	 of	 governance	 and	 ethics,	 and	 are	
transparent	 in	 all	 our	 finances	 and	 business	 dealings.	 Over	
the	 past	 five	 years	 since	 I	 became	 Chairman,	 it	 has	 been	 my	
privilege	 to	 witness	 the	 development	 of	 Air	 Partner	 from	
a	 pure	 broking	 business,	 to	 the	 vibrant,	 diverse	 aviation	
services	 company	 it	 is	 today.	 People	 are	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 our	
business,	 and	 it	 remains	 for	 me	 to	 thank	 my	 colleagues	 on	
the	 Board	 and	 across	 the	 whole	 Group	 for	 their	 support	 and	
hard	 work,	 not	 only	 in	 delivering	 a	 great	 set	 of	 results	 for	 our	
shareholders	 this	 year,	 but	 also	 in	 creating	 a	 strong	 platform	
for	 growth.	 I	 wish	 you	 all	 every	 success	 into	 2017	 and	 beyond.

Explaining our business
Market overview
We	 have	 been	 in	 aviation	 services	 for	 more	 than	 55	 years.	
The	 market	 –	 both	 aviation	 and	 the	 wider	 market	 –	 has	 changed	
significantly	 during	 that	 time.	 With	 a	 history	 in	 aircraft	 broking	
centred	 on	 the	 UK,	 our	 vision	 is	 to	 become	 a	 world-class	
aviation	 services	 group.
A steadily growing global aviation market
In	 the	 short	 term,	 the	 global	 aviation	 market	 can	 be	 adversely	
affected	 by	 geo-political	 issues	 or	 ‘acts	 of	 God’,	 but	 the	
longer-term	 trend	 is	 positive.	 The	 International	 Air	 Transport	
Association	 (IATA)	 predicts	 passenger	 traffic	 to	 increase	
to	 7.2	 billion	 passengers	 in	 2035,	 a	 near	 doubling	 of	 the	
3.8	 billion	 air	 travellers	 in	 2016
1
.		
While	 this	 assumption	 is	 based	 on	 trade	 liberalisation	
gathering	 pace,	 even	 a	 more	 pessimistic	 assumption	 based	
on	 increased	 protectionism	 predicts	 5.8	 billion	 passengers	
in	 2035.	 The	 message	 is	 clear:	 the	 aviation	 market	 is	 growing	
and	 as	 it	 does	 so,	 the	 demand	 for	 aviation	 services	 will	
also	 increase.	 We	 are	 therefore	 adding	 new	 service	 lines	 to	
complement	 our	 core	 broking	 offering,	 strengthening	 our	
customer	 proposition	 and	 extending	 our	 global	 reach.
Our unique position in the market
In	 an	 industry	 where	 asset	 ownership	 is	 commonplace,	
Air	 Partner’s	 strategy	 is	 different.	 We	 don’t	 own	 aircraft	 –	
rather,	 our	 main	 assets	 are	 our	 people,	 brands	 and	 reputation	
(see	 our	 business	 model	 on	 pages	 10-11),	 and	 we	 aim	 to	 grow	
on	 this	 basis.
Meeting	 our	 clients’	 needs	 is	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 everything	 we	
do.	 By	 offering	 more	 services	 in	 the	 two	 broad	 categories	 of	
broking	 and	 consulting/training,	 not	 only	 do	 we	 increase	 the	
chance	 of	 retaining	 our	 customers,	 we	 have	 the	 opportunity	
to	 cross-sell	 services	 to	 strengthen	 our	 relationships	 further.
Environment
Our	 own	 direct	 carbon	 footprint	 is	 negligible,	 however	 we	
are	 involved	 in	 an	 industry	 that	 makes	 a	 small	 but	 significant	
contribution	 to	 man-made	 carbon	 dioxide	 emissions.	
Accordingly,	 we	 have	 investigated	 the	 environmental	
performance	 of	 the	 aircraft	 types	 we	 offer	 and,	 uniquely	
among	 our	 competitors,	 we	 share	 this	 data	 with	 our	 customers,	
right	 from	 the	 start,	 so	 they	 can	 factor	 this	 into	 their	 choices.	
Unlike	 other	 providers	 who	 may,	 or	 often	 may	 not,	 offer	 just	
a	 standard	 carbon	 offset	 scheme	 based	 on	 their	 own	 limited	
fleet	 (which	 could	 be	 ill-suited	 to	 the	 mission	 in	 any	 case),	
Air	 Partner	 offers	 a	 totally	 bespoke	 solution	 every	 time.	 Then	
we	 offer	 to	 neutralise	 the	 calculated	 impact	 of	 these	 emissions.
The market for broking
At	 Air	 Partner,	 broking	 encompasses	 commercial	 jets,	
private	 jets,	 freight,	 emergency	 planning	 (our	 bespoke	
disaster	 response	 service)	 and	 aircraft	 remarketing.	 The	
global	 air	 charter	 market	 is	 highly	 fragmented,	 with	 low	
barriers	 to	 entry	 and	 little	 or	 no	 regulation.	 Other	 than	 direct	
competitors,	 there	 are	 also	 competitors	 offering	 similar	
services	 with	 a	 different	 business	 model,	 particularly	 in	 the	
private	 jet	 sector	 (eg	 fractional	 ownership,	 charter	 of	 their	
own	 aircraft	 or	 charter	 of	 aircraft	 under	 their	 management).	
Other	 competitors	 aim	 to	 use	 technology	 to	 create	 a	 seamless	
end-to-end	 booking	 process,	 seeing	 this	 as	 an	 advantage.

9 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We	 aim	 to	 differentiate	 ourselves	 as	 follows:
• service:	 we	 offer	 our	 customers	 an	 unrivalled	 service,	
whether	 this	 be	 a	 product	 that	 provides	 better	 service	
levels,	 such	 as	 JetCard,	 or	 a	 complete	 service	 that	 our	
competitors	 cannot	 offer,	 such	 as	 a	 charter	 service	 with	
a	 safety	 audit	 of	 the	 carrier
• reputation:	 in	 a	 market	 where	 competitors	 come	 and	 go,	 our	
55-year	 heritage	 demonstrates	 stability,	 safety,	 quality	 and	
financial	 performance	
• our people:	 in	 our	 experience,	 technology	 cannot	 replace	
people.	 We	 invest	 in	 technology	 to	 improve	 the	 customer	
experience	 and	 drive	 efficiencies,	 but	 the	 key	 to	 our	 success	
is	 a	 genuine	 24/7/365	 service	 by	 our	 aviation	 experts	 for	
customers	 who	 want	 a	 bespoke,	 personal	 service.	
Material	 geopolitical	 events	 and/or	 natural	 disasters	 can	
cause	 short-term	 downturns	 in	 demand	 for	 aircraft	 charter	
(for	 example,	 9/11	 or	 the	 Eyjafjallajökull	 volcanic	 eruption),	
although	 our	 Emergency	 Planning	 Division	 is	 often	 called	 on	
at	 such	 times,	 for	 example,	 providing	 aid	 to	 a	 disaster	 zone,	
or	 arranging	 troop	 transfers	 or	 evacuations	 in	 times	 of	 war.	
Moreover,	 our	 vision	 to	 supply	 a	 greater	 range	 of	 services	
across	 a	 broader	 geographic	 area	 should	 help	 mitigate	
local	 challenges.
The market for consulting and training
The	 pace	 of	 growth	 of	 the	 aviation	 industry,	 busier	 skies,	 more	
competition,	 demands	 for	 higher	 fleet	 utilisation	 and	 greater	
operational	 capability	 are	 occurring	 against	 a	 backdrop	 of	 zero	
tolerance	 of	 accidents.	 This	 is	 increasing	 pressure	 on	 safety	
results	 and	 management.	 Furthermore,	 the	 aviation	 safety	
world	 has	 evolved	 over	 the	 past	 five	 years	 from	 one	 where	 it	
seeks	 to	 understand	 how	 safety	 management	 systems	 (SMS)	
work	 to	 securing	 effective	 performance.
Unlike	 broking,	 consulting	 and	 training	 services	 exist	 in	
a	 highly	 regulated	 environment,	 and	 one	 in	 which	 regulations	
are	 constantly	 changing.	 Indeed,	 it	 is	 this	 change	 and	 constant	
desire	 to	 improve	 standards	 that	 underpins	 the	 business	
models	 of	 both	 Baines	 Simmons	 and	 Clockwork	 Research	
(see	 page	 10).
Civil aviation
In	 2013,	 global	 regulators	 began	 to	 move	 towards	
performance-based	 regulation	 (PBR).	 This	 is	 now	 standard	
practice	 for	 the	 International	 Civil	 Aviation	 Organization	
(ICAO)	 and	 the	 European	 Aviation	 Safety	 Agency	 (EASA).	
By	 moving	 to	 a	 PBR	 approach,	 regulators	 are	 aiming	 to	 embed	
a	 risk-based	 approach	 to	 safety,	 whether	 this	 be	 SMS	 or	
fatigue	 risk	 management.	 This	 move	 is	 providing	 opportunities	
for	 both	 Baines	 Simmons	 and	 Clockwork	 Research	 to	 take	
their	 services	 beyond	 the	 UK	 and	 Europe	 to	 Asia,	 Australia	
and	 North	 America.	
Defence
In	 the	 defence	 market,	 bodies	 such	 as	 the	 European	
Defence	 Agency	 (EDA)	 have	 committed	 to	 the	 principles	 of	
harmonisation	 of	 airworthiness	 requirements.	 Through	 its	
long-term	 relationship	 with	 various	 military	 authorities	 around	
the	 world,	 Baines	 Simmons	 is	 well	 positioned	 to	 benefit	 from	
the	 opportunities	 that	 will	 arise.

Explaining our business
Business model and strategy
To	 create	 long-term,	 sustainable	 value	 for	 shareholders,	 we	 are	
developing	 a	 total	 offer	 for	 customers	 in	 the	 air	 charter	 market	 who	
will	 choose	 us	 because	 we	 provide	 the	 best	 in	 quality,	 safety	 and	
service.	 Growth	 by	 acquisition	 is	 core	 to	 our	 strategy.
What we offer Our customers
Aircraft charter
At	 the	 core	 of	 our	 business	 model,	 providing	 tailored	 services	 for	 many	 years,	
leveraging	 our	 relationships	 with	 the	 majority	 of	 aircraft	 operators	 and	 enabling	
us	 to	 select	 the	 aircraft	 appropriate	 for	 our	 customers’	 needs.	 Profit	 is	 largely	
generated	 through	 commissions,	 although	 some	 fee	 income	 is	 generated	 through	
the	 provision	 of	 professional	 services	 or,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 our	 Emergency	 Planning	
Division,	 subscriptions.
Charter customers
Corporate	 customers	 (including	 sports	 teams	 and	
tour	 operators),	 governments,	 and	 high	 net	 worth	
individuals,	 who	 require	 our	 skills	 and	 expertise	 to	
solve	 often	 complex	 aviation	 requirements.	 Projects	
range	 from	 one-off	 charters	 to	 much	 longer	 or	 more	
complicated	 projects	 spanning	 many	 months	 or	
multiple	 rotations.
Aircraft remarketing
Air Partner Remarketing	 (formerly	 Cabot	 Aviation)	 provides	 comprehensive	
remarketing	 programmes	 across	 the	 globe	 for	 all	 types	 of	 commercial	 and	 corporate

•	Optimise our core 
This	 summarises	 our	 aim	 to	 achieve	 more	 with	 the	 resources	 we	 currently	
employ,	 whether	 this	 be	 to	 increase	 efficiencies	 at	 an	 operating	 level	 or	 to	 grow	
gross	 profit	 through	 our	 ‘Customer	 First’	 initiative,	 as	 described	 to	 the	 right.	
•	Enhance and extend our offer 
Air	 Partner’s	 aim	 is	 to	 become	 a	 global	 aviation	 services	 provider.	 To	 mitigate	
the	 inherent	 risks	 in	 our	 core	 broking	 business,	 we	 therefore	 have	 embarked	 on	
a	 strategy	 of	 increasing	 the	 range	 of	 services	 the	 Group	 provides.	
•	Creating value by putting our customers first 
During	 2015,	 we	 began	 our	 Customer	 First	 programme.	
Ultimately,	 it	 will	 enable	 us	 to	 provide	 an	 unrivalled	
customer	 experience,	 enhancing	 our	 brand	 and	
differentiating	 us.	 Our	 brand,	 and	 people	 strategies	
aim	 to	 ensure	 that	 Customer	 First	 is	 deeply	 embedded	
in	 everything	 we	 do,	 while	 our	 technology	 strategy	 will	
provide	 the	 infrastructure	 to	 roll	 out	 this	 approach	
quickly	 to	 new	 services. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements

What differentiates us
Our people
Whichever	 part	 of	 the	
business	 they	 work	 in,	
our	 people	 are	 the	 ones	
who	 deliver	 the	 high-
quality	 experience	 our	
customers	 expect.	
Sourcing,	 retaining	 and	
motivating	 our	 people	
is	 therefore	 critical	 to	
maintaining	 the	 service	
levels	 our	 customers	
demand.	 Our	 commitment	
to	 training,	 remuneration	
and	 clarity	 of	 roles	 is	
essential	 for	 our	 success.	
Our brand
The	 global	 aviation	
services	 market	 is	
broad,	 fragmented	
and	 competitive.	
Differentiating	 our	 brands	
is	 therefore	 essential	 for	
our	 current	 and	 future	
success.	 Maintaining	 and	
enhancing	 brand	 identity	
requires	 a	 consistently	
excellent	 customer	
experience	 –	 and,	 in	 the	
long	 run,	 we	 aim	 to	 build	
an	 unrivalled	 proposition	
by	 offering	 the	 full	 range	
of	 aviation	 services	 our	
customers	 want.
Our technology
Technology	 is	 core	 to	
providing	 an	 enhanced	
customer	 experience	 and	
building	 a	 global	 aviation	
services	 group.	 To	 fulfil	
our	 Customer	 First	
ethos,	 we	 must	 invest	
in	 infrastructure	 that	
enables	 us	 to	 understand	
our	 customers	 and	
cross-sell	 our	 services.	
And,	 as	 we	 increase	 the	
number	 of	 services	
we	 provide,	 that	
infrastructure	 must	 be	
scalable	 to	 manage	 costs.
Our capital resources
The	 strength	 of	 our	
balance	 sheet	
differentiates	 Air	 Partner	
from	 our	 competitors.	
It	 helps	 us	 support	 and	
retain	 key	 customers	 by	
providing	 credit	 terms,	
while	 enabling	 us	 to	
offer	 additional	 aviation	
services	 through	
judicious	 acquisitions.	
Our plc status
Air	 Partner	 is	 the	 only	
listed	 company	 in	 its	
sector	 and	 this,	 coupled	
with	 the	 fact	 the	 business	
has	 existed	 for	 over	
55	 years,	 provides	 our	
customers	 with	 a	 level	
of	 financial	 transparency	
and	 assurance	 that	 our	
competitors	 cannot	 offer.

•	Developing and retaining our people 
Teamwork	 is	 the	 cornerstone	 of	 our	 business.	 We	 invest	 in	 our	
people	 and	 give	 them	 an	 environment	 in	 which	 they	 feel	 included,	
valued,	 empowered	 and	 able	 to	 reach	 their	 full	 potential.	 Having	
a	 team	 of	 skilled	 and	 motivated	 brokers,	 trainers	 and	 consultants	
with	 the	 experience	 to	 deliver	 the	 service	 required	 by	 Customer	
First	 is	 critical	 to	 our	 ongoing	 success.	 We	 recognise	 their	
dedication	 by	 linking	 remuneration	 to	 performance	 and	 actively	
encouraging	 personal	 development	 by	 offering	 training	 to	 build	
capabilities	 and	 encourage	 the	 right	 behaviours.
•	Maintain and enhance our brand identity	
With	 a	 track	 record	 of	 over	 55	 years,	 Air	 Partner	 is	 well-known	 in	
the	 aviation	 industry.	 Our	 transformational	 journey	 from	 a	 broking	
business	 to	 an	 aviation	 services	 group	 has	 meant	 the	 Group	 has	
extended	 beyond	 the	 original	 Air	 Partner	 brand.	 Baines	 Simmons	
and	 Clockwork	 Research	 are	 both	 well	 respected	 businesses	 in	
their	 own	 sector,	 and	 collectively	 our	 brand	 is	 stronger	 through	
the	 addition	 of	 these	 businesses. 12 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Explaining our business: business model and strategy continued
People: the fuel of our business
We	 are	 a	 relationship-based	 business	 and	 our	 success	 depends	 on	 our	
people.	 We	 have	 always	 been	 a	 lean	 organisation	 able	 to	 adapt	 quickly	 to	
reflect	 changes	 in	 the	 industry,	 and	 having	 an	 experienced,	 motivated	 and	
engaged	 team	 is	 critical.	 As	 we	 grow	 and	 offer	 our	 customers	 new	 aviation	
services,	 this	 only	 becomes	 more	 important.	
An open, progressive culture
Air	 Partner	 is	 a	 developing	 business.	 Part	 of	 the	 challenge	 as	 we	
grow	 and	 take	 on	 people	 from	 new	 acquisitions	 is	 to	 integrate	
everyone	 so	 that	 they	 feel	 part	 of	 the	 Air	 Partner	 Group.	 Key	 to	
this	 is	 our	 people-centred	 culture.	 Our	 aim	 is	 to	 run	 a	 business	
that	 is	 equitable	 for	 all,	 regardless	 of	 gender,	 race,	 nationality,	
disability	 or	 any	 other	 difference,	 and	 to	 treat	 everyone	 fairly	
and	 with	 respect.	 A	 number	 of	 key	 elements	 make	 our	 culture	
people-centred.	 We	 have	 a	 flat	 structure,	 enhanced	 by	 a	 genuine	
‘open-door’	 policy.	 Proof	 of	 this	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 our	 headquarters	
is	 entirely	 open-plan,	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 our	 CEO’s	 and	 CFO’s	
offices.	 And	 even	 our	 most	 senior	 leaders	 make	 sure	 they	
connect	 with	 employees	 on	 a	 day-to-day	 basis.	 We	 encourage	
two-way	 conversation,	 supported	 by	 initiatives	 like	 our	
engagement	 survey,	 our	 employee	 forum,	 and	 the	 CEO’s	
breakfasts	 throughout	 the	 year,	 open	 to	 all	 employees,	 which,	
while	 non-obligatory,	 are	 often	 well	 attended.	 We	 offer	 flexible	
working	 and	 advocate	 a	 healthy	 lifestyle,	 through	 initiatives	
such	 as	 providing	 fresh	 fruit	 and	 healthy	 snacks	 for	 our	 team	
and	 subsidising	 gym	 memberships.	
Recruitment and retention
People	 tend	 to	 stay	 with	 Air	 Partner	 for	 a	 good	 length	 of	 time.	
The	 average	 stay	 is	 five	 years	 and	 some	 of	 our	 staff	 have	 been	
with	 us,	 10,	 15	 or	 20	 years	 plus.	 We	 have	 initiatives	 to	 ensure	
we	 are	 successful	 at	 retaining	 our	 key	 people.	 With	 our	 recent	
acquisitions,	 we	 want	 to	 ensure	 that	 this	 continues.
We	 are	 keen	 to	 ensure	 that	 people	 remain	 engaged	 and	
challenged	 in	 their	 roles	 and	 aim	 to	 reach	 their	 full	 potential.	
To	 underscore	 the	 importance	 of	 this,	 we	 are	 working	 towards	
‘engagement’	 as	 a	 key	 performance	 indicator	 (KPI),	 measured	
through	 our	 Employee	 Engagement	 survey,	 which	 we	 carry	
out	 every	 two	 years.	 The	 most	 recent	 survey	 was	 launched	
in	 February	 2017,	 and	 we	 will	 report	 on	 our	 engagement	 score	
in	 next	 year’s	 annual	 report.	
Integrating new businesses
Successful	 integration	 is	 a	 key	 and	 necessary	 objective	 of	 any	
acquisition	 or	 merger.	 Integrating	 small,	 similar	 businesses	
tends	 to	 be	 easier,	 because	 there	 is	 already	 a	 common	 way	
of	 working,	 and	 this	 is	 reflected	 in	 the	 smooth	 integration	
of	 Cabot	 Aviation,	 now	 Air	 Partner	 Remarketing.	 Bringing	
on	 board	 an	 entirely	 new	 type	 of	 business,	 as	 we	 did	 with	
Baines	 Simmons,	 is	 more	 challenging,	 but,	 as	 shown	 by	 the	
profitability	 of	 the	 business	 this	 year,	 we	 are	 well	 on	 the	 way	
to	 succeeding	 in	 winning	 hearts	 and	 minds.	 Our	 most	 recent	
acquisition,	 Clockwork	 Research,	 has,	 like	 Cabot	 Aviation,	
been	 very	 straightforward,	 and	 we	 look	 forward	 to	 working	
more	 closely	 with	 and	 learning	 from	 our	 new	 businesses	 as	
they	 integrate	 into	 the	 Group.
Equal opportunities and human rights
We	 are	 committed	 to	 providing	 equal	 opportunities	 and	
ensuring	 our	 staff	 can	 work	 without	 discrimination.	 Full	
consideration	 is	 given	 to	 employees	 with	 a	 disability	 and	
should	 an	 employee	 become	 disabled	 while	 working	 for	 us,	
we	 would	 make	 every	 effort	 to	 enable	 them	 to	 continue	 to	
work	 for	 the	 Group.	 As	 at	 26	 April	 2017,	 Air	 Partner	 had	 seven	
directors,	 including	 one	 woman.	 Of	 our	 257	 employees,	
138	 were	 men	 and	 119	 women,	 and	 three	 of	 our	 nine	 senior	
managers	 were	 women.	 Air	 Partner	 has	 a	 responsibility	 to	
conduct	 business	 in	 an	 ethical	 way	 and	 accordingly	 has	 in	
place	 internal	 policies	 to	 support	 recognised	 human	 rights	
principles.	 These	 include	 policies	 on	 non-discrimination,	
health	 and	 safety,	 environmental	 issues,	 and	 bribery	 and	
corruption.	 We	 maintain	 a	 zero	 tolerance	 approach	 to	 bribery	
and	 corruption	 and	 a	 programme	 of	 internal	 training	 is	 in	 place	
to	 ensure	 that	 all	 staff	 are	 aware	 of	 the	 Group’s	 policies.

Getting technology right
Having	 the	 best	 possible	 technical	 infrastructure	 is	 key	
to	 supporting	 our	 ambition	 to	 offer	 a	 full	 range	 of	 services	
to	 our	 customers,	 while	 maintaining	 an	 efficient,	 	
cost-effective	 business.
Ramping up our investment
2016	 has	 seen	 Air	 Partner	 investing	 significantly	 in	 technology	
as	 a	 necessary	 counterpart	 to	 efficient,	 long-term	 growth.	
During	 the	 year,	 we	 appointed	 a	 new	 Group	 Head	 of	
Technology,	 Lee	 Pyle,	 to	 lead	 an	 expanded	 IT	 team	 to	 deliver	
the	 technical	 platform	 we	 need	 to	 underpin	 the	 business.	
A	 central	 part	 of	 this	 work	 was	 to	 enhance	 our	 core	 Group	 IT	
systems,	 and	 during	 the	 year	 we	 introduced	 an	 upgraded	
financial	 system	 which	 will	 make	 the	 gathering	 and	 reporting	
of	 data	 faster	 and	 more	 efficient.	 We	 also	 began	 the	
development	 of	 a	 new	 customer	 relationship	 management	
(CRM)	 system,	 set	 to	 go	 live	 later	 in	 2017.	 This	 is	 essential	 to	
enable	 us	 to	 understand	 our	 customer	 base	 better	 across	 the	
divisions,	 especially	 now	 that	 our	 Customer	 First	 programme	
is	 well	 under	 way.	
It	 is	 also	 a	 key	 platform	 for	 growth:	 we	 need	 to	 be	 able	 to	
integrate	 our	 acquisitions	 easily	 into	 our	 systems,	 and	 also	 be	
able	 to	 get	 a	 picture	 of	 our	 customers	 across	 the	 whole	 Group.	
This	 will	 enable	 us	 to	 identify	 opportunities	 for	 cross-selling,	
which	 are	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 our	 strategy.
Looking ahead
We	 have	 two	 key	 aims	 for	 2017.	 First,	 we	 aim	 to	 introduce	
Cloud	 technology	 that	 will,	 among	 other	 functions,	 help	
our	 customer	 service	 team	 work	 more	 flexibly,	 including	
spending	 more	 time	 out	 on	 the	 road	 working	 more	 closely	
with	 customers.	 Second,	 we	 are	 significantly	 enhancing	 our	
digital	 communications	 platforms	 in	 partnership	 with	 the	
marketing	 team,	 whose	 remit	 has	 been	 to	 refresh	 our	 brand	
and	 raise	 the	 profile	 of	 the	 Group.	 Technology	 is	 essential	
to	 these	 developments,	 and	 both	 teams	 have	 been	 working	
closely	 together	 over	 the	 past	 year	 towards	 the	 shared	 goal	
of	 a	 stand-out	 brand	 with	 an	 agile	 and	 responsive	
digital	 capability.

integrateouracquisitions

Expanding our services
In	 pursuit	 of	 our	 vision	 to	 become	 a	 global	 aviation	 services	
company,	 we’re	 broadening	 our	 offer	 to	 encompass	 a	 full	
range	 of	 aviation	 services,	 and	 expanding	 where	 we	
operate	 to	 become	 truly	 global.	 In	 doing	 so,	 we	 aim	 to	
take	 our	 existing	 customers	 with	 us.
We	 are	 extending	 our	 product	 range	 and	 our	 geographic	
presence	 through	 carefully	 targeted	 acquisitions,	 which	
should	 in	 time	 offer	 mutual	 benefits	 to	 our	 core	 broking	
business.	 The	 key	 to	 success	 in	 this	 area	 is	 integration,	
and	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Cabot	 Aviation,	 now	 Air	 Partner	
Remarketing,	 enabled	 us	 to	 test	 the	 water.	 A	 small	 business	
in	 a	 similar	 field,	 it	 proved	 the	 model,	 while	 the	 acquisition	 of	
Baines	 Simmons	 added	 safety	 consulting	 and	 training	 to	 our	
offer.	 The	 addition	 of	 Clockwork	 Research	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2016,	
with	 the	 safety	 benefits	 of	 fatigue	 risk	 management,	 will	 help	
add	 depth	 to	 the	 consulting	 and	 training	 side	 of	 the	 business.	
Each	 new	 acquisition	 not	 only	 broadens	 our	 product	 offering,	
it	 broadens	 our	 geographic	 reach	 as	 well,	 since	 each	 has	
trading	 partners	 in	 different	 territories.	 In	 addition,	 it	 gives	
us	 the	 ability	 to	 offer	 a	 total	 aviation	 service	 to	 customers,	
which	 becomes	 increasingly	 attractive	 across	 all	 markets.	
Strong finances
Underpinning	 this	 strategy	 is	 careful	 financial	 management.	
Capital	 allocation	 is	 key,	 and	 low	 risk	 is	 of	 paramount	
importance	 –	 every	 pound	 we	 spend	 must	 generate	 the	
highest	 possible	 return.
“ Eachnewacquisitionhelps
usofferatotalaviation
servicetocustomers.”
 MARK BRIFFA, Chief Executive Officer
As	 part	 of	 that,	 we	 need	 a	 robust	 integration	 plan,	 and	 we	
have	 learned	 many	 lessons	 from	 the	 acquisitions	 of	 Cabot	
Aviation	 and	 Baines	 Simmons,	 particularly	 the	 importance	
of	 communication	 and	 culture,	 which	 will	 help	 us	 integrate	
Clockwork	 Research,	 and	 other	 potential	 new	 businesses.	
We	 are	 pleased	 that,	 under	 the	 first	 full	 year	 of	 our	
management,	 both	 Cabot	 Aviation	 and	 Baines	 Simmons	
have	 delivered	 profits	 to	 the	 Group,	 and	 we	 look	 forward	
to	 working	 closely	 with	 the	 Clockwork	 Research	 team.	
Looking ahead
The	 Group	 continues	 to	 assess	 investment	 opportunities,	
both	 organic	 and	 acquisitions,	 in	 line	 with	 our	 stated	
strategic	 objective	 to	 become	 a	 world-class	 global	 aviation	
services	 group.

Our	 Commercial	 Jets	 division	 was	 presented	 with	 a	 typical	
enquiry	 from	 a	 well-known	 automotive	 company,	 comprising	
the	 customer’s	 required	 flight	 route,	 number	 and	 profile	
of	 passengers.	 At	 this	 point,	 our	 Group	 Charter	 team	
identified	 a	 synergy	 of	 safety	 culture	 between	 Air	 Partner	
and	 our	 client.	 As	 a	 result,	 Commercial	 Jets	 liaised	 with	
Baines	 Simmons	 and	 asked	 them	 to	 carry	 out	 an	 audit	
of	 the	 two	 operators	 that	 our	 client	 would	 be	 using.

With	 our	 first	 acquisition,	 in	 May	 2015	 –	 aircraft	 remarketing	
specialist	 Cabot	 Aviation	 –	 we	 were	 dealing	 with	 an	 ad	 hoc	
business	 with	 the	 same	 essential	 quality	 of	 earnings	 as	 our	
aircraft	 charter	 divisions.	 It	 was	 therefore	 a	 fairly	 sure	 step	
with	 which	 to	 test	 our	 integration	 capabilities,	 while	 giving	
us	 a	 valuable	 foothold	 in	 new	 territories.	 Cabot	 had	 a	 very	
profitable	 first	 full	 year	 as	 part	 of	 Air	 Partner,	 and	 is	 now	 being

more	 time	 and	 work	 than	 Cabot	 Aviation,	 but	 despite	 the	
challenges,	 Baines	 Simmons	 has	 also	 had	 a	 profitable	 first

Baines	 Simmons.	 Co-founder	 Dr	 Alexandra	 Holmes	 discusses	
joining	 Air	 Partner.
‘Considerable mutual benefit’
‘We’ve	 been	 going	 for	 12	 years	 and	 have	 built	 up	 a	 very	 good	
reputation	 among	 the	 big	 aviation	 operators,’	 she	 says.	 ‘What	
we	 offer	 is	 almost	 unique.	 We	 do	 sometimes	 come	 up	 against	
universities	 but	 they	 wouldn’t,	 for	 instance,	 repeatedly	 go	 to	
the	 Maldives	 to	 carry	 out	 research	 and	 build	 a	 bespoke	 fatigue	
management	 system.	 We’re	 very	 hands	 on	 and	 spend	 a	 lot	 of	
time	 with	 clients,	 building	 relationships.	 We	 tend	 not	 to	 lose	
them.
‘We	 weren’t	 looking	 to	 sell	 necessarily,	 but	 could	 see	 that	
there	 was	 a	 much	 larger	 need	 for	 our	 service	 with	 the	
increasing	 awareness	 of	 performance	 safety	 and	 health.	
Joining	 Air	 Partner	 will	 help	 us	 grow	 and	 meet	 that	 need.	 There	
are	 huge	 opportunities	 and,	 along	 with	 Baines	 Simmons	 and	
other	 complementary	 acquisitions,	 we	 will	 help	 move	 the	
Group	 into	 a	 different	 space.	 We’re	 looking	 forward	 to	 working

Explaining our business
Principal risks and uncertainties
The	 Board	 has	 carried	 out	 a	 robust	 assessment	 of	 the	
principal	 risks	 facing	 the	 Group	 including	 those	 that	
would	 threaten	 its	 business	 model,	 future	 performance,	
solvency	 or	 liquidity.
Risk management process
The	 Board	 defines	 the	 risk	 appetite	 and	 monitors	 the	
management	 of	 significant	 risks	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 nature	
and	 extent	 of	 the	 significant	 risks	 taken	 by	 the	 Company	 are	
aligned	 with	 the	 overall	 goals	 and	 strategic	 objectives.	 Our	
risk	 appetite	 influences	 the	 culture	 of	 our	 business	 and	 how	
we	 operate,	 and	 is	 reflected	 in	 our	 management	 structure.	
The	 Operating	 Board	 supports	 the	 Board	 in	 monitoring	 the	
exposures	 through	 regular	 reviews	 and	 its	 general	 oversight	
of	 the	 day-to-day	 running	 of	 the	 business.	
Annual risk analysis
We	 identified	 and	 assessed	 new	 and	 existing	 risks	 over	 the	
course	 of	 the	 year	 as	 the	 Group’s	 overall	 risk	 profile	 continued	
to	 evolve.	 The	 Board	 and	 the	 Operating	 Board	 performed	
further	 analysis	 to	 prioritise	 these	 risks,	 with	 a	 focus	 on	
those	 considered	 to	 pose	 the	 greatest	 risk	 to	 achieving	
our	 objectives.
During	 the	 year,	 there	 has	 been	 a	 change	 to	 our	 legal	 and	
regulatory	 risks	 following	 the	 potential	 uncertainties	 arising	
from	 Brexit	 and	 the	 US	 Presidential	 election.	 However,	 both	
of	 these	 political	 events	 could	 present	 opportunities,	 and	 we	
are	 continuing	 to	 evaluate	 the	 situation.
Our principal risks and uncertainties
The	 principal	 risk	 to	 the	 Group’s	 business	 stems	 from	 the	
general	 economic	 conditions	 in	 which	 our	 clients	 operate,	
affecting	 their	 willingness	 and	 ability	 to	 charter	 or	 contract	
consulting	 services.	 Ad	 hoc	 charters	 are	 likely	 to	 continue	
to	 be	 affected	 by	 serious	 economic	 instability	 in	 the	 major	
world	 markets.
The	 pervasive	 risk	 to	 Air	 Partner’s	 chartering	 business	 is	 the

Chief Executive’s review
2016	 will	 be	 a	 year	 that	 many	 will	 remember	 as	 one	 of	 seismic	 and	
surprising	 change,	 especially	 on	 the	 political	 front	 both	 at	 home	 and	 abroad.	
On	 the	 quieter	 stage	 of	 aviation,	 our	 skies	 get	 busier	 and	 business	 gets	 more	
challenging,	 but	 Air	 Partner	 has	 completed	 the	 year	 with	 a	 set	 of	 results	
to	 make	 us	 proud	 and	 give	 our	 shareholders	 confidence	 in	 our	 strategy.	
Mark Briffa  Chief	 Executive	 Officer
The	 Group	 has	 made	 great	 progress	 during	 the	 year,	 delivering	
an	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 of	 £5.1m,	 a	 17.2%	 increase	
year-on-year.	 As	 ever,	 these	 results	 reflect	 the	 dedication	 and	
drive	 of	 all	 our	 staff,	 who	 continue	 to	 put	 our	 customers	 first,	
providing	 an	 unrivalled	 and	 differentiated	 service	 in	 our	 sector.
One Group, two divisions
The	 Group	 is	 structured	 into	 two	 complementary	 divisions:	
Broking,	 which	 delivers	 aircraft	 charter	 and	 remarketing	
services;	 and	 Consulting	 &	 Training,	 which	 delivers	
professional	 services,	 predominantly	 in	 the	 aviation	 safety	
sector.	 Both	 divisions	 operate	 internationally,	 servicing	
a	 high-quality	 customer	 base.	 Both	 divisions	 will	 play	
important	 roles	 in	 delivering	 our	 long-term	 strategy	 to	
become	 a	 world-class	 global	 aviation	 services	 group	 with	
a	 balanced	 business	 mix	 between	 the	 two.
Broking performance
Our	 Broking	 division	 has	 performed	 well	 this	 year,	 achieving	
a	 gross	 profit	 of	 £26.1m	 and	 an	 underlying	 operating	 profit	 of	
£6.6m	 which	 compare	 to	 £25.2m	 and	 £6.1m	 respectively	 in	 the	
prior	 year.	 This	 masks	 a	 better	 underlying	 performance,	 with	
some	 significant	 new	 business	 wins	 replacing	 a	 contract	 we	
expected	 not	 to	 be	 renewed	 as	 we	 entered	 the	 year.	 These	
wins	 were	 a	 result	 of	 some	 excellent	 teamwork,	 creativity	 and	
innovation	 by	 our	 people	 delivering	 solutions	 to	 some	 of	 our	
customers’	 most	 complex	 and	 technical	 needs.	 Our	 Customer	
First	 approach	 is	 delivering,	 and	 helping	 us	 measure,	 better	
levels	 of	 service	 and	 partnership	 with	 our	 most	 valued	
customers.	 As	 a	 result,	 we	 are	 seeing	 increased	 customer	
loyalty,	 and,	 with	 a	 greater	 portfolio	 of	 products,	 we	 are	 seeing	
the	 breadth	 of	 our	 activity	 with	 valued	 customers	 expand.	
During	 the	 year,	 we	 took	 steps	 to	 further	 enhance	 our	 Private	
Jet	 and	 JetCard	 offers,	 and	 we	 expect	 to	 evolve	 JetCard	 in	 the	
years	 ahead	 to	 reflect	 the	 lifestyle	 needs	 of	 our	 customers,	
in	 partnership	 with	 Camper	 &	 Nicholsons	 International.	 Since	
1782,	 they	 have	 been	 synonymous	 with	 the	 world’s	 leading	
yachts,	 and	 today	 are	 global	 leaders	 in	 all	 luxury	 yachting	
activities,	 specialising	 in	 their	 charter,	 sale,	 purchase,	
marketing,	 management	 and	 construction.	 This	 partnership	 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements

to	 make	 our	 customer	 experience	 the	 very	 best	 it	 can	 be.
Air	 Partner	 remarketing	 –	 formerly	 Cabot	 Aviation	 –	 also	
completed	 some	 significant	 projects	 in	 the	 year	 and	 the	
pipeline	 for	 the	 year	 ahead	 looks	 good.
The	 team,	 under	 the	 strong	 leadership	 of	 Tony	 Whitty,	 is	
responsible	 for	 all	 remarketing	 activity	 at	 Air	 Partner	 globally,	
and	 during	 the	 period	 we	 took	 the	 decision	 to	 consolidate	
all	 our	 short-term	 leasing	 activities	 under	 Tony’s	 wing	 so	
that	 we	 can	 leverage	 our	 expertise	 and	 understanding	 of	 the	
marketplace	 and	 service	 the	 customer	 better.	 The	 results	
from	 both	 the	 rebranding	 and	 the	 combination	 have	 been	
outstanding,	 and	 I	 believe	 the	 long-term	 outlook	 for	 our	
remarketing	 operation	 is	 excellent	 as	 we	 work	 with	 more	
international	 customers	 and	 add	 scale.	 Remarketing	 will	 be	
a	 beneficiary	 of	 organic	 investment	 and	 focus,	 and,	 while	 we	
will	 not	 rush	 anything,	 we	 hope	 to	 have	 a	 significantly	 larger	
remarketing	 business	 in	 three	 to	 five	 years	 than	 we	 do	 today.	
Consulting & Training performance
This	 report	 marks	 the	 first	 full	 year	 of	 operation	 from	 our	
Consulting	 &	 Training	 division,	 with	 a	 contribution	 of	 £0.5m,	
equating	 to	 10%	 of	 our	 underlying	 profits.	 I	 am	 very	 pleased	
with	 this	 maiden	 performance,	 and	 excited	 that	 the	 division	
is	 well	 positioned	 for	 future	 success.	 Almost	 all	 of	 this	 comes	
from	 Baines	 Simmons,	 our	 leading	 aviation	 safety	 consultants	
specialising	 in	 aviation	 regulation,	 compliance	 and	 safety	
management,	 which	 has	 performed	 well	 and	 is	 in	 a	 strong	
position	 to	 grow	 and	 develop	 in	 the	 years	 ahead.	 In	 December	
2016	 –	 seven	 weeks	 before	 the	 end	 of	 the	 financial	 year	
and	 15	 months	 after	 the	 completion	 of	 the	 Baines	 Simmons	
acquisition	 –	 we	 acquired	 Clockwork	 Research,	 a	 leading	
fatigue	 risk	 management	 consultancy.	 Integration	 of	
Clockwork	 Research	 was	 carried	 out	 on	 time	 and	 as	 planned.	
Similar	 to	 Air	 Partner	 Remarketing,	 Clockwork	 Research	 will	 be	
a	 beneficiary	 of	 future	 organic	 investment	 and	 focus	 as	 we

assist	 them	 to	 scale	 the	 business.	 As	 we	 work	 better	 together	
across	 the	 Group	 to	 deliver	 what	 our	 customers	 need,	 we	
expect	 the	 division’s	 contribution	 to	 our	 results	 to	 increase	
in	 future	 years	 as	 we	 become	 a	 more	 balanced	 business.
A common platform for growth
We	 have	 maintained	 our	 commitment	 to	 organic	 investment	
in	 core	 systems	 and	 controls.	 Our	 technology	 programme,	
Project	 Connect,	 began	 in	 2014	 and	 got	 us	 fit	 to	 compete	
globally.	 It	 enabled	 our	 latest	 upgrades,	 which	 began	 in	
February	 and	 should	 be	 finalised	 by	 the	 end	 of	 2017.	 The	 scale	
of	 the	 programme	 cannot	 be	 understated	 as	 it	 puts	 in	 place	
a	 solid	 foundation	 for	 future	 growth	 and	 is	 a	 core	 enabler	
to	 successfully	 carrying	 out	 our	 long-term	 strategy.	
We	 are	 introducing	 new	 platforms	 from	 which	 we	 can	
share	 data	 across	 the	 Group	 and	 which	 have	 the	 ability	 to	
accommodate	 the	 needs	 of	 any	 new	 acquisitions	 as	 soon	 as	
they	 come	 on	 board.	 This	 will	 give	 us	 greater	 consistency	 and	
flexibility.	 We	 introduced	 a	 new	 Group-wide	 finance	 system,	
which	 came	 on-stream	 in	 February,	 and	 will	 be	 moving	 all	 our	
companies	 onto	 a	 common	 CRM	 platform	 during	 2017.	
Transforming the business mix
Organic	 growth	 and	 self-improvement	 are	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 our	
long-term	 strategy,	 and	 by	 aligning	 ourselves	 closely	 with	 our	
most	 valued	 customers,	 we	 are	 better	 able	 to	 identify	 not	
only	 new	 business	 opportunities	 but	 also	 the	 strategic	 gaps	
across	 the	 Group.	 We	 have	 identified	 the	 services	 and	
capabilities	 we	 need	 to	 add	 or	 enhance	 and	 also	 identified	
the	 geographies	 where	 we	 need	 to	 develop	 a	 presence	 or	 add	
scale.	 In	 the	 years	 ahead,	 we	 will	 address	 these	 strategic	 gaps	
by	 either	 building	 a	 market-leading	 position	 organically	 or	
acquiring	 suitable	 businesses	 and	 platforms.		
It	 sounds	 straightforward	 –	 and	 as	 an	 idea,	 it	 is.	 The	 challenge	
lies	 in	 execution.	 We	 recognise	 that	 every	 acquisition	 carries	
risk	 –		 as	 it	 does	 reward	 and	 opportunity.	 We	 will	 judge	 risk	
and	 reward	 in	 detail	 before	 committing	 to	 acquisitions	
and	 deploying	 our	 capital.	 We	 are	 able	 to	 quickly	 assess	
a	 business’s	 strategic	 fit	 on	 various	 criteria,	 but	 alongside	 the	
analysis	 of	 its	 financial	 statements	 –	 the	 due	 diligence	 of	
financial	 track	 record	 and	 performance,	 and	 the	 assessment	
of	 future	 economic	 returns	 all	 speak	 to	 value	 –	 we	 spend	
a	 huge	 amount	 of	 time	 getting	 comfortable	 with	 the	 non-
financial	 components	 of	 a	 business,	 predominantly	 the	
people	 and	 culture.	
The	 most	 important	 question	 we	 ask	 ourselves	 when	 we	
evaluate	 a	 potential	 acquisition	 is	 ‘Is	 this	 an	 Air	 Partner	
company?’.	 The	 acquired	 business	 will,	 from	 day	 one,	 carry	
our	 brand	 or	 an	 association	 with	 our	 brand,	 and	 indeed	 may	
adopt	 our	 brand	 in	 due	 course,	 so	 we	 need	 to	 get	 comfortable	
with	 a	 lot	 more	 than	 just	 the	 numbers.	 The	 strategy,	 product	
or	 service,	 capital,	 scale,	 customer	 base,	 operating	 ethos	 and	
methodologies	 are	 all	 important,	 but	 they	 are	 brought	 to	 life	
by	 the	 people	 and	 the	 organisation’s	 culture.	 If	 we	 cannot	
tick	 all	 the	 boxes	 –	 both	 financial	 and	 non-financial	 –	 and	 get	
comfortable,	 we	 will	 not	 pursue	 the	 opportunity.
The	 aviation	 industry	 has	 many	 passionate	 and	 dedicated	
people	 who	 are	 delivering	 great	 products	 and	 services.	 Over	
the	 years,	 we	 have	 had	 the	 privilege	 to	 meet	 great	 businesses	
and	 we	 have	 evaluated	 many	 opportunities.	 There	 are	 plenty	
of	 acquisition	 opportunities,	 but	 we	 are	 selective,	 looking	 for	
complementary	 businesses.	 In	 nearly	 every	 instance,	 we	 are	
dealing	 direct	 with	 the	 owners	 or	 managers,	 and	 their	 decision	
to	 sell	 can	 be	 triggered	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 business	 or	 life	 events.	
In	 advance	 of	 that	 decision,	 we	 develop	 mutual	 trust	 and	 our	
understanding	 of	 the	 business.
We	 are	 delighted	 to	 have	 acquired	 three	 great	 businesses	 over	
the	 past	 two	 years	 –	 Cabot	 Aviation	 and	 Baines	 Simmons	 in	
2015	 and	 Clockwork	 Research	 in	 2016.	 These	 businesses	 are	
all	 run	 by	 passionate	 and	 dedicated	 people	 and	 deliver	 an	
exceptional	 service	 to	 their	 customers.	 As	 well	 as	 the	 financial	
contribution,	 they	 bring	 new	 services	 and	 capabilities	 to	 the	
Group	 which	 our	 customers	 and	 staff	 value,	 in	 the	 process	
making	 us	 a	 better	 and	 smarter	 organisation.	
Previous	 reports	 introduced	 the	 acquisitions	 of	 Cabot	 Aviation	
and	 Baines	 Simmons	 and	 this	 year	 I	 am	 pleased	 to	 introduce	
Clockwork	 Research.	 Clockwork	 Research	 brings	 new	 services	
and	 capability	 in	 the	 specialist	 field	 of	 fatigue	 risk	 management.

Great people
As	 we	 go	 forward	 on	 our	 journey	 of	 transformation,	 it’s	
important	 that	 we	 share	 the	 same	 vision	 and	 that	 all	 our	
people	 understand	 it.	 Enhancing	 our	 brand	 is	 as	 much	
about	 our	 internal	 audience	 as	 it	 is	 about	 the	 external,	 and	
accordingly	 we	 are	 working	 to	 articulate	 our	 vision	 and	 values	
and	 enhance	 our	 internal	 communications	 by	 engaging	 our	
staff	 across	 the	 organisation	 more	 frequently.	 We	 can	 do	
a	 lot	 better,	 but	 we	 are	 starting	 from	 a	 strong	 base,	 with	 a	 rich	
heritage	 and	 globally	 recognised	 brand.	 We	 have	 a	 clear,	
long-term	 strategy	 and	 are	 becoming	 an	 exciting	 place	 to	
work,	 with	 services	 and	 capabilities	 that	 add	 value	 and	
enable	 us	 to	 compete	 beyond	 price,	 and	 that	 will	 offer	 steady	
career	 progression.	 We	 aim	 to	 reward	 good	 performance	
and	 exceptional	 behaviour,	 and,	 as	 we	 grow,	 a	 key	 aim	 is	
to	 retain	 our	 existing	 culture	 that	 keeps	 people	 at	 its	 heart.	
In	 January	 2016,	 we	 hired	 Lee	 Pyle	 as	 Group	 Head	 of	 Technology.	
Under	 his	 leadership,	 we	 are	 making	 a	 considerable	 investment	
in	 technology	 in	 order	 to	 create	 a	 solid	 and	 sustainable	 basis	
for	 growth.	
In	 June	 2016,	 we	 hired	 Julia	 Timms	 as	 Group	 Marketing	
Director.	 During	 the	 latter	 part	 of	 the	 year,	 she	 set	 in	 motion	
an	 overhaul	 of	 the	 Air	 Partner	 brand,	 which	 will	 become	
the	 umbrella	 brand	 for	 all	 our	 product	 offerings,	 including	
any	 future	 acquisitions.	 This	 is	 a	 really	 important	 lever	 of	
transformation,	 in	 that	 it	 will	 project	 a	 clear,	 unified	 identity	
to	 the	 world,	 enhancing	 our	 ability	 to	 cross-sell	 our	 services.	
Finally,	 in	 January	 2017,	 we	 appointed	 David	 McCown,	 who	
was	 formerly	 our	 Vice-President	 for	 Business	 Development	
for	 the	 United	 States,	 as	 President	 for	 our	 US	 business,	 a	 key	
focus	 for	 organic	 growth	 for	 2017	 and	 beyond.
Outlook
We’re	 on	 a	 journey	 of	 transformation,	 and	 2016	 has	 been	 an	
encouraging	 year	 on	 a	 number	 of	 fronts.	 The	 path	 ahead	 is	
exciting	 but,	 as	 we	 always	 state,	 in	 the	 world	 of	 aviation,	 and	
most	 especially	 in	 the	 charter	 industry,	 we	 must	 be	 cautious	
when	 managing	 expectations.	 The	 charter	 business	 has	
always	 been,	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 be,	 a	 volatile	 industry.	
Despite	 this,	 over	 nearly	 six	 decades,	 we	 have	 developed	
our	 business	 and	 adapted	 to	 grow	 and	 succeed.	
We	 are	 confident	 we	 have	 a	 successful	 and	 very	 clear	 long-
term	 strategy.	 We	 manage	 our	 operations	 for	 long-term	
success,	 aligning	 what	 we	 do	 with	 our	 customers	 and	 aiming	
to	 exceed	 their	 most	 complex	 and	 technical	 needs.	
We	 aim	 to	 become	 a	 balanced	 business,	 with	 two	 market	
leading	 divisions	 –	 Broking	 and	 Consulting	 &	 Training	 –	
delivering	 exceptional	 service	 and	 value	 to	 customers,	 and,	 as	
a	 consequence,	 high-quality	 and	 increasingly	 visible	 earnings	
to	 our	 shareholders.	 This	 will	 add	 value	 to	 our	 customers	 and	
staff	 and	 build	 real	 value	 to	 the	 owners	 of	 our	 business.	
Broking	 still	 accounts	 for	 90%	 of	 our	 profits,	 but	 in	 the	 future	
we	 expect	 our	 business	 mix	 to	 evolve	 significantly,	 driven	
by	 organic	 growth	 and	 suitable	 acquisitions.	 Our	 organic	
investments	 are	 rewarding	 us	 and	 we	 have	 some	 exciting	
initiatives	 under	 way.	 Our	 newly	 acquired	 businesses	 have	
delivered	 strong	 operational	 performance	 and	 made	 an	
excellent	 first	 full-year	 financial	 contribution	 to	 the	 Group.	
We	 will	 continue	 to	 build	 relationships	 with	 the	 owners	 and	
managers	 of	 the	 many	 suitable	 businesses	 we	 have	 identified	
as	 potential	 acquisitions,	 but	 we	 will	 remain	 patient	 and	 keep	
to	 our	 strict	 evaluation	 criteria.

only	 listed	 company	 in	 this	 sector,	 and	 balance	 sheet	 strength	
are	 key	 in	 supporting	 two	 of	 the	 Group’s	 main	 strategic	
focuses:	 putting	 our	 customers	 first	 and	 expanding	 our	
service	 offering.
A strong balance sheet
In	 a	 crowded	 market	 with	 low	 barriers	 to	 entry,	 we	 are	 able	 to	
use	 our	 financial	 position	 to	 differentiate	 our	 services	 to	 key	
customers	 through	 our	 ability	 to	 offer	 favourable	 credit	 terms	
on	 large	 projects,	 as	 evidenced	 by	 the	 movement	 in	 working	
capital	 and	 non-JetCard	 cash	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 In	
addition,	 we	 have	 expanded	 our	 service	 offering	 to	 pursue	
the	 strategy	 of	 becoming	 a	 global	 aviation	 services	 company	
through	 the	 acquisition	 of	 complementary	 businesses	 using	
cash	 or	 debt.	 Subsequent	 to	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 loan	
outstanding	 at	 31	 January	 2017	 was	 refinanced	 through	 a	
revolving	 credit	 facility	 of	 £7.5m	 which,	 in	 combination	 with	
an	 overdraft	 facility,	 provides	 the	 Group	 with	 £9m	 of	 facilities	
in	 addition	 to	 non-JetCard	 cash.
Financial overview
Revenue:	 Air	 Partner	 primarily	 uses	 gross	 profit	 as	 its	 key	
indicator	 of	 business	 performance	 given	 the	 potential	 for	
revenue,	 as	 determined	 under	 IFRS,	 to	 fluctuate	 depending	
on	 the	 number	 of	 contracts	 enacted	 in	 the	 year	 where	 we	 act	
as	 principal,	 as	 opposed	 to	 agent.	 The	 reduction	 in	 revenue	
of	 £7.4m	 to	 £42.5m	 (2016:	 £49.9m)	 is	 due	 to	 the	 non-repeat	
of	 a	 specific	 oil	 and	 gas	 contract	 which	 ended	 early	 in	 2017.
Underlying operating profit:	 underlying	 operating	 profit	
increased	 by	 16.6%	 to	 £5.1m	 (2016:	 £4.4m),	 with	 the	
majority	 of	 the	 increase	 being	 attributable	 to	 the	 improved	
performance	 of	 the	 Consulting	 &	 Training	 division.	 Excluding	
the	 impact	 of	 Air	 Partner	 Remarketing’s	 results	 from	 the	
Commercial	 Jets	 segment,	 our	 legacy	 business’s	 performance	
increased	 by	 £0.1m,	 or	 2.9%,	 on	 a	 like-for-like	 basis.
Other items:	 other	 items	 comprise	 restructuring	 costs,	
amortisation	 of	 intangible	 assets	 arising	 on	 acquisition,	
acquisition-related	 costs	 and	 non-cash	 acquisition-related	
costs	 (being	 the	 IFRS	 2	 charge	 arising	 on	 the	 share-based	
consideration	 for	 Air	 Partner	 Remarketing).	 The	 overall	
reduction	 in	 ‘other	 items’	 of	 £0.5m	 to	 £0.7m	 (2016:	 £1.2m)	
is	 due	 to:
•	the	 lower	 amount	 incurred	 in	 respect	 of	 restructuring	 of	
£0.2m	 following	 the	 major	 restructuring	 of	 the	 Operating	
Board	 that	 took	 place	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2016
•	lower	 acquisition	 related	 costs	 of	 £0.1m,	 a	 reduction	 of	
£0.3m,	 due	 to	 their	 being	 only	 one	 acquisition	 in	 the	 year,	
that	 of	 Clockwork	 Research.
Amortisation	 of	 intangibles	 arising	 from	 acquisitions	 of	
£0.3m	 and	 non-cash	 acquisition	 related	 costs	 of	 £0.1m	 were	
consistent	 with	 the	 prior	 year.
Operating profit:	 operating	 profit	 increased	 by	 £1.2m	 to	 £4.4m	
(2016:	 £3.2m)	 due	 to	 a	 combination	 of	 the	 increased	 trading	
performance	 of	 £0.7m	 at	 an	 underlying	 operating	 profit	 level	
combined	 with	 a	 reduction	 in	 ‘other	 items’	 of	 £0.5m.
Finance charges:	 the	 Group’s	 net	 finance	 charge	 remained	
at	 £0.1m,	 comprising	 interest	 on	 the	 Group’s	 loan	 and	 interest	
receivable	 on	 cash	 balances.

Taxation
The	 Group’s	 underlying	 effective	 tax	 rate	 for	 the	 year	 was	 33%	
(2016:	 30%)	 and	 has	 been	 affected	 by	 an	 adjustment	 in	 respect	
of	 prior	 years	 totalling	 £0.4m.	 Without	 this	 adjustment,	 the	
underlying	 tax	 rate	 would	 have	 been	 25%.	 The	 change	 arose	
primarily	 due	 to	 an	 adjustment	 in	 respect	 of	 a	 research	 and	
development	 claim	 made	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2015.	
The	 statutory	 effective	 tax	 rate	 for	 the	 year	 was	 35%	
(2016:	 39%).	 The	 lower	 rate	 being	 due	 to	 a	 reduction	 in	
amounts	 disallowable	 for	 tax	 purposes	 included	 within	
‘other	 items’.
Financial position
JetCard cash:	 the	 reduction	 of	 £0.9m	 is	 as	 a	 result	 of	 record	
utilisation	 in	 the	 year	 outstripping	 the	 pace	 of	 new	 cards	 and	
renewals.	 Subsequent	 to	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 Group	
will	 be	 placing	 all	 JetCard	 funds	 into	 segregated	 accounts	
as	 further	 assurance	 to	 our	 customers.
Non-JetCard cash net of borrowings:	 the	 net	 debt	 position	
has	 improved	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 improved	 trading	 position	
increasing	 net	 cash	 inflow	 from	 operating	 activities	 of	 £1.9m,	
less	 outflows	 for	 the	 investment	 in	 Clockwork	 Research	 of	
£0.4m,	 dividends	 paid	 of	 £2.5m	 and	 repayment	 of	 borrowings	
of	 £0.5m	 but	 benefiting	 from	 a	 foreign	 exchange	 gain	 of	 £1.6m.
As	 noted	 above,	 the	 Group’s	 bank	 loan,	 which	 stood	 at	 £3.0m	
at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 was	 refinanced	 with	 a	 new	 revolving	
credit	 facility,	 which	 has	 total	 availability	 of	 £7.5m,	 provided	
by	 Air	 Partner’s	 main	 bankers.	 The	 facility	 expires	 in	
February	 2020.
Other net current assets and liabilities:	 with	 cash	 excluded,	
the	 Group	 is	 in	 a	 net	 current	 liabilities	 position	 as	 a	 result	 of	
deferred	 income,	 particularly	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 JetCard	 product	
exceeding	 other	 current	 assets.
Foreign exchange
Where	 possible,	 the	 Group	 uses	 natural	 hedging	 to	 minimise	
its	 foreign	 exchange	 exposure,	 for	 example	 matching	 JetCard	
deposits	 denominated	 in	 euros	 or	 US	 dollars	 with	 the	 respective	
deferred	 income.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Group	 also	 uses	 derivative	
financial	 instruments	 to	 hedge	 certain	 transactions	 in	
accordance	 with	 its	 internal	 policy.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 these	
instruments	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 was	 a	 liability	 of	 £9,000	
(2016:	 an	 asset	 of	 £36,000)	 and	 the	 loss	 recognised	 through	
the	 income	 statement	 as	 a	 result	 in	 the	 change	 in	 fair	 value	
was	 a	 charge	 of	 £45,000	 (2016:	 a	 gain	 of	 £186,000).
While	 Brexit	 has	 caused	 a	 degree	 of	 volatility	 in	 currency	 markets	
during	 the	 year,	 given	 our	 geographical	 reach,	 with	 profits	 arising	
in	 the	 US	 in	 dollars,	 and	 in	 Europe	 in	 euros,	 the	 Group	 as	 a	 whole	
has	 not	 suffered	 adversely	 financially	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 leave	 vote	
to	 date.	 In	 its	 Aircraft	 Broking	 division	 in	 the	 UK,	 the	 most	 likely	
to	 have	 a	 currency	 mismatch	 between	 income	 and	 costs,	 the	
brokers	 are	 able	 to	 source	 alternative	 suppliers	 to	 help	 mitigate	
any	 erosion	 of	 margin	 and	 also	 apply	 the	 Group’s	 internal	 policy	
on	 hedging	 when	 necessary.	 Overall,	 the	 Group’s	 net	 foreign	
exchange	 gain	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 for	 the	 year	 was	
a	 loss	 of	 £20,000	 (2016:	 gain	 of	 £2,000).

A	 high	 percentage	 of	 the	 Group’s	 business	 is	 driven	 by	 the	
short-term	 needs	 of	 our	 customers.	 A	 long	 forward-order	
book	 is	 therefore	 neither	 available	 nor	 appropriate	 to	 use	
as	 a	 measure	 of	 our	 longer-term	 prospects.
Strategic KPIs
We	 are	 on	 a	 journey	 of	
transformation	 to	 become	
a	 world-class	 global	 aviation	
services	 group.	 This	 year,	 we	
identified	 four	 KPIs	 to	 measure	
our	 progress:	 two	 financial	 and	
two	 non-financial.	 The	 financial	
KPIs	 are:
• optimise:	 increase	 in	
gross	 profit	 from	 legacy	
Air	 Partner	 broker	 business
• enhance:	 the	 contribution	
made	 by	 the	 Group’s	 new	
acquisitions	 to	 overall	
Group	 underlying	 profit.
Our	 two	 non-financial	 KPIs	
measure	 our	 two	 most	
important	 assets	 –	 our	
customers	 and	 our	 people:
• customers:	 net	 promoter	
score
• people:	 employee	 turnover.
These	 KPIs	 may	 be	 amended,	
or	 added	 to,	 as	 we	 continue	
to	 transform.
1.		 Financial	 KPIs	 are	 for	 the	 last	 five	 financial	 periods,	 being	 the	 financial	 years	 ended	 31	 July	 2012,	 the	 unaudited	
pro-forma	 financial	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2014	 and	 the	 financial	 years	 ended	 31	 January	 2015,	 31	 January	 2016	
and	 31	 January	 2017.
2.		 All	 financial	 KPIs	 are	 based	 on	 total	 rather	 than	 underlying	 measures,	 except	 for	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 and	
underlying	 basic	 earnings	 per	 share.
3.	 Detailed 	 segmental	 reporting	 is	 set	 out	 in	 note	 4	 to	 the	 financial	 statements.

2017 performance: divisional reviews
In	 the	 world	 of	 commercial	 airline	 charter,	 success	 depends	
on	 experience,	 expertise	 and	 reputation	 built	 over	 decades.	
Air	 Partner’s	 Commercial	 Jets	 team	 offers	 logistical	 excellence,	
value	 for	 money	 and	 dependability.	
Performance
The	 period	 under	 review	 saw	
Commercial	 Jets	 deliver	 a	 strong	
performance	 in	 both	 Europe	 and	 the	 US.	
Gross	 profit	 increased	 by	 5.0%	 to	 £14.7m	
(2016:	 £14.0m)	 and	 underlying	 operating	
profit	 improved	 to	 £3.8m,	 an	 increase	
of	 30.3%	 (2016:	 £3.0m).	 This	 was	 driven	
largely	 by	 the	 performance	 of	 Air	 Partner	
Remarketing	 (formerly	 Cabot	 Aviation)	
for	 a	 full	 year,	 while	 strong	 performances	
by	 tour	 operations,	 sports	 and	
government	 clients	 in	 Europe	 was	 able	
to	 offset	 the	 downturn	 in	 the	 oil	 and	
gas	 market	 in	 the	 UK.
In	 the	 US,	 despite	 a	 reduced	 flying	
schedule	 from	 a	 key	 customer,	
we	 benefited	 from	 the	 presidential	
election,	 working	 on	 the	 ‘Hillary	 for	
America’	 campaign.
In	 the	 UK,	 a	 one-off	 major	 oil	 and	 gas	
contract	 which	 operated	 throughout	
the	 previous	 financial	 year	 came	 to	 an	
end,	 but	 we	 continued	 to	 make	 gains	
in	 the	 sports	 market,	 particularly	 with	
a	 number	 of	 Premiership	 football	 teams.
Emergency Planning
Our	 Emergency	 Planning	 product,	
whereby	 we	 map	 out	 evacuation	
contingencies	 for	 blue	 chip	 companies	
with	 personnel	 stationed	 in	 volatile	
regimes,	 is	 a	 subscription-based	 service	
and	 provides	 a	 recurring	 income	 stream.	
The	 division	 typically	 serves	 companies	
operating	 in	 unstable	 parts	 of	 the	 globe	
but	 also	 assists	 charities	 with	 civil	
emergency	 evacuation	 and	 disaster	
relief.	 Emergency	 Planning	 met	
expectations	 for	 the	 year	 and,	 given	
the	 uncertainties	 in	 the	 geopolitical	
environment,	 we	 believe	 this	 business	
is	 well	 placed	 for	 future	 growth.
A strong year for Air Partner Remarketing 
(formerly Cabot Aviation)
Air	 Partner	 Remarketing	 had	 a	 profitable	
year	 in	 its	 first	 full	 year	 of	 ownership	
and	 goes	 into	 2017	 with	 a	 strong	
pipeline	 of	 mandates.	 Key	 sales	
successes	 included	 the	 sale	 of	 three	
Kenya	 B777s	 to	 a	 US	 operator.	 During	
the	 year,	 we	 also	 moved	 short-term	
leasing	 (ACMI)	 into	 Air	 Partner	
Remarketing	 and	 as	 a	 result	 it	 had	 its	
strongest	 year	 over	 the	 last	 five-year	
period.	 The	 integration	 of	 Air	 Partner	
Remarketing	 into	 our	 offices	 at	 Gatwick	
has	 been	 very	 smooth	 and	 successful.

Private Jets
As	 part	 of	 one	 of	 the	 world’s	 largest	 suppliers	 of	 aircraft	
charter,	 our	 Private	 Jets	 team	 has	 the	 experience,	
relationships	 and	 aviation	 expertise	 to	 tailor	 solutions	
to	 meet	 our	 customers’	 exacting	 needs.
Performance
Overall,	 Private	 Jets	 has	 fared	 well	 this	
year.	 Mixed	 results	 from	 ad	 hoc	
business,	 with	 corporate	 customers	
flying	 less	 often,	 was	 offset	 by	 JetCard,	
which	 had	 another	 record	 year.	 Gross	
profit	 increased	 by	 9.3%	 to	 £10.2m	 and	
underlying	 operating	 profit	 rose	 by	 4.4%	
to	 £2.5m.	 We	 had	 a	 great	 start	 to	 the	
year	 in	 the	 UK,	 though	 ad	 hoc	 flying	
tailed	 off	 somewhat	 in	 the	 second	 half	
of	 the	 year,	 while	 conversely,	 in	 the	 US,	
we	 had	 a	 slow	 start	 and	 a	 strong	 finish.	
2017	 also	 saw	 strong	 performance	 for	
Private	 Jets	 in	 Europe,	 especially	 in	
Germany.	 JetCard	 utilisation	 has	
increased	 41%	 on	 2016,	 a	 fantastic	
achievement.	 Card	 numbers	 have	
increased	 by	 13	 to	 222	 although	 JetCard	
deposits	 have	 decreased	 to	 £15.9m	
(2016:	 £16.8m)	 reflecting	 the	 higher	
utilisation	 in	 the	 year.
Customer First gives us an edge
The	 private	 jet	 market	 is	 extremely	
competitive	 but	 we	 believe	 our	
Customer	 First	 strategy,	 which	 delivers	
an	 unrivalled	 level	 of	 service,	
particularly	 for	 JetCard,	 together	 with	
our	 financial	 stability,	 transparency	 and	
security,	 means	 we	 have	 a	 unique	
proposition.	 We	 have	 some	 exciting	
initiatives	 under	 way	 which	 we	 believe	
will	 further	 extend	 our	 services	 in	 this	
area	 and	 deliver	 exceptional	 services	
to	 our	 customers.	 We	 continue	 to	
monitor	 technology	 platforms	 in	 the	
private	 jet	 space,	 but	 we	 fundamentally	
believe	 –	 and	 our	 customers	 seem	
to	 agree	 –	 that	 until	 technological	
capabilities	 have	 further	 developed,	
complex	 travel	 scheduling	 is	 better	
handled	 by	 people	 rather	 than	 machines.	
Our	 Customer	 First	 programme	 remains	
pivotal	 to	 our	 operations	 and	 we	 believe	
it	 accounts	 for	 a	 large	 proportion	 of	 our	
continuing	 success.	 By	 putting	 our	
customers	 first,	 we	 continue	 to	 provide	
an	 unrivalled	 service,	 together	 with	
a	 value	 for	 money	 proposition.	 This	
formula	 is	 proving	 to	 be	 good	 for	
everyone	 who	 uses	 our	 services,	 as	
well	 as	 all	 our	 stakeholders.
As	 part	 of	 our	 strategy	 to	 grow	 in	 the	 US,	
we	 invested	 in	 a	 new	 office	 in	 New	 York,	
with	 the	 aim	 of	 growing	 our	 market	
share	 by	 highlighting	 our	 products’	
flexibility	 and	 service	 offering.	
Increased	 trade	 in	 US	 dollars	 will,	
we	 believe,	 help	 to	 offset	 the	 Brexit	
effect	 in	 the	 UK.
Developing our offer
We	 have	 invested	 in	 sales	 and	 have	
made	 greater	 in-roads	 into	 Europe	
where	 we	 already	 have	 a	 solid	 foothold.	
We	 have	 also	 started	 to	 offer	 additional	
services	 like	 controlled	 catering	 and	
have	 received	 enthusiastic	 feedback	
from	 our	 customers	 who,	 in	 this	 class,	
are	 extremely	 discerning	 and	 used	 to	
high	 standards.	 Furthermore,	 and	 as	
discussed,	 we	 went	 into	 partnership	
with	 Camper	 &	 Nicholsons,	 the	 luxury	
yacht	 specialists,	 in	 April	 2017.

Freight
Air	 Partner’s	 Freight	 team	 delivers	 bespoke	 air	 freight	
solutions	 to	 meet	 the	 most	 demanding	 schedules,	
reliably	 and	 at	 the	 best	 possible	 rates.
Performance
Air	 Partner	 is	 primarily	 a	 passenger	
business,	 but	 we	 see	 Freight	 as	
a	 strategic,	 protective	 offering	 which	
allows	 us	 to	 offer	 a	 full	 aviation	 service	
to	 customers.	 From	 a	 small	 base,	 we	 can	
add	 value	 –	 a	 good	 example	 being	 the	
German	 automotive	 business.	 The	 year’s	
performance	 in	 that	 particular	 market	
was	 buoyant,	 and	 complements	 our	
service	 offering	 from	 Commercial	 Jets	
in	 the	 automotive	 sector.
However,	 overall,	 Freight’s	 performance	
reflected	 the	 high	 prior	 year	 comparable,	
boosted	 by	 one	 key	 contract,	 which	 was	
not	 renewed.	 The	 downturn	 in	 the	 oil	
and	 gas	 industry,	 where	 Freight	 has	
traditionally	 been	 involved	 with	 the	
transportation	 of	 heavy	 pipes	 and	 other	
drilling	 gear,	 also	 meant	 a	 less	 busy	
period,	 with	 gross	 profit	 of	 £1.1m	
(2016:	 £1.9m)	 and	 underlying	 operating	
profit	 of	 £0.2m	 (2016:	 £0.8m).	 The	
division	 is	 always	 subject	 to	 the	
unpredictability	 of	 just-in-time	 logistics,	
from	 moving	 aircraft	 or	 automotive	
spares	 to	 mobilising	 at	 a	 moment’s	
notice	 to	 assist	 in	 disaster	 recovery.

2017 performance: divisional reviews	 continued
Baines	 Simmons	 is	 a	 world-leading	 aviation	 safety	
consultancy	 which	 specialises	 in	 aviation	 regulation,	
compliance	 and	 safety	 management.	 Clockwork	 Research	
is	 a	 leading	 fatigue	 risk	 management	 consultancy.
Performance
In	 its	 first	 full	 year	 of	 operation,	 our	
Consulting	 &	 Training	 division	 delivered	
a	 gross	 profit	 of	 £5.7m	 and	 an	 underlying	
operating	 profit	 of	 £0.5m,	 equivalent	
to	 10.3%	 of	 the	 Group	 total.	 Baines	
Simmons	 delivered	 good	 results	 in	 its	
first	 full	 year	 of	 ownership,	 while	 in	
December	 2016	 the	 acquisition	 of	
Clockwork	 Research	 strengthened	 our	
Consulting	 &	 Training	 proposition.	 Over	
the	 coming	 year,	 we	 have	 an	 ambitious	
plan	 for	 the	 continuous	 development	 of	
SMARRT	 MAP	 (Safety	 Management	 and	
Risk	 Reduction	 Tool	 Measurement	 and	
Performance)	 which	 will	 enhance	 our	
overall	 proposition	 and	 which	 will	 further	
strengthen	 the	 relationship	 between	 our	
consulting	 and	 training	 services.
Integrating Baines Simmons
The	 introduction	 of	 Customer	 First	
into	 Baines	 Simmons	 has	 established	
strong	 foundations	 for	 the	 future.	
By	 standardising	 many	 of	 our	 processes	
we	 can	 ensure	 the	 consistent	 high-
quality	 delivery	 of	 our	 products	 and	
services.	 We	 constantly	 review	 these	
products	 and	 services	 to	 ensure	 they	
are	 aligned	 to	 our	 customers’	 needs.	
The	 integration	 of	 shared	 Group	 services	
such	 as	 marketing,	 finance,	 HR	 and	 IT	
was	 largely	 completed	 during	 the	 year.
Baines	 Simmons	 continued	 to	 benefit	
from	 a	 number	 of	 large	 and	 long-term	
customer	 programmes	 which	 cut	 across	
both	 consulting	 and	 training	 products	
and	 services,	 while	 our	 Aviation	 Safety	
Academy	 experienced	 its	 best	 ever	
monthly	 performance	 in	 November.
Outsourced services
In	 April	 2016,	 we	 announced	 that	 we	 had	
been	 successful	 in	 securing	 a	 further	
10-year	 contract	 to	 provide	 aviation	
support	 services	 to	 the	 Isle	 of	 Man	
Aircraft	 Registry	 (IOMAR).	 In	 January	
2017,	 IOMAR	 was	 named	 Best	 Global	
Aviation	 Registry	 in	 World	 Commerce	
Review	 Magazine’s	 2017	 awards.	
IOMAR	 will	 celebrate	 its	 10-year	
anniversary	 in	 May	 2017	 and,	 since	
launch,	 almost	 950	 aircraft	 have	 been	
registered,	 highlighting	 the	 continued	
success	 of	 the	 Registry	 which	 is	 now	 the	
sixth	 largest	 private/corporate	 aircraft	
registry	 in	 the	 world.
Welcoming Clockwork Research
Clockwork	 Research,	 with	 its	 smart	
innovations	 in	 fatigue	 management,	
is	 a	 natural	 fit	 with	 Baines	 Simmons	
in	 terms	 of	 safety	 control	 and	 risk	
management.	
It	 strengthens	 our	 offering	 and	 the	
opportunities	 are	 good.	 Headed	 up	 by	
a	 small	 team	 of	 enterprising	 academics,	
Clockwork	 Research	 is	 very	 well	 respected	
by	 major	 operators	 across	 the	 world.	
The	 business	 uses	 systems	 models	 to	
ensure	 that	 pilots	 and	 other	 essential	
personnel	 are	 getting	 the	 necessary	
sleep	 to	 carry	 out	 their	 tasks	 effectively	
and	 safely.	 The	 pipeline	 of	 future	
projects	 is	 encouraging,	 and	 includes	
a	 large	 project	 with	 a	 fleet	 operator	 in	
Asia	 to	 carry	 out	 a	 large-scale	 research	
study	 and	 then	 help	 them	 to	 build	
a	 fatigue	 management	 system.	 This	
is	 a	 first	 for	 the	 region. The	 Baines	 Simmons	 team	 is	 driven	 by	 our	
passion	 to	 make	 the	 skies	 safer	 for	 all

Chairman’s introduction to governance
UK Corporate Governance Code
The	 Board	 supports	 the	 principles	 and	 provisions	
set	 out	 in	 the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	 issued	
by	 the	 Financial	 Reporting	 Council	 in	 September	
2014	 (the	 Code).	 Our	 duty	 is	 to	 manage	 the	 Group	
in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Code,	 and	 we	 believe	 that,	
throughout	 the	 year,	 the	 Company	 applied	 the	
main	 principles	 of	 the	 Code,	 and	 complied	 with	
its	 provisions.	 We	 have	 structured	 our	 corporate	
governance	 report	 in	 line	 with	 the	 Code’s	 principles,	
and	 you	 will	 find	 the	 relevant	 compliance	 statements	
highlighted	 in	 each	 section.

Dear Shareholder
As	 announced	 on	 2	 February,	 I	 will	 be	 stepping	 down	 after	
five	 years	 as	 Chairman.	 I	 am	 proud	 to	 have	 served	 as	 your	
Chairman,	 guiding	 the	 Board	 and	 supporting	 the	 management	
team	 during	 both	 tough	 and,	 I	 am	 pleased	 to	 say,	 more	
buoyant	 times	 in	 recent	 years.	
Our focus this year
We	 have	 been	 active	 on	 the	 acquisition	 front	 and	 a	 considerable	
amount	 of	 our	 effort	 as	 a	 Board	 has	 been	 spent	 scrutinising	
proposals	 and	 due	 diligence	 necessary	 to	 ensure	 that	 proposed	
acquisitions	 meet	 the	 high	 standards	 our	 shareholders	 expect.	
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 welcome	 Clockwork	 Research,	 leaders	 in	 fatigue	
risk	 management,	 to	 the	 Group	 (see	 page	 17).	 Another	 key	
area	 of	 focus	 has	 been	 IT.	 The	 Board	 has	 approved	 investment	
in	 technology	 platforms	 that	 will	 significantly	 enhance	 our	
current	 operations	 while	 also	 setting	 up	 our	 systems	 to	 enable	
us	 to	 integrate	 our	 acquisitions	 seamlessly.	
A new programme of Board visits
With	 the	 expanding	 geographical	 footprint	 of	 the	 Group,	 for	
the	 first	 time	 this	 year	 we	 decided	 to	 hold	 two	 Board	 meetings	
outside	 the	 UK,	 one	 in	 Paris	 and	 one	 in	 Fort	 Lauderdale,	
Florida.	 Visiting	 our	 sites	 and	 meeting	 our	 people	 is	
enormously	 valuable;	 what	 we	 learn	 about	 the	 Group	
in	 a	 short	 visit	 is	 worth	 hours	 of	 time	 in	 the	 boardroom.	
Board changes
During	 the	 year,	 we	 welcomed	 Shaun	 Smith	 and	 Amanda	 Wills	
to	 the	 Board	 as	 independent	 non-executive	 directors.	 We	 also	
said	 farewell	 to	 Andrew	 Wood	 at	 our	 2016	 AGM	 and	 Peter	
Saunders	 replaced	 him	 as	 our	 Senior	 Independent	 Director.	
Later	 in	 the	 year,	 on	 8	 September	 2016,	 we	 welcomed	 Richard	
Jackson	 to	 the	 Board.	 Richard	 served	 at	 the	 Civil	 Aviation	
Authority	 for	 11	 years	 as	 group	 director	 of	 consumer	
protection,	 and	 was	 instrumental	 in	 the	 introduction	 of	 new	
ATOL	 regulations	 and	 the	 ATOL	 Protection	 Contribution	 and	
oversaw	 the	 restructuring	 of	 a	 number	 of	 major	 tour	 operators.	
Richard	 began	 his	 career	 with	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Defence	 in	 1974	
before	 joining	 the	 financial	 services	 sector.	 Richard	 also	 acts	
as	 consultant	 to	 a	 number	 of	 aviation	 and	 travel-related	 clients.
Following	 my	 decision	 to	 stand	 down	 as	 Chairman	 after	 the	
AGM	 in	 June,	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 conducted	 a	 selection	
process	 as	 set	 out	 on	 page	 50.	 I	 am	 pleased	 that	 Peter	 Saunders	
will	 take	 up	 the	 role	 as	 Chairman	 after	 the	 conclusion	 of	 the	
AGM	 on	 28	 June.	
We	 have	 once	 again	 undertaken	 a	 Board	 performance	 evaluation	
exercise.	 Because	 of	 the	 changes	 in	 the	 Board’s	 composition	
during	 the	 year,	 we	 decided	 it	 was	 more	 appropriate,	 as	 well	
as	 cost	 effective,	 to	 carry	 out	 an	 internal	 evaluation	 rather	 than	
an	 externally	 facilitated	 exercise,	 as	 discussed	 on	 page	 50.
I	 am	 confident	 that	 I	 will	 be	 leaving	 Air	 Partner	 with	 a	 renewed	
Board	 and	 a	 revitalised	 senior	 management	 team.	 I	 have	 every	
confidence	 that	 together	 they	 will	 bring	 to	 fruition	 the	 exciting	
transformation	 journey	 set	 out	 in	 this	 report.

Leadership
UK Corporate Governance Code
A. Leadership
A.1 The role of the Board
The	 Board’s	 role	 is	 to	 provide	 entrepreneurial	 leadership	 to	 the	
Group	 within	 a	 framework	 of	 prudent	 and	 effective	 controls	 which	
enables	 risk	 to	 be	 assessed	 and	 managed.	 The	 Board	 sets	 the	
Group’s	 strategic	 aims	 and	 ensures	 that	 the	 necessary	 resources	 are	
in	 place	 to	 achieve	 those	 aims.	 The	 Board	 met	 formally	 eight	 times	
during	 the	 year.	 There	 is	 a	 clear	 schedule	 of	 matters	 reserved	 for	 the	
Board,	 together	 with	 delegated	 authorities	 throughout	 the	 Group.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
The	 roles	 of	 the	 Chairman	 and	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 Officer	 are	
clearly	 defined.	 The	 Chairman,	 Richard	 Everitt,	 is	 responsible	 for	
the	 leadership	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Board.	 The	 Chief	 Executive	
Officer,	 Mark	 Briffa,	 is	 responsible	 for	 leading	 the	 day-to-day	
management	 of	 the	 Group	 in	 line	 with	 the	 strategy	 set	 by	 the	
Board.		 Roles	 and	 responsibilities	 of	 key	 Board	 members	 are	
available	 online	 at	 www.airpartner.com.
A.3 The role of the Chairman
The	 Chairman	 sets	 the	 agendas	 for	 the	 Board	 meetings,	 manages	
the	 meeting	 timetable	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 Company	 Secretary	
and	 promotes	 open	 and	 constructive	 debate	 between	 executive	
directors	 and	 non-executive	 directors	 during	 meetings.
A.4 The role of non-executive directors
The	 Chairman	 actively	 invites	 the	 non-executive	 directors’	 views.	
They	 scrutinise	 the	 performance	 of	 management	 against	 agreed	
goals	 and	 provide	 objective	 and	 constructive	 challenge	 to	 the	
executive	 directors.	 They	 attend	 an	 annual	 strategy	 day	 with	
the	 Operating	 Board	 and	 help	 develop	 proposals	 on	 strategy.	
If	 a	 director	 had	 a	 concern	 which	 could	 not	 be	 resolved	 about	 the	
running	 of	 the	 Company	 or	 a	 proposed	 action,	 they	 would	 ensure	
that	 their	 concerns	 were	 recorded	 in	 the	 Board	 minutes.	 The	
non-executive	 directors	 have	 discussions	 without	 the	 executive	
directors	 present.	
Mark	 Briffa	 and	 Neil	 Morris	 are	 not	 members	 of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 or	 Remuneration	 Committee	 but	 attend	 meetings	
when	 appropriate	 by	 invitation.	 Other	 senior	 executives	 are	 regularly	 invited	 to	 attend	 meetings	 for	 specific	 items.

Role of the Board
It	 is	 the	 Board’s	 role	 to	 ensure	 the	 effective	 direction	 and

all	 shareholders.	 The	 application	 of	 standards	 of	 corporate

circumstance	 is	 an	 important	 part	 of	 that	 role.
The	 Board	 sets	 the	 strategic	 aims	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 rigorously	
reviews	 trading	 performance	 against	 strategic	 initiatives,	
and	 against	 financial	 targets	 set	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year.

and	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 appointment	 of	 new	 members	 to	
the	 Board.	 The	 Board	 meets	 formally	 at	 least	 five	 times	 a	 year	
with	 additional	 meetings	 as	 necessary.
A	 formal	 schedule	 of	 matters	 is	 reserved	 for	 Board	 decision,	
including	 formulation	 and	 development	 of	 strategy,	 major	
acquisitions	 or	 disposals,	 significant	 bank	 borrowings,	 Board-
level	 appointments,	 the	 approval	 of	 financial	 reports	 and	
price-sensitive	 statements	 and	 overall	 business	 risk	 assessment.	
A	 copy	 of	 the	 schedule	 is	 available	 online	 at	 www.airpartner.com.	
The	 Board	 receives	 reports	 at	 each	 meeting	 from	 the	 Chief	
Executive	 Officer,	 the	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	 and,	 following

B. Effectiveness
B.1 The composition of the Board
When	 making	 appointments	 to	 the	 Board,	
the	 Board	 and	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	
consider	 the	 wide	 range	 of	 skills,	 knowledge,	
experience	 and	 independence	 required	 to	
maintain	 an	 effective	 Board.	
B.2 Board appointments
The	 Board	 is	 responsible	 for	 the	 appointment	
of	 executive	 directors.	 Succession	 planning	
and	 the	 appointment	 of	 new	 non-executive	
directors	 to	 the	 Board	 is	 led	 by	 the	
Nomination	 Committee.	 The	 Nomination	
Committee	 report	 is	 on	 page	 50	 and	 gives	
details	 of	 the	 recruitment	 process	 and	
appointment	 of	 Richard	 Jackson	 as	
independent	 non-executive	 director	 on	
8	 September	 2016.	 As	 the	 Chairman	 should	
not	 chair	 the	 nomination	 committee	 when	
it	 is	 dealing	 with	 the	 appointment	 of	
a	 successor	 to	 the	 chairmanship,	 a	 sub-
committee	 of	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	
conducted	 the	 Chairman	 succession	 process	
and	 recommended	 to	 the	 Board	 that	
Peter	 Saunders	 be	 appointed	 as	 the	 new	
Chairman.	 The	 Board	 approved	 the	
recommendation	 and	 the	 appointment	
of	 Peter	 Saunders	 as	 Chairman	 will	 take	
effect	 immediately	 following	 the	 conclusion	
of	 the	 2017	 AGM	 on	 28	 June.	
B.3 Commitment
When	 appointed,	 directors	 are	 informed	 of	
the	 time	 commitment	 expected	 from	 them.	
A	 copy	 of	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 of	 the	
appointment	 of	 the	 non-executive	 directors	
is	 available	 for	 inspection	 at	 the	 Company’s	
registered	 office	 during	 normal	 business	
hours	 and	 at	 the	 AGM.	
B.4 Development
Newly	 appointed	 Board	 members	 receive	
a	 full	 and	 tailored	 induction.	 Following	 this	
induction,	 meetings	 are	 arranged	 with	
key	 executives	 and	 managers	 within	 the	
business	 to	 provide	 ongoing	 education	 and	
information	 about	 the	 business	 and	 each	
non-executive	 director	 attends	 one	 Operating	
Board	 meeting	 each	 year.	 All	 directors	 attend	
an	 annual	 Strategy	 Day	 with	 the	 Operating	
Board	 and	 other	 senior	 managers.
B.5 Information and support
The	 Chairman,	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	
Company	 Secretary,	 ensures	 that	 all	 Board	
members	 receive	 accurate	 and	 timely	
information.	 The	 Board	 ensures	 that	 all	
directors	 have	 access	 to	 independent	
professional	 advice	 at	 the	 Company’s	
expense	 where	 they	 judge	 it	 necessary	 to	
discharge	 their	 responsibilities	 as	 directors.	
All	 directors	 have	 access	 to	 the	 advice	 and	
services	 of	 the	 Company	 Secretary.
B.6 Board evaluation
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Board	 and	 its	
committees	 undertook	 an	 evaluation	
of	 their	 performance.	 The	 non-executive	
directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 performance	
evaluation	 of	 the	 Chairman	 taking	 into	
account	 the	 views	 of	 the	 executive	 directors.
B.7 Re-election of the directors 
All	 directors	 are	 subject	 to	 election	 by	
shareholders	 at	 the	 first	 AGM	 after	 their	
appointment	 and	 to	 annual	 re-election	
thereafter.
Composition of the Board
The	 composition	 of	 the	 Board	 is	 shown	 on	 page	 42.
Board changes
As	 stated	 in	 the	 2016	 Annual	 Report,	 Andrew	 Wood	 resigned	
as	 a	 non-executive	 director	 of	 the	 Company	 at	 the	 conclusion	
of	 the	 AGM	 on	 29	 June	 2016.	 During	 the	 year,	 the	 following	
appointments	 were	 made	 to	 the	 Board:
•	Amanda	 Wills	 on	 20	 April	 2016
•	Shaun	 Smith	 on	 1	 May	 2016
•	Richard	 Jackson	 on	 8	 September	 2016.
Following	 Andrew’s	 retirement	 from	 the	 Board,	 Peter	 Saunders	
was	 appointed	 as	 Senior	 Independent	 Director	 and	 Shaun	 Smith	
was	 appointed	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee.
After	 12	 years	 on	 the	 Board	 and	 five	 years	 as	 Chairman,	
Richard	 Everitt	 has	 decided	 to	 step	 down	 as	 Chairman	 and	
therefore	 will	 not	 stand	 for	 re-election	 at	 the	 2017	 AGM.	 Full	
details	 regarding	 the	 process	 to	 select	 his	 successor	 together	
with	 the	 appointment	 of	 the	 new	 non-executive	 directors	 are	
set	 out	 in	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 report	 on	 page	 50.	
Independence of non-executive directors
The	 Board	 considers	 all	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 to	 be	
independent.	 Given	 their	 relatively	 small	 shareholdings,	 the	
Board	 does	 not	 believe	 that	 these	 impact	 on	 the	 independence	
of	 Richard	 Everitt,	 Peter	 Saunders	 or	 Shaun	 Smith.	
Board performance evaluation
The	 Company	 continues	 each	 year	 to	 evaluate	 the	
performance	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 its	 committees.	 Because	 of	 the	
changes	 in	 the	 Board’s	 composition	 during	 the	 year,	 it	 was	
decided	 that	 it	 was	 more	 appropriate,	 as	 well	 as	 cost	 effective	
and	 pragmatic,	 to	 carry	 out	 an	 internal	 review	 rather	 than	 an	
externally	 facilitated	 evaluation	 exercise.	 Therefore	 the	
Board’s	 effectiveness	 was	 assessed	 internally	 by	 way	 of	
a	 questionnaire	 completed	 by	 Board	 members.	 The	 responses	
to	 the	 questionnaires	 were	 evaluated	 by	 the	 Chairman	 and	 the	
Company	 Secretary	 and	 a	 report	 was	 prepared	 for	 the	 Board.	
The	 Board	 confirms	 its	 belief	 that	 all	 directors	 bring	 significant	
value	 to	 the	 business,	 are	 effective	 in	 Board	 decision	 making	
and	 show	 the	 appropriate	 level	 of	 commitment	 to	 their	 roles.	
Election and re-election of directors
Following	 his	 appointment	 to	 the	 Board	 on	 8	 September	 2016,	
Richard	 Jackson	 will	 stand	 for	 election	 at	 this	 year’s	 AGM.	 The	
Board	 recommends	 the	 election	 of	 Richard	 Jackson	 as	 listed	
in	 the	 separate	 Notice	 of	 Annual	 General	 Meeting.
In	 accordance	 with	 best	 practice,	 all	 other	 directors	 will	 resign	
at	 the	 2017	 AGM	 and	 stand	 for	 re-election,	 with	 the	 exception	
of	 Richard	 Everitt	 who,	 as	 previously	 explained,	 is	 standing	
down	 from	 the	 Board.

The	 Board	 is	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 fair,	 balanced	 and	
understandable	 financial	 information.	 The	 strategic	 report	 is	 set	
out	 on	 pages	 1	 to	 39	 inclusive	 and	 this	 provides	 information	 about	
the	 performance	 of	 the	 Group,	 the	 business	 model,	 strategy	 and	
the	 risks	 and	 uncertainties	 relating	 to	 the	 Group’s	 business.	
C.2 Risk management and internal control systems

on	 pages	 51	 to	 53.
C.3 The role of the Audit and Risk Committee
The	 activities	 of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee,	 which	 assists	 the	
Board	 with	 its	 responsibilities	 for	 monitoring	 and	 reviewing	 the	
effectiveness	 of	 internal	 control	 and	 risk	 management	 systems,	
internal	 audit	 and	 the	 external	 auditor,	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Audit	
and	 Risk	 Committee	 report	 on	 pages	 51	 to	 53.	 The	 terms	 of	
reference	 of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 are	 available	 online	
at	 www.airpartner.com.	 The	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 as	
a	 whole	 has	 competence	 relevant	 to	 the	 sector	 in	 which	 the	
Company	 operates.
Risk management and internal control
During	 the	 year,	 the	 full	 Board	 was	 responsible	 for	 the	
Group’s	 system	 of	 risk	 management	 and	 internal	 control	 and	
for	 reviewing	 its	 effectiveness,	 though	 reports	 are	 provided	
in	 the	 first	 instance	 to	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 by	 the	
Chief	 Financial	 Officer.	 The	 Board	 has	 established	 an	 ongoing	
process	 for	 identifying,	 evaluating	 and	 managing	 significant	
risk.	 This	 process	 is	 reviewed	 regularly	 by	 the	 Board.	
The	 key	 internal	 procedures	 in	 place	 for	 the	 year	 ended	
31	 January	 2017	 and	 up	 to	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 the	 Annual	
Report	 are	 as	 follows:
•	a	 detailed	 and	 comprehensive	 annual	 budget	 is	 produced	
and	 formally	 approved	 by	 the	 Board
•	the	 Board	 maintains	 a	 schedule	 of	 key	 matters	 reserved	
for	 its	 approval,	 which	 include	 financing	 and	 changes	 to	
banking	 arrangements,	 all	 significant	 capital	 expenditure	
and	 all	 acquisitions	 and	 disposals
•	both	 the	 Board	 and	 the	 Operating	 Board	 receive	 monthly	
financial	 reports,	 showing	 the	 performance	 of	 each	 division	
and	 country,	 with	 relevant	 commentaries	 to	 highlight	
variance	 from	 budget	 or	 particular	 areas	 of	 concern
•	business	 performance	 reports	 are	 circulated	 to	 the	
Operating	 Board	 on	 a	 weekly	 basis	 for	 sales	 bookings,	
and	 monthly	 to	 monitor	 overall	 performance
•	clearly	 defined	 authority	 limits	 and	 controls	 are	 in	 place	
over	 contract	 signing	 limits,	 purchasing	 commitments	 and	
the	 extension	 of	 credit	 to	 clients;	 in	 particular,	 brokers	
operate	 within	 individual,	 pre-set	 limits	 of	 authority	
and	 only	 those	 staff	 who	 have	 successfully	 completed	
a	 six-month	 probationary	 period	 can	 sign	 charter	
commitments	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Group.	 Adherence	 to	 these	
limits	 and	 controls	 are	 tested	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis	 as	 part	
of	 the	 internal	 audit	 process
•	each	 of	 the	 Group’s	 major	 offices	 is	 visited	 at	 least	 once	
a	 year	 by	 a	 senior	 member	 of	 the	 finance	 team
•	the	 Company	 has	 a	 robust	 risk	 management	 process	 that	
follows	 a	 sequence	 of	 risk	 identification,	 assessment	 of	
probability	 and	 impact,	 and	 assigns	 an	 owner	 to	 manage	
mitigation	 activities.	 A	 risk	 register	 is	 monitored	 by	 senior	
management	 and	 reported	 to	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee.	
The	 risk	 register	 and	 the	 methodology	 applied	 is	 the	 subject	
of	 continuous	 review	 by	 senior	 management	 and	 updated	
to	 reflect	 new	 and	 developing	 areas	 which	 might	 impact	
business	 strategy.	 The	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 actively	
reviews	 the	 risk	 register	 and	 assesses	 the	 actions	 being	
taken	 by	 senior	 management	 to	 monitor	 and	 mitigate	 the	
risks.	 Those	 risks	 which	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 the	 principal	
risks	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 presented	 on	 pages	 18	 to	 21
•	the	 Group	 does	 not	 trade	 speculatively	 in	 derivatives.	
Other	 than	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts,	 the	 Group	
does	 not	 use	 complex	 treasury	 instruments	 in	 the	 normal	
course	 of	 business	 and	 any	 specific	 projects	 that	 may	
involve	 such	 instruments	 require	 Board	 approval.	
The	 Board	 confirms	 that	 it	 has	 complied	 with	 the	 Code	 with	
regard	 to	 its	 responsibilities	 relating	 to	 risk	 management	 and	
internal	 controls.
The	 directors	 reviewed	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Group’s	
internal	 control	 and	 risk	 management	 systems	 during	 the	 year.	
In	 their	 review,	 which	 covered	 all	 material	 controls	 including	
financial,	 operational	 and	 compliance	 controls,	 the	 directors	
considered	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 Group’s	 business,	 the	 risks	 to	
which	 that	 particular	 business	 is	 exposed,	 the	 likelihood	 of	
such	 risks	 occurring	 and	 the	 costs	 of	 protecting	 against	 them.	
However,	 such	 a	 system	 is	 designed	 to	 manage	 rather	 than	
eliminate	 the	 risk	 of	 failure	 to	 achieve	 business	 objectives,	
and	 can	 only	 provide	 reasonable,	 and	 not	 absolute,	 assurance.	
Whistleblowing
A	 whistleblowing	 policy	 is	 in	 place	 across	 the	 Group	 to	 enable	
members	 of	 staff	 to	 bring	 to	 the	 attention	 of	 any	 director	
serious	 matters	 of	 financial	 misconduct	 which	 they	 believe	
would	 damage	 the	 performance	 or	 reputation	 of	 the	 Company.

Dear Shareholder
The	 principal	 purpose	 of	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	
(the	 Committee)	 is	 to	 lead	 the	 process	 for	 the	 appointment	
of	 new	 non-executive	 directors	 to	 the	 Board.	
Membership	 will	 vary	 but	 the	 terms	 of	 reference	 for	 the	
Committee	 have	 been	 agreed	 by	 the	 Board	 and	 are	 available	
online	 at	 www.airpartner.com.	 The	 Committee	 is	 made	 up	
of	 three	 directors,	 including	 one	 executive	 director.
When	 proposing	 appointments	 of	 non-executive	 directors,	 the	
Committee	 considers	 the	 independence,	 skills,	 knowledge	 and	
experience	 that	 a	 candidate	 possesses	 compared	 to	 the	 skill	
sets	 and	 experience	 of	 the	 Board	 as	 it	 currently	 stands.	 Selection	
of	 candidates	 also	 takes	 into	 consideration	 the	 breadth	 of	
knowledge	 that	 the	 Board	 has	 and	 that	 it	 may	 require	 to	
provide	 a	 well-balanced	 environment	 which	 encourages	
scrutiny	 and	 appropriate	 challenge	 of	 executive	 management.
Changes to non-executive roles
As	 set	 out	 in	 the	 2016	 Annual	 Report,	 the	 Nomination	
Committee	 made	 up	 of	 myself,	 Peter	 Saunders	 and	 Mark	 Briffa	
recommended	 to	 the	 Board	 that	 Amanda	 Wills	 be	 appointed	
as	 a	 non-executive	 director.	 Amanda	 was	 appointed	 to	 the	
Board	 with	 effect	 from	 20	 April	 2016.
Following	 Andrew	 Wood’s	 decision	 to	 step	 down	 as	 a	 non-
executive	 director	 after	 the	 2016	 AGM,	 the	 Committee	 also	
sought	 a	 non-executive	 director	 with	 the	 appropriate	
expertise	 to	 replace	 Andrew	 as	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	
Committee.	 Following	 consultation	 with	 its	 advisers,	 a	 number	
of	 recommendations	 were	 put	 forward	 and	 after	 careful	
consideration	 of	 candidates	 against	 criteria	 and	 interviews	 by	
each	 member	 of	 the	 Committee	 and	 the	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer,	
the	 Committee	 recommended	 to	 the	 Board	 that	 Shaun	 Smith	
be	 appointed	 as	 a	 non-executive	 director.	 Shaun	 joined	 the	
Board	 on	 1	 May	 2016	 and	 was	 appointed	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Audit	
and	 Risk	 Committee	 on	 29	 June	 2016.
Later	 in	 the	 year,	 the	 Nomination	 Committee	 made	 up	 of	
myself,	 Peter	 Saunders	 and	 Mark	 Briffa	 made	 a	 decision	 to	
seek	 a	 further	 non-executive	 director	 with	 expertise	 in	 the	
aviation	 sector	 to	 assist	 the	 Board	 in	 its	 acquisition	 strategy.	
The	 Committee	 consulted	 with	 its	 advisers	 to	 obtain	
recommendations	 for	 suitable	 candidates.	 After	 consideration	
of		 candidates	 against	 criteria	 and	 interviews	 with	 each	
member	 of	 the	 Committee	 and	 the	 wider	 Board,	 the	 Committee	
recommended	 to	 the	 Board	 that	 Richard	 Jackson	 be	 appointed	
as	 a	 non-executive	 director.	 Richard	 was	 appointed	 to	 the	
Board	 on	 8	 September	 2016.	
Chairman succession
As	 announced	 on	 2	 February,	 I	 will	 stand	 down	 from	 the	
Board	 after	 the	 AGM	 in	 June	 2017.	 The	 Nomination	 Committee	
appointed	 a	 sub-committee	 to	 conduct	 a	 process	 to	 select	
a	 new	 Chairman.	 It	 comprised	 our	 independent	 non-executive	
directors	 Shaun	 Smith	 and	 Amanda	 Wills,	 who	 appointed	
external	 search	 consultants,	 Ridgeway	 Partners,	 to	 support	
them.	 The	 sub-committee	 prepared	 a	 detailed	 specification	
for	 the	 role	 of	 Chairman,	 specifying	 the	 skills,	 knowledge,	
experience	 and	 attributes	 required.	 They	 then	 conducted	
a	 robust	 process	 involving	 discussions	 with	 existing	 directors	
and	 advisers,	 followed	 by	 interviews	 with	 the	 potential	
candidates.	 Ridgeway	 Partners	 also	 carried	 out	 detailed	
research	 into	 the	 candidates	 and	 made	 recommendations	
to	 the	 sub-committee.	 The	 decision-making	 process	 did	 not	
involve	 myself,	 Peter	 Saunders	 who	 was	 a	 candidate,	 or	 the	
Chief	 Executive	 Officer,	 Mark	 Briffa	 as	 he	 will	 report	 to	 the	
new	 Chairman.
Following	 this	 process,	 the	 Committee	 recommended	 to	 the	
Board	 that	 Peter	 Saunders	 be	 appointed	 as	 Chairman	 and	
the	 Board	 approved	 the	 recommendation	 on	 26	 April	 2017.
Peter	 has	 been	 a	 non-executive	 director	 of	 the	 Company	 since	
September	 2014,	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	
since	 March	 2015	 and	 Senior	 Independent	 Director	 since	 June	
2016.	 He	 will	 take	 up	 the	 role	 of	 Chairman	 immediately	 after	
the	 AGM	 on	 28	 June	 2017.
Diversity
The	 Company	 is	 a	 team	 made	 up	 of	 people	 with	 a	 broad	
range	 of	 backgrounds.	 Our	 policy	 is	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 best	
candidate	 is	 selected	 to	 join	 the	 Board;	 this	 policy	 will	 remain	
in	 place	 going	 forward	 and	 the	 Board	 does	 not	 intend	 to	 adopt	
a	 quota	 system	 with	 prescriptive,	 quantitative	 targets.	
Instructions	 to	 any	 external	 adviser	 conducting	 a	 search	 for	
appropriate	 candidates	 require	 them	 to	 search	 for	 candidates	
from	 as	 many	 different	 backgrounds	 as	 possible.

Dear Shareholder
The	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 (the	 Committee)	 supports	
the	 Board	 in	 maintaining	 sound	 internal	 control	 and	 risk

appropriate	 corporate	 reporting,	 risk	 management	 and	 internal

regularly	 to	 the	 Board.	
The	 Committee’s	 principal	 duties	 are	 to	 monitor	 the	 integrity	
of	 the	 Company’s	 financial	 statements,	 to	 review	 the	
consistency	 of,	 and	 any	 changes	 to,	 accounting	 policies	 and	
standards,	 to	 review	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 the	 effectiveness	
of	 audit	 procedures	 and	 the	 work	 of	 the	 internal	 and	 external	
auditor	 and	 to	 monitor	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 the	 systems	 for	
risk	 management	 and	 internal	 financial	 control.	 The	 Board	
as	 a	 whole	 is	 responsible	 for	 internal	 control	 and	 risk	
management.	 The	 Committee	 is	 required	 to	 report	 its	 findings	
to	 the	 Board,	 making	 any	 necessary	 recommendations	 for	
action	 or	 improvements.	
The	 Committee	 reviewed	 and	 revised	 its	 terms	 of	 reference	
during	 the	 year	 under	 review.	 Its	 terms	 of	 reference	 can	 be	
found	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	 www.airpartner.com.
Robust review of risk
The	 Committee	 acts	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 to	 review	 the	
effectiveness	 of	 the	 internal	 control	 system	 and	 risk	
management	 processes	 on	 a	 regular	 and	 ongoing	 basis.
The	 Committee	 undertook	 this	 review	 process	 throughout	 the	
year	 and	 subsequent	 to	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 to	 include	 the	
date	 of	 approval	 of	 this	 Annual	 Report.	
At	 each	 meeting,	 the	 Committee	 receives	 an	 update	 from	 the	
CFO	 on	 any	 material	 matters	 together	 with	 a	 report	 from	 the	
Group’s	 internal	 audit	 process.	 The	 external	 auditor,	 Deloitte	 LLP,	
presents	 its	 findings	 to	 the	 Committee	 twice	 a	 year,	 specifically	
after	 the	 half-year	 review	 and	 following	 the	 year-end	 audit	
process.	 Issues	 reviewed	 by	 the	 Committee	 are	 detailed	 below.
Membership
The	 Committee	 is	 made	 up	 of	 the	 non-executive	 directors:
Shaun	 Smith	 (Chairman)
Richard	 Everitt
Richard	 Jackson
Peter	 Saunders
Amanda	 Wills
Shaun	 Smith	 was	 appointed	 to	 the	 Committee	 on	 his	
appointment	 as	 a	 non-executive	 director	 on	 1	 May	 2016	 and	
appointed	 as	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee	 on	 29	 June	 2016	
when	 the	 former	 Committee	 Chairman,	 Andrew	 Wood	 stepped	
down	 as	 a	 non-executive	 director.	 Richard	 Jackson	 joined	 the	
Committee	 after	 his	 appointment	 as	 a	 non-executive	
director	 on	 8	 September	 2016.
The	 Board	 is	 satisfied	 that	 Committee	 members	 have	 the	
appropriate	 level	 of	 expertise	 to	 fulfil	 its	 Terms	 of	 Reference.	
The	 Chairman,	 Shaun	 Smith,	 a	 qualified	 Corporate	 Treasurer	
with	 an	 Honours	 degree	 in	 Economics,	 is	 considered	 to	 have	
recent	 and	 relevant	 financial	 experience.	 The	 Committee	 as	
a	 whole	 is	 considered	 to	 have	 competence	 relevant	 to	 the	
aviation	 and	 travel	 sector.	 Biographies	 of	 the	 non-executive	
directors	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 42.	
Although	 not	 members,	 the	 external	 auditor,	 Deloitte	 LLP	
(Deloitte),	 the	 Chief	 Executive	 Officer	 and	 the	 Chief	 Financial	
Officer	 are	 notified	 of	 all	 meetings	 and	 may	 attend	 by	 invitation.	
At	 each	 meeting,	 the	 Committee	 has	 the	 opportunity	 to	 talk	 to	
the	 external	 auditor	 without	 the	 CEO	 or	 the	 CFO	 being	 present.	
Deloitte	 attended	 all	 meetings	 during	 the	 year.
Meetings
The	 attendance	 of	 directors	 at	 the	 meetings	 of	 the	 Committee	
is	 set	 out	 on	 page	 45.	 The	 Committee	 met	 four	 times	 during	
the	 year.	
In	 addition	 to	 reviewing	 the	 interim	 and	 annual	 results	
announcements	 in	 advance	 of	 publication	 and	 planning	 for	
the	 annual	 statutory	 audit,	 the	 Committee	 has	 focused	 on	 the	
process	 for	 risk	 management	 and	 continues	 to	 review	 internal	
control	 developments.
Significant issues related to the financial statements
The	 significant	 accounting	 and	 audit	 matters	 considered	 by	
the	 Committee	 and	 discussed	 with	 the	 external	 auditor	 during	
the	 year	 and	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 31	 January	 2017	 year	 end	 were:	
Roll-out of new contract approval policy
As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 change	 in	 revenue	 recognition	 policy	
adopted	 in	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2016,	 the	 Group	
has	 undertaken	 a	 full	 review	 of	 its	 contract	 approval	 policy	
resulting	 in	 the	 launch	 of	 a	 new	 policy	 during	 the	 year	 to	
ensure	 contracts	 that	 are	 principal	 in	 nature	 can	 be	 identified	
by	 management.	 Given	 this	 new	 policy	 was	 adopted	 during	 the	
financial	 year,	 management	 have	 also	 applied	 a	 retrospective	
review	 process	 to	 ensure	 such	 contracts	 are	 captured.
Revenue recognition
During	 the	 previous	 year,	 the	 directors	 reviewed	 the	 Group’s	
revenue	 recognition	 methodology	 with	 the	 conclusion	 being	
that	 it	 was	 more	 appropriate	 to	 recognise	 the	 majority	 of	 the	
Group’s	 contracts	 on	 an	 agency	 basis.	 The	 new	 contract	
approval	 policy,	 as	 described	 above,	 was	 introduced	 as	 a	 way	
of	 ensuring	 any	 contracts	 that	 are	 principal	 in	 nature	 are	
captured	 appropriately	 by	 management.

In	 addition,	 Air	 Partner’s	 internal	 quality	 control	 function	
assesses	 aircraft	 operators	 prior	 to	 selection	 to	 ensure	 that	
only	 operators	 of	 the	 highest	 quality	 are	 used.	 Further	 to	
ensuring	 the	 completeness	 of	 the	 provisions	 against	 pre-
payments,	 the	 Committee	 sought	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 control	
procedures	 pertaining	 to	 the	 authorisation	 of	 payments	 to	
operators	 were	 complied	 with	 via	 the	 internal	 audit	 process.
Completeness of operator accruals
When	 revenues	 and	 costs	 for	 air	 charter	 contracts	 are	 initially	
recognised,	 estimates	 may	 need	 to	 be	 made	 in	 order	 to	 accrue	
items	 of	 income	 and	 expenditure	 that	 have	 not	 been	 invoiced.	
These	 estimates	 may	 differ	 from	 the	 actual	 outcome.	 Judgement	
is	 exercised	 when	 assessing	 the	 level	 of	 provisions	 necessary	
and	 the	 Committee	 requires	 that	 prudent	 but	 reasonable	
discretion	 is	 exercised	 on	 matters	 of	 judgement.	 The	 Committee	
determined	 that	 the	 level	 of	 accruals	 was	 reasonable	 following	
a	 detailed	 review	 of	 the	 controls	 and	 the	 level	 of	 accruals	 in	
relation	 to	 trading	 activity	 in	 the	 period	 before	 year	 end.	
Finalisation of purchase price allocation relating to the acquisition 
of Baines Simmons Limited
During	 the	 previous	 financial	 year,	 the	 Group	 acquired	 Baines	
Simmons	 Limited.	 There	 is	 significant	 judgement	 required	 in	
the	 valuation	 of	 the	 intangibles,	 and	 accordingly	 the	 initial	
recognition	 was	 made	 on	 a	 provisional	 basis.	 The	 purchase	
price	 allocation	 was	 revised	 during	 the	 year,	 which	 resulted	 in	
a	 change	 to	 the	 values	 of	 intangibles	 and	 goodwill	 recognised.	
A	 third-party	 specialist	 was	 engaged	 to	 perform	 both	 the	
initial	 and	 subsequent	 purchase	 price	 allocation.	
The valuation of goodwill and intangible assets created 
through acquisitions
During	 the	 year,	 there	 was	 a	 potential	 indicator	 of	 impairment	 in	
the	 consulting	 and	 training	 cash	 generating	 unit	 (CGU)	 of	 Baines	
Simmons	 Limited.	 Having	 performed	 a	 full	 impairment	 review	
exercise,	 it	 was	 the	 view	 of	 management	 that	 no	 impairment	
of	 the	 goodwill	 or	 other	 intangibles	 related	 to	 this	 CGU.	 There	
were	 no	 issues	 arising	 from	 any	 other	 impairment	 review	
performed	 in	 respect	 of	 other	 goodwill	 or	 intangible	 assets.
External audit
Deloitte	 was	 appointed	 as	 the	 Group’s	 external	 auditor	 in	 2011.	
The	 Group’s	 current	 audit	 engagement	 partner	 was	 appointed	
during	 the	 period	 ended	 31	 January	 2014,	 with	 the	 next	 partner	
rotation	 being	 due	 after	 31	 January	 2018.	 The	 timing	 of	 a	
competitive	 tender	 will	 continue	 to	 be	 assessed	 on	 an	 annual	
basis,	 considering	 the	 results	 of	 the	 annual	 effectiveness	 review.
Prior	 to	 the	 audit	 being	 conducted,	 the	 Committee	 considered	
the	 content	 and	 scope	 of	 audit	 work	 and	 the	 audit	 fees	
proposed	 by	 Deloitte	 and	 discussed	 changes	 in	 accounting	
policies	 and	 new	 developments	 within	 the	 business	 which	 might	
affect	 financial	 reporting	 going	 forward.	 A	 formal	 report	 received	
from	 Deloitte,	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 audit	 and	 matters	 arising	 from	
the	 report	 was	 discussed	 prior	 to	 the	 Board’s	 approval	 of	 the	
financial	 statements.	
The	 Committee	 is	 aware	 of	 the	 need	 to	 safeguard	 the	 auditor’s	
objectivity	 and	 independence	 and	 the	 issue	 is	 discussed	
annually	 by	 the	 Committee	 and	 periodically	 with	 the	 audit	
engagement	 partner	 from	 Deloitte.	 In	 addition	 to	 this,	 policies	
on	 the	 award	 of	 non-audit	 work	 to	 the	 external	 auditor	 exist.	
During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2017,	 fees	 of	 £26,000	 were	
paid	 to	 Deloitte	 in	 respect	 of	 non-audit	 services.	 Of	 this	 amount,	
£22,000	 was	 in	 respect	 of	 audit-related	 assurance	 services.
In	 assessing	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 external	 audit	 process	 by	
the	 Committee,	 the	 auditors	 were	 asked	 to	 articulate	 the	 steps	
that	 they	 have	 taken	 to	 ensure	 objectivity	 and	 independence.	
This	 year,	 the	 Committee	 reviewed	 and	 challenged	 the	
external	 audit	 plan	 to	 ensure	 that	 having	 identified	 potential	
areas	 of	 risks,	 Deloitte	 would	 employ	 effective	 audit	
procedures	 to	 examine	 them.	 The	 Committee	 monitors	 the	
auditors’	 performance,	 behaviour	 and	 effectiveness	 during	
the	 exercise	 of	 their	 duties,	 which	 informs	 the	 Committee’s	
decision	 to	 recommend	 reappointment	 on	 an	 annual	 basis.
External auditor effectiveness
The	 Committee	 reviews	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 external	
auditor	 with	 the	 CFO	 at	 the	 end	 of	 each	 audit	 period.	 The	
Committee	 has	 begun	 the	 process	 of	 formally	 assessing	
Deloitte’s	 effectiveness	 by	 asking	 members	 of	 the	 Committee,	
the	 CFO	 and	 individuals	 who	 have	 worked	 with	 Deloitte	 during	
the	 year	 under	 review	 to	 provide	 their	 feedback.	
Deloitte	 has	 indicated	 its	 willingness	 to	 continue	 in	 office	 and	
the	 Committee	 has	 recommended	 Deloitte’s	 appointment	 to	
the	 Board.	 A	 resolution	 to	 reappoint	 Deloitte	 will	 be	 proposed	
at	 the	 2017	 AGM.	
Internal audit
During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2017,	 the	 responsibilities	 of	
the	 internal	 audit	 role	 were	 extended	 to	 include	 audits	 relating	
to	 the	 Group’s	 ISO	 certification.	
The	 findings	 of	 the	 internal	 audit	 work	 programme	 are	
presented	 to	 the	 Committee	 for	 review.	 The	 internal	 audit	
function	 is	 not	 fully	 independent	 of	 management	 as	 it	 is	
currently	 staffed	 by	 senior	 members	 of	 the	 Group	 finance	
function.	 Although	 not	 independent,	 the	 senior	 members	
of	 the	 Group	 finance	 function	 who	 undertake	 the	 work	 are	
considered	 appropriately	 qualified	 to	 undertake	 this	 work.
No	 significant	 deficiencies	 in	 the	 system	 of	 internal	 controls	
were	 identified	 following	 the	 internal	 audit	 review.

Internal audit effectiveness
The	 Code	 and	 the	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference	 require	
the	 Committee	 to	 monitor	 and	 review	 the	 effectiveness	 of	
the	 Company’s	 internal	 audit	 processes.	 The	 Committee	
is	 satisfied	 that	 the	 internal	 audit	 function	 fulfilled	 its	
objectives	 for	 the	 year.
Whistleblowing
The	 Committee	 reviewed	 the	 Group’s	 whistleblowing	 policy,	
known	 as	 the	 Concern	 at	 Work	 Policy,	 which	 is	 in	 place	 to	
enable	 members	 of	 staff	 to	 raise	 concerns	 about	 possible	
improprieties	 in	 matters	 of	 financial	 reporting	 or	 other	 matters	
which	 they	 believe	 would	 damage	 the	 performance	 or	
reputation	 of	 the	 Company.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The	 Board	 sought	 advice	 from	 the	 Committee	 that	 the	
information	 presented	 in	 this	 Annual	 Report,	 when	 taken	 as	
a	 whole,	 is	 fair,	 balanced	 and	 understandable	 and	 contains	
the	 information	 necessary	 for	 shareholders	 to	 assess	 the	
Group’s	 performance,	 business	 model	 and	 strategy.
The	 steps	 taken	 by	 the	 Committee,	 or	 on	 its	 behalf,	 to	 provide	
this	 advice	 to	 the	 Board	 included	 setting	 up	 a	 committee	 of	
senior	 individuals	 within	 the	 Group	 to	 draft	 the	 Annual	 Report,	
with	 each	 of	 these	 individuals	 having	 responsibility	 for	 the	
production	 of	 certain	 sections	 of	 the	 document.
The	 Board	 requested	 that	 the	 Committee	 advise	 on	 whether	
it	 believes	 the	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts,	 taken	 as	 a	 whole,	
is	 fair,	 balanced	 and	 understandable	 and	 provides	 the	
information	 necessary	 for	 shareholders	 to	 assess	 the	
Company’s	 position	 and	 performance,	 business	 model	 and	
strategy.	 The	 Committee	 has	 advised	 the	 Board	 accordingly.
Discharge of responsibilities
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Committee	 has	 continued	 its	 detailed	
scrutiny	 of	 the	 appropriateness	 of	 the	 Group’s	 system	 of	 risk	
management	 and	 internal	 controls,	 and	 the	 robustness	 and	
integrity	 of	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 reporting,	 along	 with	 both	
the	 internal	 and	 external	 audit	 processes.	
The	 Committee	 has	 devoted	 significant	 time	 to	 reviewing	
these	 areas,	 which	 are	 integral	 to	 the	 Group’s	 core	
management	 and	 financial	 processes,	 as	 well	 as	 engaging	
regularly	 with	 management.
The	 Committee	 has,	 where	 necessary,	 taken	 initiative	 in	
requesting	 information	 in	 order	 to	 provide	 the	 appropriate	
constructive	 challenge	 for	 its	 role.	 During	 the	 course	 of	 the	
year,	 the	 information	 that	 the	 Committee	 has	 received	 has	
been	 timely	 and	 clear	 and	 has	 enabled	 the	 Committee	 to	
discharge	 its	 duties	 effectively.

Viability statement
In	 accordance	 with	 provision	 C.2.2	 of	 the	 Code,	 the	 Board	
addressed	 the	 prospects	 of	 the	 Company	 over	 a	 period	 longer	
than	 the	 12	 months	 required	 by	 the	 going	 concern	 provision.	
The	 Board	 conducted	 this	 review	 for	 a	 period	 of	 three	 years,	
which	 was	 selected	 for	 the	 following	 reasons:	
•	 the	 Group’s	 strategic	 plan	 covers	 a	 three-year	 period
•	 the	 variability	 of	 earnings	 means	 that	 forecasting	 beyond	 three	
years	 is	 more	 subjective,	 hence	 the	 Board	 believes	 a	 three-year	
period	 is	 the	 most	 appropriate.
The	 three-year	 strategic	 plan	 considers	 the	 Group’s	 cash	 flows,	
forecasted	 underlying	 profit,	 covenant	 compliance	 and	 investments	
in	 technology.	 These	 metrics	 are	 subject	 to	 sensitivity	 analysis	
which	 involves	 consideration	 of	 downside	 scenarios.	 Where	
possible,	 this	 analysis	 is	 carried	 out	 to	 evaluate	 the	 potential	
impact	 of	 the	 Group’s	 principal	 risks.
The	 three-year	 plan	 is	 underpinned	 by	 regular	 Board	 briefings	
provided	 by	 the	 business	 unit	 heads	 and	 the	 discussion	 of	 any	
new	 strategic	 initiatives	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Board	 in	 its	 normal	
course	 of	 business.	
Based	 on	 the	 results	 of	 this	 analysis,	 the	 Board	 has	 a	 reasonable	
expectation	 that	 the	 Company	 will	 be	 able	 to	 continue	 in	 operation	
and	 meet	 its	 liabilities	 as	 they	 fall	 due	 over	 the	 three-year	 period	
of	 the	 assessment.
Going concern
Having	 considered	 the	 Group’s	 current	 financial	 position,	 the	
factors	 affecting	 its	 cost	 base,	 the	 state	 of	 the	 air	 charter	 and	
aviation	 consultancy	 market	 as	 a	 whole	 and	 forecasts	 for	 a	 period	
of	 not	 less	 than	 12	 months	 from	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 these	
financial	 statements,	 the	 directors	 are	 satisfied	 that	 the	 Group	 and	
Company	 have	 adequate	 resources	 to	 continue	 in	 business	 for	 the	
foreseeable	 future	 and	 that	 the	 Company	 is	 a	 going	 concern.	
Therefore,	 the	 directors	 have	 continued	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	
concern	 basis	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	 financial	 statements. “ Goingforward,wewillsupport,

PETER SAUNDERS
Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee 
54 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Dear Shareholder
On	 behalf	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 (the	 Committee),	
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 present	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 report	 for	
the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2017.	 During	 the	 year,	 I	 was	 pleased	
to	 welcome	 new	 Board	 members,	 Amanda	 Wills,	 Shaun	 Smith	
and	 Richard	 Jackson	 to	 the	 Committee.	 Going	 forward,	 we	 will	
support,	 on	 behalf	 of	 shareholders,	 the	 ongoing	 development	
and	 effective	 governance	 of	 a	 remuneration	 framework	
appropriate	 for	 our	 Group.
I	 have	 set	 out	 in	 my	 statement	 the	 following	 information:
•	the	 Committee’s	 philosophy	 for	 remuneration
•	how	 the	 Committee	 reflects	 employee	 remuneration	
arrangements	 in	 considering	 executive	 remuneration
•	the	 key	 activities	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Committee	 during	
the	 year	
•	the	 key	 areas	 of	 focus	 for	 the	 Committee	 during	 2017/18	
and	 beyond.
Our remuneration philosophy
The	 Group’s	 total	 remuneration	 packages	 are	 designed	 to	
be	 competitive	 to	 attract,	 retain	 and	 motivate	 high-quality	
individuals	 throughout	 the	 business.	 Our	 packages	 aim	 to	
recruit	 talented	 executives	 and	 senior	 managers	 capable	
of	 effectively	 delivering	 on	 the	 Group’s	 strategy	 and	 driving	
business	 outcomes	 through	 their	 teams,	 thereby	 enhancing	
long-term	 shareholder	 value.	
The	 principles	 of	 our	 remuneration	 policy	 are	 to:	
•	ensure	 overall	 remuneration	 is	 market	 competitive	 to	
attract	 and	 retain	 the	 leadership	 and	 talent	 required	
to	 drive	 the	 business	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 all	 stakeholders
•	adopt	 a	 simple,	 transparent	 and	 cost-effective	 approach	
to	 remuneration	 which	 is	 clear	 and	 understandable	 for	
business	 leaders,	 shareholders	 and	 the	 wider	 team
•	align	 compensation	 to	 performance	 and	 incorporate	
a	 balance	 of	 fixed	 and	 variable	 remuneration
•	design	 incentive	 plans	 which	 reinforce	 both	 short-	 and	
long-term	 behaviours,	 promote	 long-term	 development	
and	 support	 the	 strategic	 plans	 of	 the	 business	
•	ensure	 remuneration	 packages	 motivate	 and	 incentivise	
executive	 directors,	 management	 and	 the	 broader	 team	
to	 deliver	 on	 stretching	 performance	 targets.
The	 Company	 employs	 a	 number	 of	 people	 in	 a	 variety	
of		 roles,	 from	 brokers	 and	 administration	 support	 staff	 to	
consultants,	 senior	 management	 and	 directors	 across	 a	 range	
of	 geographies.	 The	 reward	 structure	 for	 our	 people	 is	 built	
around	 a	 set	 of	 common	 reward	 principles	 on	 a	 framework	
altered	 to	 suit	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 each	 business	 area.	 Reward	
packages	 differ,	 taking	 into	 account	 a	 number	 of	 factors	
including	 seniority,	 role,	 impact	 on	 the	 business,	 local	 practice,	
custom	 and	 legislation.
The	 remuneration	 policy	 for	 the	 executive	 directors	 reflects	
the	 overall	 remuneration	 philosophy	 and	 principles	 of	 the	
wider	 Group.	 When	 determining	 remuneration	 policy	 and	
arrangements	 for	 executive	 directors,	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee	 considers	 the	 wider	 pay	 and	 employment	 conditions	
elsewhere	 in	 the	 Group	 to	 ensure	 pay	 structures	 from	 director	
to	 senior	 management	 are	 aligned	 and	 appropriate.
When	 considering	 salary	 increases	 for	 the	 executive	 directors,	
the	 Committee	 considers	 the	 general	 level	 of	 salary	 increase	
across	 the	 Group.	 Typically,	 salary	 increases	 will	 be	 aligned	
with	 those	 received	 elsewhere	 in	 the	 Group	 unless	 the	
Remuneration	 Committee	 considers	 that	 specific	 circumstances	
require	 a	 different	 level	 of	 increase	 for	 executive	 directors.	
Key remuneration activities during the year
Following	 shareholder	 approval	 at	 our	 2016	 AGM,	 the	 revised	
policy	 and	 Long	 Term	 Incentive	 Plan	 (LTIP)	 were	 implemented.	
Details	 of	 how	 the	 policy	 was	 applied	 during	 the	 year	 are	 set	
out	 on	 pages	 60	 to	 65.	
In	 my	 2016	 report,	 I	 stated	 that	 the	 Company	 intended	 in	
due	 course	 to	 introduce	 a	 Company-wide	 share	 plan.	 The	
Committee	 undertook	 a	 thorough	 review	 of	 possible	 options	
for	 an	 all-employee	 share	 plan,	 the	 objective	 being	 to	
implement	 a	 Group	 plan	 that	 would	 benefit	 and	 incentivise	
both	 UK	 and	 international	 employees.	 Proposals	 and	 costs	
were	 sought	 from	 three	 separate	 market-leading	 share	 plan	
providers.	 The	 review	 highlighted	 that,	 although	 a	 UK	 plan	
set-up	 would	 be	 straightforward	 and	 cost	 effective,	 the	 set	
up	 and	 annual	 maintenance	 costs	 of	 implementing	 overseas	
plans	 in	 six	 jurisdictions	 were	 prohibitive,	 especially	 given	 the	
relatively	 small	 number	 of	 employees	 in	 those	 countries.	 After	
discussion,	 the	 Committee	 concluded	 that	 it	 would	 not	 be	
possible	 to	 introduce	 a	 Group-wide	 scheme	 that	 offered	 an	
equivalent	 benefit	 for	 all	 Group	 employees	 and	 therefore	
Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Directors’ remuneration report 55 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
decided	 not	 to	 proceed	 with	 the	 implementation	 of	 a	 Group	
share	 plan	 at	 this	 time.	 It	 was	 agreed	 that	 the	 share	 plan	
environment	 should	 be	 kept	 under	 review	 and	 that	 if	 the	
position	 changed,	 the	 Committee	 would	 consider	 this	 again	
in	 the	 future.	 The	 introduction	 of	 such	 a	 plan	 would	 require	
shareholder	 approval.	
Other	 key	 activities	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Committee	 during	 the	
year	 were:	
•	annual	 benchmarking	 of	 executive	 remuneration	 to	 ensure	
it	 remains	 appropriate	 to	 promote	 the	 long-term	 success	 of	
the	 Company
•	setting	 bonus	 targets	 following	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 financial	
budget
•	determining	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 the	 performance	 measures	
in	 respect	 of	 the	 incentive	 plan	 have	 been	 achieved	
•	approving	 the	 Key	 Results	 Areas	 for	 the	 CEO	 and	 CFO	 for	
2017/18.
Focus for 2017/18 and beyond
During	 the	 current	 year,	 the	 Committee	 will	 continue	 to	 review	
executive	 and	 Group-wide	 remuneration	 to	 ensure	 it	 remains	
appropriate	 to	 promote	 the	 long-term	 success	 of	 the	 Company.	
Compliance statement
This	 report	 complies	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006,	 Schedule	 8	
of	 the	 Large	 and	 Medium-sized	 Companies	 and	 Groups	
(Accounts	 and	 Reports)	 (Amendment)	 Regulations	 2013	 and	
the	 Listing	 Rules	 and	 applies	 the	 main	 principles	 relating	
to	 remuneration	 which	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 UK	 Corporate	
Governance	 Code.	
Recommendation
Positive	 votes	 of	 99.84%	 in	 favour	 of	 the	 Directors’	
remuneration	 report	 and	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 policy	
report	 were	 received	 from	 shareholders	 at	 the	 2016	 AGM,	
providing	 a	 strong	 endorsement	 for	 our	 remuneration	
strategy.	 I	 will	 be	 available,	 together	 with	 my	 fellow	
Committee	 members,	 at	 our	 AGM	 in	 June	 2017	 to	 answer	 any	
questions	 or	 receive	 your	 feedback	 with	 regard	 to	 our	 policy	
and	 how	 we	 have	 implemented	 it.	
On	 behalf	 of	 the	 Committee,	 I	 look	 forward	 to	 receiving	 your	
support	 at	 the	 AGM.

D.1 Setting levels of remuneration
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 sets	 levels	 of	 remuneration	 to	
promote	 the	 long-term	 success	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 structures	
executive	 remuneration	 so	 as	 to	 link	 rewards	 to	 corporate	 and	
individual	 performance.
D.2 Procedure
The	 composition	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 and	 its	 activities	
and	 approach	 to	 setting	 the	 remuneration	 policy	 for	 the	 executive	
directors	 and	 recommendations	 and	 monitoring	 of	 the	 level	 and	
structure	 of	 remuneration	 for	 senior	 management	 can	 be	 found	
in	 the	 Annual	 statement	 of	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 54	 to	 55.	 The	 Board	 determines	 the	
remuneration	 of	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 within	 the	 limits	
set	 in	 the	 Company’s	 Articles	 of	 Association.
The	 information	 contained	 in	 the	 following	 parts	 of	 this	 report	
has	 been	 audited:	 the	 table	 containing	 the	 single	 total	 figure	 of

and	 directors’	 beneficial	 interests	 in	 shares	 on	 page	 63.
The	 information	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 60	 to	 65	 of	 this	 report	 includes,	
as	 indicated,	 the	 auditable	 disclosures	 referred	 to	 in	 the	 Auditors’	
report	 on	 pages	 72	 to	 79	 as	 specified	 by	 the	 UK	 Listing	 Authority	 and

and	 Reports)	 (Amendment)	 Regulations	 2013	 (the	 Regulations).	
As	 required	 by	 the	 Regulations,	 the	 rest	 of	 this	 report	 is	 divided	
into	 two	 sections:
•	the	 directors’	 remuneration	 policy	 table	 which	 sets	 out	
the	 elements	 of	 the	 Company’s	 policy	 on	 director	 remuneration
•	the	 annual	 report	 on	 remuneration	 which	 sets	 out	 payments

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy table – non-executive directors 
The	 Company	 intends	 to	 have	 at	 least	 two	 independent	 non-executive	 directors	 on	 the	 Board	 at	 any	 time,	 in	 addition	 to	 the	
Chairman.	 The	 Board	 considers	 each	 of	 the	 non-executive	 directors	 to	 be	 independent.	
The	 non-executive	 directors’	 remuneration	 (including	 that	 of	 the	 Chairman)	 reflects	 the	 anticipated	 time	 commitment	 to	 fulfil	
their	 duties.	 Non-executive	 directors	 do	 not	 receive	 benefits,	 bonuses,	 long-term	 incentive	 awards,	 a	 pension	 or	 compensation	
on	 termination	 of	 their	 appointments.	
The	 following	 table	 sets	 out	 a	 summary	 of	 the	 Company’s	 remuneration	 policy	 for	 non-executive	 directors:
Remuneration policy report continued
Remuneration	 element Purpose	 and	 link	 to	 remuneration	 policy Key	 features	 and	 operation	 (including	 maximum	 levels)
Fees Fees	 for	 non-executive	 directors	
are	 set	 at	 an	 appropriate	 level	
to	 recruit	 and	 retain	 directors	 of	
a	 sufficient	 calibre	 without	 paying	
more	 than	 is	 necessary	 to	 do	 so.	
Fees	 are	 set	 taking	 into	 account	
the	 following	 factors:	 the	 time	
commitment	 required	 to	 fulfil	
the	 role,	 typical	 practice	 at	 other	
companies	 of	 a	 similar	 size,	 and	
salary	 levels	 of	 employees	
throughout	 the	 Group.
The	 non-executive	 director	 fees	 policy	 is:
•	 to	 pay	 a	 basic	 fee	 for	 membership	 of	 the	 Board
•		 to	 pay	 additional	 fees	 for	 chairmanship	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 chairmanship	
of	 a	 committee	 to	 take	 into	 account	 the	 additional	 responsibilities	 and	 time	
commitment	 of	 these	 roles.
Fees	 are	 reviewed	 at	 appropriate	 levels	 at	 appropriate	 intervals	 (normally	
once	 every	 year)	 by	 the	 Board	 with	 reference	 to	 individual	 experience,	 the	
external	 market	 and	 the	 expected	 time	 commitment	 required	 of	 the	 director.	
The	 Company’s	 current	 maximum	 fees	 are	 as	 follows:
•	 basic	 fee	 –	 £30,000
•	 additional	 fee	 for	 Board	 Chairman	 –	 £30,000
•	 additional	 fee	 for	 Committee	 Chairman	 –	 £5,000.

the	 Board	 with	 its	 own	 defined	 terms	 of	 reference.	 Its	 primary	
role	 is	 to	 review	 and	 set	 the	 remuneration	 policy	 for	 the	
executive	 directors,	 within	 the	 context	 of	 salaries	 and	 benefits	
paid	 across	 the	 Group	 as	 a	 whole,	 and	 making	 discretionary	
performance-related	 awards	 to	 the	 executive	 directors.	 The	
full	 Board	 agrees	 the	 remuneration	 of	 the	 Chairman	 and	
non-executive	 directors	 on	 the	 principle	 that	 no	 individual	
should	 be	 able	 to	 determine	 their	 own	 remuneration.

Taxable	 benefits	 –	 executive	 directors	 receive	 a	 benefits	
package	 including	 a	 car	 allowance,	 life	 assurance,	 subsidised	
gym	 membership	 and	 home	 telephone	 and	 internet	 facility.	
The	 car	 allowance	 payable	 to	 the	 CEO	 and	 CFO	 included	 in	 the	
above	 amount	 was	 £15,000	 and	 £10,000	 respectively	 (2016:	
£15,000	 and	 £10,000).
Bonus	 –	 the	 maximum	 bonus	 for	 the	 period	 for	 the	 CEO	 and	
CFO	 was	 capped	 at	 150%	 of	 the	 financial	 element	 of	 the	 bonus,	
which	 equates	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 150%	 of	 salary	 and	 100%	 of	
salary	 respectively.
LTIP	 –	 awards	 under	 the	 revised	 Air	 Partner	 Share	 Incentive	
Plan	 2012	 following	 approval	 at	 the	 2016	 AGM	 was	 made	 to	
both	 executive	 directors	 in	 the	 period	 under	 review	 and	 are	
subject	 to	 performance	 and	 continued	 service	 conditions.
Pension-related	 benefit	 –	 both	 executive	 directors	 are	
members	 of	 the	 Air	 Partner	 Pension	 Scheme	 (a	 defined	
contribution	 scheme)	 and	 receive	 a	 pension	 contribution	
of	 12%	 of	 base	 salary.	 Executive	 directors	 may	 elect	 with	 the	
Committee’s	 consent	 to	 receive	 some	 or	 all	 of	 the	 Company’s	
pension	 contribution	 as	 a	 cash	 alternative.
Annual bonus (audited)
As	 noted	 above,	 the	 bonus	 payments	 for	 both	 the	 CEO	 and	
CFO	 are	 based	 on	 the	 following	 weighting:	 70%	 on	 achievement	
of	 the	 Group’s	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 target	 and	 30%	
attributable	 to	 personal	 objectives,	 which	 only	 become	
payable	 should	 the	 Group	 achieve	 65%	 or	 higher	 of	 its	
underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 target.	 For	 reference,	 the	
underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 target	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	
31	 January	 2016	 was	 £3.8m	 and	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	
31	 January	 2015	 was	 £4.8m,	 the	 thresholds	 for	 2017	 were	
£5.0m	 and	 £5.5m	 respectively.
In	 respect	 of	 the	 personal	 objective	 element,	 the	 executive	
directors	 receive	 four	 to	 five	 objectives	 each	 year	 against	
which	 they	 will	 receive	 a	 score	 of	 0	 (unacceptable	 performance)	
to	 4	 (excellent	 performance).	 Although	 every	 effort	 is	 made	 to	
ensure	 that	 personal	 objectives	 are	 SMART,	 there	 is	 likely	
to	 be	 a	 degree	 of	 subjectivity	 to	 the	 scores	 attributed	 against	
each	 objective.	
As	 the	 Group	 achieved	 its	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 target	
and	 surpassed	 the	 65%	 underpin	 level	 of	 the	 payment	 of	 the	
personal	 objective	 element,	 bonuses	 were	 payable	 to	 the	
executive	 directors	 for	 the	 period	 ending	 31	 January	 2017.

The	 number	 of	 share	 options	 awarded	 under	 the	 LTIP	 was	
determined	 by	 using	 the	 closing	 price	 of	 an	 Air	 Partner	 plc	
share	 on	 the	 day	 preceding	 the	 date	 of	 grant	 as	 ascertained	
by	 the	 Official	 List	 which	 was	 502.5p	 on	 21	 October	 2013,	
387.5p	 on	 2	 June	 2015	 and	 339.63p	 on	 28	 June	 2016.	
The	 face	 value	 of	 awards	 made	 to	 Mark	 Briffa	 and	 Neil	 Morris	
on	 3	 June	 2015	 are	 £340,000	 and	 £151,000.	 This	 is	 calculated	
based	 on	 a	 closing	 share	 price	 of	 £3.89	 on	 3	 June	 2015.	
Prices	 quoted	 are	 pre-share	 split.
The	 awards	 granted	 are	 subject	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	
performance	 and	 employment	 conditions	 as	 specified	
by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee. 64 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Vesting	 of	 the	 grants	 is	 subject	 to	 a	 combination	 of	 50%	
earnings	 per	 share	 (EPS)	 and	 50%	 total	 shareholder	 return	
(TSR)	 related	 targets:	
EPS:
•	100%	 vest	 if	 performance	 greater	 than	 RPI	 +20%	 per	 annum
•	25%	 vest	 if	 performance	 equal	 to	 RPI	 +15%	 per	 annum.
TSR:
•	100%	 vest	 if	 performance	 greater	 than	 75th	 percentile
•	25%	 if	 performance	 equal	 to	 50th	 percentile.
Between	 these	 target	 levels,	 share	 options	 will	 vest	 on	 a	
straight-line	 basis	 and	 shares	 will	 vest,	 subject	 to	 achievement	
of	 these	 performance	 conditions,	 on	 3	 June	 2018.
The	 adjusted	 underlying	 EPS	 for	 the	 base	 year	 ending	
31	 January	 2015	 has	 been	 calculated	 as	 19.5p	 excluding	 the	
impact	 of	 one-off	 tax	 credits.
The	 face	 value	 of	 awards	 made	 to	 Mark	 Briffa	 and	 Neil	 Morris	
on	 29	 June	 2016	 are	 £408,539	 and	 £84,157.	 This	 is	 calculated	
based	 on	 a	 closing	 share	 price	 of	 370p	 on	 29	 June	 2016.	
The	 number	 of	 LTIPs	 awarded	 was	 determined	 from	 the	
closing	 share	 price	 the	 day	 prior	 to	 grant	 (339.63p	 per	 share)	
and	 the	 executive	 directors’	 salaries	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant.
The	 awards	 granted	 are	 subject	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	
performance	 and	 employment	 conditions	 as	 specified	
by	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee.
EPS
Two-thirds	 of	 the	 award	 (66.67%	 of	 the	 award)	 will	 be	 subject	
to	 an	 earnings	 per	 share	 (EPS)	 compound	 annual	 growth	 target	
which	 will	 be	 in	 addition	 to	 any	 increase	 in	 the	 Consumer	 Prices	
Index	 (CPI),	 as	 follows:
EPS	 growth %	 of	 award	 vesting
Below	 CPI	 +5%	 pa Nil
CPI	 +5%	 pa 25%
CPI	 +10%	 pa	 or	 above 100%
For	 intermediate	 performance	 between	 CPI	 +5%	 pa	 and	
CPI	 +10%	 pa	 vesting	 will	 occur	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis.	
TSR
The	 remaining	 one-third	 of	 the	 award	 (33.33%	 of	 the	 award)	
will	 be	 subject	 to	 an	 absolute	 total	 shareholder	 return	 (TSR)	
performance	 condition	 as	 follows:	
EPS	 growth %	 of	 award	 vesting
Below	 9%	 pa	 returns Nil
9%	 pa	 returns 25%
16%	 pa	 returns	 or	 above 100%
For	 intermediate	 performance	 between	 9%	 pa	 returns	 and	
16%	 pa	 returns,	 vesting	 will	 occur	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis.
The	 adjusted	 underlying	 EPS	 for	 the	 base	 year	 ending	
31	 January	 2016	 has	 been	 calculated	 as	 24.6p.
The	 market	 price	 per	 share	 at	 31	 January	 2017	 was	 108p	 (540p)	
(31	 January	 2016:	 77p	 (385p))	 and	 ranged	 between	 66p	 (330p)	
and	 108p	 (540p)	 during	 the	 year.	 The	 average	 price	 during	 the

Share award vesting
The	 share	 award	 under	 the	 LTIP	 granted	 to	 Mark	 Briffa	 on	
22	 October	 2013	 (the	 2013	 award)	 vested	 on	 3	 October	 2016.	
The	 vesting	 covered	 the	 performance	 period	 from	 1	 August	
2013	 to	 31	 July	 2016.	
The	 2013	 award	 was	 subject	 to	 a	 performance	 condition	 with	
an	 EPS	 element	 and	 a	 TSR	 element.
The	 Company’s	 broker,	 Liberum	 Capital	 confirmed	 to	 the	
Committee	 that	 were	 Air	 Partner	 in	 the	 FTSE	 Small	 Cap	 Index,	
it	 would	 have	 ranked	 52nd	 over	 the	 measurement	 period	 and	
that	 as	 the	 schedule	 of	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 LTIP	 stated	 that	 there	
would	 be	 conditional	 vesting	 where	 the	 performance	 was	
between	 the	 50th	 and	 75th	 percentile	 rankings,	 this	 resulted	 in	
31%	 of	 the	 TSR	 element	 being	 achieved	 with	 Air	 Partner	 ranking	
as	 52nd.	 The	 Committee	 therefore	 agreed	 that	 31%	 of	 the	 TSR	
element	 of	 the	 award,	 being	 50%	 of	 the	 total	 award,	 would	 vest.
The	 Remuneration	 Committee	 satisfied	 itself	 that	 the	 recorded	
EPS	 growth	 and	 TSR	 ranking	 was	 a	 genuine	 reflection	 of	 the	
underlying	 business	 performance	 of	 the	 Group,	 and	 approved	
the	 vesting	 of	 the	 2013	 award	 at	 the	 calculated	 percentages	
set	 out	 below:
Performance	 criterion Achieved %	 of	 award	 to	 vest
EPS	 growth Growth	 greater	 than	 RPI	 +10% 100%
TSR 52nd	 percentile	 against	 the	
FTSE	 Small	 Cap	 Index
31%
The	 measurement	 period	 was	 non-coterminous	 to	 Air	 Partner’s	
accounting	 reference	 date.

Share split, share capital structure, buying back and 
shareholder rights
On	 25	 January	 2017,	 the	 Company’s	 shareholders	 approved	
a	 5	 to	 1	 split	 of	 the	 Company’s	 shares,	 which	 reduced	 the	
nominal	 value	 of	 the	 ordinary	 shares	 to	 1p	 each.	 The	 share	
split	 became	 effective	 on	 31	 January	 2017.
The	 authorised	 share	 capital	 of	 the	 Company	 is	 £750,000	
divided	 into	 75,000,000	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 1	 pence	 each.	 The	
Company	 has	 one	 class	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 which	 have	 equal	
rights	 to	 dividends	 and	 capital	 and	 to	 vote	 at	 general	 meetings	
of	 the	 Company,	 as	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Company’s	 Articles	 of	
Association.	 The	 number	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 1	 pence	 each	
issued	 and	 fully	 paid	 at	 31	 January	 2017	 was	 52,217,565	
(2016,	 before	 share	 split:	 10,443,513	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 5p	
each).	 Other	 than	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 share	 split,	 no	 new	 shares	
have	 been	 issued	 during	 the	 year.	 No	 shares	 were	 bought	 back	
during	 the	 year.
Options	 outstanding	 under	 all	 employee	 share	 schemes	
amounted	 to	 6.12%	 of	 the	 Company’s	 issued	 share	 capital	 as	
at	 31	 January	 2017.	 This	 includes	 options	 granted	 which	 have	
not	 yet	 vested.	 In	 addition,	 options	 representing	 8.99%	 of	 the	
issued	 share	 capital	 have	 been	 exercised	 within	 the	 10	 years	
preceding	 31	 January	 2017.	 No	 more	 than	 10%	 of	 the	 issued	
share	 capital	 in	 any	 rolling	 10-year	 period	 may	 currently	 be	
taken	 up	 by	 employee	 share	 schemes	 by	 way	 of	 dilution	 with	
any	 excess	 (up	 to	 a	 further	 10%	 of	 the	 issued	 share	 capital)	
being	 acquired	 by	 purchase	 in	 the	 market	 via	 the	 Air	 Partner	
Employee	 Benefit	 Trust	 (the	 Trust).	 Under	 the	 Articles	 of	
Directors’ report 67 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
Association,	 the	 Company	 has	 authority	 to	 issue	 75,000,000	
ordinary	 shares.	 Resolutions	 to	 renew	 the	 authorities	 given	
to	 directors	 to	 allot	 shares,	 to	 dis-apply	 certain	 pre-emption	
rights	 and	 to	 make	 market	 purchases	 of	 the	 Company’s	 own	
shares,	 all	 subject	 to	 appropriate	 limits,	 will	 be	 put	 to	 the	
Annual	 General	 Meeting	 (AGM)	 to	 replace	 the	 authorities	
granted	 in	 2016.
The	 Trust	 holds	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 the	 Company	 in	 order	 to	
satisfy	 options	 under	 the	 Group’s	 share	 option	 schemes.	
At	 31	 January	 2017,	 the	 number	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 held	 by	
the	 Trust	 was	 341,820.	 Shares	 held	 by	 the	 Trust	 abstain	 from	
voting	 and	 are	 not	 entitled	 to	 receive	 dividends.	 A	 further	
413,640	 shares	 are	 held	 by	 the	 Trust	 in	 a	 nominee	 capacity	
for	 two	 beneficiaries	 of		 the	 Trust.	
There	 are	 no	 specific	 restrictions	 on	 the	 size	 of	 a	 holding	 nor	
on	 the	 transfer	 of	 shares,	 which	 are	 both	 governed	 by	 the	
general	 provisions	 of	 the	 Articles	 of	 Association	 and	 prevailing	
legislation.	 The	 directors	 are	 not	 aware	 of	 any	 agreements	
between	 holders	 of	 the	 Company’s	 shares	 that	 may	 result	 in	
restrictions	 on	 the	 transfer	 of	 securities	 or	 on	 voting	 rights.
No	 person	 has	 any	 special	 rights	 of	 control	 over	 the	
Company’s	 share	 capital	 and	 all	 issued	 shares	 are	 fully	 paid.	
No	 individual	 or	 corporate	 entity	 has	 the	 right	 to	 appoint	
a	 director.	 The	 appointment	 and	 replacement	 of	 directors	
is	 governed	 by	 the	 Articles	 of	 Association,	 the	 UK	 Corporate	
Governance	 Code,	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 and	 related	
legislation.	
Change of control – significant contracts
There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 commercial	 agreements	 that	 take	
effect,	 alter	 or	 terminate	 upon	 a	 change	 of	 control	 of	 the	
Company;	 none	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 significant	 in	 terms	 of	 its	
potential	 impact	 on	 the	 business	 of	 the	 Group	 as	 a	 whole.	
The	 Company	 does	 not	 have	 agreements	 with	 any	 director	
or	 employee	 that	 would	 provide	 compensation	 for	 loss	 of	
office	 or	 employment	 resulting	 from	 a	 takeover,	 except	 that	
provisions	 of	 the	 Company’s	 share	 schemes	 and	 plans	 may	
cause	 options	 and	 awards	 granted	 to	 employees	 under	 such	
schemes	 and	 plans	 to	 vest	 on	 a	 takeover.

Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The	 key	 risks	 that	 we	 identified	 in	 the	 current	 year	 were:
1	 Revenue	 recognition:	 classification	 as	 either	 agent	 or	 principal
2	 Completeness	 of	 provisions	 against	 operator	 prepayments
3	 Completeness	 of	 operator	 accruals
4	 Finalisation	 of	 purchase	 price	 allocation	 relating	 to	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Baines	 Simmons
5		 Impairment	 of	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 relating	 to	 the	 Baines	 Simmons	 consulting	 and	 training	
cash-generating	 unit.
Within	 this	 report,	 any	 new	 risks	 are	 identified	 with	 	 and	 any	 risks	 which	 are	 the	 same	 as	 the	 prior	 year	 are	
identified	 with	 .
Materiality Our	 chosen	 materiality	 of	 £410,000	 (2016:	 £285,000)	 represents	 8.1%	 (2016:	 6.6%)	 of	 underlying	 profit	 before	
tax,	 1.3%	 (2016:	 1.0%)	 of	 gross	 profit	 and	 2.7%	 (2016:	 2.1%)	 of	 net	 assets.	
Underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 is	 defined	 by	 management	 in	 note	 2.	
Scoping Our	 global	 testing	 approach	 is	 a	 combination	 of	 full	 scope,	 specified	 audit	 procedures	 and	 defined	 procedures.	
We	 have	 made	 changes	 to	 our	 scoping	 decisions	 made	 in	 the	 prior	 year	 for	 several	 global	 entities	 to	 reflect	
their	 current	 significance.
Significant changes 
in our approach
We	 identified	 an	 additional	 key	 risk	 in	 the	 current	 year	 relating	 to	 the	 risk	 of	 impairment	 of	 the	 Baines	 Simmons	
consulting	 and	 training	 cash-generating	 unit.	 We	 have	 not	 reported	 on	 the	 revenue	 recognition	 of	 JetCard	 and	
other	 deferred	 income	 as	 this	 risk	 didn’t	 have	 a	 significant	 effect	 on	 the	 allocation	 of	 resources	 in	 the	 audit	 in	
the	 current	 year.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As	 explained	 in	 note	 1	 to	 the	 Group	 financial	 statements,	 in	 addition	 to	 complying	 with	 its	 legal	 obligation	 to	 apply	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted	 by	 the

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
As	 required	 by	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 we	 have	 reviewed	 the	 directors’	 statement	 regarding	
the	 appropriateness	 of	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 of	 accounting	 contained	 within	 note	 2	
to	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 directors’	 statement	 on	 the	 longer-term	 viability	
of	 the	 Group	 contained	 within	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 report	 on	 page	 51.
We	 are	 required	 to	 state	 whether	 we	 have	 anything	 material	 to	 add	 or	 draw	 attention	
to	 in	 relation	 to:
•	the	 directors’	 confirmation	 on	 page	 53	 that	 they	 have	 carried	 out	 a	 robust	
assessment	 of	 the	 principal	 risks	 facing	 the	 Group,	 including	 those	 that	 would	
threaten	 its	 business	 model,	 future	 performance,	 solvency	 or	 liquidity
•	the	 disclosures	 on	 pages	 18-21	 that	 describe	 those	 risks	 and	 explain	 how	 they	 are	
being	 managed	 or	 mitigated
•	the	 directors’	 statement	 in	 note	 2	 to	 the	 financial	 statements	 about	 whether	 they	
considered	 it	 appropriate	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 of	 accounting	 in	
preparing	 them	 and	 their	 identification	 of	 any	 material	 uncertainties	 to	 the	 Group’s	
ability	 to	 continue	 to	 do	 so	 over	 a	 period	 of	 at	 least	 12	 months	 from	 the	 date	 of	
approval	 of	 the	 financial	 statements
•	the	 directors’	 explanation	 on	 page	 53	 as	 to	 how	 they	 have	 assessed	 the	 prospects	
of	 the	 Group,	 over	 what	 period	 they	 have	 done	 so	 and	 why	 they	 consider	 that	
period	 to	 be	 appropriate,	 and	 their	 statement	 as	 to	 whether	 they	 have	 a	 reasonable	
expectation	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 be	 able	 to	 continue	 in	 operation	 and	 meet	 its	
liabilities	 as	 they	 fall	 due	 over	 the	 period	 of	 their	 assessment,	 including	 any	 related	
disclosures	 drawing	 attention	 to	 any	 necessary	 qualifications	 or	 assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting and we did not identify 
any such material uncertainties. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We	 are	 required	 to	 comply	 with	 the	 Financial	 Reporting	 Council’s	 Ethical	 Standards	
for	 Auditors	 and	 confirm	 that	 we	 are	 independent	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 we	 have	 fulfilled	
our	 other	 ethical	 responsibilities	 in	 accordance	 with	 those	 standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the 
Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those 
standards. We also confirm we have not provided 
any of the prohibited non-audit services referred 
to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The	 assessed	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 described	 on	 pages	 74	 to	 76	 are	 those	 that	 had	 the	 greatest	 effect	 on	 our	 audit	 strategy,	
the	 allocation	 of	 resources	 in	 the	 audit	 and	 directing	 the	 efforts	 of	 the	 engagement	 team. 74 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1. Revenue recognition: classification as either agent or principal 
Risk description Air	 Partner	 plc	 provides	 air	 charter	 services	 to	 customers	 using	 operator	 aircraft	 to	 supply	 the	 flight.	
The	 recognition	 of	 revenue	 as	 either	 ‘agent’	 or	 ‘principal’	 is	 determined	 by	 the	 application	 of	 the	 criteria	 set	
out	 in	 IAS	 18	 ‘Revenue’.	 Under	 this	 standard,	 an	 entity	 is	 acting	 as	 principal	 when	 it	 has	 exposure	 to	 the	
significant	 risks	 and	 rewards	 associated	 with	 the	 rendering	 of	 services.	
Management	 must	 apply	 their	 judgement	 to	 consider	 if	 the	 Company	 is	 acting	 as	 the	 principal	 or	 the	 agent	
in	 each	 contract	 with	 the	 end	 customer	 where	 Air	 Partner’s	 standard	 terms	 and	 conditions	 are	 modified	
(or	 indeed	 not	 used	 as	 a	 basis	 for	 the	 contract).
There	 is	 a	 risk	 that	 revenue	 is	 recognised	 incorrectly	 either	 as	 ‘gross’	 revenue	 when	 the	 business	 is	 not	
exposed	 to	 ‘principal’	 risk,	 or	 booked	 as	 ‘net’	 or	 ‘agency’	 revenue	 when	 the	 balance	 of	 risk	 points	 to	 the	
Company	 being	 the	 ‘principal’	 in	 the	 arrangement.	
Total	 gross	 transaction	 value	 (GTV)	 was	 £215.8m	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2017	 (2016:	 £210.8m).	
GTV	 represents	 the	 total	 value	 of	 invoices	 raised	 to	 customers.
The	 Group’s	 revenue	 recognition	 accounting	 policy	 is	 included	 on	 page	 92	 of	 the	 notes	 to	 the	 financial	
statements.	 This	 is	 discussed	 by	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 on	 page	 51.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
In	 order	 to	 address	 this	 risk:
•	we	 tested	 the	 design	 and	 implementation	 of	 management’s	 controls	 over	 the	 classification	 of	 revenue
•	we	 obtained	 and	 reviewed	 Air	 Partner’s	 standard	 contract	 terms	 and	 those	 contracts	 where	 management	
concluded	 that	 they	 were	 principal	 against	 the	 IAS	 18	 criteria	 to	 assess	 whether	 the	 correct	 application	
of	 IAS	 18	 recognition	 was	 applied
•	we	 also	 selected	 a	 sample	 of	 recorded	 revenue	 amounts,	 obtained	 and	 reviewed	 the	 customer	 contract	
in	 order	 to	 assess	 whether	 the	 correct	 application	 of	 IAS	 18	 revenue	 classification	 had	 been	 applied
•	we	 performed	 focused	 testing	 on	 a	 further	 sample	 of	 contracts	 which	 management	 has	 classified	 as	 agent	
arrangements	 by	 selecting	 a	 sample	 of	 those	 which	 had	 similar	 characteristics	 (industry,	 size,	 margin)	 to	
customer	 contracts	 where	 Air	 Partner	 was	 classified	 as	 principal.	 For	 these	 we	 evaluated	 management’s	
assessment	 on	 whether	 Air	 Partner	 is	 an	 agent	 using	 the	 criteria	 of	 IAS	 18.
Key observations From	 the	 work	 performed	 above,	 we	 are	 satisfied	 that	 revenue	 recognition	 has	 been	 appropriately	 applied	 in	
accordance	 with	 IAS	 18.
2. Completeness of provisions against operator prepayments 
Risk description The	 Group	 enters	 into	 sales	 contracts	 with	 customers	 for	 aircraft	 charter	 and	 enters	 into	 purchase	 contracts	
‘back-to-back’.	 The	 Group	 is	 required	 to	 prepay	 operators	 for	 flights	 which	 occur	 in	 the	 future.	 At	 the	 year	 end,	
the	 value	 of	 Group	 prepayments	 was	 £5.2m	 (2016:	 £7.0m)	 which	 includes	 operator	 prepayments.	 Although	 the	
Group	 matches	 the	 purchase	 contract	 with	 the	 customer	 receipt,	 there	 is	 a	 credit	 risk	 in	 cases	 where	 suppliers	
default	 before	 the	 flight	 takes	 off	 and	 that	 monies	 prepaid	 to	 suppliers	 are	 not	 recoverable.	 In	 certain	 cases,	
Air	 Partner	 may	 still	 fulfil	 the	 flight	 for	 the	 customer.	 There	 is	 a	 risk	 these	 prepayments	 need	 to	 be	 provided	 for.	
This	 is	 discussed	 by	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 on	 page	 52.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
In	 order	 to	 address	 this	 risk:
•	we	 checked	 the	 accuracy	 of	 the	 listing	 of	 prepaid	 operator	 costs	 as	 at	 31	 January	 2017	 by	 agreeing	 a	 sample	
through	 to	 signed	 contracts
•	we	 reviewed	 prepaid	 operator	 costs	 to	 identify	 those	 which	 had	 a	 higher	 chance	 of	 irrecoverability
•	we	 traced	 a	 sample	 of	 prepayments	 through	 to	 post-year	 end	 flight	 records	 to	 check	 that	 the	 operator	 had	
supplied	 the	 flight
•	for	 those	 flights	 in	 our	 sample	 that	 had	 not	 yet	 taken	 off	 at	 the	 date	 of	 our	 testing	 we	 reviewed	 the	 operator’s	
business	 history	 with	 the	 Group	 for	 evidence	 of	 dispute	 and	 slow	 payment	 as	 well	 as	 third-party	 evidence	
of	 their	 financial	 position
•	we	 requested	 details	 from	 the	 Group’s	 external	 legal	 advisers	 to	 identify	 legal	 disputes	 with	 operators.
Key observations From	 the	 work	 performed	 above,	 we	 are	 satisfied	 that	 operator	 prepayments	 are	 valued	 appropriately.

3. Completeness of operator accruals
Risk description Flights	 and	 related	 services	 are	 purchased	 from	 a	 large	 number	 of	 different	 suppliers	 and	 the	 nature	 of	 the	
Group’s	 products	 and	 services	 is	 that	 they	 are	 bespoke	 and	 tailored	 to	 the	 client’s	 requirements.	 As	 a	 result,	
the	 process	 of	 matching	 costs	 and	 associated	 revenues	 in	 order	 to	 appropriately	 account	 on	 an	 accruals	 basis	
requires	 estimation	 of	 future	 costs.	 The	 risk	 of	 completeness	 is	 considered	 significant	 as:
•	suppliers	 submit	 invoices	 with	 differing	 timescales,	 often	 significantly	 later	 than	 the	 date	 of	 the	 service	
provision
•	certain	 employees	 have	 elements	 of	 their	 remuneration	 based	 upon	 a	 commission	 calculated	 with	 reference	
to	 gross	 profit	 on	 flight	 services.
These	 factors	 result	 in	 a	 heightened	 risk	 of	 under-accrual	 of	 costs.	 This	 is	 discussed	 by	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	
Committee	 on	 page	 52.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
In	 order	 to	 address	 this	 risk:
•	we	 tested	 a	 sample	 of	 purchase	 invoices	 and	 payments	 made	 after	 31	 January	 2017.	 We	 agreed	 these	 to	
evidence	 supporting	 the	 date	 of	 flights	 or	 service	 delivery	 and	 considered	 whether,	 where	 this	 was	 before	
the	 year	 end,	 an	 accrual	 had	 been	 recorded
•	we	 performed	 analytical	 procedures	 on	 gross	 margin	 for	 the	 components	 in	 our	 scope	 to	 highlight	 instances	
where	 costs	 may	 not	 have	 been	 recorded.	 If	 we	 identified	 an	 unexpected	 margin,	 we	 carried	 out	 more	
focused	 testing	 on	 the	 completeness	 of	 accruals
•	we	 reviewed	 significant	 accrual	 amounts	 against	 amounts	 recorded	 at	 the	 prior	 period	 end	 to	 highlight	 any	
potential	 risk	 of	 under-accrual.
Key observations From	 the	 work	 performed	 above,	 we	 did	 not	 identify	 any	 incomplete	 accruals	 which	 required	 reporting	 to	 the	
Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee.
4. Finalisation of purchase price allocation relating to the acquisition of Baines Simmons
Risk description During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2016,	 Air	 Partner	 acquired	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited.	 In	 the	 current	 year,	
management	 finalised	 the	 Baines	 Simmons	 acquisition	 accounting,	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 3	 (revised)	
Business	 Combinations.	 Goodwill	 is	 £1.7m	 (2016:	 £2.8m)	 and	 intangibles	 are	 £4.0m	 (2016:	 £2.7m).	 See	 note	 33	
where	 the	 finalised	 allocation	 has	 been	 disclosed.	
There	 is	 significant	 judgement	 required	 in	 the	 valuations	 of	 the	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 and	
management	 has	 used	 a	 valuation	 expert	 to	 assist	 in	 this	 process.	 We	 have	 identified	 the	 finalisation	 of	 the	
purchase	 price	 allocation	 as	 the	 significant	 risk	 in	 the	 acquisition	 accounting.
We	 have	 pinpointed	 the	 risk	 to	 management’s	 finalisation	 of	 the	 purchase	 price	 allocation	 between	 cash-
generating	 units	 (CGUs)	 and	 the	 related	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets.	 The	 main	 assumptions	 used	 in	
allocating	 this	 between	 the	 CGUs	 are	 revenue	 growth,	 the	 allocation	 of	 overheads	 and	 the	 discount	 rate	
applied	 to	 each.
The	 Group’s	 accounting	 policy	 is	 included	 on	 page	 89	 of	 the	 notes	 to	 the	 financial	 statements.	 This	 is	 discussed	
by	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 on	 page	 52.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
In	 order	 to	 address	 this	 risk:
•	we	 checked	 the	 accuracy	 of	 the	 schedules	 supporting	 the	 valuation	 of	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 acquired
•	we	 challenged	 the	 inputs	 and	 assumptions	 listed	 above	 used	 in	 the	 valuation.	 This	 included	 involving	
internal	 specialists	 to	 benchmark	 the	 discount	 rate	 and	 challenge	 the	 methodology	 used
•	we	 also	 assessed	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 cash	 flow	 forecasts	 through	 comparison	 to	 historical	 results	 and	
other	 knowledge	 gained	 from	 our	 audit
•	we	 assessed	 whether	 the	 accounting	 journals	 posted	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 transaction	 were	 in	 accordance	
with	 IFRS	 3
•	we	 considered	 the	 competency	 of	 management’s	 expert.
Key observations From	 the	 work	 performed	 above,	 we	 concluded	 that	 the	 assumptions	 used	 in	 the	 allocations	 were	 appropriate.	 76 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Air Partner plc	 continued
5.  Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets relating to the Baines Simmons consulting and training cash-generating 
unit (CGU)
Risk description Management	 is	 required	 to	 test	 Group	 goodwill	 balances	 annually	 for	 impairment.	 The	 assessment	 of	 the	
carrying	 value	 of	 goodwill	 and	 intangibles	 involves	 judgement	 in	 relation	 to	 forecasting	 future	 cash	 flows	 and	
is	 sensitive	 to	 growth	 rates	 and	 the	 discount	 rate	 applied	 to	 future	 cash	 flows.	
Management	 has	 assessed	 the	 future	 cash	 flows	 of	 the	 cash	 generating	 unit	 and	 concluded	 that	 it	 is	 not	
impaired.	 We	 have	 considered	 the	 Company’s	 forecast	 performance	 and	 pinpointed	 our	 risk	 specifically	
to	 the	 revenue	 and	 gross	 profit	 growth	 rates	 and	 discount	 rate	 applied	 within	 the	 Baines	 Simmons	 consulting	
and	 training	 CGU.	 As	 at	 31	 January	 2017,	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 relating	 to	 this	 CGU	 total	 £1.6m	
(2016:	 £3.2m).	
The	 Group’s	 goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 accounting	 policies	 are	 included	 on	 page	 87	 of	 the	 notes	 to	 the	
financial	 statements.	 This	 is	 discussed	 by	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 on	 page	 52.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
In	 order	 to	 address	 this	 risk:
•	we	 checked	 the	 accuracy	 of	 the	 schedules	 supporting	 the	 cash	 flow	 model
•	we	 challenged	 the	 appropriateness	 of	 the	 key	 assumptions	 of	 cash	 flow	 growth,	 revenue	 and	 gross	 profit	
growth	 rates	 using	 historical	 performance,	 historical	 forecasting	 accuracy,	 knowledge	 of	 the	 business	 and	
sensitivity	 analysis
•	we	 challenged	 the	 discount	 factor	 used,	 using	 our	 internal	 specialists,	 to	 assess	 the	 appropriateness	 for	 this	
business,	 by	 comparison	 to	 external	 data	 and	 via	 sensitivity	 analysis
•	we	 also	 tested	 the	 completeness	 of	 direct	 and	 overhead	 costs	 via	 post-year	 end	 payment	 testing	 and	 the	
occurrence	 of	 revenue	 for	 2017.
Key observations From	 the	 work	 performed	 above,	 we	 concluded	 that	 the	 inputs	 and	 assumptions	 applied	 in	 the	 valuation	 model	
were	 appropriate.
These	 matters	 were	 addressed	 in	 the	 context	 of	 our	 audit	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 as	 a	 whole,	 and	 in	 forming	 our	 opinion	 thereon,	
and	 we	 do	 not	 provide	 a	 separate	 opinion	 on	 these	 matters.
Our application of materiality
We	 define	 materiality	 as	 the	 magnitude	 of	 misstatement	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 that	 makes	 it	 probable	 that	 the	 economic	 decisions	 of	
a	 reasonably	 knowledgeable	 person	 would	 be	 changed	 or	 influenced.	 We	 use	 materiality	 both	 in	 planning	 the	 scope	 of	 our	 audit	 work	 and	
in	 evaluating	 the	 results	 of	 our	 work.
Based	 on	 our	 professional	 judgement,	 we	 determined	 materiality	 for	 the	 financial	 statements	 as	 a	 whole	 as	 follows:
Group materiality £410,000	 (2016:	 £285,000)
Basis for determining 
materiality
We	 used	 a	 combination	 of	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax,	 gross	 profit	 and	 net	 assets	 to	 determine	 materiality.
Our	 chosen	 materiality	 represents	 8.1%	 (2016:	 6.6%)	 of	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax,	 1.3%	 (2016:	 1.0%)	 of	 gross	
profit	 and	 2.7%	 (2016:	 2.1%)	 of	 net	 assets.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
In	 determining	 our	 materiality	 benchmark	 we	 considered	 the	 performance	 indicators	 most	 applicable	 to	 the	
users	 of	 the	 financial	 statements,	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 business	 and	 comparative	 audit	 reports	 for	 listed	 entities.	
Gross	 profit	 and	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 are	 the	 key	 measures	 used	 by	 analysts	 in	 presenting	 business	
performance	 to	 users	 of	 the	 financial	 statements.	 However,	 as	 profit-based	 measures	 do	 not	 fully	 represent	
the	 size	 of	 the	 balance	 sheet,	 we	 have	 also	 considered	 net	 assets	 in	 determining	 materiality.	 In	 making	 this	
determination,	 we	 considered	 the	 profit	 metrics	 of	 both	 the	 prior	 year	 and	 the	 current	 year	 because	 of	 the	
variation.	 Underlying	 profit	 is	 defined	 by	 management	 on	 page	 91.	
We	 agreed	 with	 the	 Audit	 and	 Risk	 Committee	 that	 we	 would	 report	 to	 the	 Committee	 all	 audit	 differences	 in	 excess	 of	 £20,500	 (2016:	 £5,700),	
as	 well	 as	 differences	 below	 that	 threshold	 that,	 in	 our	 view,	 warranted	 reporting	 on	 qualitative	 grounds.	 We	 also	 report	 to	 the	 Audit	 and	
Risk	 Committee	 on	 disclosure	 matters	 that	 we	 identified	 when	 assessing	 the	 overall	 presentation	 of	 the	 financial	 statements. 77 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our	 audit	 was	 scoped	 by	 obtaining	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 its	 environment,	 including	 internal	 control,	 how	 the	 Group	 is	
organised,	 the	 consolidation	 process,	 the	 performance	 and	 financial	 position	 of	 each	 component	 as	 a	 proportion	 of	 the	 total	 for	 the	 Group	
and	 assessing	 the	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 throughout	 the	 Group.	 Based	 on	 that	 assessment,	 we	 focused	 our	 Group	 audit	 scope	
primarily	 on	 the	 Group	 operations	 in	 the	 UK,	 France,	 the	 US	 and	 Germany.
The	 UK	 and	 France	 were	 subject	 to	 a	 full	 audit,	 while	 the	 US	 and	 Germany	 were	 subject	 to	 specified	 audit	 procedures	 including	 full	 audit	
procedures	 on	 significant	 risks.	 Our	 testing	 in	 the	 US	 and	 Germany	 was	 based	 on	 our	 assessment	 of	 the	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 and	
of	 the	 materiality	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operations	 at	 those	 locations	 including	 an	 audit	 of	 account	 balances	 relating	 to	 the	 significant	 risks	 areas	
applicable	 to	 those	 locations.	
The	 Group	 audit	 engagement	 team	 visited	 all	 overseas	 component	 audit	 teams	 as	 part	 of	 our	 oversight	 of	 their	 work.	 We	 visited	 each	 of	
the	 overseas	 locations	 set	 out	 above	 in	 order	 for	 a	 senior	 member	 of	 the	 Group	 audit	 engagement	 team	 to	 update	 our	 understanding	
of	 the	 operations,	 risks	 and	 control	 environments	 of	 each	 component	 as	 well	 as	 to	 review	 the	 component	 auditors’	 working	 papers.	
The	 Group	 audit	 engagement	 team	 performed	 the	 audit	 of	 the	 UK	 business	 and	 procedures	 on	 the	 US	 business	 without	 the	 involvement	
of	 a	 component	 team.	
For	 all	 other	 locations,	 we	 have	 performed	 analytical	 review	 procedures	 at	 Group	 level.	 At	 the	 parent	 entity	 level	 we	 also	 tested	 the	
consolidation	 process.	 The	 changes	 in	 scope	 this	 year	 are	 that	 we	 performed:
•	specified	 audit	 procedures	 on	 revenue	 and	 cost	 of	 sales	 for	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited
•	analytical	 review	 procedures	 for	 Italy,	 rather	 than	 specified	 audit	 procedures
•	analytical	 review	 procedures	 for	 the	 newly	 acquired	 subsidiary	 Clockwork	 Research	 Limited.	
The	 Group	 audit	 engagement	 team	 has	 obtained	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 Group,	 including	 the	 consolidation	 process	 and	 Group-wide	
controls,	 to	 confirm	 our	 conclusion	 that	 there	 were	 no	 significant	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 of	 the	 aggregated	 financial	 information	
of	 the	 remaining	 components	 not	 subject	 to	 audit	 or	 audit	 of	 specified	 account	 balances.	 The	 Group	 results	 are	 split	 as	 follows:

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In	 our	 opinion,	 based	 on	 the	 work	 undertaken	 in	 the	 course	 of	 the	 audit:
•	the	 part	 of	 the	 Directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited	 has	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006
•	the	 information	 given	 in	 the	 Strategic	 report	 and	 the	 Directors’	 report	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 for	 which	 the	 financial	 statements	 are	 prepared	
is	 consistent	 with	 the	 financial	 statements
•	the	 Strategic	 report	 and	 the	 Directors’	 report	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 legal	 requirements.
In	 the	 light	 of	 the	 knowledge	 and	 understanding	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 environment	 obtained	 in	 the	 course	 of	 the	 audit,	 we	 have	 not	
identified	 any	 material	 misstatements	 in	 the	 Strategic	 report	 and	 the	 Directors’	 report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacyofexplanationsreceivedandaccountingrecords
Under	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion:
•	we	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our	 audit,	 or
•	adequate	 accounting	 records	 have	 not	 been	 kept	 by	 the	 Parent	 Company,	 or	 returns	
adequate	 for	 our	 audit	 have	 not	 been	 received	 from	 branches	 not	 visited	 by	 us,	 or
•	the	 Parent	 Company	 financial	 statements	 are	 not	 in	 agreement	 with	 the	 accounting	
records	 and	 returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’remuneration
Under	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 we	 are	 also	 required	 to	 report	 if	 in	 our	 opinion	 certain	
disclosures	 of	 directors’	 remuneration	 have	 not	 been	 made	 or	 the	 part	 of	 the	
Directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited	 is	 not	 in	 agreement	 with	 the	 accounting	
records	 and	 returns.
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporategovernancestatement
Under	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 we	 are	 also	 required	 to	 review	 part	 of	 the	 Corporate	
governance	 statement	 relating	 to	 the	 Company’s	 compliance	 with	 certain	 provisions	
of	 the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Ourdutytoreadotherinformationintheannualreport
Under	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland),	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	
to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion,	 information	 in	 the	 annual	 report	 is:
•	materially	 inconsistent	 with	 the	 information	 in	 the	 audited	 financial	 statements,	 or
•	apparently	 materially	 incorrect	 based	 on,	 or	 materially	 inconsistent	 with,	 our	
knowledge	 of	 the	 Group	 acquired	 in	 the	 course	 of	 performing	 our	 audit,	 or
•	otherwise	 misleading.
In	 particular,	 we	 are	 required	 to	 consider	 whether	 we	 have	 identified	 any	 inconsistencies	
between	 our	 knowledge	 acquired	 during	 the	 audit	 and	 the	 directors’	 statement	 that	
they	 consider	 the	 annual	 report	 is	 fair,	 balanced	 and	 understandable	 and	 whether	 the	
annual	 report	 appropriately	 discloses	 those	 matters	 that	 we	 communicated	 to	 the	 Audit	
and	 Risk	 Committee	 which	 we	 consider	 should	 have	 been	 disclosed.
We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements. 79 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As	 explained	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 Directors’	 responsibilities	 statement,	 the	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	 financial	
statements	 and	 for	 being	 satisfied	 that	 they	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view.	 Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	 audit	 and	 express	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 financial	
statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).	 We	 also	 comply	 with	 International	
Standard	 on	 Quality	 Control	 1	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).	 Our	 audit	 methodology	 and	 tools	 aim	 to	 ensure	 that	 our	 quality	 control	 procedures	 are	
effective,	 understood	 and	 applied.	 Our	 quality	 controls	 and	 systems	 include	 our	 dedicated	 professional	 standards	 review	 team	 and	
independent	 partner	 reviews.
This	 report	 is	 made	 solely	 to	 the	 Company’s	 members,	 as	 a	 body,	 in	 accordance	 with	 Chapter	 3	 of	 Part	 16	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006.	
Our	 audit	 work	 has	 been	 undertaken	 so	 that	 we	 might	 state	 to	 the	 Company’s	 members	 those	 matters	 we	 are	 required	 to	 state	 to	 them	
in	 an	 auditor’s	 report	 and	 for	 no	 other	 purpose.	 To	 the	 fullest	 extent	 permitted	 by	 law,	 we	 do	 not	 accept	 or	 assume	 responsibility	 to	 anyone	
other	 than	 the	 Company	 and	 the	 Company’s	 members	 as	 a	 body,	 for	 our	 audit	 work,	 for	 this	 report,	 or	 for	 the	 opinions	 we	 have	 formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An	 audit	 involves	 obtaining	 evidence	 about	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 sufficient	 to	 give	 reasonable	 assurance	
that	 the	 financial	 statements	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 error.	 This	 includes	 an	 assessment	 of:	
whether	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 Group’s	 and	 the	 Parent	 Company’s	 circumstances	 and	 have	 been	 consistently	 applied	
and	 adequately	 disclosed;	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 significant	 accounting	 estimates	 made	 by	 the	 directors;	 and	 the	 overall	 presentation	 of	 the	
financial	 statements.	 In	 addition,	 we	 read	 all	 the	 financial	 and	 non-financial	 information	 in	 the	 annual	 report	 to	 identify	 material	
inconsistencies	 with	 the	 audited	 financial	 statements	 and	 to	 identify	 any	 information	 that	 is	 apparently	 materially	 incorrect	 based	 on,	 or	
materially	 inconsistent	 with,	 the	 knowledge	 acquired	 by	 us	 in	 the	 course	 of	 performing	 the	 audit.	 If	 we	 become	 aware	 of	 any	 apparent	
material	 misstatements	 or	 inconsistencies	 we	 consider	 the	 implications	 for	 our	 report.

2  Accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (IFRSs)	 as	 adopted	
for	 use	 in	 the	 European	 Union	 in	 accordance	 with	 EU	 law	 (IAS	 regulation	 EC1606/2002)	 and	 those	 parts	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	
2006	 applicable	 to	 companies	 reporting	 under	 IFRS.
The	 financial	 statements	 are	 presented	 in	 sterling,	 being	 the	 currency	 of	 the	 primary	 economic	 environment	 in	 which	 the	 Group	
operates.	 Unless	 otherwise	 stated,	 figures	 are	 rounded	 to	 the	 nearest	 thousand.	 They	 are	 prepared	 on	 the	 historical	 cost	 basis,	
except	 for	 the	 revaluation	 of	 certain	 financial	 instruments	 which	 are	 stated	 at	 fair	 value.	
The	 accounting	 policies	 adopted	 are	 consistent	 with	 those	 of	 the	 previous	 financial	 year,	 except	 as	 described	 in	 the	
following	 sections.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The	 following	 new	 and	 revised	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 have	 been	 adopted	 in	 the	 current	 year:	
•	IFRS	 11	 (amendments)	 Accounting	 for	 acquisitions	 of	 interest	 in	 Joint	 Operations;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	
1	 January	 2016
•	IAS	 16	 (amendments)	 Property,	 Plant	 and	 Equipment	 and	 IAS	 38	 Intangible	 Assets:	 Amendments	 regarding	 the	 clarification	
of	 acceptable	 methods	 of	 depreciation	 and	 amortisation;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2016
•	IAS	 16	 and	 IAS	 41	 (amendments)	 Property,	 Plant	 and	 Equipment:	 Amendments	 to	 bring	 bearer	 plants	 into	 the	 scope	 of	 IAS	 16	
rather	 than	 IAS	 41;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2016
•	IAS	 27	 (amendments)	 Separate	 Financial	 Statements;	 Amendments	 reinstating	 the	 equity	 method;	 effective	 for	 periods	
beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2016
•	IAS	 1	 (amendments)	 Disclosure	 initiative;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2016
•	IFRS	 10	 Consolidated	 financial	 statements,	 IFRS	 12	 Disclosure	 of	 interests	 in	 other	 entities	 and	 IAS	 28	 Investment	 in	 associates;	
applying	 the	 consolidation	 exception	 for	 investment	 entities;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2016.
Adoption	 of	 the	 above	 has	 had	 no	 impact	 on	 the	 disclosures	 or	 on	 the	 amounts	 recognised	 in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	
Annual Improvements 2012-2014 cycle
The	 Annual	 Improvements	 cycle	 provides	 a	 streamlined	 process	 for	 dealing	 efficiently	 with	 a	 collection	 of	 amendments	 to	 IFRSs.	
The	 primary	 objective	 of	 the	 process	 is	 to	 enhance	 the	 quality	 of	 standards,	 by	 amending	 existing	 IFRSs	 to	 clarify	 guidance	 and	
wording,	 or	 to	 correct	 for	 relatively	 minor	 unintended	 consequences,	 conflicts	 or	 oversights.
Adoption	 of	 the	 Annual	 Improvements	 2012-2014	 cycle	 has	 had	 no	 impact	 on	 the	 disclosures	 or	 on	 the	 amounts	 recognised	
in	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements.	
New standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
The	 following	 standards,	 amendments	 and	 interpretations	 to	 existing	 standards	 have	 been	 published	 –	 they	 are	 not	 mandatory	
for	 the	 current	 accounting	 period,	 and	 have	 not	 been	 early	 adopted	 by	 the	 Group:
•	IAS	 12	 Income	 taxes:	 clarify	 recognition	 of	 deferred	 tax	 assets	 for	 unrealised	 losses;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	
after	 1	 January	 2017
•	Annual	 Improvements	 to	 IFRS	 standards	 2014-2016	 cycle;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2017
•	IAS	 7	 Statement	 of	 cash	 flows:	 clarify	 disclosure	 requirements;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2017
•	IFRS	 9	 (2014)	 Financial	 Instruments;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2018
•	IFRS	 2	 Share-based	 payment:	 classification	 and	 measurement	 of	 share-based	 payment	 transactions;	 effective	 for	 periods	
beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2018
•	IAS	 40	 Investment	 Property:	 transfers	 of	 investment	 property;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2018
•	IFRS	 16	 Leases;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2019
•	IFRS	 15	 Revenue	 from	 Contracts	 with	 Customers;	 effective	 for	 periods	 beginning	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2018.
Notes to the financial statements
for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2017 87 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
2  Accounting policies continued
There	 are	 no	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 in	 issue	 but	 not	 yet	 adopted	 which,	 in	 the	 opinion	 of	 the	 directors,	 will	 have	
a	 material	 effect	 on	 the	 reported	 income	 or	 net	 assets	 of	 the	 Group	 or	 Company.
b) Basis of consolidation
The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 incorporate	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 entities	 controlled	 by	 the	
Company	 (its	 subsidiaries)	 made	 up	 to	 31	 January	 each	 year.	 Control	 is	 achieved	 where	 the	 Company	 has	 the	 power	 to	 govern	
the	 financial	 and	 operating	 policies	 of	 an	 investee	 entity	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 benefits	 from	 its	 activities.
The	 results	 of	 subsidiaries	 acquired	 or	 disposed	 of	 during	 the	 year	 are	 included	 in	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statement	 from	
the	 effective	 date	 of	 acquisition	 or	 up	 to	 the	 effective	 date	 of	 disposal,	 as	 appropriate.	 Where	 necessary,	 adjustments	 are	
made	 to	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 subsidiaries	 to	 bring	 the	 accounting	 policies	 used	 into	 line	 with	 those	 used	 by	 the	 Group.	
All	 intra-Group	 transactions,	 balances,	 income	 and	 expenses	 are	 eliminated	 on	 consolidation.
c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The	 preparation	 of	 financial	 statements	 requires	 management	 to	 make	 judgements,	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	
application	 of	 policies	 and	 reported	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 income	 and	 expenses.	 These	 estimates	 and	 associated	
assumptions	 are	 based	 on	 historical	 experience	 and	 various	 other	 factors	 believed	 to	 be	 reasonable	 under	 the	 circumstances.	
Actual	 results	 could	 differ	 from	 these	 estimates.	 These	 underlying	 assumptions	 are	 reviewed	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis.	 Revisions	
to	 accounting	 estimates	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 the	 estimate	 is	 revised	 if	 the	 revision	 affects	 only	 that	 period;	
or	 in	 the	 period	 of	 the	 revision	 and	 future	 periods	 if	 these	 are	 also	 affected.	
Impairment of goodwill
Management	 conducts	 annual	 impairment	 reviews	 of	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 goodwill	 in	 relation	 to	 acquired	 subsidiaries.	
Accruals related to air charter contracts
When	 revenues	 and	 costs	 for	 air	 charter	 contracts	 are	 initially	 recognised,	 estimates	 may	 need	 to	 be	 made	 in	 order	 to	 accrue	
items	 of	 income	 and	 expenditure	 that	 have	 not	 been	 invoiced	 but	 are	 expected	 to	 crystallise.	 These	 estimates	 may	 not	 reflect	
the	 ultimate	 outcome.
Valuation of acquisition goodwill and intangibles
An	 intangible	 resource	 acquired	 with	 a	 subsidiary	 undertaking	 is	 recognised	 as	 an	 intangible	 asset	 if	 it	 is	 separable	 from	 the	
acquired	 business	 or	 arises	 from	 contractual	 or	 legal	 rights,	 and	 it	 is	 expected	 to	 generate	 future	 economic	 benefits	 and	 its	 fair	
value	 can	 be	 measured	 reliably.	 The	 identification	 of	 intangible	 assets	 acquired	 as	 part	 of	 business	 combinations	 requires	
judgement.	 For	 each	 business	 combination	 the	 balance	 of	 goodwill	 to	 other	 intangible	 assets	 is	 reviewed	 for	 appropriateness.	
Acquired	 intangible	 assets,	 comprising	 brands,	 customer	 relationships,	 other	 mandates	 and	 training	 materials,	 are	 amortised	
through	 the	 Consolidated	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 their	 estimated	 economic	 lives	 of	 between	 one	 and	
20	 years.	 Significant	 judgement	 is	 required	 in	 determining	 the	 fair	 value	 and	 economic	 lives	 of	 acquired	 intangible	 assets.	
External	 valuations	 are	 obtained	 for	 significant	 acquisitions.	 Details	 of	 the	 intangible	 assets	 recognised	 on	 acquisition	 during	
the	 year	 are	 disclosed	 in	 note	 32.	
d) Going concern
The	 Group’s	 business	 activities,	 together	 with	 the	 factors	 likely	 to	 affect	 its	 future	 development,	 performance	 and	 position	
are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Strategic	 report	 on	 pages	 1	 to	 39.	 The	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 Group,	 its	 cash	 flows,	 liquidity	 position	 and	
borrowing	 facilities	 are	 described	 in	 the	 Strategic	 Report	 on	 pages	 1	 to	 39.	 In	 addition,	 note	 24	 to	 the	 financial	 statements	
includes	 the	 Group’s	 objectives,	 policies	 and	 processes	 for	 managing	 its	 capital	 risk;	 details	 of	 its	 financial	 instruments	 and	
hedging	 activities;	 and	 its	 exposures	 to	 interest	 rate	 risk,	 credit	 risk,	 liquidity	 risk	 and	 foreign	 currency	 risk.
The	 Group	 has	 considerable	 cash	 resources	 and	 little	 debt.	 As	 a	 consequence,	 the	 directors	 believe	 that	 the	 Group	 is	 well	 placed	
to	 manage	 its	 business	 risks	 successfully	 despite	 the	 current	 uncertain	 economic	 outlook.
The	 directors	 have	 a	 reasonable	 expectation	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 adequate	 resources	 to	 continue	 in	 operational	 existence	 for	 the	
foreseeable	 future.	 Thus	 they	 continue	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	 concern	 basis	 of	 accounting	 in	 preparing	 the	 annual	 financial	 statements. 88 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

e) Foreign currency
i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 foreign	 exchange	 rate	 prevailing	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Monetary	
assets	 and	 liabilities	 denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 at	 the	 reporting	 date	 are	 translated	 to	 the	 functional	 currency	 of	 the	
entity	 at	 the	 foreign	 exchange	 rate	 ruling	 at	 that	 date.	 Foreign	 exchange	 differences	 arising	 on	 translation	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	
income	 statement.	 Non-monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 that	 are	 measured	 in	 terms	 of	 historical	 cost	 in	 a	 foreign	 currency	 are	
translated	 using	 the	 exchange	 rate	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.
ii) Financial statements of foreign operations 
The	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 of	 foreign	 operations	 are	 translated	 at	 exchange	 rates	 prevailing	 at	 the	 reporting	 date.	 Income	 and	
expenses	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 average	 rate	 for	 the	 period.	 Exchange	 differences	 arising	 are	 classified	 as	 equity	 and	 transferred	
to	 the	 Group’s	 translation	 reserve.	
f) Goodwill
Goodwill	 arising	 in	 a	 business	 combination	 is	 recognised	 as	 an	 asset	 at	 the	 date	 that	 control	 is	 acquired	 (the	 acquisition	 date).	
Goodwill	 is	 measured	 as	 the	 excess	 of	 the	 sum	 of	 the	 consideration	 transferred,	 the	 amount	 of	 any	 non-controlling	 interest	 in	
the	 acquiree	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 acquirer’s	 previously	 held	 equity	 interest	 (if	 any)	 in	 the	 entity	 over	 the	 net	 of	 the	 acquisition	
date	 amounts	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets	 acquired	 and	 the	 liabilities	 assumed.
Goodwill	 denominated	 in	 currencies	 other	 than	 sterling	 is	 revalued	 at	 the	 rate	 of	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 balance	 sheet	 date.
If,	 after	 reassessment,	 the	 Group’s	 interest	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 acquiree’s	 identifiable	 net	 assets	 exceeds	 the	 sum	 of	 the	
consideration	 transferred,	 the	 amount	 of	 any	 non-controlling	 interest	 in	 the	 acquiree	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 acquirer’s	
previously	 held	 equity	 interest	 in	 the	 acquiree	 (if	 any),	 the	 excess	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 profit	 or	 loss	 as	 a	 bargain	
purchase	 gain.
Goodwill	 is	 not	 amortised	 but	 is	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 at	 least	 annually.	 For	 the	 purpose	 of	 impairment	 testing,	 goodwill	 is	
allocated	 to	 each	 of	 the	 Group’s	 cash-generating	 units	 expected	 to	 benefit	 from	 the	 synergies	 of	 the	 combination.	 Cash-generating	
units	 to	 which	 goodwill	 has	 been	 allocated	 are	 tested	 for	 impairment	 annually,	 or	 more	 frequently	 when	 there	 is	 an	 indication	
that	 the	 unit	 may	 be	 impaired.	 If	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 the	 cash-generating	 unit	 is	 less	 than	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 unit,	
the	 impairment	 loss	 is	 allocated	 first	 to	 reduce	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 any	 goodwill	 allocated	 to	 the	 unit	 and	 then	 to	 the	 other	
assets	 of	 the	 unit	 pro	 rata	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 each	 asset	 in	 the	 unit.	 An	 impairment	 loss	 recognised	 for	
goodwill	 is	 not	 reversed	 in	 a	 subsequent	 period.
On	 disposal	 of	 a	 subsidiary,	 the	 attributable	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 is	 included	 in	 the	 determination	 of	 the	 profit	 or	 loss	 on	 disposal.
g) Intangible assets 
Internally generated assets 
Internally	 generated	 intangible	 assets	 developed	 by	 the	 Group	 are	 recognised	 only	 if	 all	 of	 the	 following	 conditions	 are	 met:
•	an	 asset	 is	 created	 that	 can	 be	 identified
•	it	 is	 probable	 that	 the	 asset	 created	 will	 generate	 future	 economic	 benefits
•	the	 development	 cost	 of	 the	 asset	 can	 be	 measured	 reliably.
Other	 research	 expenditure	 is	 written	 off	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 it	 is	 incurred.	
Amortisation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 so	 as	 to	 write	 off	 the	 cost	 of	 assets	 less	 their	 residual	 values	 over	 their	
estimated	 useful	 lives,	 which	 in	 the	 case	 of	 software	 is	 10%-20%	 per	 annum	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis.	 The	 carrying	 value	 of	
intangible	 assets	 with	 a	 finite	 life	 is	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 whenever	 events	 or	 changes	 in	 circumstances	 indicate	 that	 the	
carrying	 value	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable. 89 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
2  Accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
Intangible	 assets	 arising	 on	 acquisition	 are	 stated	 at	 fair	 value	 less	 accumulated	 amortisation	 and	 any	 impairment	 losses.	
Amortisation	 of	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 intangible	 assets	 arising	 on	 acquisition	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 the	
estimated	 useful	 life,	 which	 is	 as	 follows:
Brands	 10%	 per	 annum	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	
Mandates/order	 book	 100%	 per	 annum
Customer	 relationships	 5%-16.7% 	 per	 annum	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	
Training	 materials	 10%	 per	 annum	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	
The	 carrying	 value	 of	 intangible	 assets	 with	 a	 finite	 life	 is	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 whenever	 events	 or	 changes	 in	 circumstances	
indicate	 that	 the	 carrying	 value	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable.
h) Property, plant and equipment
Items	 of	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation	 and	 any	 impairment	 losses.	
Depreciation	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 so	 as	 to	 write	 off	 the	 cost	 of	 assets	 less	 their	 residual	 values	 over	 their	
estimated	 useful	 lives,	 as	 follows:
Short	 leasehold	 property	 over 	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis
Leasehold	 improvements	 over 	 the	 life	 of	 the	 lease	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis
Fixtures	 and	 equipment	 10%-33% 	 per	 annum	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis
Motor	 vehicles	 	 25%	 reducing	 balance
i) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 Group	 reviews	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 of	 its	 tangible	 and	 intangible	 assets	 to	 determine	 whether	
there	 is	 any	 indication	 that	 those	 assets	 have	 suffered	 an	 impairment	 loss.	 If	 any	 such	 indication	 exists,	 the	 recoverable	 amount	
of	 the	 asset	 is	 estimated	 to	 determine	 the	 extent	 of	 the	 impairment	 loss	 (if	 any).	 Where	 the	 asset	 does	 not	 generate	 cash	 flows	
that	 are	 independent	 from	 other	 assets,	 the	 Group	 estimates	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 the	 cash-generating	 unit	 to	 which	 the	
asset	 belongs.	 An	 intangible	 asset	 with	 an	 indefinite	 useful	 life	 is	 tested	 for	 impairment	 at	 least	 annually	 and	 whenever	 there	
is	 an	 indication	 that	 the	 asset	 may	 be	 impaired.
Recoverable	 amount	 is	 the	 higher	 of	 fair	 value	 less	 costs	 to	 sell	 and	 value	 in	 use.	 In	 assessing	 value	 in	 use,	 the	 estimated	 future	
cash	 flows	 are	 discounted	 to	 their	 present	 value	 using	 a	 pre-tax	 discount	 rate	 that	 reflects	 current	 market	 assessments	 of	 the	
time	 value	 of	 money	 and	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 asset	 for	 which	 the	 estimates	 of	 future	 cash	 flows	 have	 not	 been	 adjusted.
If	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 an	 asset	 (or	 cash-generating	 unit)	 is	 estimated	 to	 be	 less	 than	 its	 carrying	 amount,	 the	 carrying	
amount	 of	 the	 asset	 (or	 cash-generating	 unit)	 is	 reduced	 to	 its	 recoverable	 amount.	 An	 impairment	 loss	 is	 recognised	
immediately	 in	 profit	 or	 loss,	 unless	 the	 relevant	 asset	 is	 carried	 at	 a	 revalued	 amount,	 in	 which	 case	 the	 impairment	 loss	
is	 treated	 as	 a	 revaluation	 decrease.
Where	 an	 impairment	 loss	 subsequently	 reverses,	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 asset	 (or	 cash-generating	 unit)	 is	 increased	 to	
the	 revised	 estimate	 of	 its	 recoverable	 amount,	 but	 so	 that	 the	 increased	 carrying	 amount	 does	 not	 exceed	 the	 carrying	 amount	
that	 would	 have	 been	 determined	 had	 no	 impairment	 loss	 been	 recognised	 for	 the	 asset	 (or	 cash-generating	 unit)	 in	 prior	 years.	
A	 reversal	 of	 an	 impairment	 loss	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 profit	 or	 loss,	 unless	 the	 relevant	 asset	 is	 carried	 at	 a	 revalued	
amount,	 in	 which	 case	 the	 reversal	 of	 the	 impairment	 loss	 is	 treated	 as	 a	 revaluation	 increase.
j) Assets in disposal groups classified as held for sale
Non-current	 assets	 and	 disposal	 groups	 are	 classified	 as	 held	 for	 sale	 only	 if	 they	 are	 available	 for	 immediate	 sale	 in	 their	
present	 condition	 and	 a	 sale	 is	 highly	 probable	 and	 expected	 to	 be	 completed	 within	 one	 year	 from	 the	 date	 of	 classification.	
Such	 assets	 are	 measured	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 carrying	 amount	 and	 fair	 value	 less	 costs	 to	 sell	 and	 are	 not	 depreciated	 or	 amortised. 90 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

k) Financial instruments
Financial assets
The	 Group	 classifies	 its	 financial	 assets	 in	 the	 following	 categories:	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss,	 and	 loans	 and	
receivables.	 The	 classification	 depends	 on	 the	 purpose	 for	 which	 the	 financial	 assets	 were	 acquired.	 Management	 determines	
the	 classification	 of	 its	 financial	 assets	 at	 initial	 recognition.
Purchases	 and	 sales	 of	 financial	 assets	 are	 recognised	 on	 the	 trade	 date	 –	 the	 date	 on	 which	 the	 Group	 commits	 to	 purchase	
or	 sell	 the	 asset.	 Financial	 assets	 are	 initially	 recognised	 at	 fair	 value	 plus	 transaction	 costs,	 except	 for	 financial	 assets	 held	
at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 which	 are	 initially	 recognised	 at	 fair	 value,	 and	 transaction	 costs	 are	 expensed	 in	 the	 income	
statement.	 Financial	 assets	 are	 derecognised	 when	 the	 rights	 to	 receive	 cash	 flows	 have	 expired	 or	 have	 been	 transferred	 and	
the	 Group	 has	 transferred	 substantially	 all	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership.	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial	 assets	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 are	 financial	 assets	 held	 for	 trading.	 A	 financial	 asset	 is	 classified	 in	 this	
category	 if	 acquired	 principally	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 selling	 in	 the	 short	 term.	 Derivatives	 are	 also	 categorised	 as	 held	 for	 trading	
unless	 they	 are	 designated	 as	 hedges.	 Assets	 in	 this	 category	 are	 classified	 as	 current	 assets	 if	 they	 are	 expected	 to	 be	 settled	
within	 12	 months;	 otherwise,	 they	 are	 classified	 as	 non-current.	 Financial	 assets	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 are	 initially	
recognised	 at	 fair	 value	 at	 the	 date	 the	 contract	 is	 entered	 into,	 and	 subsequently	 gains	 or	 losses	 arising	 from	 changes	 in	 their	
fair	 value	 are	 presented	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 within	 administrative	 expenses	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 arise.	 The	 Group’s	
financial	 assets	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 comprise	 derivative	 financial	 instruments.
Derivative financial instruments
The	 Group	 enters	 into	 derivative	 financial	 instruments,	 including	 foreign	 exchange	 forward	 contracts,	 to	 manage	 its	 exposure	
to	 foreign	 exchange	 rate	 risk.	 Derivatives	 not	 designated	 into	 an	 effective	 hedge	 relationship	 are	 classified	 as	 a	 financial	 asset	
or	 a	 financial	 liability.	 The	 Group	 has	 not	 designated	 any	 derivatives	 as	 hedging	 items	 and	 therefore	 does	 not	 apply	 hedge	
accounting.
Loans and receivables
Loans	 and	 receivables	 are	 non-derivative	 financial	 assets	 with	 fixed	 or	 determinable	 payments	 that	 are	 not	 quoted	 in	 an	 active	
market.	 They	 are	 included	 in	 current	 assets,	 except	 for	 maturities	 greater	 than	 12	 months	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 reporting	 period.	
These	 are	 classified	 as	 non-current	 assets.	 Loans	 and	 receivables	 are	 subsequently	 carried	 at	 amortised	 cost	 using	 the	 effective	
interest	 method.	 The	 Group’s	 loans	 and	 receivables	 comprise	 trade	 receivables,	 other	 receivables,	 accrued	 income	 and	 cash	 and	
cash	 equivalents	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet.	
Trade receivables
Trade	 receivables	 are	 amounts	 due	 from	 customers	 for	 services	 performed	 in	 the	 ordinary	 course	 of	 business.	 If	 collection	
is	 expected	 in	 one	 year	 or	 less,	 they	 are	 classified	 as	 current	 assets.	 If	 not,	 they	 are	 presented	 as	 non-current	 assets.
Other receivables
Other	 receivables	 are	 other	 amounts	 contractually	 due	 from	 third	 parties,	 for	 example	 deposits	 receivable	 for	 leased	 assets.	
Accrued income
Accrued	 income	 is	 revenue	 that	 has	 been	 contracted	 and	 recognised	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 accounting	 policies,	 but	 not	
yet	 invoiced.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 comprise	 cash	 balances	 and	 call	 deposits	 with	 an	 original	 maturity	 of	 three	 months	 or	 less.	
The	 carrying	 amount	 of	 these	 assets	 approximates	 their	 fair	 value. 91 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Financial liabilities
The	 Group	 classifies	 its	 financial	 liabilities	 in	 the	 following	 categories:	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss,	 and	 at	 amortised	 cost.	
The	 classification	 depends	 on	 the	 purpose	 for	 which	 the	 financial	 liabilities	 were	 acquired.	 Management	 determines	 the	
classification	 of	 its	 financial	 liabilities	 at	 initial	 recognition.	 Financial	 liabilities	 are	 recognised	 when	 the	 Group	 becomes	 a	 party	
to	 the	 contractual	 agreement	 of	 the	 instrument.	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial	 liabilities	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 are	 financial	 liabilities	 held	 for	 trading.	 A	 financial	 liability	 is	 classified	
in	 this	 category	 if	 acquired	 principally	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 selling	 in	 the	 short	 term.	 Derivatives	 are	 also	 categorised	 as	 held	 for	
trading	 unless	 they	 are	 designated	 as	 hedges.	 Liabilities	 in	 this	 category	 are	 classified	 as	 current	 liabilities	 if	 they	 are	 expected	
to	 be	 settled	 within	 12	 months;	 otherwise,	 they	 are	 classified	 as	 non-current.	 Financial	 liabilities	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	
loss	 are	 initially	 recognised	 at	 fair	 value	 at	 the	 date	 the	 contract	 is	 entered	 into,	 and	 subsequently	 gains	 or	 losses	 arising	 from	
changes	 in	 their	 fair	 value	 are	 presented	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 within	 administrative	 expenses	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	
arise.	 The	 Group’s	 financial	 liabilities	 at	 fair	 value	 through	 profit	 or	 loss	 comprise	 derivative	 financial	 instruments.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
The	 Group’s	 financial	 liabilities	 at	 amortised	 cost	 comprise	 trade	 payables,	 other	 payables,	 accrued	 costs	 and	 borrowings.	
They	 are	 initially	 measured	 at	 fair	 value,	 net	 of	 transaction	 costs,	 and	 are	 subsequently	 measured	 at	 amortised	 cost	 using	 the	
effective	 interest	 method.
Trade payables
Trade	 payables	 are	 obligations	 to	 pay	 for	 goods	 or	 services	 that	 have	 been	 acquired	 in	 the	 ordinary	 course	 of	 business	 from	
suppliers.	 Trade	 payables	 are	 classified	 as	 current	 liabilities	 if	 payment	 is	 due	 within	 one	 year	 or	 less.	 If	 not,	 they	 are	 presented	
as	 non-current	 liabilities.
Other payables
Other	 payables	 that	 are	 financial	 liabilities	 at	 amortised	 cost	 are	 certain	 customer	 deposits	 which	 are	 contractually	 refundable	
to	 customers	 on	 demand.
Accrued costs
Accrued	 costs	 are	 costs	 that	 have	 been	 contracted	 and	 recognised	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 accounting	 policies,	 but	 for	
which	 invoices	 have	 not	 yet	 been	 received	 or	 payments	 made,	 as	 applicable.
Borrowings
Borrowings	 consist	 of	 an	 interest-bearing	 bank	 loan	 which	 is	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	 offset	 and	 the	 net	 amount	 reported	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 when	 there	 is	 a	 legally	 enforceable	
right	 to	 offset	 the	 recognised	 amounts	 and	 there	 is	 an	 intention	 to	 settle	 on	 a	 net	 basis	 or	 realise	 the	 asset	 and	 settle	 the	
liability	 simultaneously.
Other items
The	 directors	 believe	 that	 the	 underlying	 profit	 and	 earnings	 per	 share	 measures	 provide	 additional	 useful	 information	 for	
shareholders	 on	 the	 underlying	 performance	 of	 the	 business.	 These	 measures	 are	 consistent	 with	 how	 underlying	 business	
performance	 is	 measured	 internally.	 The	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 measure	 is	 not	 a	 recognised	 profit	 measure	 under	 IFRS	
and	 may	 not	 be	 directly	 comparable	 with	 adjusted	 profit	 measures	 used	 by	 other	 companies.	 The	 adjustments	 made	 to	 reported	
profit	 before	 tax	 are	 to	 exclude	 the	 following:
•	restructuring	 costs
•	significant	 and	 one-off	 impairment	 charges	 and	 provisions	 that	 distort	 underlying	 trading
•	costs	 relating	 to	 strategy	 changes	 that	 are	 not	 considered	 normal	 operating	 costs	 of	 the	 underlying	 business
•	acquisition	 costs
•	amortisation	 of	 intangible	 assets	 recognised	 on	 acquisition
•	acquisition	 consideration	 classified	 as	 an	 employee	 cost	 under	 IFRS	 3	 Business	 Combinations. 92 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Equity instruments issued by the Group
An	 equity	 instrument	 is	 a	 contract	 that	 evidences	 a	 residual	 interest	 in	 the	 asset	 of	 an	 entity	 after	 deducting	 all	 its	 liabilities.	
Equity	 instruments	 are	 recorded	 at	 the	 proceeds	 received,	 net	 of	 direct	 issue	 costs.	 The	 Group’s	 equity	 instruments	 comprise	
share	 capital	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet.
l) Provisions
Provisions	 are	 recognised	 when	 the	 Group	 has	 a	 present	 obligation	 as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 past	 event,	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 the	 Group	
will	 be	 required	 to	 settle	 that	 obligation.	 Provisions	 are	 measured	 at	 the	 directors’	 best	 estimate	 of	 the	 expenditure	 required	
to	 settle	 the	 obligation	 at	 the	 reporting	 date,	 and	 are	 discounted	 to	 present	 value.
A	 restructuring	 provision	 is	 recognised	 when	 the	 Group	 has	 developed	 a	 detailed	 formal	 plan	 for	 the	 restructuring	 and	 has	
raised	 a	 valid	 expectation	 in	 those	 affected	 that	 it	 will	 carry	 out	 the	 restructuring	 by	 starting	 to	 implement	 the	 plan	 or	
announcing	 its	 main	 features	 to	 those	 affected	 by	 it.
m) Revenue
Revenues	 are	 derived	 from	 aircraft	 chartering	 services,	 aircraft	 remarketing	 services,	 aircraft	 inspection	 services	 and	 the	
provision	 of	 training	 and	 safety	 consulting	 services.	 In	 line	 with	 IAS	 18	 Revenue,	 where	 a	 contract	 has	 been	 determined	 as	
principal,	 the	 full	 amount	 of	 the	 invoice	 is	 recognised	 as	 revenue.	 Where	 Air	 Partner	 is	 not	 acting	 as	 principal,	 revenue	 is	
recognised	 on	 an	 agency	 basis	 and	 only	 gross	 margin	 is	 reported	 as	 revenue.	 Revenue	 is	 measured	 as	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	
consideration	 received	 for	 the	 provision	 of	 goods	 and	 services	 to	 third-party	 customers	 and	 is	 stated	 exclusive	 of	 value	 added	
tax	 and	 is	 only	 recognised	 where	 there	 is	 a	 contractual	 right	 to	 receive	 consideration	 for	 work	 undertaken,	 the	 amount	 can	 be	
measured	 reliably	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 future	 economic	 benefits	 will	 flow.	
Aircraft chartering services
Amounts	 receivable	 in	 respect	 of	 aircraft	 chartering	 services	 are	 recognised	 as	 revenue	 when	 the	 economic	 benefits	 are	 deemed	
to	 have	 passed	 to	 the	 customer,	 which	 is	 generally	 the	 flight	 date.	 In	 instances	 where	 the	 Group	 is	 acting	 as	 agent,	 the	 net	
amount	 receivable	 by	 the	 Group	 is	 recognised	 as	 revenue.	 In	 instances	 where	 the	 Group	 is	 acting	 as	 principal,	 the	 full	 amount	
of	 the	 contract	 is	 recognised	 as	 revenue.
Aircraft remarketing services
Air	 Partner	 Remarketing’s	 (formerly	 Cabot	 Aviation)	 principal	 activity	 is	 that	 of	 an	 aircraft	 remarketing	 broker.	 Fees	 earned	
in	 respect	 of	 these	 services	 are	 recognised	 when	 they	 become	 payable	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 contract	 with	
the	 customer.
Aircraft inspection services
Aircraft	 registered	 with	 the	 Isle	 of	 Man	 Aircraft	 Registry,	 which	 is	 managed	 by	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited,	 require	 an	 annual	
inspection.	 Amounts	 receivable	 in	 respect	 of	 such	 inspections	 are	 recognised	 as	 revenue	 once	 the	 aircraft	 has	 been	 inspected.	
Provision of aviation-related training and safety consulting services
Baines	 Simmons	 Limited	 provides	 aviation-related	 specialist	 training	 and	 consultancy	 services.	 Revenue	 is	 recognised	 by	
reference	 to	 the	 stage	 of	 completion	 of	 the	 contract	 determined	 by	 the	 value	 of	 the	 services	 provided	 at	 balance	 sheet	 date	 as	
a	 proportion	 of	 the	 total	 value	 of	 the	 assignment.	 Amounts	 in	 respect	 of	 unbilled	 services	 provided	 to	 clients	 are	 recognised	
as	 revenue	 at	 balance	 sheet	 date.
n) Segmental reporting
Operating	 segments	 are	 reported	 in	 a	 manner	 consistent	 with	 the	 internal	 reporting	 provided	 to	 the	 chief	 operating	 decision	
maker.	 The	 chief	 operating	 decision	 maker,	 who	 is	 responsible	 for	 resource	 allocation	 and	 assessing	 performance	 of	 the	
operating	 segments,	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 the	 Board.	 The	 nature	 of	 the	 operating	 segments	 is	 set	 out	 in	 note	 4.
o) Share-based payments
From	 time	 to	 time,	 the	 Group	 will	 grant	 options	 to	 employees	 to	 subscribe	 for	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 the	 Company.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	
options	 granted	 is	 recognised	 as	 an	 employee	 expense	 with	 a	 corresponding	 increase	 in	 equity.	 The	 fair	 value	 is	 measured	 at	
grant	 date	 using	 the	 Monte	 Carlo	 method	 and	 spread	 over	 the	 period	 during	 which	 employees	 become	 unconditionally	 entitled	
to	 the	 options,	 based	 on	 management’s	 estimate	 of	 the	 number	 of	 options	 which	 will	 ultimately	 vest,	 adjusting	 at	 each	 reporting	
date	 for	 the	 effect	 of	 non-market	 based	 vesting	 conditions.	 93 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

p) Retirement benefit costs
Payments	 to	 defined	 contribution	 retirement	 benefit	 schemes	 are	 charged	 as	 an	 expense	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 the	 employees	
render	 service.	 Payments	 made	 to	 state-managed	 retirement	 benefit	 schemes	 are	 dealt	 with	 as	 payments	 to	 defined	 contribution	
schemes	 where	 the	 Group’s	 obligations	 under	 the	 schemes	 are	 equivalent	 to	 those	 arising	 in	 a	 defined	 contribution	 retirement	
benefit	 scheme.
q) Taxation
The	 tax	 expense	 represents	 current	 and	 deferred	 tax.	 Tax	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 except	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 relates	
to	 items	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity,	 in	 which	 case	 it	 is	 recognised	 in	 equity.
Current	 tax	 is	 the	 expected	 tax	 payable	 on	 the	 taxable	 income	 for	 the	 year,	 using	 tax	 rates	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	
at	 the	 reporting	 date,	 and	 any	 adjustments	 to	 the	 tax	 payable	 in	 respect	 of	 previous	 years.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 the	 tax	 expected	 to	 be	 payable	 or	 recoverable	 on	 differences	 between	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 assets	 and	
liabilities	 in	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 corresponding	 tax	 bases	 used	 in	 the	 computation	 of	 taxable	 profit	 and	 is	 accounted	
for	 using	 the	 balance	 sheet	 liability	 method.	 Deferred	 tax	 liabilities	 are	 recognised	 for	 all	 temporary	 differences	 and	 deferred	 tax	
assets	 are	 recognised	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 taxable	 profits	 will	 be	 available	 against	 which	 deductible	 temporary	
differences	 can	 be	 utilised.	 Such	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	 not	 recognised	 if	 the	 temporary	 differences	 arise	 from	 goodwill	 or	
from	 the	 initial	 recognition	 (other	 than	 in	 a	 business	 combination)	 of	 other	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 in	 a	 transaction	 that	 affects	
neither	 the	 taxable	 profit	 nor	 the	 accounting	 profit.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 calculated	 at	 the	 tax	 rates	 that	 are	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 at	 the	 reporting	 date.
r) Gross transaction value
Gross	 transaction	 value	 (GTV)	 represents	 the	 total	 value	 invoiced	 to	 clients	 and	 is	 stated	 exclusive	 of	 value	 added	 tax.	
s) Leasing
Leases	 are	 classified	 as	 finance	 leases	 whenever	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 lease	 transfer	 all,	 or	 substantially	 all,	 of	 the	 risks	 and	 rewards	
of	 ownership	 to	 the	 lessee.	 All	 other	 leases	 are	 classified	 as	 operating	 leases.	 Rental	 income	 or	 expenditure	 from	 operating	
leases	 is	 recognised	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 the	 lease	 term.
t) Dividends 
Final	 dividends	 on	 ordinary	 shares	 are	 recognised	 as	 a	 liability	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 the	 dividends	 are	 approved	 by	 the	
Company’s	 shareholders.	 Dividends	 are	 recognised	 as	 a	 liability	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 are	 approved.

4  Segmental analysis
The	 services	 provided	 by	 the	 Group	 consist	 of	 chartering	 different	 types	 of	 aircraft	 and	 related	 aviation	 services.	
The	 Group	 has	 four	 segments:	 Commercial	 Jets,	 Private	 Jets,	 Freight	 and	 Consulting	 &	 Training.	 Air	 Partner	 Remarketing’s	
(formerly	 Cabot	 Aviation)	 results	 are	 aggregated	 into	 Commercial	 Jets.	 Overheads	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 corporate	 costs	 are	
allocated	 to	 the	 Group’s	 segments	 in	 relation	 to	 operating	 activities.	
Sales	 transactions	 between	 operating	 segments	 are	 carried	 out	 on	 an	 arm’s	 length	 basis.	 All	 results,	 assets	 and	 liabilities	
reviewed	 by	 the	 Board	 (which	 is	 the	 chief	 operating	 decision	 maker)	 are	 prepared	 on	 a	 basis	 consistent	 with	 those	 that	 are	
reported	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.
The	 Board	 does	 not	 review	 revenue,	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 at	 segmental	 level,	 therefore	 these	 items	 are	 not	 disclosed.
The	 segmental	 information,	 as	 provided	 to	 the	 Board	 on	 a	 monthly	 basis,	 is	 as	 follows:

In	 March	 2010,	 Air	 Partner	 Private	 Jets	 Limited	 was	 closed.	 A	 claim	 against	 the	 company	 was	 filed	 by	 former	 employees	 of	 that	
business	 on	 the	 grounds	 that	 contractual	 undertakings	 could	 no	 longer	 be	 fulfilled.	 The	 last	 date	 for	 the	 claims	 to	 be	 pursued	
was	 16	 March	 2016.	 As	 no	 further	 actions	 have	 been	 taken	 by	 the	 claimants,	 the	 claims	 have	 lapsed.	 As	 a	 result,	 the	 provision	
was	 derecognised	 in	 the	 previous	 financial	 year.

The	 Group	 tests	 goodwill	 annually	 for	 impairment,	 or	 more	 frequently	 if	 there	 are	 indications	 that	 goodwill	 might	 be	 impaired.	
For	 the	 purpose	 of	 impairment	 testing,	 the	 recoverable	 amount	 of	 the	 cash	 generating	 unit	 was	 measured	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 its	
value	 in	 use,	 by	 applying	 cash	 flow	 projections	 based	 on	 financial	 forecasts	 covering	 a	 three-year	 period.	 The	 key	 assumptions	
for	 the	 value	 in	 use	 calculation	 were	 those	 regarding	 the	 discount	 rates,	 growth	 rates	 and	 expected	 changes	 to	 selling	 prices	 and	
direct	 costs	 during	 the	 forecast	 period.	 The	 estimated	 growth	 rates	 were	 based	 on	 past	 performance	 and	 expectation	 of	 future	
changes	 in	 the	 market.	 The	 growth	 rate	 used	 to	 extrapolate	 cash	 flow	 projections	 beyond	 the	 period	 covered	 by	 the	 financial	
forecasts	 was	 2%	 (2016:	 2%).	 The	 pre-tax	 rate	 used	 to	 discount	 the	 forecast	 cash	 flows	 ranged	 from	 10.76%-13%	 (2016:	 13%).
The	 directors	 do	 not	 believe	 that	 there	 are	 any	 reasonably	 possible	 changes	 to	 the	 key	 assumptions	 that	 would	 result	 in	
a	 material	 impairment	 of	 goodwill. 102 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

24  Financial instruments
The	 objectives	 of	 the	 Group’s	 treasury	 activities	 are	 to	 manage	 financial	 risk,	 minimise	 adverse	 effects	 of	 fluctuations	 in	 the	
financial	 markets	 on	 the	 value	 of	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 and	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 working	 capital	 requirements	
fit	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 ongoing	 business.
The	 Group	 has	 various	 financial	 instruments	 such	 as	 cash,	 trade	 receivables,	 trade	 payables	 and	 borrowings	 that	 arise	 directly	
from	 its	 operations,	 along	 with	 forward	 currency	 contracts	 undertaken	 to	 minimise	 risk	 on	 future	 business.
a) Interest rate risk
The	 Group’s	 policy	 is	 to	 manage	 interest	 rate	 risk	 and	 to	 maximise	 its	 return	 from	 its	 cash	 balances.	 The	 Group’s	 main	 interest	
rate	 risk	 is	 related	 to	 variable	 rates	 on	 cash	 held	 at	 the	 bank.	 Certain	 cash	 balances	 are	 deposits	 on	 fixed	 interest	 terms,	 but	 are	
never	 lodged	 for	 more	 than	 three	 months	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 Group	 does	 not	 suffer	 unduly	 from	 the	 risk	 of	 interest	 rate	 variation.

possible	 change	 in	 interest	 rates,	 with	 effect	 from	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year.	 There	 was	 no	 additional	 impact	 on	 shareholders’	
equity.	 These	 changes	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 reasonably	 possible	 based	 on	 observation	 of	 current	 market	 conditions.	 The	 rate	
range	 on	 which	 interest	 was	 receivable	 during	 the	 year	 was	 0.0%	 to	 1.0%	 (2016:	 0.0%	 to	 1.0%).

b) Credit risk
The	 carrying	 amount	 of	 financial	 assets	 recognised	 at	 the	 reporting	 date,	 as	 summarised	 below,	 represents	 the	 Group’s	 maximum	
exposure	 to	 credit	 risk:

	 39,830 37,442 21,690 25,149
The	 Group	 constantly	 monitors	 defaults	 of	 customers	 and	 other	 counterparties	 and	 incorporates	 this	 information	 into	 its	 credit	
risk	 controls.	 It	 is	 the	 Group’s	 policy	 that	 all	 counterparties	 who	 wish	 to	 trade	 on	 credit	 terms	 are	 subject	 to	 an	 external	 credit	
verification	 process.
The	 directors	 consider	 that	 all	 of	 the	 above	 financial	 assets	 that	 are	 not	 impaired	 for	 each	 of	 the	 reporting	 dates	 under	 review	
are	 of	 good	 credit	 quality,	 including	 those	 that	 are	 past	 due.
The	 Group	 has	 no	 significant	 concentration	 of	 credit	 risk	 to	 commercial	 customers,	 as	 credit	 risk	 is	 predominantly	 government	 based.
The	 credit	 risk	 on	 liquid	 funds	 and	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 is	 limited	 because	 the	 counterparties	 are	 banks	 with	 high	
credit	 ratings	 assigned	 by	 international	 credit	 rating	 agencies.
Refer	 to	 note	 18	 for	 details	 of	 impairment	 losses	 for	 financial	 instruments.
c) Liquidity risk
The	 Group	 faces	 liquidity	 risks	 in	 paying	 operators	 before	 a	 flight	 occurs	 or	 before	 payment	 is	 received	 from	 the	 client.	
The	 Group	 aims	 to	 mitigate	 liquidity	 risk	 by,	 where	 possible,	 making	 payments	 to	 operators	 only	 once	 payment	 from	 the	 client	
has	 been	 received.
The	 Group	 manages	 cash	 within	 its	 operations	 and	 ensures	 that	 cash	 collection	 is	 efficiently	 managed.	 Any	 excess	 cash	 is	 placed	
on	 low-risk,	 short-term	 interest-bearing	 deposits	 or	 distributed	 to	 shareholders	 through	 dividends,	 although	 the	 Group	 retains	
enough	 working	 capital	 in	 the	 business	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 business	 operations	 can	 run	 smoothly.
As	 at	 31	 January	 2017,	 the	 Group	 and	 Company’s	 financial	 liabilities	 had	 contractual	 maturities	 which	 are	 summarised	 below:

d) Foreign currency risk
The	 Group	 has	 invested	 in	 foreign	 operations	 outside	 the	 UK	 and	 also	 buys	 and	 sells	 goods	 and	 services	 denominated	 in	 currencies	
other	 than	 sterling.	 As	 a	 result	 the	 value	 of	 the	 Group’s	 non-sterling	 revenue,	 purchases,	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 and	 cash	
flows	 can	 be	 affected	 by	 movements	 in	 exchange	 rates	 in	 general	 and	 in	 US	 Dollar	 and	 Euro	 rates	 in	 particular.	 The	 Group’s	 policy	
on	 foreign	 currency	 risk	 is	 not	 to	 enter	 into	 forward	 contracts	 until	 a	 firm	 contract	 has	 been	 signed.
The	 Group	 considers	 using	 derivatives	 where	 appropriate	 to	 hedge	 its	 exposure	 to	 fluctuations	 in	 foreign	 exchange	 rates.	 The	
purpose	 is	 to	 manage	 the	 currency	 risks	 arising	 from	 the	 Group	 operations.	 It	 is	 the	 Group’s	 policy	 that	 no	 trading	 in	 financial	
instruments	 will	 be	 undertaken.
Foreign	 currency	 denominated	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities,	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 the	 closing	 rate,	 are	 as	 follows:

d) Foreign currency risk	 continued
The	 following	 table	 demonstrates	 the	 sensitivity	 of	 financial	 instruments	 to	 a	 reasonably	 possible	 change	 in	 the	 euro	 and	 US	
dollar	 exchange	 rates,	 with	 all	 other	 variables	 held	 constant,	 on	 profit	 before	 tax	 and	 equity.	 It	 assumes	 a	 10%	 change	 of	 the	
sterling/euro	 exchange	 rate	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 January	 2017	 (2016:	 10%).	 A	 10%	 change	 is	 also	 assumed	 for	 the	 sterling/US	
dollar	 exchange	 rate	 (2016:	 10%).	 Both	 of	 these	 percentages	 have	 been	 determined	 based	 on	 the	 average	 market	 volatility	 in	
exchange	 rates	 in	 the	 previous	 12	 months.	 The	 sensitivity	 is	 based	 on	 the	 Group’s	 foreign	 currency	 financial	 instruments	 held	
at	 each	 reporting	 date	 and	 also	 takes	 into	 account	 forward	 exchange	 contracts	 that	 offset	 effects	 from	 changes	 in	 currency	
exchange	 rates.
If	 sterling	 had	 strengthened	 against	 the	 euro	 and	 US	 dollar	 by	 10%	 (2016:	 10%)	 and	 10%	 (2016:	 10%)	 respectively,	 the	 impact

e) Forward contracts
The	 Group	 utilises	 currency	 derivatives	 to	 hedge	 significant	 future	 transactions	 and	 cash	 flows.	 The	 Group	 is	 a	 party	 to	 foreign	
currency	 forward	 contracts	 in	 the	 management	 of	 its	 exchange	 rate	 exposures.	 The	 instruments	 purchased	 are	 primarily	
denominated	 in	 the	 currencies	 of	 the	 Group’s	 principal	 markets.
Derivatives	 that	 do	 not	 qualify	 for	 hedge	 accounting	 are	 accounted	 for	 as	 trading	 instruments,	 and	 any	 change	 in	 their	 fair	 value	
determined	 as	 the	 mark-to-market	 value	 at	 balance	 sheet	 date	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	 No	 derivatives	 qualified	
for	 hedge	 accounting	 during	 the	 year	 (2016:	 none).
At	 the	 reporting	 date,	 the	 total	 notional	 amount	 of	 outstanding	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 that	 the	 Group	 had	
committed	 are	 as	 below	 and	 their	 related	 fair	 value	 was	 as	 follows	 (terms	 not	 exceeding	 three	 months	 from	 31	 January	 2017):

Forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 –	 notional	 amount 682 537
Financial	 (liability)/asset (9) 36
Changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 amounting	 to	 £45,000	 have	 been	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	
in	 the	 period	 (2016:	 credit	 of	 £186,000).	
These	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 are	 not	 traded	 in	 active	 markets.	 Their	 fair	 value	 has	 been	 determined	 by	 using	 valuation	
techniques	 which	 maximise	 the	 use	 of	 observable	 market	 data,	 namely	 the	 contract	 exchange	 rate	 and	 the	 bank’s	 forward	 rate.	
The	 derivatives	 are	 therefore	 categorised	 as	 level	 2	 using	 the	 fair	 value	 hierarchy.
f) Capital risk management
The	 Group’s	 objectives	 when	 managing	 capital	 are	 to	 safeguard	 the	 Group’s	 ability	 to	 continue	 as	 a	 going	 concern	 in	 order	
to	 provide	 returns	 for	 shareholders	 and	 benefits	 for	 other	 stakeholders.	
The	 Group’s	 primary	 tool	 in	 managing	 risk	 is	 cash	 flow	 analysis.	 In	 addition	 to	 strategic	 cash	 flow	 management,	 the	 Group	
performs	 detailed	 weekly	 cash	 flow	 modelling.
The	 schedule	 of	 matters	 reserved	 for	 Board	 decision	 includes	 approval	 of	 any	 financial	 instruments	 or	 bank	 borrowings	
in	 excess	 of	 £2,000,000.
The	 capital	 structure	 of	 the	 Group	 consists	 of	 net	 debt	 (borrowings	 and	 other	 long-term	 liabilities	 disclosed	 in	 note	 19	 after	
deducting	 non-JetCard	 cash	 and	 bank	 balances)	 and	 equity	 of	 the	 Group	 (comprising	 issued	 capital,	 reserves,	 and	 retained	
earnings	 disclosed	 in	 notes	 28	 to	 31).
The	 Group	 is	 not	 subject	 to	 any	 externally	 imposed	 capital	 requirements.	 The	 Group’s	 gearing	 ratio	 at	 year	 end	 is	 as	 follows:
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Debt 2,957 3,471
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents 3,929 3,015
Net	 cash/(debt) 972 (456)
Equity 14,934 13,880
Net	 debt	 to	 equity	 ratio (6.51%) 3.29%
Debt	 is	 defined	 as	 long-	 and	 short-term	 borrowings	 and	 other	 long-term	 liabilities	 as	 detailed	 in	 note	 19.
Equity	 includes	 all	 share	 capital	 and	 reserves	 of	 the	 Group	 that	 are	 managed	 as	 capital.

At	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 Group	 had	 undistributed	 earnings	 in	 respect	 of	 overseas	 subsidiaries	 that	 would	 be	 subject	 to	
overseas	 withholding	 taxes	 on	 remission	 to	 the	 UK.	 No	 liability	 has	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 these	 earnings	 because	 the	
Group	 is	 in	 a	 position	 to	 control	 the	 timing	 of	 the	 reversal	 of	 the	 temporary	 differences	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 such	 differences	
will	 not	 reverse	 in	 the	 foreseeable	 future.
At	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 Group	 had	 unused	 tax	 losses	 totalling	 £167,000	 (2016:	 £232,000)	 for	 which	 no	 deferred	 tax	 asset	
was	 recognised,	 as	 it	 is	 not	 considered	 probable	 that	 there	 will	 be	 future	 taxable	 profits	 available. 118 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
27  Employee benefits
In	 the	 UK,	 the	 Company	 operates	 a	 defined	 contribution	 retirement	 benefit	 scheme	 for	 all	 qualifying	 employees.	 The	 assets	 of	
the	 scheme	 are	 held	 in	 individual	 personal	 pension	 schemes	 which	 are	 fully	 transferable	 if	 the	 employee	 leaves	 the	 Company.
Similar	 schemes	 operate	 across	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 Group	 depending	 on	 local	 regulations	 and	 individual	 social	 contribution	 levels.	
The	 amount	 of	 expense	 related	 to	 such	 pension	 contributions	 is	 disclosed	 in	 note	 8.	
In	 other	 subsidiaries,	 the	 employees	 are	 members	 of	 state-managed	 retirement	 funds	 operated	 by	 respective	 governments,	
with	 contributions	 payable	 being	 a	 specified	 percentage	 of	 payroll	 costs.	 The	 only	 obligation	 of	 the	 Group	 with	 respect	 to	 the	
retirement	 benefit	 scheme	 is	 to	 make	 the	 specified	 contributions.	 The	 total	 cost	 charged	 to	 income	 of	 £506,000	 (2016:	 £480,000)	
represents	 contributions	 payable	 to	 these	 various	 schemes	 by	 the	 Group.	 As	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 £67,000	 (2016:	 £129,000)	
was	 accrued	 in	 respect	 of	 such	 schemes.

32  Acquisition of subsidiaries
On	 12	 December	 2016,	 Air	 Partner	 plc	 acquired	 100%	 of	 the	 issued	 share	 capital	 of	 Clockwork	 Research	 Limited,	 obtaining	
control	 of	 the	 company	 on	 that	 date.	 Clockwork	 Research	 Limited	 is	 a	 leading	 fatigue	 risk	 management	 consultant.	 The	
acquisition	 of	 Clockwork	 Research	 Limited	 adds	 significant	 specialist	 consulting	 expertise	 and	 knowledge	 to	 the	 Group.	
The	 provisional	 amounts	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets	 acquired	 and	 liabilities	 assumed	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the

Deferred	 consideration	 of	 up	 to	 £200,000	 is	 payable	 depending	 on	 earnings	 performance	 in	 the	 12-month	 periods	 ending	
31	 March	 2017	 and	 31	 March	 2018.	 The	 directors	 consider	 it	 likely	 that	 the	 performance	 conditions	 will	 be	 met	 and	 have	 therefore	
recognised	 the	 maximum	 amounts	 payable.
No	 goodwill	 is	 deductible	 for	 tax	 purposes.	
Clockwork Research Limited
The	 goodwill	 of	 £333,000	 arising	 from	 the	 acquisition	 is	 attributable	 to	 the	 value	 of	 the	 assembled	 workforce	 and	 the	 ability	
of	 the	 senior	 staff	 to	 generate	 future	 business.	
Acquisition	 related	 costs	 (included	 in	 Other	 items)	 amounted	 to	 £55,000.	
Clockwork	 Research	 Limited	 contributed	 revenue	 of	 £70,000	 and	 losses	 after	 tax	 of	 £3,000	 being	 the	 results	 for	 the	 period	
between	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition	 and	 31	 January	 2017.	
If	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Clockwork	 Research	 Limited	 had	 been	 completed	 on	 the	 first	 day	 of	 the	 financial	 year,	 Group	 revenues	 for	
the	 period	 would	 have	 been	 £43,000,000	 and	 Group	 profit	 after	 tax	 would	 have	 been	 £2,955,000. 121 Air Partner plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

33  Prior year acquisitions
On	 18	 August	 2015,	 Air	 Partner	 plc	 acquired	 100%	 of	 the	 issued	 share	 capital	 of	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited,	 obtaining	 control	 of	
the	 company	 on	 that	 date.	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited	 is	 a	 leading	 aviation	 safety	 consultant.	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited	 will	 enable	
Air	 Partner	 to	 extend	 the	 Group’s	 service	 and	 product	 capabilities	 with	 offerings	 complementary	 to	 its	 existing	 charter	 business.	
Contingent	 consideration	 of	 up	 to	 £600,000	 is	 payable	 to	 the	 vendors	 of	 Baines	 Simmons	 Limited	 depending	 on	 the	 performance	
to	 31	 January	 2018.	 As	 the	 directors	 do	 not	 consider	 it	 likely	 that	 the	 minimum	 performance	 threshold	 will	 be	 met,	 no	 amounts	
have	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 this.
At	 31	 January	 2016,	 the	 purchase	 price	 allocation	 was	 provisional:	 the	 accounting	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Baines	 Simmons	
Limited	 has	 since	 been	 finalised.	 This	 resulted	 in	 adjustment	 to	 the	 value	 of	 intangibles	 recognised	 on	 acquisition,	 an	 increase	
in	 customer	 relationships	 of	 £1.6m,	 and	 decreases	 in	 the	 value	 of	 the	 brand	 of	 £0.04m	 and	 training	 materials	 of	 £0.2m.
The	 amounts	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets	 acquired	 and	 liabilities	 assumed	 on	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Baines	 Simmons
