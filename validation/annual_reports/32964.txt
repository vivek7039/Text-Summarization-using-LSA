CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Clear strategy, 
material upside
Stephen Whyte
Chairman
I am pleased to welcome 
you to Genel’s seventh 
annual results statement, 
and my first as Chairman.  ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Looking at Genel from an external 
perspective it was clear that the Company 
operated in a challenging environment, but 
it had demonstrated resilience while retaining 
real growth potential. In 2017 Genel delivered 
on that potential.
I am now more confident than ever that, 
while challenges remain, there is material 
upside in the Genel portfolio and significant 
opportunities ahead. As we enter 2018, 
I believe that we have both the right strategy 
to take advantage of these and the right 
management team to deliver on that strategy.
The macroeconomic climate altered again in 
2017. On the positive side, the increase in the 
oil price helped to boost cash flows from our 
producing assets, and also provided a more 
solid basis for the economy of the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq (‘KRI’). The unfortunate events 
in the KRI in the last quarter of the year and 
the subsequent material reduction in KRG 
exports caused by these events significantly 
disrupted the status quo. However, despite the 
decrease in oil exports, the KRG continued to 
demonstrate its ability and willingness to make 
payments, and Genel has received payments 
for sales on a monthly basis since September 
2015. This has enabled investment by the 
Company to continue.
Financial strength 
underpinning opportunity
Genel is currently on a sound financial 
footing, and continues to generate significant 
free cash flow, something boosted by 
the signing of the Receivable Settlement 
Agreement (‘RSA’) in August 2017. The 
successful refinancing in December then 
provided a bedrock from which we can move 
forward with a proactive growth strategy.
There are exciting opportunities available 
for cash-generative, proactive companies, 
and the Board and management carried out 
a comprehensive review of Genel strategy in 
order to define a clear and focused roadmap 
to creating significant shareholder value. The 
refreshed strategy focuses on the creation 
of shareholder value, providing growth 
opportunities while retaining a firm focus 
on prudent financial planning. 
Our strategy builds on our core strengths – 
a robust and cash-generative asset portfolio, 
technical and commercial expertise, and our 
ability to leverage regional relationships and 
manage risk in complex areas. These were 
key drivers behind our excellent performance 
in 2017.
We have significant organic development 
options within Genel’s KRI portfolio, 
the financial ability to add assets to the 
portfolio, and management with the skills 
and experience to maximise the value of 
these opportunities. 
Focus on cost and capability
Genel will continue to ensure that its cost 
base reflects the external economic situation. 
Total general and administrative cash costs 
were more than halved from 2014 to 2016, 
and the Company continues to ensure the 
most appropriate structure and cost base 
from which to grow and deliver maximum 
value to stakeholders. In 2017 reductions 
were made to remuneration at all levels, 
and executive remuneration brought into 
line with comparable listed E&P companies.
Side by side with this focus on cost, is a 
focus on operational capability. There has 
been significant change at both Board and 
management levels over the last twelve 
months or so, and we have a high-quality 
team working well together. As we go 
forward, the Board will work to ensure 
continuity at management level and provide 
leadership on management succession.
In 2017 we welcomed Tim Bushell and Martin 
Gudgeon to the Board, adding relevant skills 
and experience. Both have made a significant 
contribution to the healthy dynamics and 
strong processes confirmed by an external 
board evaluation review carried out at the 
end of 2017. 
Despite changes to personnel, one thing 
that has not changed has been the Company-
wide focus on health, safety, and responsible 
operations. Genel takes pride in its operations 
and strives for positive community impact, 
and it was pleasing to see a repeat of 2016’s 
performance in achieving no lost-time 
incidents, while reducing incidents of primary 
containment loss to a single minor event. 
I would like to thank all employees across 
our operations for their ongoing vigilance 
and hard work.
Focus in 2018
We have a robust balance sheet, a clear 
strategy, and the correct team to implement 
it. Going through 2018 we look forward to 
clearly setting out the growth potential that 
this provides, and as such plan for active 
capital market engagement.
We appreciate the patience and confidence 
that our shareholders have shown in Genel 
over the last few turbulent years, and hope 
that the successes seen in the second half 
of 2017, and our strong financial position, 
provide renewed confidence that we 
can deliver on our plans to add material 
shareholder value in the years to come.
We have a robust financial 
position, a clear strategy, 
and the correct team 
to implement it. GENEL ENERGY

STRATEGIC REPORT
A landmark year 
of delivery
Murat Özgül
Chief Executive Officer
2017 was a successful year for Genel 
Energy. We went into the year with 
a clear focus, and took proactive 
steps to deliver our key goals.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 
STATEMENT  ANNUALREPORT2017
7 
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Prudent capital 
allocation is at the core 
of everything that we 
do, and we spend each 
dollar in a way that 
creates the greatest 
value for our 
shareholders. 
Delivering on our focus
I was pleased to welcome Esa Ikaheimonen 
as Chief Financial Officer and Bill Higgs as 
Chief Operating Officer, both of whom bring 
the qualities and experience to help us deliver 
on these goals.
A primary aim was to maximise the 
generation of free cash flow from our 
producing oil assets in the KRI. In the 
year, monthly payments totalling $263 
million were received from the KRG, with 
our ongoing focus on cost and disciplined 
capital allocation helping to convert 
this into $142 million in free cash flow, 
before bond interest payments. 
This figure was boosted in the second half 
of the year by additional proceeds received 
under the RSA. This was a very positive deal 
for Genel, and helped to fulfil our second aim 
for 2017 of converting the receivable into 
cash generation. 
Writing off the past receivable in favour 
of increased future cash flows helped to 
simplify our balance sheet while significantly 
increasing cash flow. Under the RSA, Genel 
receives override payments of 4.5% of Tawke 
gross PSC revenues for the five year period 
from 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2022, while 
capacity building payments (‘CBP’) on the 
profit share element of our Tawke entitlement 
are eliminated over the entire life of the field. 
This definitive agreement was the positive 
culmination of a constructive dialogue with 
the KRG, and has already provided significant 
benefits to Genel, with the promise of more to 
come. $19 million was received in 2017 under 
the override, and the elimination of CBP 
resulted in a $7 million benefit to Genel in Q4. 
Cash-generative oil assets
The receipt of 4.5% of gross Tawke 
PSC revenues means that the positive 
performance of Peshkabir adds material cash 
flow to Genel. The successful Peshkabir-2 
well was followed by the equally successful 
Peshkabir-3 well, and production of c.5,000 
bopd from the former was commingled with 
the latter to end the year at a very consistent 
15,000 bopd from the field. Working with 
the operator, we will continue to focus 
on Peshkabir in 2018. 
The Peshkabir-4 well spud in February, 
and will potentially be followed by a further 
five wells in 2018. Field production is 
expected by the operator to reach 30,000 
bopd by the summer and continue to ramp 
up in the second half of the year. This is 
very encouraging, and when added to the 
robust production from the main Tawke 
field, highly cash-generative.
Despite operational activity at the Tawke PSC 
being focused on maximising the potential 
of Peshkabir, general Tawke field production 
was solid in 2017. Work done at Taq Taq 
also provided encouragement. While the 
field declined year-on-year as anticipated, 
production was relatively stable in the second 
half of 2017, with the TT-29w well providing 
a positive result in December 2017. The well 
encountered a deeper free water level 
and more extensive oil bearing cretaceous 
reservoirs on the northern flank of the field 
than previously forecast, and potentially 
opens up further development avenues. 
This well result, and the stabilisation 
of production, led to a 12% reserves 
replacement at Taq Taq for 2P, and 
40% reserves replacement at the higher 
confidence 1P level, as upwards technical 
revisions partially offset the five million 
barrels of production in 2017. 2P reserves 
more than doubling at Peshkabir also 
bolstered reserves at the Tawke PSC, 
and prudent expenditure will allow ongoing 
cash generation from across the Genel 
portfolio for years to come.
Opportunities for growth
Prudent capital allocation is at the core of 
everything that we do, and we spend each 
dollar in a way that creates the greatest value 
for our shareholders. The most cost-effective 
way of spending is to invest in our producing 
assets, as money spent is cost-recoverable. 
In 2017, 66% of our capital expenditure was 
spent on our producing fields. As payments 
are received monthly, this is currently 
recovered through cash receipts within 
approximately 90 days.
This focus on expenditure and value creation, 
with a cash investment of $345 million in 
buying back bonds at below par reducing 
gross cash debt from $675 million to $300 
million, helped to reduce our net debt as at 
end-2017 to $135 million. This was a 44% 
reduction year-on-year from the end-2016 
figure of $241 million, providing Genel with 
the financial flexibility to take advantage 
of new opportunities. We are focused on 
finding those opportunities that promise 
to add to our financial strength, and capital 
allocation will remain biased on near-term 
cash generation. Below: Operations at Taq Taq GENEL ENERGY

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 
STATEMENT CONTINUED
Bina Bawi and Miran remain 
a significant opportunity for 
Genel, and we will work to 
convert that opportunity into 
shareholder value in 2018.
 
 Below: Bina Bawi field facilities
 
 Top: Drilling operations at Peshkabir
 Below: Workers at Bina Bawi
Some of these near-term cash-generative 
opportunities can be found within the Genel 
portfolio. The significant increase in high-
value Bina Bawi 2C oil resources we saw in 
the recent CPR by RPS Consultants offers 
a tangible opportunity. As Bina Bawi oil is 
both high-quality and in close proximity 
to the Taq Taq field and associated export 
infrastructure, it is an attractive near-term 
development candidate for the Company. 
This would be the beginning of tangible value 
crystallisation of our Bina Bawi and Miran 
assets, another key strategic focus for Genel. 
In 2017 we moved towards this goal through 
the finalisation of PSC amendments together 
with the Gas Lifting Agreements (‘GLA’s) for 
both fields, incorporating the commercial 
terms as announced in the term sheets 
signed in 2015. This provided certainty and 
allowed the progression of talks with potential 
partners, which were slowed down following 
developments in the KRI in the second half of 
2017. Entering 2018 we are now in a stronger 
position to move the project forward, with 
upstream materially de-risked. The updated 
CPRs, announced in January 2018 confirmed 
a c.40% increase in gross combined 2C 
resources to almost 15 Tcf. Even at a 1C 
level, gross raw gas resource estimates are 
significantly higher than the gas volumes 
agreed under the Gas Lifting Agreements. 
The extension to the schedule for satisfying 
the conditions precedent, signed in January 
2018, provided further clarity over the 
timetable, and the bolstered financial position 
of the Company means that we are well-
positioned to progress with the building 
blocks of value creation. We have optionality 
about the progression of the project, with 
the ability to take the upstream towards FID 
with 100% ownership, should this be the 
best way to maximise shareholder value. 
Expenditure will remain prudent, as the 
upstream development matches the progress 
of the midstream. An extended well test at 
Bina Bawi will then provide valuable data on 
well deliverability and gas composition, and 
we will proactively engage with potential 
farm-in partners at the best possible time and 
terms for Genel. Bina Bawi and Miran remain 
a significant opportunity for Genel, and we 
will work to convert that opportunity into 
shareholder value in 2018.
Genel will also make appropriate expenditure 
on our African exploration assets, which 
offer longer-term opportunities. Following 
the completion of over 3,000 km of 2D 
seismic in Somaliland, which was purchased 
from the government, the first in this highly 
prospective area for over 25 years, we are 
excited about the long-term opportunities 
and see significant geological potential on 
the Genel acreage position. This 10-month 
seismic acquisition project was completed 
with an impeccable HSE and security record. 
There were successful elections held in 2017, 
and increasing international investment 
is opening up opportunities. Of particular 
note is DP World’s almost half a billion 
dollar investment in the port at Berbera, 
which being just 100 km from our licence 
offers a clear route to market. 2018 will see 
the processing of the Somaliland seismic, 
which will then guide the optimal strategy 
to maximise future value.
Offshore Morocco the conversion of our 
well commitment to a 3D seismic acquisition 
programme was both cost-effective for 
Genel and will help materially de-risk the Sidi 
Moussa licence. It is worth noting ENI’s recent 
acquisition of the licence block adjacent 
to Sidi Moussa. 
Outlook
Genel is a highly cash-generative business, 
and we expect to continue to generate 
significant free cash flow throughout 
2018. Prudent expenditure will progress 
the significant near-term opportunities 
within the portfolio, and our sound 
financial position allows us to explore the 
possibility of bolstering our portfolio and 
adding to the strength of our core assets. 
I look forward to updating all stakeholders 
on our progress throughout the year.  ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
OUR DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL
HOW WE CREATE VALUE
We create value by finding and monetising hydrocarbons, and 
generating cash flow. To achieve this we must execute exploration 
and appraisal campaigns, successful M&A, deliver selective 
development projects, maximise production and free cash flow 
over the life of field, and be prepared to monetise at all points of 
the cycle. As we do this, we leverage our following key strengths:
 — The ability to attract a world-class Board and Management team, 
ensuring a high level of corporate governance and ensuring a 
robust approach to risk management and strategic planning
 — Long-term strategic thinking, allying our goals with 
those of host governments and partners to build deep and 
valuable relationships, helping to unlock value in complex 
commercial situations
 — Experience in managing risk in complex areas, both technical 
and geopolitical, making portfolio decisions based on 
a holistic assessment
 — A constant focus on shareholder value, with an aim of providing 
sector-leading returns through organic growth, portfolio events 
and through the building of an asset profile capable of sustaining 
a long-term dividend
OUR BUSINESS MODEL 
AND STRATEGY
Our strategy 
for the creation 
of shareholder 
value
The key components of our strategy are below.
MAXIMISE THE VALUE OF OUR  
KRI ASSETS
Generating material free cash flow 
from our KRI oil assets, systematically 
progressing our world-class gas resources.
Oil production from the Tawke, Peshkabir 
and Taq Taq fields generates significant 
free cash flow, and we will continue 
to maximise this through efficient 
reservoir management and disciplined 
capital allocation. Our Bina Bawi and 
Miran fields provide material upside 
opportunities, with both high-value oil 
resources and 15 Tcf of mean raw gas. As 
we continue our investment in the KRI as 
a committed partner, our asset potential 
and strong relationships with key regional 
stakeholders gives us a solid basis for 
increased value creation.

MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET 
Disciplined capital allocation, maximising 
financial flexibility to execute our strategy. 
A highly cash-generative portfolio, 
low leverage and disciplined and 
value driven capital allocation provides 
us with a robust financial base that 
is highly resilient to changes in the 
macro-economic environment. It also 
allows us the optionality to benefit from 
growth opportunities and make value-
accretive additions to our portfolio. 
At the appropriate time, this paves the 
way to returning capital to shareholders.

Genel’s strategic ambition is to become 
a world-class independent E&P creator 
of shareholder value.
Our strategic ambition is underpinned by our 
core strengths – a robust and cash-generative 
asset portfolio, technical and commercial 
expertise, and our ability to leverage regional 
relationships and manage risk in complex 
areas. These strengths and capabilities 
were key drivers behind our excellent 
performance in 2017, and are transferrable 
to other regions. With a strong Board and a 
management team with proven track records 
of executing strategies and delivering value, 
this provides a significant opportunity.
As we deliver on our strategy, we place 
robust corporate governance, excellence 
in HSE, and a keen awareness of our place 
in the community at the heart of everything 
that we do. We believe that the way we 
conduct ourselves with host governments 
and local people is crucial to our success, and 
we strive to deliver in a manner that protects 
the health and safety of our employees, 
minimises adverse environmental impact, 
and provides benefits to local communities. 
Our success at value creation is judged as 
first-quartile performance in total shareholder 
returns amongst our peer group.
BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-
VALUE ASSETS 
Developing a rich funnel of new 
opportunities, with prudent allocation 
of capital to the highest return projects.
Genel systematically seeks opportunities 
to leverage our strengths and capabilities, 
utilising our management team members’ 
track record in successful M&A execution. 
We aim to add assets that build on 
the strengths of the current portfolio, 
prioritising areas with low to moderate 
political risk while retaining a focus on 
significant cash generation. We are 
governed by clear investment criteria and 
our commitment to value creative capital 
allocation, focused on assets that provide 
the highest returns and enhance the 
quality of our existing portfolio.

GROWING THE RESOURCE BASE
Increasing reserves and resources through cost-effective 
development, exploration and appraisal campaigns, and selective 
acquisitions. Maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, 
focused on value creation and capital efficiency, investing in a 
profitable portfolio that is balanced on the risk-reward spectrum
Key focus
Genel continues to prioritise near-term spend on our KRI production 
and development assets, with only a modest percentage of cashflow 
spent on exploration. Our exploration strategy targets low-risk, low-cost 
opportunities and partnerships that de-risk higher risk exploration 
opportunities in the existing portfolio. 
We draw on our Board and management’s significant M&A experience, 
with a Company focus on value accretive acquisitions targeting near 
term cash flow with low to moderate political risk.
2017 activity
Successful appraisal work at 
Peshkabir added 43 MMbbls of gross 
2P resources, and updated CPRs 
for Bina Bawi and Miran stated a 
significant upgrade to the combined 
2C gross raw gas resources to 15 
Tcf. Technical adjustments also saw 
a material increase in high-value oil 
resources at Bina Bawi. In Africa, 
seismic acquisition was completed 
in Somaliland, with processing 
now underway.

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION
Safely and efficiently deliver development projects for the benefit 
of both Genel and the communities in which we operate. The key 
aim is to maximise production of available natural resources over 
the life of field and generate maximum free cash flow.
Key focus
Genel is concentrating on cash-generative assets in the KRI, where 
production costs are amongst the lowest in the world. We are also 
actively looking to leverage our capabilities outside KRI for accelerated 
profitable growth.
2017 activity
Activity on the Tawke PSC was 
focused on Peshkabir, with gross 
production rising to 15,000 bopd 
by the end of the year, with more 
to come in 2018. Tawke production 
remained solid, and activity at 
Taq Taq mitigated field declines, 
resulting in December production 
being at a higher level than that 
in June. 
READ MORE P16
Our oil assets
Oil production in the KRI provides 
material cash generation, with 
$263 million received in 2017 for 
oil sales, generating $142 million 
in free cash flow. Our reserves are 
being produced at some of the 
lowest costs in the industry, with the 
Receivable Settlement Agreement 
boosting cash flow from the Tawke 
PSC. Genel will apply our technical 
and commercial experience to 
unlock and fast-track further 
oil development opportunities.

Bina Bawi and Miran
Underpinned by a government-
backed gas sales agreement between 
Turkey and the KRG, gas resources 
at Miran and Bina Bawi provide 
a unique and transformational 
opportunity. Genel continues to 
progress the building blocks towards 
value creation, as we further de-risk 
the upstream development. In 2017 
PSC amendments and Gas Lifting 
Agreements (‘GLA’s) were finalised 
for both fields.

FINANCE AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Manage financial and business assets to provide flexibility 
in our capital structure in order to pursue strategic objectives 
and underpin future value-add growth. Retaining balance sheet 
discipline appropriate to the external environment, ensuring the 
ability to take advantage of opportunities and be ahead of the 
curve to capitalise on sector opportunities
Key focus
Disciplined capital allocation in areas that maximise the creation of 
shareholder value. We re-invest our cash smartly and allocate capital 
towards those areas with the highest returns, making sure that we are 
suitably financed through a mix of diverse funding options and portfolio 
management, providing a base from which to accelerate the growth 
of our portfolio.
2017 activity
66% of our capital expenditure was 
value-accretive, cost-recoverable, 
spend on our producing assets. 
Coupled with another year of 
consistent payments this helped 
generate material free cash flow, 
and the successful refinancing 
in December 2017 solidified a 
significant improvement in the 
balance sheet, reducing year-end 
net debt by 44% to $135 million.

Definition
Lost time incident frequency measures the 
number of lost time incidents per millions

Definition
Loss of primary containment records any 
unplanned or uncontrolled release of material 
from a piece of equipment (such as a pipe, 
vessel, or tank) used for containment of 
potentially harmful or hazardous substances 
and products.
Performance
The significant increase in 2P reserves at 
Peshkabir, with gross reserved adding 44.2 
MMbbls to 75 MMbbls, more than offset declines 
from the Tawke. Taq Taq gross 2P stood at 
55 MMbbls, compared to 61 MMbbls as of 
31 December 2016, with the difference being 
production in the intervening period, partly 
offset by a small upward technical revision. 
Performance
Net reserves and resources grew by 1.1 BNboe 
in 2017, largely due to the significant increase 
in gross raw gas resources at Bina Bawi and 
Miran detailed in the CPRs announced in 
January 2018. These detailed a 46% increase 
in combined gross 2C raw gas resources to 14.8 
Tcf, from 10.2 Tcf as at 31 December 2016. Note 
that previous years’ figures have been restated, 
due to the amendment of sales gas to raw gas.
Performance
Ongoing investment at the Tawke field 
facilitated a solid performance in 2017, and 
the contribution of production from Peshkabir 
led to a slight increase in production from the 
Tawke PSC. Taq Taq production fell year-on-
year, although investment in the second half of 
2017 saw production stabilise, with field output 
in December surpassing that of the previous 
five monthly figures.
Performance
The receipt of over $250 million in payments 
for oil exports, and disciplined capital allocation, 
and our ongoing focus on costs, led to another 
year of positive free cash flow generation.
Performance
2017 matched the performance of 2016, as we 
again achieved our target of zero LTIs across 
both TTOPCO and Genel operations. This is 
a testament to our operational team, and 
work continues across our assets to ensure 
that processes and procedures remain of 
the highest possible standard.
Performance
There was a solitary loss of primary containment 
in 2017, as a production facility heater suffered 
an internal fire at Taq Taq. There were no injuries 
or spills. The heater was decommissioned 
and replaced with another unit, with updated 
and safer technology.
Relevance to strategy
Our strategy is to enhance the value of our 
existing 2P reserves through active reservoir 
management and cost effective development. 
The Company also looks to replace 2P reserves 
through a combination of maturing contingent 
resource to commerciality, exploration for new 
sources of hydrocarbons and M&A activity.
Relevance to strategy
Prospective resources are those quantities 
of hydrocarbons estimated to be potentially 
recoverable from undiscovered accumulations 
by application of future development projects, 
and have the potential to drive long term growth.
Relevance to strategy
Production from our fields provides Genel’s 
revenue generation, and is a key measure of our 
operational performance. Our oil production in 
the KRI is managed to ensure long-term value 
creation, with production maximised over the 
life of the field. 
Relevance to strategy
Production from operating activities forms 
Genel’s revenue generation. Net cash illustrates 
the success of monetisation of these activities, 
reflecting both money received and the 
minimisation of operating costs. Free cash flow 
has replaced capital expenditure as a KPI, which 
did not reflect Genel’s focus on cash generation.
Relevance to strategy
The safety of our workforce remains of 
paramount importance. Genel is committed to 
running safe and reliable operations across our 
portfolio, aiming at zero fatalities and no lost 
time incidents.
Relevance to strategy
Part of our commitment to being a sustainable 
business is for the impact on the environment 
around our operations to be minimised. Asset 
integrity is a major priority for Genel and we 
plan and execute the operations of our business 
and our engagement of subcontractors so as to 
minimise risk and mitigate potential impact.

Production and sales
Net production in 2017 averaged 35,200 
bopd. While production at the Tawke PSC 
increased, boosted by the contribution 
from the Peshkabir field, overall production 
declined year-on-year as Taq Taq continued 
its decline in the first half of 2017. The 
implementation of an active well intervention 
programme and contributions from new well 
stock arrested this decline in H2 2017.
Exports by the KRG were consistent in 2017, 
and almost all Tawke PSC production was 
exported via Ceyhan. Approximately two 
thirds of Taq Taq production was exported by 
the KRG, with the remainder being sold to the 
local Bazian refinery, for which Genel invoices 
at the same price under the terms of the 
February 2016 payment mechanism.
Consistent and predictable payments 
throughout the year allowed for a proactive 
drilling programme to be carried out across 
Genel assets. Drilling activity was targeted 
in line with our capital allocation policy, 
aiming for cost-effective activity for the 
greatest reward. As such, a significant focus 
was placed on the appraisal of Peshkabir,

which promised and delivered near-term 
cash generation. Activity at Taq Taq in the 
year led to a stabilisation of production, 
with the TT-29w then contributing to an 
uplift at the end of the year.
Average production in 2018 to date has been 
33,300 bopd, in line with guidance.
Reserves and resources
At 31 December 2017, Genel’s proven (1P) 
and proven plus probable (2P) net working 
interest reserves totalled 97.1 MMbbls 
and 150.0 MMbbls respectively. 1P and 2P 
reserves increased by 9.8 MMbbls and 2.2 
MMbbls, when compared to the figures as at 
31 December 2016, after adjustment for 2017 
production of 12.9 MMbbls. This is a reserves 
replacement of 75% for the high-confidence 
proven reserves, and yields a reserves 
to production ratio of greater than seven 
years for 1P, and greater than 11 years for 
2P reserves.
Genel has booked 504 MMbbls gross (126 
MMbbls net working interest) 2P reserves 
at the Tawke PSC, as a 133% increase in 2P 
reserves at Peshkabir to 75 MMbbls helped 
to offset a downward technical revision of 
36.6 MMbbls at the Tawke field, leading to 
an overall increase in Tawke PSC 2P reserves 
of 7.6 MMbbls. The reserves booked are in 
line with the operator’s Annual Statement of 
Reserves, but do not include those associated 
with the proposed enhanced oil recovery 
project at the Tawke field. While the Company 
sees merit in the proposal, further definition 
of the project is required prior to FID and 
reserves booking. 
Taq Taq gross 2P reserves were largely 
unchanged, estimated at 54.7 MMbbls, 
compared to 59.1 MMbbls as of 28 February 
2017, with the difference being production 
in the intervening period, partly offset by a 
small reserves increase, a result of stabilising 
production and the integration of the TT-29w 
well into the field model.
Bina Bawi gross 2C light (c.45◦ API) oil 
resources are estimated by RPS at 37.1 
MMbbls, compared to 13 MMbbls as of July 
2013. Due to the high-quality of the Bina 
Bawi oil, and given the value of these barrels, 
this represents an attractive near-term 
development candidate. GENEL ENERGY

STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED
Below: Worker at Taq Taq
In line with Genel’s stated aim 
of investing in those areas that 
provide the best returns, the 
focus of drilling in 2018 will 
be on the Peshkabir field.
A decline in estimated Miran West gross 
2C heavy (c.15◦ API) oil resources from the 
previously carried 52 MMbbls to 23.7 MMbbls 
is based on Management estimates that 
include a downwards revision for the removal 
of matrix contribution from the Shiranish 
reservoir, a lesson learnt from Taq Taq.
Genel’s 2C raw gas resources at Miran 
and Bina Bawi were lifted c.40% to 14,792 
Bscf, a figure which excludes associated 
condensate volumes attributable to the 
upstream partners of 137 MMbbls. Even on a 
1C gross raw gas resources basis, estimated 
at 6,618 Bcf, volumes at Miran and Bina Bawi 
greatly exceed those agreed under the Gas 
Lifting Agreement.
KRI assets
Genel’s KRI oil assets provide the cash 
generation that drives the business and 
provides the bedrock for future growth. As 
such, maximising the cash flow from these 
assets is a key priority for Genel. With capital 
expenditure being cost-recoverable, they are 
also the focus of the majority of Genel activity.
Tawke PSC (25% working interest)
Tawke PSC production averaged 109,050 
bopd in 2017, a slight increase year-on-
year, with aggregate production from 
the Peshkabir-2 and Peshkabir-3 wells 
contributing 3,590 bopd to this figure. 
In line with Genel’s focus to invest in those 
areas that provide the best returns, the focus 
of drilling in 2018 will be on the Peshkabir 
field. A total of six Peshkabir wells are 
planned to be drilled this year, and field 
production is expected by the operator to 
reach 30,000 bopd by summer and continue 
to ramp up in the second half of the year. 
Following the signing of the RSA, these are 
highly cash-generative barrels for Genel.
The first of the six wells, Peshkabir-4, is 
currently drilling, with results expected in Q2.
At the Tawke field, the Tawke-48 well was 
recently completed and is being brought onto 
production. The focus in the first half of the 
year is on workovers and rebuilding of the 
Tawke field reservoir models to incorporate 
the learning from the 2017 campaign. Further 
drilling will be weighted to the back half of 
2018 and will be agreed by the joint venture 
after completion of the model rebuild.
Taq Taq PSC (44% working interest, 
joint operator) 
Production in 2017 averaged 18,050 bopd, 
with production stabilising in the second half 
of the year, with Q4 2017 averaging 14,035 
bopd, in line with Q3 2017 of 14,080 bopd. 
The implementation of a proactive well 
intervention and production optimisation 
programme helped slow the rate of 
production decline in the first half of 2017. 
The successful TT-29w well then led to a 
small increase in production, and average 
production in December 2017 of 15,068 bopd 
was the highest monthly average in H2.
The TT-29w well encountered a deeper free 
water level and more extensive oil bearing 
cretaceous reservoirs on the northern flank 
of the field than previously forecast. The 
results of the well are still being analysed, and 
will drive the 2018 drilling programme. The 
well intervention programme, focused on the 
provision of artificial lift and water shut off in 
existing wells, will continue throughout 2018. 
Drilling activity is set to resume in the second 
half of the year, with two wells scheduled 
targeting the flanks of the field.
Bina Bawi and Miran fields  
(100% working interest, operator) 
In line with our capital allocation strategy, 
there was limited field activity in 2017, as 
Genel focused on our producing oil assets. 
The finalisation of PSC amendments and Gas 
Lifting Agreements was an important step, 
reasserting the opportunity ahead, which 
was then furthered in 2018 through the uplift 
in mean raw 2C gas resources to 15 Tcf. 
The gas development is in an almost unique 
position as an upstream project without 
volume or price risk. As such, Genel will 
focus its efforts in 2018 to characterise the 
remaining uncertainties, namely surface 
facilities and drilling capital expenditure, well 
deliverability and design, and operating costs. 
This work will be combined with that carried 
out by Baker Hughes in 2017, to deliver an 
optimised Field Development Plan that will 
help define the roadmap to unlocking the 
value of the assets.   ANNUALREPORT2017

Later in the year, Genel expects to undertake 
an extended well test of Bina Bawi-4, 
which will provide valuable data on well 
deliverability and gas composition.
The significant increase in gas resources 
detailed in the updated CPR helped to 
build momentum behind the development, 
and Genel will now maintain upstream 
readiness in alignment with progress on the 
midstream, engaging with potential farm-
in partners for upstream participation at 
an optimal time to secure maximum value

Africa
Onshore Somaliland, the acquisition of 2D 
seismic data on the SL -10B/13 (Genel 75% 
working interest, operator) and Odewayne 
(Genel 50% working interest, operator) 
blocks began in March 2017, completing in 
January 2018 having acquired c.3,150 km 
in total. This was the first time that seismic 
has been obtained in this highly prospective 
area for over 25 years. Evidence of a thick 
Mesozoic rift basin provided encouraging 
results, and led to the targeted infill 2D 
seismic acquisition on the SL -10B/13 block. 
Processing of the data has commenced. 
Seismic interpretation and the associated 
development of a prospect inventory, in turn 
guiding the optimal strategy to maximise 
future value, is expected to be completed 
by year-end.
UNDERSTANDING SOMALILAND
Genel’s KRI oil assets provide 
the cash generation that drives 
the business and provides the 
bedrock for future growth. 
As such, maximising the cash 
flow from these assets 
is a key priority. 
Genel’s prior commitment to drill one well on 
the Sidi Moussa licence (Genel 60% working 
interest, operator), offshore Morocco, has 
been replaced by an obligation to carry 
out a 3D seismic campaign across the 
acreage, significantly reducing anticipated 
expenditure. Planning is ongoing, with seismic 
acquisition set to begin in 2018, which is 
expected to materially de-risk the licence.
Somaliland, with a population of 3.5 
million, declared independence in 1991. 
Though not internationally recognised, 
Somaliland has a working political system, 
government institutions, a police force 
and its own currency.
 
In November 2017 Somaliland held its 
third presidential election, and the first in 
the world to use retina scans to recognise 
voters. International observers praised the 
smooth and peaceful conduct of voting 
and the integrity of the electoral process.
 
Somaliland’s north coast, on the major 
shipping route of the Gulf of Aden, is 
host to the natural deep water port of 
Berbera where continued stability and 
has promoted increased investment 
towards export potential. GENEL ENERGY

Making a lasting 
contribution to 
communities
OUR SUSTAINABLE APPROACH
BOOSTING EMPLOYABILITY 
IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY
As well as providing economic benefits for 
a country as a whole, we strive to directly 
support local communities through 
providing opportunities.
Genel, with its partner in TTOPCO, is 
committed to supporting local communities, 
with economic development and training 
a key priority.
In partnership with a local NGO, in the 
communities around Taq Taq 42 young 
men received training on air conditioning 
units and repairs and maintenance using 
electrical tools. In addition, 50 farmers 
were trained to take advantage of new 
farming techniques. 
In total, 92 people were provided with 
training to increase their capabilities 
and skills in order to boost their 
employability status and generate 
their own private income.

ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
Leaving the environment untarnished 
for future generations is a core priority 
for Genel Energy. Educating local children 
on environmental awareness is a way 
of spreading this goal.
Genel conducted a campaign with students 
in Sulaimaniyah to raise awareness about 
environmental issues and encourage 
positive action regarding the protection 
of nature and the cleanliness of the 
environment in the Kurdistan Region 
of Iraq. 
Working with the Sulaimaniyah Educational 
Department, a team from Genel led 100 
students to Hawari Shar Public Park. All 
students were provided with information 
leaflets and Genel branded T-shirts prior 
to an organised litter pick, and Charles 
Walker, HSE Supervisor at TTOPCO, 
gave a talk on environmental awareness. GENEL ENERGY

OUR SUSTAINABLE APPROACH 
CONTINUED
Supporting and sustaining the communities 
in which we operate is fundamental to Genel 
Energy’s success. Natural resources should 
be a boon to a region, and it is imperative 
that local people share the benefits of the 
resources found in their area. As well as 
providing economic benefits for a region, 
we strive to support local communities 
directly through providing opportunities, 
while leaving the environment untarnished 
for future generations. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY 
A safe workplace remains a top priority for 
Genel, and we are proud that 2017 matched 
the success of 2016 in achieving our target 
of zero lost time incidents across TTOPCO 
and Genel operations. 
This is a testament to the ongoing focus of our 
operational team, who worked hard to achieve 
this result. The Company also works with 
contractors in order that they share Genel’s 
high standards. In 2017, contractor assurance 
management plans were developed for five 
existing contracts. On the ground at Taq 
Taq and Genel-operated sites, 57 HSE visits 
were made in the year, and site emergency 
exercises take place on a monthly basis. 
Comprehensive risk assessments take place 
ahead of any operational work, with a focus 
of 2017 being the Miran and Bina Bawi pre-FID 
work programme. 12 training and knowledge 
sharing sessions were held with 161 attendees 
in 2017 on a wide range of HSE topics 
including HSE observation, intervention 
and recognition, oil spill preparedness and 
response, crisis management and relative 
response, and first aid, as the Company 
continues to engender a strong HSE 
culture across the business. 
The awareness of HSE issues amongst the 
workforce is illustrated through the 38 
observation/intervention cards that were 
submitted by Genel employees in 2017, which 
contribute to ensuring the safest possible 
working environment for our employees 
and contractors. 
The attentiveness to the safe running of 
our operations also saw losses of primary 
containment reduced to a solitary minor 
event, as a production facility heater 
suffered a small internal fire at Taq Taq, 
with no injuries or spills.
PEOPLE
Our talented, experienced and motivated 
staff are key to the success of our Company.
As of 31 December 2017, Genel employed 121 
people. Of these, 65 are based in Ankara, 17 
in London, 15 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, 
and 24 in our African operations. TTOPCO 
employed 384 people, of whom 298 are 
local employees.
 
Our commitment to employing a diverse and 
balanced workforce enables us to build an 
effective and talented workforce at all levels 
of the organisation, including the Board.
The value we place on equal opportunities 
and diversity of ideas, skills, knowledge, 
experience, culture, ethnicity and gender 
is evident in our daily operations as well as 
formalised in our policies and procedures.
Our recruitment policy is to appoint 
individuals based solely on their skills, 
experience and suitability to the role. 
30% (37 employees) of our workforce 
are women. Of those, 19% (7 employees) 
hold senior management positions 
within our organisation.
ENVIRONMENT
Our operations are managed in accordance 
with our policy of minimising environmental 
impacts and potential adverse effects. This 
includes a focus on effective design, efficient 
operation, and responsible energy use. 
In this regards, during 2017 we awarded the 
contract for environmental, social and health 
impact assessment (ESHIA) studies for the 
planning phase related to future work on 
the Miran and Bina Bawi gas developments. 
The ESHIA identifies, predicts, and 
evaluates the environmental effects of 
proposed actions and projects, including 
the identification of measures to reduce 
or avoid these effects where possible.
We continue to report our greenhouse 
gas (‘GHG’) emissions in accordance with 
the requirements of the UK’s Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013, for all Genel 
operated assets or facilities. 
The majority of energy and fuel data 
collected has been based on actual, 
measured consumption. 2.59% of emissions 
(26.6 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (tCO
2
e)) has 
Above: Refugee support, KRI
been extrapolated from actual consumption 
figures. Emissions are calculated using 
appropriate conversion factors sourced from: 
the Defra/DECC UK Government Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2015 and 
the IEA CO
2
 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 
Highlights 2013 Edition.
According to the methodologies outlined 
above, our total reportable scope 1 emissions 
in 2017 were 661 tCO
2
e, which included the 
combustion of diesel and LPG. Our total 
reportable scope 2 emissions were 367 
tCO
2
e, attributable to purchased electricity 
at our offices and field operations. Our total 
reportable scope 1 and 2 emissions were 
therefore 1028 tCO
2
e, normalised to 10.49 
tCO
2
e per employee (based on the 2017 
monthly average number of employees).
The GHG emissions from facilities we operate 
were 1028 tCO
2
e in 2017, which is lower than 
those reported (1156 tonnes tCO
2
e) in 2016. 
The main reasons for this decrease were 
lower level of exploration and development 
activities at the Miran and Bina-Bawi blocks 
in the KRI.
At a local level, we aim to leave the 
environment in an untarnished state 
for future generations, and work with the 
local community to raise awareness about 
environmental issues. Genel conducted a one-
day campaign with students in Sulaimaniyah 
to do this and encourage positive action 
regarding the protection of nature and 
the cleanliness of the environment in 
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
Working with the Sulaimaniyah Educational 
Department, a team from Genel led 100 
students from Twy Malik Preparatory 
School for Girls and Kurdistan Educational 
Community to Hawari Shar Public Park. 
All students were provided with information   ANNUALREPORT2017

leaflets and Genel branded T-shirts prior 
to an organised litter pick. 
Waste collection work continues in the 
villages surrounding Taq Taq. A local 
company is employed to remove waste from 
nine villages on a daily basis, transporting 
the waste to municipal disposal sites.
 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
We partner with and invest in communities 
close to our operations to achieve mutual 
long-term benefits, and we see it as our 
responsibility to help local people develop 
the skills to thrive and play a part as we 
work with them to unlock the potential of 
our host countries’ natural resources. Over 
three quarters of TTOPCO employees are 
from the local community, with such direct 
employment making a tangible difference 
to local areas.
Education is a key priority, and Genel works 
to maximise opportunities for people of all 
ages. As the KRI continues to face economic 
hardship, boosting worker skills increases 
employment opportunities. Working with its 
partner in TTOPCO and with a local NGO, 42 
young men in the communities around Taq 
Taq received training on air conditioning units 
and repairs and maintenance using electrical 
tools. In addition, 50 farmers were trained to 
take advantage of new farming techniques. 
In total, 92 people were provided with training 
to increase their capabilities and skills that 
enabled them to boost their employability 
status and generate their own private income.
In the villages surrounding Taq Taq, there are 
four primary schools educating 222 children. 
As part of our commitment to ensure that 
all children have every necessity required 
for school, the 108 boys and 114 girls were 
provided with brand new clothes. Genel then 
rolled out this support for local children to 
those in the proximity of Miran and Bina 
Bawi. In total, 183 children from five villages 
near to Miran, and a further 64 from three 
villages near to Bina Bawi, all benefitted 
from the programme. 
Genel continues to work with medical 
facilities in the KRI to fulfil the most pressing 
requirements. Most notably in 2017 a 
$99,000 donation fulfilled a request from 
the Koya District Commissioner to answer 
an urgent requirement for a Siemens 
cardiac catheterisation machine, which was 
installed by a local contractor. The machine 
directly contributes to the provision of 
better health services.
As operations ramp up in Somaliland so 
will our social programme, and we will strive 
to ensure that the local community directly 
benefits from Genel’s operations. In 2017 
Genel worked with and supported the 
Government, financially and logistically, with 
their efforts to bring relief to areas suffering 
from a severe drought that continued to 
engulf the region early in 2017. This took the 
form of providing emergency water and food 
to some of the impacted communities.

which is operating profit / (loss) adjusted for the add back of depreciation and amortisation ($117.4 million), 
exploration expense ($1.9 million) and impairment of property, plant and equipment ($58.2 million). 
2. Free cash flow before interest is net cash generated from operating activities less cash outflow due to purchase 
of intangible assets and purchase of property, plant and equipment (oil and gas assets only).
3. Cash reported at 31 December 2017 excludes $18.5 million of restricted cash.
4. Reported debt less cash.
Proceeds received in 2017 increased 
significantly from the prior year as a result of, 
first, the temporary CBP offset arrangement 
in the first half of the year and, subsequently, 
the RSA that was signed in August. The RSA 
formalised enhanced cash flow generation 
from Tawke PSC production into enduring 
contractual terms. In line with our focus 
on rigorous capital discipline, spend was 
prioritised on cash-generative producing 
assets, with non-production related capital 
expenditure minimised. 
This increased cash flow generation, 
which the Company expects to sustain, 
together with the reduction in net debt and 
refinancing, leaves Genel well positioned 
for future growth. 
Through the year, the Company has taken 
proactive and determined steps to deliver 
on the three key financial priorities that were 
set out in last year’s annual report:
 — Continue to work with the KRG for timely 
and full payments for oil deliveries, and for 
a transparent mechanism for reconciliation 
and recovery of the receivable
 — Continue to focus on all aspects of the 
Company’s cost base, whether capital, 
operating or administrative expenditure
 — Manage liquidity appropriately ahead of the 
2019 maturity of the Company’s bond debt
The key milestones in achieving these 
objectives are further explained in the 
following paragraphs.
In March, the Company’s confidence 
in consistent payments enabled the 
continuation of its proactive approach to 
rightsizing its debt by buying back to $252.8 
million nominal value of its bonds at an 
average 13% discount to par. This resulted 
in an accounting gain of $32.6 million, a 
reduction in total debt from $675.0 million 
to $421.8 million and a reduction in interest 
costs from over $50 million last year to just 
over $30 million.
In June, the Company received formal 
endorsement that capacity building payments 
due on proceeds received in the final quarter 
of 2016 and the first half of 2017 should 
be offset against the overdue receivable 
balance – this represented a cash benefit 
of $46.9 million.
In August, the Company successfully 
negotiated the RSA, converting its overdue 
receivable balance, which prior to the RSA 
was being recovered through an agreed 5% 
incremental take of gross revenues from the 
Tawke and Taq Taq PSCs, into contractual 
rights to benefit from increased shares of 
future revenue from the Tawke PSC (both 
the Tawke and Peshkabir fields). This benefit 
is received by way of: 
(1) the overriding royalty interest (‘ORRI’) 
of 4.5% of Tawke PSC gross revenue, 
which continues until July 2022; and 
(2) the waiver of CBP due on all proceeds 
received under the Tawke PSC, 
throughout the life of the licence. 
Cash received from the RSA in 2017 
amounted to $26.0 million, relating to sales 
made in August, September and October. 
The RSA also confirmed that the KRG 
reverted to making entitlement payments 
in line with the contractual terms of the PSC 
rather than under the proxy mechanism that 
was used in 2016 and for the first half of 2017.
In December, the Company reduced the 
debt from $421.8 million to $300 million 
and extended the maturity from May 2019 
to December 2022. The extended bonds 
pay a coupon of 10%.
Throughout the year the Company retained 
its focus on its cost base and disciplined 
capital allocation. Capital investment was 
focused on cost recoverable investment in 
production at Tawke and Taq Taq in order 
to maximise the benefit of the improving 
oil price and the improved cash flow 
generation explained above. As a result, 
74% of operating and capital expenditure 
incurred in the year was cost recoverable 
and consequently received back within 
circa three months of being incurred.

Operating expenditure at our producing 
assets was already one of the lowest in the 
world at around $2/bbl – in 2017 the average 
operating expense per barrel remained at 
around the same level.
This careful cost management, together with 
the positive impact of the CBP offset in the 
first half of the year, the RSA in the second 
half of the year, and reduced interest cost, 
has resulted in a significant increase in free 
cash flow generation, which increased from 
$59 million in 2016 to $142 million in the 
current year. The Company aims to continue 
the generation of significant free cash flow 
in future years through an ongoing efficient  GENEL ENERGY

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
allocation of capital, a focus on cost discipline, 
and the ongoing enhanced cash flows from 
the Tawke PSC.
The strong cash flow, together with the 
buyback of debt at a discount to par, has 
resulted in a reduction in net debt from $241 
million at the start of the year to $135 million 
at year-end. This deleveraging of the balance 
sheet and increased financial capacity 
increases the resilience of the business 
and the options available to the Company 
going forward.
The fourth financial priority for 2017 was to 
secure equity and debt investment into the 
Miran and Bina Bawi licences. The Company 
has made further progress in evaluating 
the options to maximise the value of these 
licences for Genel, options which have 
increased as a result of the Company’s 
improved cash generation. Further appraisal 
work is now planned in order to evaluate 
the optimal timing for farm-out and/or to 
pursue sole development of near term cash 
generating opportunities in order to maximise 
value delivery for shareholders. CPR’s for 
both licences were updated in early 2018 
and confirmed the oil and gas potential of 
these assets.
For 2018 the financial priorities of the 
Company are the following:
 — Maintenance of a strong balance sheet 
and management of liquidity runway 
throughout the development of the 
Miran and Bina Bawi fields
 — Continued focus on capital allocation, with 
prioritisation of highest value investment 
in assets with ongoing or near-term 
cash generation 
 — Continued focus on cost optimisation and 
performance management
 — Selective investment in value accretive 
opportunities that provide visible cash 
generation and debt capacity 
A summary of the financial results for the 
year is provided below, in addition there 
is some explanation of the RSA and how it 
is accounted for in the financial statements.
Financial results for the year 
Income statement
Working interest production of 35,200 bopd 
was significantly reduced compared to last 
year (2016: 53,300 bopd), principally as a 
result of decline in Taq Taq through 2016 
and in Q1 2017 before stabilising at around 
working interest production of 6,500 bopd. 
Revenue has increased from $190.7 million 
to $228.9 million. The year-on-year increase 
has been caused principally by the improved 
revenue generation of the Tawke PSC 
following the RSA, which was effective from

August, and generated incremental revenue 
of $48 million. The negative impact of lower 
production was partly offset by improved 
Brent oil price.
Production costs of $27.5 million decreased 
from last year (2016: $35.1 million) primarily 
as a result of lower use of consumables, 
personnel costs and well maintenance costs.
The Company reported a net gain arising 
from the RSA of $293.8 million. The RSA 
effectively saw the Company write-off its 
existing overdue receivable balance in 
exchange for the ORRI, a royalty income 
stream on Tawke PSC sales, and the waiver 
of CBPs that otherwise would have been 
due on proceeds received under the Tawke 
PSC. The net increase in the value of booked 
assets on the balance sheet of $293.8 million 
has been presented on the face of the income 
statement as ‘Net gain arising from the RSA’ 
– effectively representing the difference in 
value between the previous book value of 
receivables and the discounted cash flow 
value of the RSA.
The increase in revenue and the net 
gain arising from the RSA has resulted 
in EBITDAX increasing to $475.5 million 
(2016: $130.7 million).
Depreciation of $83.3m (2016: $127.8 million) 
was reduced year-on-year as a result of 
lower production. Amortisation of Tawke 
intangibles is a new item arising from the RSA 
and resulted in an expense of $32.8 million. 
Exploration expense of net $1.9 million 
is significantly decreased from last year 
(2016: $815.1 million), which included 
impairment of Miran, Bina Bawi and Chia 
Surkh ($779.0 million) and the accrual of the 
Morocco minimum work obligation ($33.0 
million). The current year expense includes 
a credit of $16.0 million, which is comprised 
of the release of about half of the accrual 
relating to Morocco. 
An impairment expense of $58.2 million 
(2016: $218.3 million) has been recorded in 
relation to the Taq Taq PSC. Whilst the results 
of TT-29 and the CPR are encouraging, the 
Company is still assessing the amount of 
capital expenditure and related returns that 
would be required to deliver the CPR 2P 
production profile.
 
The Company’s planned capital expenditure 
for Taq Taq results in a more conservative 
production profile than the 2P forecast from 
last year’s CPR, and is also lower than the 
2P production profile from the latest CPR 
announced in February 2018.
General and administrative costs were $21.0 
million (2016: $26.0 million), of which cash 
costs were $16.9 million (2016: $17.4 million).
Finance income of $4.9 million (2016: 
$16.2 million) was comprised of $2.7 million 
discount unwind on trade receivables (2016: 
$14.2 million) and $2.2 million of bank interest 
income (2016: $2.0 million). Other finance 
expense of $28.0 million (2016: $10.0 million) 
was comprised of $3.7 million premium 
paid and $16.0 million accelerated discount 
unwind on redemption of the bonds (2016: 
$- million) together with non-cash discount 
unwind expense on liabilities of $8.3 million 
(2016: $10.0 million).
In the KRI, the Company is either exempt 
from tax or tax due has been paid on its 
behalf by the KRG from the KRG’s own share 
of revenues, resulting in no tax payment 
required or expected to be made by the 
Company. Tax presented in the income 
statement of $1.0 million relates to taxation 
of the Turkish and UK service companies. 
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the year was $94.1 
million (2016: $61.2 million). Cost recovered 
spend on producing assets in the KRI was 
$59.5 million (2016: $40.3 million) with 
spend on exploration and appraisal assets 
amounting to $34.6 million (2016: $20.9 
million), principally incurred on the Miran, 
Bina Bawi and Somaliland PSCs.
Cash flow and cash
Net cash flow from operations was 
$221.0 million (2016: $131.0 million). This 
was positively impacted by $86.5 million 
(2016: $53.9) of proceeds being received 
for the historic KRG receivable, and $176.8 
million (2016: $153.4 million) received for 
current sales. 
Free cash flow before interest was $141.8 
million (2016: $59.1 million) and free cash 
flow after interest was $99.1 million (2016: 
$7.1 million). After which, $216.7 million 
(2016: $35.4 million) was used in March 
to buy back Company bonds with nominal 
value of $252.8 million (2016: $55.4 million), 
with a further $128.5 million spent on 
buying back Company bonds as part of 
the bond refinancing.
$18.5 million (2016: $19.5 million) of cash 
is restricted and therefore excluded from 
reported cash of $162.0 million (2016: $407.0 
million). Overall there was a net decrease in 
cash of $245.1 million compared to a decrease 
of $47.8 million last year.
Debt
Total debt has been reduced from $675.0 
million at the start of the year to $300.0 
million of bonds maturing in December 2022 
– this is reported under IFRS net of capitalised 
costs at $296.8 million (2016: $648.2 million) 
and results in net debt of $134.8 million 
(2016: $241.2 million). 
The bond has three financial covenant 
maintenance tests:
Financial covenant Test YE2017
Net debt / EBITDAX < 3.0 0.3
Equity ratio (Total 
equity/Total assets) > 40% 76%
Minimum liquidity > $30m $162m
Net assets 
Net assets at 31 December 2017 were 
$1,609.8 million (2016: $1,333.4 million) 
and consist primarily of oil and gas assets 
of $1,847.9 million (2016: $1,538.7 million), 
trade receivables of $73.3 million (2016: 
$253.5 million) and net debt of $134.8 million 
(2016: $241.2 million).
Liquidity / cash counterparty  
risk management 
The Company monitors its cash position, 
cash forecasts and liquidity on a regular 
basis. The Company holds surplus cash 
in treasury bills or on time deposits with 
a number of major financial institutions. 
Suitability of banks is assessed using 
a combination of sovereign risk, credit 
default swap pricing and credit rating. 
Dividend
No dividend (2016: nil) will be paid for the 
year ended 31 December 2017. 
Going concern
The Directors have assessed that the 
Company’s forecast liquidity provides 
adequate headroom over forecast 
expenditure for the 12 months following 
the signing of the annual report for 
the period ended 31 December 2017 
and consequently that the Company 
is considered a going concern. GENEL ENERGY

Viability 
statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the 
2016 revision of the Code, the Directors 
have assessed the prospects and viability 
of the Company over a longer period 
than the 12 months required by the 
‘Going Concern’ provision.
Choice of assessment period
The Directors retain their assessment 
of five years as the appropriate period for 
their viability statement. Although inevitably 
containing cash flow uncertainty given the 
inherent volatility in long-term oil price, 
cost and production forecasting, five years 
was felt to be an appropriate period for 
the following reasons:
 — The production assumptions are supported 
by recent external reserve reports on both 
existing producing assets
 — The period captures the maturity of the 
Company’s $300 million unsecured bonds, 
maturing December 2022
Review of financial forecasts
In reviewing the expected evolution of the 
Company’s business, cash flows and capital 
structure over the review period the Directors 
took into account:
 — The Company’s five-year plan, which 
incorporates the latest life of field cash 
flow projections for the oil producing assets
 — The various capital allocation scenarios 
that may evolve in relation to the 
Bina Bawi and Miran licences and the 
Company’s other potential asset portfolio 
investment decisions
 — The Company’s $300 million bond and 
compliance with its financial covenants
 — The availability of debt capital markets 
and other sources of finance
 — The oil price forecast set out in the notes 
to our financial statements
A range of sensitivities was run on the 
assumptions set out above to reflect different 
scenarios including, but not limited to, 
changes to production profiles, commodity 
price assumptions, and payments. 
Consideration of principal risks
The principal assumptions underlying 
the forecasts above were reviewed in the 
context of the risks and mitigating actions 
set out in the Principal Risks on pages 28 to 
30 including in particular those that relate 
to the company’s viability including:
 — Payment for KRI sales
 — Development and recovery of reserves 
and resources
 — KRI natural resources industry
 — Regional risk
Viability assessment
Based on their review of these assumptions 
and sensitivities in the context of the funding 
options and risks referred to above, the 
Directors found that there was a reasonable 
expectation that the company will be able 
to continue in operation and manage its 
liabilities as they fall due over the five year 
period to December 2022.
Our 2017 strategic report, from pages 1 to 
31 has been reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Directors on 21 March 2018.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
I am pleased to present my first Corporate 
Governance Report to shareholders 
as your Chairman. 
2017 saw numerous changes at Board 
level. Three new Directors were appointed, 
including myself, and there was a reduction 
in the number of Directors appointed to the 
Board from nine to seven with the majority 
now being Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Furthermore, on 14 March 2018 
we announced that Mehmet Ög ˘ütçü will 
stand down as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. 
Board composition and size will continue to 
be reviewed as the strategy and business 
plans for the Company evolve.
The appointment of Martin Gudgeon and 
Tim Bushell provide significant relevant skills 
to the Board including technical, financial 
and corporate experience. I look forward to 
continuing to work with all Board members 
as we carry on building the business and 
delivering our strategy.
Changes at Board level led to a review of 
our committee structures to ensure each 
Board Committee has the correct skills 
and experience required for it to perform 
its duties. George Rose was appointed as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and Mehmet Ö˘ gütçü as Chairman of the 
HSSE Committee. Following Mehmet 
Ö˘ gütçü’s retirement a review of Committee 
composition will be undertaken. In September 
2017 the Board took the decision to adopt 
the Reserves Committee as a formal 
Committee of the Board, and Tim Bushell was 
appointed as its Chairman. This decision was 
taken to further strengthen the Company’s 
governance framework and provide oversight 
to the reserves and resources review 
process. Further information on the Reserves 
Committee can be found on page 48.
The Company has established a 
comprehensive induction programme, 
which is provided to all new Non-Executive 
Directors. The induction programme includes 
meetings with key department heads at both 
the Company’s London and Ankara offices 
and with relevant external advisors.
The successful completion of the bond 
refinancing in December 2017 has solidified 
Genel’s financial foundation, and provides us 
with a stable platform from which to execute 
our strategy and meet our business objectives. 
As we do this, the Company remains committed 
to operating to high standards of corporate 
governance, and we will continue to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
as is appropriate to our Company. 
During the year the Board spent a 
considerable amount of time reviewing the 
Company’s strategy. Further information on 
our strategy can be found on pages 10 and 11.
Following the results of our 2017 AGM, and in 
line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Board undertook to review remuneration. 
Following this review, effective as of 1 August 
2017, Murat Özgül’s annual salary was 
reduced from £625,000 to £500,000 and 
PSP award increased from 150% to 200% 
of annual salary. These changes brought the 
CEO’s remuneration in line with comparable 
listed peers. Further details can be found in 
our 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration 
on pages 52 to 59.
In accordance with the Company’s 
commitment to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code the Board undertook a 
formal and rigorous external evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its Committees 
and each individual Director led by Spencer 
Stuart. Further details of the Board evaluation 
can be found on page 41.

the growth of the KRI. Further information on 
our business model can be found on page 11.
We operate to a high level of governance 
within a culture that values ethical standards, 
personal and corporate integrity and respect

consistent with our business strategy and 
commitment to a transparent and high-
quality governance system.
Our view is that governance is not just 
a matter for the Board and that a strong

with whom we conduct business are set out 
in our code of conduct, which is summarised

This report aims to provide shareholders with 
a comprehensive summary of our governance 
arrangements and an explanation of how the 
Company has approached the main principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’) during 2017.
Genel Energy plc is a Jersey incorporated 
company with a standard listing on the 
London Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding 
our standard listing, we are committed to

2017, less than half the Board was made up of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. A copy

As corporate governance principles continue to 
evolve, we will continue to adopt best practice 
guidelines as appropriate to our business.

proper and reasonable steps to ensure 
full compliance with the Market Abuse 
Regulation, including ensuring that staff are 
fully trained and understand their obligations 
under the new regime. During November 
2017 additional face-to-face training was 
provided to relevant employees focusing on 
the Company’s disclosure obligations under 
the Market Abuse Regulation. 
Code of conduct
Our code of conduct defines what we stand 
for as a Company and sets out the principles 
that guide all of our business activities. All staff 
have received training on how to represent 
Genel in accordance with the principles of the 
code of conduct. We strive for operational 
excellence and aim to conduct our business 
in a responsible, ethical and safe manner 
with high standards of financial reporting, 
corporate governance, and compliance with 
applicable laws. The code of conduct sets 
guidelines by which we conduct our business 
and how we expect our Board, employees, 
suppliers, partners and others to behave. 
SpeakUp
All employees are encouraged to raise 
any concerns they may have and to report 
any suspected or known violations of the 
code of conduct without fear of retaliation. 
We operate an independently run and 
confidential ‘SpeakUp’ hotline. All issues 
raised via this route are investigated and 
reported to the Audit Committee. 
Business conduct
We conduct our business in an open, honest 
and ethical manner. We do not tolerate 
any form of bribery. We aim to ensure that 
all financial and non-financial information 
we create is complete and accurate, and 
we strive to provide accurate and timely 
information to external stakeholders, 
including governments, in the locations in 
which we operate. We take steps to protect 
against inappropriate use of confidential and 
privileged information and we aim to protect 
and use our business assets appropriately.
Our policy is not to make political donations 
and we have not done so in the period under 
review (2016: nil).
Conflicts of interest
We seek to avoid conflicts of interest 
wherever possible. We believe it is important 
that the decision making process is not 
impaired by an individual being conflicted 
by either an actual or a potential conflict. 
However, we recognise that from time 
to time situations may arise which could 
result in actual or potential conflicts and, 
accordingly, we have a formal system in place 
enabling Directors and members of senior 
management to declare any such conflicts 
and for those conflicts to be reviewed and, 
if appropriate, authorised by the Board. 
A register of conflicts is maintained by the 
Company Secretary. The Audit Committee 
and the Board have applied the principles 
and processes set out above during 2017 and 
confirm that they have operated effectively.
Third parties
We maintain high standards of business 
conduct in our dealings with all third parties 
in order to promote mutually beneficial 
relationships and protect our reputation. 
We do not seek to win or maintain business by 
acting illegally or contrary to our contractual 
agreements. Our relationships with third 
parties are conducted on a fair and honest 
basis. We expect our third parties to maintain 
the same standards of business conduct 
as we adhere to.
Communities and environment
Protecting and sustaining the communities 
and environment in which we operate 
is fundamental to maintaining our 
operating licences and to creating a long-
term sustainable business. We strive to 
maintain high standards of environmental 
protection and we do not compromise 
our environmental values for profit or 
production. We seek to maintain proactive 
and constructive engagement with the local 
communities affected by our operations 
and assets, and invest to help them develop 
in a sustainable manner. We contribute to 
socio-economic development and provide 
transparency in respect of our contributions 
and their impact. Further information on how 
we engage with communities can be found in 
the community engagement and investment 
section of this report on pages 18 to 21.
The role of the Board
The Board’s role is to provide leadership 
in delivering on the long-term success of 
the Company within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls. It is responsible for 
approving the Company’s strategy and 
business plan and keeping under review 
the financial and operational resources of 
the Company. It monitors the performance 
of the business and management against 
those strategic objectives with the overall 
objective of creating and delivering value 
to shareholders.
The performance of the Board and the 
contributions of Directors to the Board’s 
decision making processes are essential to 
fulfilling this role. The Directors may exercise 
all the powers of the Company subject to the 
provisions of relevant law, the Company’s 
articles and any special resolution of the 
Company in the furtherance of their role. GENEL ENERGY

The Board has reserved certain matters for 
its own consideration and decision making. 
Authorities have been delegated to Board 
Committees and these are set out clearly in 
each Committee’s terms of reference which are 
reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and relevant. Copies of the terms 
of reference are available on our website.
Specific matters reserved for the Board 
include setting the Company’s objectives and 
business strategy and its overall supervision. 
Significant acquisitions, divestments and 
other strategic decisions will all be considered 
and determined by the Board in accordance 
with the Company’s delegated authorities.
The Board reviews the matters reserved for 
its decision annually, subject to the limitations 
imposed by the Company’s constitutional 
documents and applicable law.
The Board and its Committees have 
access to the advice and services of the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary 
and may seek advice from independent 
experts at the expense of the Company as 
appropriate. Individual Directors may also 
seek independent legal advice at the expense 
of the Company, in accordance with the 
Board’s agreed procedure. 
In addition, the Board has extensive access to 
members of senior management, who attend 
Board meetings by invitation, and present 
regularly to the Board on the performance 
of the business.
Board composition
There are seven Directors on the Board, 
of whom one is Executive and six (including 
the Chairman) Non-Executive. Five are 
independent under the Code (including 
the Chairman who was independent 
on appointment) and two are not 
considered independent.
During 2017, Tony Hayward, Simon Lockett, 
Nathaniel Rothschild and Chakib Sbiti stepped 
down as Directors. Ümit Tolga Bilgin was 
put forward for election as a Director at the 
Company’s 2017 AGM but did not receive the 
required 50% majority of votes in favour of 
his election and accordingly was not appointed 
as a Director. On 14 March 2018 the Company 
announced that Mehmet Ög ˘ütçü will retire as 
a Director at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM.
Skills, knowledge, experience 
and attributes of Directors
The Board considers that a diversity of 
skills, background, knowledge, experience, 
perspective and gender is required in order 
to govern the business effectively. The 
Board and its Committees work actively to 
ensure that the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors continue to have the right balance 
of skills, experience, independence and 
group knowledge necessary to discharge 
their responsibilities in accordance with 
the highest standards of governance.
The Non-Executive Directors bring with 
them international and operational experience 
gained both in the sectors in which we 
operate and in other areas of business and 
public life. Murat Özgül brings additional 
perspectives to the Board’s work through a 
deep understanding of the business and the 
region within which it operates. Together 
they oversee the strategy of the Group and 
monitor the pursuit of the corporate strategy. 
All Directors are required to devote sufficient 
time and demonstrate commitment to 
their role.
Further details of the Directors’ skills and 
experience are set out on pages 34 and 35 
of this Annual Report.
Independence of the Board
Upon the retirement of Mehmet Ög ˘ütçü as 
a Director, the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors (Tim Bushell, Martin Gudgeon 
and George Rose) will make up exactly half 
the Board and are responsible for ensuring 
appropriate challenge of management and 
the decisions of the Board. Stephen Whyte (as 
Chairman) was considered independent at the 
time of his appointment. In order to ensure 
strong governance the Independent Directors 
(plus the Chairman) have a voting majority. 
The Independent Directors and the Chairman 
meet regularly in private session after Board 
meetings and on other occasions. 
Nazli K. Williams has been nominated 
for appointment to the Board by Focus 
Investments Limited in accordance with 
the relationship agreement between the 
Company and Focus, and is not considered 
to be independent.
The Board considers that, following the 
changes to the Board composition that took 
place during the year, there is an appropriate 
balance between Executive and Non-
Executive, Independent and Non-Independent 
Directors, with a view to promoting 
shareholder interests and governing 
the business effectively.

the boardroom.
The Directors receive board papers and 
other relevant information in a timely 
manner ahead of meetings. Board papers 
are delivered through an electronic 
portal that enables Directors to access 
them wherever they are in the world. The 
timely provision of relevant information to 
Directors is vital in ensuring they are able 
to fulfil their role of effective oversight and 
challenge and for enabling the Board to 
make effective decisions.
Directors’ induction and  
ongoing development
In order to govern the Group effectively, 
Non-Executive Directors must have a clear 
understanding of the overall strategy, together 
with a sound knowledge of the business and 
the industry within which it operates.
The Chairman, together with the Company 
Secretary, is responsible for ensuring that 
all new Directors receive a full, formal and 
tailored induction upon appointment to the 
Board. This includes a detailed overview of 
the Company and its governance practices 
and meetings with key personnel from 
across the Group in order to develop a full 
understanding of the business, its strategy 
and business priorities in each area.

GOVERNANCE
Risk monitoring and reporting
The Group keeps under review the 
major risks to which its operations in all 
regions are exposed by leveraging its 
local expertise, industry knowledge and 
strategic relationships. In particular, the 
Group continues to have a regular dialogue 
with its key stakeholders in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq, such as the KRG, the Turkish 
government and other regional public bodies. 
We maintain similar relationships within the 
Africa region to ensure the risks across the 
organisation as a whole are fully understood 
and mitigated appropriately and within the 
Group’s tolerance for risk.
Our risk management procedures facilitate 
the identification of the key risks and key 
risk indicators, the controls by which these 
are managed and mitigated, and how these 
controls are monitored. Senior management 
review and update the risk management 
process and keep under constant review 
the risks identified. The Board undertakes 
a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company at least annually. It 
focuses its assessment on those risks that 
could impact our business model, solvency, 
liquidity or future performance. The 
Board also reviews and monitors the risk 
management and internal control systems 
and each such review covers all material 
controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls.
Further details of the principal risks and 
uncertainties to which the Group’s operations 
are exposed, and the framework within which 
these risks are managed, are set out on 
pages 26 to 30.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control. This system is 
designed to identify, evaluate and manage the 
significant risks to which the Group is exposed. 
The Board has established processes to meet 
the obligations placed on listed companies 
and the expectations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code to publish a long-term 
viability statement and to continually monitor 
systems of risk management and internal 
control. These processes include having clear 
lines of responsibility, documented levels of 
delegated authority and appropriate operating 
procedures. We recognise that the system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against misstatement 
or loss. Our long-term viability statement 
can be found on page 31.
The Audit Committee supports the Board 
in the performance of its responsibilities by 
reviewing those procedures that relate to 
risk management and internal control. The 
Audit Committee considers the reports of 
the internal audit function and the external 
auditor and reports to the Board on such 
matters as it feels should be brought to the 
Board’s attention. Further information on the 
actions taken by the Audit Committee during 
the year can be found on pages 42 and 43.
The assessment of controls and risk 
management processes provides a 
reasonable basis for the Board to make 
proper judgements on an ongoing basis 
as to the financial position and prospects 
of the Group.
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 
up to the date of the signing of the financial 
statements, and is satisfied that it remains 
appropriate to the business.
A detailed budget is produced annually 
in accordance with our financial processes 
and reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Operational reports are provided to the 
Executive Committee on a monthly basis and 
performance against the budget kept under 
regular review in accordance with the Group’s 
financial procedures manual. The CEO 
reports to the Board on performance and 
key issues as they arise. During 2017, a five 
year business plan and forecasting process 
was introduced with the intention that it 
will support and supplement our budget 
processes. In addition, the introduction of the 
five year business plan and forecast provides 
an additional tool for the Board to consider 
when making decisions on capital allocation, 
creating value through our assets and 
de-risking possibilities. 
Communication with stakeholders
Part of the Group’s code of conduct sets 
a framework for how it partners with, and 
invests in, communities (local, regional and 
global) to achieve mutual long-term benefits. 
The Group contributes to socio-economic 
development through taxes, royalties and 
other local payments and donations. Further 
details of our community programmes 
can be found on pages 18 to 21. During the 
year a stakeholder management plan was 
adopted by the Board. The plan considers 
the Company’s key stakeholders, their impact 
on key strategic objectives and how the 
Company engages with each stakeholder.
2018 AGM
The 2018 AGM will be held on Thursday, 
17 May 2018 at Linklaters LLP, One Silk 
Street, London, EC2Y 8HQ, UK at 11.00am. 
The Notice of AGM accompanies this Annual 
Report and sets out the business to be 
considered at the meeting. The AGM will 
provide an opportunity for shareholders 
to meet with the Directors and senior 
management. Both this Annual Report 
and the Notice of AGM are available on 
our website at www.genelenergy.com
Communication with investors
We communicate on a regular basis with our 
shareholders via presentations and calls as 
part of our annual investor calendar. We also 
liaise with them on an ad-hoc basis as and 
when questions arise. During the year we 
also communicated with our bondholders 
via calls and scheduled meetings.
Our major shareholders are also encouraged 
to meet with the Chairman to discuss any 
matters that they would like to raise outside 
the formal investor calendar. Several such 
meetings took place during the year and we 
welcome an open dialogue with our investors. 
The Board receives regular investor relations 
updates covering key investor meetings 
and activities, as well as shareholder and 
investor feedback.
During 2018, as the Company’s strategy and 
business plan evolves we intend to increase 
our interaction with shareholders through 
proactive engagement.

Board committees
The Board has established five committees: 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee, the Nomination Committee, the 
Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
Committee and the Reserves Committee.
During the year the Reserves Committee 
was formally adopted as a Board Committee, 
the Committee is made up of Tim Bushell and 
Stephen Whyte, both of whom are Directors 
with strong technical backgrounds. The 
objective of the Committee is to provide 
additional oversight on the assessment of the 
Company’s reserves and resources. 
Each Committee has adopted terms of 
reference under which authority is delegated 
by the Board and copies of which are available 
on our website. Each Committee consists only 
of Independent Non-Executive Directors with 
the exception of the Nomination Committee 
and the Reserves Committee. Stephen Whyte 
was independent upon his appointment as 
Chairman, chairs the Nomination Committee 
and is a member of the Reserves Committee.
Actions from the 2016 effectiveness review Progress made against the actions
Board development
As the gas business develops, Directors should continue 
to be educated on the complex project inputs throughout 
2017 and beyond.
Detailed updates on the gas project have been part of the Board agendas 
throughout the year. The Company has added gas commercialisation and capital 
project delivery capability at the Board and executive level. During the course of 
the year an external consultant was also engaged to provide additional capability 
with the planning and development of the gas project. 
Board effectiveness
Following further changes to Board composition during 
the year, the Directors should continue to focus on its 
operational effectiveness during 2017 and the induction 
process for new Directors.
There have been significant changes to the Board and senior management 
team in the past twelve months. The effectiveness of the Board is at a good 
level and the relationship between the new Board and senior management team 
is developing in a very positive manner. All new Directors undertook a formal 
induction programme. 
Financing 
The Board, supported by the Audit Committee, will focus 
on maintaining the financial strength of the Company in 
the lead up to the refinancing in 2019.
The successful bond buyback in April 2017 and completion of refinancing 
the high-yield bond in December 2017 with the expectation of ongoing material 
free cash flow, provides us with a solid platform and financial flexibility to execute 
our growth plans. 
Underlying business
The Directors recognise the need to focus on the 
achievement of core business targets and the need 
to support management in that regard.
During 2017 Directors provided support to management to deliver core business 
achievements including but not limited to executing the RSA, refinancing our 
high-yield bond, replacing the commitment to drill a well on the Sidi Moussa 
license to a 3D seismic campaign.
Actions arising from the 2017 effectiveness review
Board Effectiveness The Board has decided to add an additional strategy meeting to the annual calendar from 2018 to review 
comprehensively and regularly the Company’s strategy in an offsite setting.
The Board has reviewed the current agenda formulation for Board meetings and identified items for 
additional regular inclusion in the coming year; cyber security; performance culture; developing talent 
and succession planning.
The Reserves Committee has been elevated to a full Board Committee and the Chairmen of the Audit 
and Reserves Committees have reviewed their terms of reference, Committee membership and ways 
of strengthening the linkages between the two Committees.
Shareholder and Regional 
Relationships
The Chairman will continue to work closely with the Chief Executive Officer to further develop shareholder 
and regional stakeholder relationships and to report regularly to the Board. The Chairman and SID will further 
strengthen the regular cycle of shareholder discussions on an annual basis.
Board Development Longer-term Board succession planning and the future composition of the Board will be reconsidered by 
the Nomination Committee in consultation with the full Board taking into consideration the future strategic 
direction of the Company.
The independent review of the performance of each of the Directors has been undertaken by the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director 
led the review of the Chairman’s performance. Following these performance reviews, the Board considers that each of the Directors continue to 
make an effective and valuable contribution and demonstrate their commitment to the role. It is the Board’s intention to continue to review its 
performance annually including that of its Committees and individual Directors. Accordingly, the Board recommends the election/re-election 
of each Director with the exception of Mehmet Ög ˘ütçü who will stand down as a Director at the Company’s forthcoming AGM.
Board effectiveness
The Board engaged independent advisors 
Spencer Stuart to facilitate an evaluation 
of the Board’s effectiveness during 2017. 
The previous four years’ Board evaluations 
were conducted internally by the Company 
Secretary, with the last external evaluation 
being conducted in 2012. The scope of the 
evaluation covered the Board, its four Board 
Committees and the Directors individually.  GENEL ENERGY

RSA accounting – the Committee considered 
the approach taken to accounting for the RSA 
in the Company’s financial statements.
During the year the Committee also 
considered refinancing of the Bond including 
consideration of strategy, quantum, structure 
and yield.
Internal audit
The Board recognises that an effective 
internal audit function is an important part 
of delivering a strong governance culture. 
Each year the Committee approves an internal 
audit plan for the year ahead which is aligned 
to the Group’s risk profile. In July 2017 the 
Committee reviewed the outcome of the 
internal audit work performed during the first 
half of 2017, there had been no significant 
findings. In December 2017, the Company 
created a new internal audit structure, 
whereby it appointed a secondee from a 
Big Four firm as its Head of Internal Audit. 
Audit fieldwork planning, review and follow 
up is co-sourced with E&Y, with execution of 
the fieldwork performed by a combination 
of internal resource, E&Y and/or subject 
matter experts, depending on the particular 
requirements or location of the audits.
External audit
The effectiveness and the independence of 
the external auditor are key to ensuring the 
integrity of the Group’s published financial 
information. The Audit Committee meet 
privately with the external auditors in the 
absence of management to discuss the 
audit. Prior to the commencement of the 
audit, the Committee reviews and approves 
the external auditor’s audit plan. PwC 
present to the Committee their proposed 
plan of work which is designed to ensure 
that there are no material misstatements 
in the financial statements.
The Committee monitors and approves 
the provision of non-audit services by the 
Company’s external auditors in accordance 
with the policy on non-audit services. The 
provision of non-audit services is generally 
limited to services that are closely connected 
to the external audit or to projects that 
require a detailed understanding of the Group 
(for example taxation advice) which require 
pre-authorisation by the Committee under 
the terms of the policy.
In 2017, the ratio of non-audit to audit fee paid 
to PwC was 1:6, the non-audit fee paid was 
$0. 1 million, further details of which can be 
found on page 92 of the notes to the financial 
statements. These fees reflect the services 
and advice provided by PwC in respect of 
tax and accounting advice received during 
the year. 
PwC have been appointed as the Company’s 
auditors for the past six years following a 
tendering process in 2011. In 2016 the Audit 
Partner was rotated and Michael Timar was 
appointed as the Senior Statutory Auditor 
to the Company. When considering the 
re-appointment of the Company’s external 
auditors, the Committee reviews the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity. In 
November 2017 the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
It reviewed papers from both management 
and the external auditors, including the 
planning and execution of the audit process. 
Following this review, the Committee was 
satisfied that the external auditor remains 
both effective and fully independent and 
on that basis their reappointment will 
be proposed and recommended at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Audit Committee engaged independent 
advisors Spencer Stuart to facilitate an 
evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness 
during 2017. The review identified some 
areas for focus in 2018 including; monitoring 
of internal controls, the Board’s current 
approach to risk oversight and suggested 
ways to elevate this on the Board’s agenda 
and link it more closely to the strategy, 
the Annual Report and strengthening the 
linkages between the Audit Committee 
and the Reserves Committee. 
Following the publication of updated FRC 
guidance on Audit Committees and new model 
terms of reference for Audit Committees by 
the ICSA in 2017 the Committees terms of 
reference were updated to ensure they were 
aligned to best practice. The Committees 
terms of reference reflect its responsibilities 
in the context of the review of internal 
financial control systems and financial risk 
management systems. The Committee terms 
of reference can be found on our website

All the members of the Nomination 
Committee are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chairman of the Board chairs 
the Nomination Committee except when the 
Committee considers the appointment of 
the Chairman.
As part of its remit the Nomination 
Committee keeps under review the 
composition and balance of the Board. 
The Committee is aware of the need to align 
the Board’s composition with the Company’s 
strategy and to ensure the Board has the 
necessary skills to ensure the Company’s 
long-term success. It assists the Board in 
ensuring that the Board consists of high-
calibre individuals whose background, skills, 
experience and personal characteristics 
will augment the present Board and 
meet its future needs. 
During the year George Rose chaired the 
Nomination Committee during the Company’s 
search process for a new Chairman. The 
Committee recommended the appointment 
of Stephen Whyte as Chairman to the 
full Board. 
The Committee spent time considering 
whether additional Directors needed to 
be appointed to the Board following the 
reduction in size of the Board following 
our 2017 AGM. The Committee reviewed 
the skills and experience around the 
boardroom ahead of engaging Spencer 
Stuart, an external search agency, to 
undertake a comprehensive search process 
and making a recommendation to the full 
Board to appoint two new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
As part of their remit Spencer Stuart were 
asked to provide a pool of candidates from 
a diverse range of backgrounds and with due 
regard to gender diversity. Spencer Stuart 
were also appointed to provide an external 
Board evaluation during the year. 
Currently there is one female Director on 
the Board and, when the opportunity arises 
we consider candidates based on merit and 
against objective criteria and with due regard 
for the benefits of diversity on the Board. In 
the year ahead, the Nomination Committee 
will keep under review the composition 
and balance of the Board to ensure the 
appropriate experience and skills to deliver 
the Company’s strategy. 
The Nomination Committee engaged 
independent advisors Spencer Stuart to 
facilitate an evaluation of the Committee’s 
effectiveness during 2017. The review 
concluded that the Nomination Committee 
was functioning effectively. The relatively 
small Board is observed as conducive to 
productive and time-effective discussions 
and its current composition is well-balanced 
and a range of sector and other important 
functional experience is represented. 
The review identified some areas for 
focus in 2018 including Board succession 
planning and the future composition of the 
Board which should be reconsidered by the 
Nomination Committee in consultation with 
the full Board taking into consideration the 
future strategic direction of the Company. 
It was also highlighted that in future 
Board appointments, the Nomination 
Committee and Board should aim to 
improve gender diversity. 
The Committee has also reviewed its 
terms of reference. The Committee terms

Genel’s HSSE policy reflects international 
best practice including but not limited to 
the IFC Performance Standards and ICMM 
Sustainable Development Framework. At 
each meeting of the Committee an update is 
received from management on the progress 
made against the HSSE strategic plan which 
it approves at the beginning of each year. 
In 2017 the plan contained actions in the 
following areas: leadership and culture, 
contractor management, operational 
activity, HSE management system, health, 
environment and HSE safety performance. 
During the course of the year progress was 
made against each of these areas including 
increased site visits to demonstrate visible 
HSE leadership, arranging various crisis and 
emergency management exercises in order 
to ensure preparedness in the event of a crisis 
and development of contractor assurance 
management plans for high risk contracts. 
During the year across the organisation 12 
HSE training and knowledge sharing sessions 
were held on topics including but not limited 
to oil spill preparedness and response, HSE 
observation, intervention and recognition and 
administering first aid. Operations activities 
also included providing HSE support for the 
development of the Miran and Bina Bawi 
gas project. 
In line with the UK Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 the Company prepares and 
reports our greenhouse gas emissions which 
can be found in our corporate responsibility 
section on pages 18 to 21. The Committee 
reviewed the greenhouse gas emissions 
occurring from operations in 2017 and 
notes a year-on-year reduction of 12%. 
In recognition of the importance of HSSE 
to our business the 2017 annual bonus 
objectives contain an element specifically 
allocated to HSSE. The Committee reviewed 
progress against the 2017 HSSE objectives 
and made recommendations to the 
Remuneration Committee on these elements 
the details of which may be found on page 54 
of the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The HSSE Committee engaged independent 
advisors Spencer Stuart to facilitate an 
evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness 
during 2017. The HSSE Committee was 
viewed as discharging its duties effectively, 
further enhancing the already strong 
HSE culture within the business. Areas for 
improvement were identified as the inclusion 
of crisis planning on the Board agenda and 
a facilitated ‘fire drill’ for the Board in 2018. 
The Committee reviews its terms of 
reference annually, which can be viewed at

GOVERNANCE
In September 2017 the Board as part of 
a review of Board Committees took the 
decision to adopt the Reserves Committee 
as a full Board Committee. This decision was 
taken to enhance the Company’s governance 
framework. Prior to this, the Committee 
membership was made up of Board Directors 
and its findings were reported to the 
Audit Committee.
The objective of the Reserves Committee 
is to provide oversight to the assessment 
of the Company’s reserves and resources. 
The Committee relies on information and 
support from management and the external 
independent reserves evaluator to carry out 
its duties and responsibilities. In addition, the 
Committee invites experts and professionals 
to its meetings as appropriate.
The Committee received and considered 
reports from management, RPS Energy 
and McDaniels in relation to the 2017 
annual reserves and resources statement.
The Reserves Committee has detailed 
terms of reference which can be viewed

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, 
I am pleased to present Genel’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. This is my first Report as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman and my 
thanks go to my predecessor, Chakib Sbiti.
We have once again prepared our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report and Annual 
Report on Remuneration in accordance with 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (as amended). As a Jersey registered 
company we are not required to prepare a 
remuneration report in accordance with UK 
legislation. However, as in previous years it 
remains the policy of Genel to comply with 
high standards of corporate governance. 
Remuneration Policy
As we have chosen to comply with UK 
remuneration reporting regulations, at our 
2017 AGM we sought shareholder approval 
for our Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’). 
The Policy was strengthened during 2017 
with the intention of applying a responsible 
approach to executive remuneration and 
aligning with the Company’s strategy in the 
challenging energy business environment.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Chairman Members Meetings in 2017
George Rose Martin Gudgeon 3 scheduled
Mehmet Ö˘ gütçü 3 ad hoc
At the AGM in June 2017, 69.31% of our 
shareholders approved our Policy. Following 
this vote, the Board reviewed the total 
remuneration package of the CEO and 
made the decision to adjust downwards his 
remuneration. I would like to thank Murat 
Özgül for demonstrating his commitment 
to Genel by working with us on this matter 
and accepting a 20% decrease of his base 
salary from £625,000 to £500,000 from 
1 August 2017. In tandem, to retain sufficient 
alignment with the long-term performance 
of the Company, his 2017 PSP maximum 
potential award was increased from 150% 
to 200% of annual salary. This change was 
within the limits of our Policy. The Committee 
was satisfied that these adjustments brought 
CEO remuneration into line with comparable 
listed E&P companies and responded to the 
concerns of our shareholders.
With this adjustment, and continued scrutiny 
of all remuneration issues, the Committee’s 
intention is to continue to operate within the 
Policy for the three-year period following 
its approval. The Policy is set out on pages 
60 to 67. We believe that the remuneration 
structure set out in the current Policy 
remains clear, transparent, and simple and 
aligned with our strategic priorities while 
also promoting behaviours which are in 
the best interests of our shareholders. 
Remuneration for 2017
Full details of the Remuneration Committee’s 
decisions for 2017 are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on pages 52 to 59.
Overall, 2017 has been a good year for 
Genel. Operating cash flow was strong, the 
Receivable Settlement Agreement was a 
notable achievement as were the Gas Lifting 
Agreements and the revised Production 
Sharing Contracts for Miran and Bina Bawi. 
However, progress on the gas business in 
total was slower than we had targeted. 
The Committee considered the bonus 
framework for the year and decided that, 
given the importance of the delivery of 
the Company’s gas, financial, operational 
and safety and environment objectives, 
the individual performance element 
should be matched to the scorecard. 
Of the maximum potential annual 
bonus, 82.14% has been achieved.
Further details of the 2017 annual bonus 
performance objectives and how they were 
assessed can be found on pages 53 and 54.
The performance period for PSP awards 
granted in 2015 ended on 31 December 2017. 
These awards will lapse as Genel’s relative 
TSR ranking was below median of the 
peer group.

Approach to remuneration in 2018
Details of how we intend to apply our Policy 
over the coming year are set out on pages 
57 to 59. We continue to apply a responsible 
approach to executive remuneration and, 
therefore, the Committee has determined 
that Murat Özgül’s base salary will be 
increased for 2018 at a rate of 3%.
For 2018, the CEO’s annual bonus will continue 
to be based solely on the achievement 
against the Company scorecard metrics. 
The scorecard will include metrics based on 
financial performance (30%), operational 
performance (20%), Bina Bawi and Miran 
(20%), strategy execution (15%) and safety 
and environment performance (15%).
The Committee is committed to the current

Objective Progress
To implement the Remuneration Policy for the Chairman, 
CEO and broad framework for remuneration for members 
of the Executive Committee
Received shareholder approval for the Remuneration Policy 
at the 2017 AGM.
To review and have regard to remuneration practices across 
the Company
Considered remuneration practices across the Company including 
management recommendations for salary increases, bonus 
payments and share awards. 
In respect of performance related elements of the Remuneration 
Policy formulate suitable performance related criteria and monitor 
their operation
Completed a mid-year review of performance against bonus targets. 
Reviewed the 2015 PSP performance against relative TSR of 
a comparator group which resulted in no shares vesting under 
the award.
To review all aspects of any equity incentive plans operated or 
to be established by the Company
The Committee considered alternative approaches to the equity 
incentive plans. As a result of the review it was agreed to review 
the performance measures for the 2017 PSP award. Further details 
are set out on pages 54 and 55.
To have regard in the performance of its duties to any published 
guidelines or recommendations regarding the remuneration 
of directors of listed companies and formation and operation 
of share schemes
As part of its deliberations during the year, governance updates were 
received from both Deloitte and the Company Secretary to ensure 
that any decisions taken and recommendations made were done so 
in the context of the wider remuneration landscape whilst remaining 
appropriate for the specific challenges facing the Company.
To ensure that provisions regarding the disclosure of information, 
including pensions, as set out in The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
and the UK Corporate Governance Code, are fulfilled

long-term value creation through developing 
our oil assets, recovering monies owed for 
past sales and establishing the gas business. 
Therefore, PSP awards for 2018 will again 
be assessed 50% on relative TSR against 
our peer group, and 50% against absolute 
TSR targets. Details of the targets are set 
out on pages 58 and 59. The Committee 
considers that these targets are appropriately 
stretching and that maximum vesting would 
represent significant value creation.
The 2018 performance metrics, seen on 
page 58, reflect the focus of the Company 
and the CEO upon the high potential for 
value creation from our assess in Miran and 
Bina Bawi, as well as driving execution of the 
strategy throughout the year. The Company 
seeks to maintain positive progress through 
clear financial and operational targets, 
and continues to aim for the highest in safety 
and environment industry standards. 
2018 AGM
At the AGM in 2018, our shareholders 
will be asked to approve this annual report 
on remuneration and I encourage you to 
vote in favour. I will be available, along 
with my Committee members, to answer 
any questions regarding our Policy on 
executive remuneration and the activities 
of the Committee.

Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has again appointed Deloitte 
LLP (‘Deloitte’) to provide independent advice 
on remuneration matters under consideration 
by the Committee. The continued appointment 
of Deloitte was approved by the Committee 
as it was felt they had the most relevant 
experience and expertise to advise the 
Committee on remuneration related matters.
Deloitte is a leading remuneration 
adviser and a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and as such voluntarily 
operates under the code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting 
in the UK. Deloitte also provided support and 
advice to the Company including in respect of 
the operation of the Company’s share plans 
during the year. The Committee is satisfied 
that the advice they have received has been 
objective and independent. Deloitte’s fees 
in respect of advice to the Committee in the 
year under review were £44,200 and were 
charged on the basis of their standard terms 
of business for the advice provided.
The Remuneration Committee engaged 
independent advisors Spencer Stuart to 
facilitate an evaluation of the Committee’s 
effectiveness during 2017. The review 
concluded the Remuneration Committee was 
functioning effectively and was seen as taking 
a pragmatic approach in the interests of the 
business within the boundaries of a sensible 
framework for remuneration. The Committee 
Chairman reports comprehensively to the 
full Board and it is acknowledged that the 
Remuneration Committee is operating with 
an ever increasing level of transparency.
The Committee also consulted during the 
year with the Chairman (Stephen Whyte and 
formerly Tony Hayward), CEO (Murat Özgül), 
the Company Secretary (Stephen Mitchell and 
formerly Sarah Robertson) and the Head of 
Human Resources (Gozde Tutanc). 
No member of the Committee nor any party 
from whom advice was sought participated 
in discussions regarding their own 
remuneration.

Benefits
In line with the Committee’s aim to provide a simple, transparent package, the CEO receives a cash supplement of 25% of base salary in lieu 
of all benefits, including pension, private health insurance, life assurance and company car provision. The cash supplement is not used in the 
calculation of bonus and long-term incentive quantum. In the event that the CEO participates in the Mandatory Pension Plan offered by the 
Company the cash supplement will be reduced by the amount contributed by the Company into the Mandatory Pension Plan.
Annual bonus
The 2017 annual bonus scorecard was approved based on the Company’s performance against key business objectives with a weighting of 70% 
against Company metrics and 30% against individual performance. These included progress against the gas project (20%), financial targets 
(20%), operational targets (15%) and health and safety performance (15%).
Genel delivered strong performance against financial and health and safety performance targets. A successful bond buyback in April was 
followed by the execution of the landmark Receivable Settlement Agreement in August and successful refinancing completed in December 2017. 
These, together combined with regular payments, materially reduced the net debt of the Company and resulted in significant free cash flow after 
interest, providing a robust financial foundation for 2018. However, the strong start to the year for the Company’s performance against the gas 
target was impacted by the political developments after September 2017 in the KRI, ultimately slowing progress in the last quarter of the year. 
Further details are set out below.

The Committee discussed the significant, positive impact of the achievement of the Receivable Settlement Agreement and the strong financial 
position of the Company. Given the close alignment of targets, it was considered appropriate to match the successful outcome of the Company 
targets to that of Mr Özgül’s personal performance. Consequentially, Murat Özgül’s overall 2017 bonus outcome was £706,000, being 82.14%

by the political developments in the KRI after September.
The upstream GLAs Condition Precedents (CPs) have been accomplished 
as the Competent Persons Report (CPR) by RPS and Field Development 
Plan (FDP) by Baker Hughes for Miran and Bina Bawi were both

Performance share plan awards made in 2017
PSP awards are granted in the form of a nil-cost conditional share award over shares in the Company with the number of conditional awards 
granted determined by reference to a percentage of base salary. 
As disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, the Committee decided that, while the relative TSR is an important measure of long-term performance, 
the current focus of the Company is on absolute long-term value creation through maximising the generation of free cash from existing oil 
assets, crystallising value from Bina Bawi and Miran, and creating shareholder value through prudent additions to the portfolio. Therefore, 
2017 PSP awards were granted based on 50% relative TSR against our peer group, and 50% against absolute TSR targets. The sectoral 
peer group for the 2017 PSP awards was reviewed in the year to ensure that it remained appropriate.

 — Salary levels for similar roles within the industry
 — Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee has decided to increase Murat Özgül’s base salary by 3% with effect from 1 January 2018. The table below shows the base salary 
for 2018.

The target bonus for Murat Özgül for 2018 remains at 100% of base salary, with a maximum bonus of 150% of base salary. For 2018, the 
performance of the Executive Director will be measured 100% against Company metrics.
In 2018, 50% of the bonus performance measures will relate to operational and financial performance. 20% will relate to Miran and Bina Bawi 
value creation, and 15% will relate to maintaining the focus on high performance in safety and environment. Strategy execution represents 
a new performance area and will represent 15% of the bonus, highlighting the importance of the growth strategy for the Company.

Performance share plan
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost conditional share award over shares in the Company with the number of awards granted normally 
determined by reference to a percentage of base salary.
The Committee reviewed the most appropriate measure to create maximum alignment with shareholders and encourage long-term value 
creation. PSP performance will continue to be measured based on 50% relative TSR and 50% absolute TSR. 
The 2018 award for the CEO will continue to be based on a face value of 200% of base salary at the time of the award.
The Committee has reviewed the existing TSR peer group and accordingly the peer group for the measurement of the relative TSR element 
of the 2018 award will remain as:
BP Ophir Energy
Cairn Energy Premier Oil
DNO Royal Dutch Shell
Enquest Seplat Petroleum
Gulf Keystone SOCO International
Nostrum Oil & Gas Tullow Oil
The relative TSR vesting schedule will remain the same as for awards made in 2017, as outlined on page 54.

The Committee is comfortable that these targets are appropriately stretching. The thresholds targets have been reviewed and updated after 
consideration of financial developments in 2017. The threshold target is set in line with Genel’s cost of capital to ensure that this element vests 
only when shareholders make a return.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration
The fee level for the Chairman has been increased to reflect external market conditions and support the Company’s ability to attract and retain 
the best candidate. 
Non-Executive Director fees for 2018 were reviewed against benchmark data for companies with a similar market cap, and also against 
comparable E&P companies. The fees remain unchanged for 2018.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
As already seen from the actions taken 
after the 2017 AGM, the Committee will 
keep the Policy under review to ensure 
that it continues to promote the attraction, 
retention and motivation of the high-
performing executive talent required to 
deliver the business strategy. It is the 
Committee’s intention that the Policy 
be put to shareholders for approval every 
three years. Should any changes be 
required before the end of the three-year 
period, the amended Policy will be put 
to shareholders, following shareholder 
consultation as appropriate.
This part of the report sets out a summary 
of the Directors’ remuneration policy as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee 
(“the Committee”) and approved by 
shareholders at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. A copy of the shareholder approved 
Policy is available at www.genelenergy.com 
in the Investors Relations section.  ANNUALREPORT2017

The Company is incorporated in Jersey rather than the UK. Accordingly, the Company does not have the benefit of the statutory protections 
afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006 in the event that there were to be any inconsistency between this Policy and any contractual 
entitlement or other rights of a Director. Therefore, in the event that there were to be any payment which was inconsistent with this Policy, the 
Company would not have the statutory right, under section 226E of the UK Companies Act 2006 to recover such payments from its Directors.

Notes to the policy table
The Committee reserves the right to make 
any remuneration payments and/or payments 
for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions available to it in connection 
with such payments) notwithstanding that 
they are not in line with the Policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment 
were agreed (i) before the 2014 AGM (the 
date the Company’s first shareholder-
approved directors’ remuneration policy 
came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set 
out above came into effect, provided that 
the terms of the payment were consistent 
with the shareholder-approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in force at the time 
they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a Director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of 
the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a 
Director of the Company. For these purposes 
‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in 
relation to an award over shares, the terms 
of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time 
the award is granted. 
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures 
are designed to provide an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive 
Directors to meet financial targets for the 
year and to deliver a combination of specific 
strategic, operational and personal goals. 
This balance allows the Committee to review 
the Company’s performance in the round 
against the key elements of our strategy 
and appropriately incentivise and reward 
Executive Directors.
Bonus targets are set by the Committee each 
year to ensure that Executive Directors are 
focused on the key objectives for the next 
twelve months. In doing so, the Committee 
takes into account a number of internal 
and external reference points, including 
the Company’s business plan.
PSP
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to 
provide long-term sustainable returns 
to shareholders. The Committee currently 
considers that a mix of absolute and relative 
TSR is the most appropriate measure to 
assess the underlying financial performance 
of the business while creating maximum 
alignment with shareholders and encouraging 
long-term value creation.
Malus provisions
Under the PSP and RSP, prior to vesting, 
the Committee may cancel or reduce the 
number of shares awarded or impose 
additional conditions on an award in 
circumstances where the Committee 
considers it to be appropriate. Such 
circumstances may include a material 
misstatement of the Company’s audited 
financial results, a material breach of health 
and safety regulations, a material failure of 
risk management or serious reputational 
damage to the Company.
The Committee has considered malus 
provisions in the context of the annual bonus 
and is satisfied that malus is appropriately 
taken into account at the time the Committee 
approves a bonus payment.
Clawback provisions
Clawback provisions apply to the annual 
bonus, PSP and RSP awards where it is 
considered appropriate. Such circumstances 
may include a material misstatement of the 
Company’s audited results, misconduct of the 
individual and any error in the calculation of 
any performance condition. Clawback may 
be applied up to one year after payment for 
bonus awards and two years after vesting 
for PSP and RSP awards. 
Plan rules
The PSP and RSP shall be operated in 
accordance with the rules of the plans as 
approved by shareholders and amended from 
time to time in accordance with those rules. 
In particular:
 — The plan rules provide for adjustments 
in certain circumstances, for example, 
awards may be adjusted in the event of 
variation of the Company’s share capital, 
demerger, special dividend, re-organisation 
or similar event
 — In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, existing share awards will vest 
in line with the plan rules to the extent the 
Committee determines, taking into account 
the extent to which any performance 
conditions (where applicable) have been 
satisfied and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, the time elapsed 
since that time. The Committee may, in 
the event of a winding-up of the Company, 
demerger, delisting, special dividend or 
other event which the Committee considers 
may affect the price of shares, allow awards 
to vest on the same basis
 — The performance conditions may be 
replaced or varied if an event occurs or 
circumstances arise which cause the 
Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, 
to determine that a substituted or 
amended performance condition would 
be more appropriate (taking into account 
the interests of the shareholders of the 
Company) provided that the amended 
performance condition would not be 
materially less difficult to satisfy
 — The Committee may elect, prior to vesting 
or exercise in the case of options, to deliver 
the value of vested awards as cash
Remuneration arrangements throughout 
the Company
The Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors is designed in line with the 
remuneration principles that underpin 
remuneration across the Company. When 
making decisions in respect of Executive 
Director remuneration arrangements, the 
Committee takes into consideration the pay 
and conditions for employees throughout 
the Company, including the local inflationary 
impact for the countries in which we 
operate. As stated in the policy table, salary 
increases are normally made with reference 
to the average increase for the wider 
employee population.
The Company places a significant focus 
on variable remuneration, ensuring that 
a meaningful proportion of remuneration 
across all employees is based on 
performance, through its operation of the 
annual bonus plan throughout the Company 
and participation in share incentive plans.
Genel is committed to strengthening and 
widening employee share ownership by the 
use of share incentives granted under our 
share plans. As a result approximately 90% 
of employees participate in our share plans.
The Committee does not directly consult 
with our employees as part of the process 
of determining executive pay. However, 
there is wide employee participation 
in our share plans. GENEL ENERGY

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration for new 
appointments to the Board, the Committee 
will consider all relevant factors including, 
but not limited to, the calibre of the individual 
and their existing package, the external 
market and the existing arrangements for 
the Company’s current Executive Directors, 
with a view that any arrangements offered 
are in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders and without paying any more 
than is necessary.
Where the new appointment is replacing 
a previous Executive Director, salaries and 
total remuneration opportunity may be 
higher or lower than the previous incumbent. 
If the appointee is expected to develop 
into the role, the Committee may decide to 
appoint the new Executive Director to the 
Board at a lower than typical salary. Larger 
increases (above those of the wider employee 
population) may be awarded over a period of 
time to move closer to market level as their 
experience develops.
Benefits will normally be limited to those 
outlined in the remuneration policy table 
above. However, additional benefits may 
be provided by the Company where the 
Committee considers it reasonable and 
necessary to do so. Such circumstances 
may include where an Executive Director 
is required to relocate in order to fulfil their 
duties. In such cases, a cash payment higher 
than the 25% of salary that is ordinarily 
paid would normally be provided under the 
Company’s standard expatriate policy in lieu 
of certain benefits, which may include the 
provision of a housing allowance, education 
support, health insurance, tax advice, 
a relocation or repatriation allowance 
and a home leave allowance.
It is expected that the structure and 
quantum of the variable pay elements 
would reflect those set out in the policy 
table above. However, the Committee 
recognises that, as an independent oil and 
gas company, it is competing with global 
firms for its talent. As a result, the Committee 
considers it important that the recruitment 
policy has sufficient flexibility in order to 
attract the calibre of individual that the 
Company requires.
Therefore:
 — Under the annual bonus, the Committee 
reserves the right to provide either a one-
off or ongoing maximum bonus opportunity 
of up to 200% of salary if this is required 
to secure an external appointment
 — The Committee would also retain the 
discretion to flex the balance between 
annual and long-term incentives and the 
measures used to assess performance 
for these elements, whilst maintaining 
the intention that a significant portion of 
variable pay would be delivered in shares
 — Variable pay could, in exceptional 
circumstances, be delivered via alternative 
structures, again with the intention that 
a significant portion would be share-
based, but in all circumstances subject to 
an ongoing over-riding cap of 600% of 
salary. This cap excludes any awards made 
to compensate the Director for incentive 
awards or any other remuneration 
arrangements forfeited from their previous 
employer (see below)
The above flexibility will only be used if the 
Committee believes such action is absolutely 
necessary to recruit and motivate a candidate 
from the global market. The Committee 
commits to explain to shareholders the 
rationale for the relevant arrangements 
following any appointment.
Where an Executive Director is appointed 
from within the Group, the normal 
policy of the Company is that any legacy 
arrangements would be honoured in line with 
the original terms and conditions. Similarly, if 
an Executive Director is appointed following 
an acquisition of or merger with another 
company, legacy terms and conditions 
would be honoured.
The Committee retains the discretion to make 
appropriate remuneration decisions outside 
the standard policy to meet the individual 
circumstances of the recruitment, when 
an interim appointment to fill an Executive 
Director role is made on a short-term basis 
or a Non-Executive Director or the Chairman 
takes on an executive function on a short-
term basis.
Buy outs
In order to facilitate recruitment, the 
Committee may make a one-off award to 
‘buy out’ incentive awards and any other 
compensation arrangements that a new hire 
has had to forfeit on leaving their previous 
employer. In doing so, the Committee 
will take into account all relevant factors 
including any performance conditions 
attached to the forfeited awards, the 
likelihood of those conditions being met, 
the proportion of the vesting/performance 
period remaining and the form of the award 
(e.g. cash or shares). Where possible, the 
forfeited awards will normally be bought 
out on an estimated like-for-like basis.
The Committee is at all times conscious of 
the need to pay no more than is necessary, 
particularly when determining any possible 
buy-out arrangements. GENEL ENERGY

Recruitment of Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and/or Non-Executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with 
those detailed in the relevant table above. 
Executive Director service contracts
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current Executive Director, as stipulated in his service contract, is set out below. 
Element Policy
Notice period — 12 months’ notice by either the Company or the Executive Director. This is also the policy for new recruits
Termination payment — It is the Company’s policy for new service contracts that it may terminate employment by making a payment 
in lieu of notice (‘PILON’) equivalent to (i) 12 months’ base salary and (ii) the Executive Director’s annual 
benefit allowance
 — Upon termination by the Company, an Executive Director has a duty to mitigate, and use reasonable 
endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. In Murat Özgül’s service 
contract, there are specific provisions requiring a reduction in any phased PILON payments in the event 
that he finds alternative employment
Remuneration and 
benefits
 — Participation in all incentive schemes, including the annual bonus and the PSP, is non-contractual
 — Outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules
The service contract of an Executive Director may also be terminated immediately and with no liability to make payment in certain circumstances, 
such as the Executive Director bringing the Group into disrepute or committing a fundamental breach of their employment obligations.
Unless otherwise approved, an Executive Director may accept only one position as a Non-Executive Director (but not as a Non-Executive 
Chairman) of a FTSE 100 company that is not a competitor of the Company, subject to prior notification to the Chairman of the Company 
and the approval of the Board or duly authorised Committee thereof.
Policy on payment for loss of office
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with 
the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Company considers a variety of factors when considering leaving arrangements for an Executive Director, including individual and business 
performance, the obligation for the Director to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new employment) and other relevant circumstances (e.g. 
ill health). The Committee may make other payments in connection with a Director’s cessation of office or employment where the payments are 
made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement 
of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of a Director’s office or employment. Any such payments may include but are not limited 
to paying any fees for outplacement assistance and/or the Director’s legal and/or professional advice fees in connection with his cessation 
of office or employment.
If the Executive Director’s employment is terminated by the Company, the Executive Director may receive a time pro-rated bonus, 
subject to Remuneration Committee discretion.

Termination — The appointment of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is terminable by either the Company 
or the Director by giving three months’ notice
 — The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation upon leaving office
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder views when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy and we commit 
to consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to our Remuneration Policy.
It is the Committee’s policy to correspond with shareholders that have engaged on remuneration matters during the year, which it has done

or articles of association. Accordingly, the 
memorandum of association of a Jersey 
company does not contain an objects clause.
Certain provisions have been incorporated 
into the articles of association to enshrine 
rights that are not conferred by the Jersey 
Companies Law, but which the Company 
believes shareholders would expect to 
see in a company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange.
Provisions in the articles of association also 
require shareholders to make disclosures 
pursuant to chapter 5 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, and require the Directors 
to comply with chapter 3 of the Disclosure

Shareholder agreements
Merger Agreement
On 7 September 2011, the Company, 
Elysion Energy Holding B.V. (formerly Genel 
Energy Holdings B.V.), Focus Investments 
and PRM entered into a merger agreement 
(the ‘Merger Agreement’) pursuant to which 
the Company agreed to purchase, and the 
Sellers agreed to sell, the entire issued 
ordinary share capital of Genel Energy 
International Limited in consideration for 
the issue of 130,632,522 ordinary shares 
(the ‘Consideration Shares’). The Merger 
Agreement was amended by a deed of 
amendment entered into on 29 October 2011.
Relationship Agreement
On 7 September 2011, the Company, 
Elysion and Focus Investments entered into 
a relationship agreement which regulates 
the ongoing relationship between Elysion, 
Focus Investments and the Company 
(the ‘Relationship Agreement’). 
On 14 October 2015 Mehmet Sepil retired as 
President and on 18 November 2015 Mehmet 
Sepil’s holding in the Company fell to below 
10% of the voting rights in the Company. 
Accordingly, certain rights of Elysion under 
the Relationship Agreement ceased to 
have effect including the right to nominate 
a representative to the Genel Board. 
The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Company is 
capable at all times of carrying on its business 
independently of Focus Investments (and 
their Associates) and that all transactions 
and relationships between the Company 
and Focus Investments are at arm’s length 
and on a normal commercial basis. For the 
purposes of the Relationship Agreement, the 
term ‘Associate’ includes, in the case of Focus 
Investments, Mehmet Emin Karamehmet.
On 12 February 2015 the Relationship 
Agreement was amended to reflect changes 
to the Listing Rules that apply to controlling 
shareholders. Whilst the Relationship 
Agreement reflected the majority of the 
requirements we felt it prudent to amend 
it to align it to the specific obligations 
under Listing Rule 6.1.4(d).
The Relationship Agreement will terminate 
upon the earlier of (i) the Company 
ceasing to have any of its ordinary shares 
listed on the Official List and admitted to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange’s 
main market for listed securities, and (ii) 
Elysion and Focus Investments together 
with their respective Associates ceasing 
between them to be entitled to exercise, 
or control the exercise of, in aggregate 
10% or more of the Voting Rights.
Pursuant to the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement, it has been agreed that, 
among other things:
a) For so long as Focus Investments and 
its respective Associates are entitled 
to exercise or control the exercise of, 
in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting 
Rights, Focus Investments will, and will 
procure so far as it is reasonably able to 
do so, that each of its Associates will:
i. not take any action which precludes 
or inhibits any member of the 
Group from carrying on its business 
independently of Focus Investments 
and its respective Associates;
ii. not exercise any of its Voting Rights to 
procure any amendment to the articles 
of association of the Company which 
would be inconsistent with or breach 
any provision of the Relationship 
Agreement;
iii. if and for so long as paragraph 
11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules applies 
to the Company, abstain from voting on 
any resolution required by paragraph 
11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules to 
approve a ‘related party transaction’ 
(as defined in paragraph 11.1.5R of 
the Listing Rules) involving Focus 
Investments or any of its Associates 
as the related party;
iv. comply with all provisions of the Listing 
Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, the requirements of the London 
Stock Exchange and the FSMA 
that apply to it in connection with 
the Company;
v. ensure that the business and affairs 
of the Company are conducted 
in accordance with its articles of 
association; and 
vi. exercise all of its Voting Rights in a 
manner consistent with the intention 
that at all times at least half of the 
Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
are Independent Non-Executives and 
that certain committees of the Board 
shall comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code;
b) For so long as Focus Investments and its 
respective Associates are, between them, 
entitled to exercise or control the exercise 
of, in aggregate, 10% or more of the 
Voting Rights, Focus Investments will, and 
will procure that each of its Associates will:
i. conduct all transactions and 
arrangements with any member of the 
Group on arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms;
ii. not take any action that would have the 
effect of preventing the Company from 
complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and
iii. not propose or procure the proposal 
of a shareholder resolution which is 
intended or appears to be intended 
to circumvent the proper application 
of the Listing Rules;
c) Provided that Focus Investments and 
its Associates are entitled to exercise or 
control the exercise of 10% or more of the 
Voting Rights, Focus Investments shall be 
entitled to nominate for appointment to 
the Board one Director by giving notice 
to the Company; and
d) For so long as Focus Investments together 
with their its Associates are entitled to 
exercise or to control the exercise of, 
in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting 
Rights, subject to compliance by the 
Company with its legal and regulatory 
obligations, the Company shall procure 
that Focus Investments is provided with  GENEL ENERGY

financial and other information as is 
necessary or reasonably required by 
them for the purposes of their accounting

The rights described at (b)–(d) above 
will terminate and cease to be of any 
effect in the event that Focus Investments 
(or any Affiliate (as defined in the Merger 
Agreement) of Focus Investments that holds 
any ordinary shares) ceases to be controlled

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GENEL ENERGY PLC
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, Genel Energy plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2017, the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended, the 
consolidated cash flow statement; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overview
 — Overall group materiality: $20 million (2016: $22 million), based on 1% of total assets.
Materiality
Group
scoping
Key audit 
matters
 — We identified two significant components out of the group’s 22 reporting entities. 
Specific financial statement line items were in scope for an additional nine entities.
 — Overall, our scoping strategy resulted in a minimum of 80% of each financial statement 
line item being in scope for testing.
 — Accounting for the Receivable Settlement Agreement (‘RSA’) with the Kurdistan Regional 
Government (‘KRG’), and the resulting fair value assessment.
 — Impairment reviews of oil producing assets.
 — Impairment review of gas evaluation and other exploration assets.
Context:
The context for our audit is set by Genel’s major activities in 2017, including the execution of the Receivable Settlement Agreement (‘RSA’), 
together with the steadily improved world oil prices. The group’s cash flow generating assets continue to be its interests in the Tawke and Taq 
Taq producing oil fields in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (‘KRI’). In 2017, oil production was below the prior year CPR 2P forecasts on both oil fields 
which led to impairment reviews of both assets. Conversely, there were positive developments in relation to the Peshkabir field of the Tawke 
Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’), and the group’s Bina Bawi and Miran PSCs, with a large resource upgrade announced on the gas fields 
along with an upgrade to Bina Bawi oil resources. The group also obtained a 12 month extension to February 2019 for meeting the conditions 
precedent in the Miran and Bina Bawi gas lifting agreements, and the remedy period now extends to February 2020. The other notable 
event for 2017 was the buy-back of bonds with nominal value of $252.8 million in March 2017, and subsequent refinancing of the remaining 
bonds in December 2017 which reduced total outstanding principal from $421.8 million to $300 million and extended the final maturity 
of the bonds to December 2022.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole.  ANNUALREPORT2017
73 
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality $20 million (2016: $22 million).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We considered whether this measure continues to be appropriate 
and in concluding that it is, we considered the activities of the 
group and also materiality levels used by auditors of other similar 
upstream oil and gas companies. As a significant proportion of the 
group’s net assets is represented by exploration assets, we believe 
an asset measure is the most relevant.
Consistent with prior years, we used a lower specific materiality 
for certain income statement financial statement line items. In 2017, 
we used 5% of EBITDAX (excluding gain on the RSA) ($6 million) 
(2016: $7 million) for revenue, production costs, gain on bond 
buy back, finance income and expenses, and general and 
administrative costs.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range 
of balance sheet materiality allocated across components was between $14 million and $19 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $1 million (2016: $1.1 million) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates.
The group is structured along three reporting segments being the type of assets it operates: Oil producing assets, Miran and Bina Bawi assets 
and Exploration assets. The group financial statements are a consolidation comprising the group’s operating businesses in these reporting 
segments as well as centralised functions. While the group’s key assets are almost entirely based in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, accounting 
functions are largely performed in the company’s office in Ankara.
Our group scoping was based on total assets, consistent with our approach to materiality, and identified two financially significant components 
comprising a high proportion of total group assets, which required an audit of their complete financial information. These two significant 
components are (a) the main trading entity for the Kurdistan oil producing assets, Taq Taq and Tawke and (b) the entity that holds the Miran 
and Bina Bawi assets.
We also performed specific procedures on certain financial statement line items within nine other components in the group including: operating 
expenses, finance expenses and income, gain on the bond buy back, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Overall, our scoping strategy resulted in a minimum of 80% of each financial statement line item being in scope for testing. The PwC UK 
engagement team performed all of the audit work, both in the UK and at the group’s operations in Ankara.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. GENEL ENERGY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for the Receivables Settlement Agreement (“RSA”) 
and the fair value assessment
Refer to Note 10 for further information.
As a result of entering into the RSA, the group has written off the 
existing overdue receivable balance from the KRG. In exchange 
for waiving the right to receive the overdue receivable, the group 
obtained, inter alia, a 4.5% royalty on gross Tawke field revenues (the 
“ORRI”) for a period of five years and a waiver from paying capacity 
building payments (“CBPs) to the KRG from the group’s share of profit 
oil under the Tawke PSC. The future economic benefits arising from 
these contractual rights were recognised as intangible assets. 
As a result of the derecognition of the overdue receivable and 
recognition of new intangible assets, a net gain of $293.8m has been 
recorded in the income statement as “Net gain arising from the RSA”.
There is a material judgment associated with the accounting for the 
RSA under IFRS, including the classification of the contractual rights 
as intangible assets. 
There is also material judgment involved in determining the 
cost of the intangible assets recognised on the balance sheet, 
which were acquired for non-cash consideration. 
Management determined that the cost of the assets approximates 
the fair value of the overdue receivable waived, and the most reliable 
determinant of the fair value of the receivable waived is the fair 
value of assets received in exchange, since the RSA was entered into 
on arm’s length terms between two market participants. 
The calculation of fair value of the ORRI and the CBP waiver is 
based on a discounted cash flow analysis which includes a number 
of forward looking assumptions including production volumes, oil 
price and capital expenditures. There is also judgment in determining 
an appropriate discount rate. There is a risk that these inputs, 
assumptions and estimates are inaccurate and that the interpretations 
and calculations made are not appropriate.
Change in level of risk: New risk
We reviewed the RSA and associated amendments to the PSC 
in considering the appropriate classification of the ORRI and 
CBP waiver under IFRS. 
We concur that the overdue KRG receivable should be derecognised 
from the group balance sheet in accordance with IAS 39 as the rights 
to the cash flows have expired. 
We also concur that intangible assets is the most appropriate 
classification given the nature of the RSA which grants the company 
contractual rights to future economic benefits that meet the criteria 
under IAS 38 for separate recognition, and that the measurement 
basis is in line with IAS 38. 
We have reviewed management’s valuation models which support the 
initial recognition of the ORRI and CBP waiver assets, including testing 
the models for mathematical accuracy. 
We also tested the key inputs and assumptions included in the models 
as follows:
 — Reserves and production profile – The reserves and production 
profile for the Tawke field which underpinned the valuation as at 
1 August 2017 were compared to the Competent Person’s Report 
(‘CPR’) for Tawke prepared as of 28 February 2017, the forecasts 
available as at 30 June 2017, and the five year plan submitted to the 
Board of Directors. We also discussed the key technical assumptions 
with management. There were no matters arising from this work.
 — Expenditure – we compared management’s forecasts for capital 
and operating expenditure for Tawke to the CPRs and to approved 
budgets. We also performed reasonableness tests against historic 
incurred costs. 
 — Oil prices – Management’s oil price forecast was compared to 
consensus forecasts obtained from a collection of brokers and 
independent consultants as at 30 June 2017. We found that 
management’s assumptions were within the range of forecasts 
albeit at the higher end of the range of brokers in the period beyond 
2019. Netback adjustments to the oil prices made by management 
were agreed to those currently included in invoices issued to 
the KRG. 
 — Discount rate – We obtained an independent view of an appropriate 
discount rate range from PwC’s valuation experts. Management’s 
discount rate was within this range.
We also reviewed the presentation and disclosure of the net gain 
arising from the RSA and concluded this is in line with IFRS.

Impairment reviews of oil producing assets
Refer to Note 9 for further information.
In 2017, the performance of the group’s Taq Taq and Tawke assets 
were below the prior year CPR 2P forecast, which is an indicator of 
impairment because this profile was used for assessing recoverable 
amount at the end of the prior year. 
As a result, management performed an impairment assessment of 
each of its producing assets as at 31 December 2017. The outcome 
of this assessment was an impairment charge of $58m recorded on 
the Taq Taq Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’). There was no impairment 
of Tawke. 
We focused on this area due to the judgment involved in impairment 
assessments, with the recoverable amount of the Taq Taq and Tawke 
CGU’s dependant on a number of forward looking assumptions.
Change in level of risk: No change
We considered management’s evaluation of its producing assets 
in Kurdistan and agree that impairment triggers exist.
The recoverable amounts for Taq Taq and Tawke have been estimated 
on a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) basis using a discounted 
cash flow. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment 
models provided by management, and checked that the valuation 
approach was in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. We 
tested the key inputs and assumptions used in the models as follows:
 — Reserves and production profile – for both producing assets, we 
compared management’s internal reserves and production forecasts 
used to the production profiles included in the most recent Competent 
Person’s Reports (CPRs) issued in early 2018. In addition, we discussed 
the key assumptions with management and management’s experts 
who produced the Taq Taq CPR’s; we attended the year-end meeting of 
the Reserves Committee; we read minutes of the Asset Management 
and Operating Committees and inspected approved budgets. There 
were no issues arising from this work.
 — Expenditure – management’s internal forecasts for capital and 
operating expenditure for Taq Taq and Tawke have been compared 
to the CPRs, and to approved budgets. We have also performed 
reasonableness tests against historic incurred costs. There were 
no issues arising from this work. 
 — Oil prices – we compared short and long term price assumptions 
used by management to the consensus prices from a sample of 
brokers and independent consultants as at 31 December 2017. 
We found that management’s assumptions up to 2020 are close to 
average, but in the medium to long term move towards the higher 
end of the brokers’ range. Netback adjustments to the oil prices 
made by management were agreed to those currently included 
in invoices issued to the KRG.
 — Discount rate – We obtained an independent view of an appropriate 
discount rate range from PwC’s valuation experts. Management’s 
discount rate was within this range.
We concur with the impairment charge recorded on Taq Taq and 
consider management’s disclosure of impairment testing included 
in note 9 are appropriate.
Review of Miran and Bina Bawi assets
Refer to Note 8 for further information.
At the year end, the carrying value of Miran and Bina Bawi assets 
is $858m. As required by IFRS 6 – Exploration for and evaluation of 
mineral resources (‘IFRS 6’) the Group has performed an assessment 
for impairment indicators as at the year end for Miran and Bina Bawi 
and concluded that there are no triggers for impairment. 
Management carried out this assessment at a segment level, as 
allowed by IFRS 6 due to the current commercial linkages between the 
two assets. This is an area of focus due to the prior year impairments 
recorded on these assets, and the continuing gap between the group’s 
net asset value and its market capitalisation, which may be considered 
an indicator of impairment in isolation. 
Change in level of risk: Decreased this year due to positive 
developments on Miran and Bina Bawi assets.
For the Miran and Bina Bawi assets we reviewed management’s 
assessment of impairment indicators. In assessing management’s review 
of impairment indicators we performed the following procedures:
 — Considered events in 2017, including the extension to the deadline 
for meeting conditions precedent in the gas lifting agreements and 
the increase in the company’s market capitalisation following the 
Miran and Bina Bawi gas resource upgrade announcement; 
 — Reviewed the updated CPR and met with the competent person to 
understand the key assumptions and uncertainties in their report; 
 — Discussed with management their current views on the likely 
development of the assets, and reviewed changes to management’s 
Miran and Bina Bawi valuation models compared to the prior year 
and considered whether these reflected our understanding of 
events occurring in 2017.
We did not identify any impairment triggers arising from this work 
which would have resulted in the requirement for a full impairment 
assessment of Miran Bina Bawi.
We also considered management’s approach of carrying out the 
review at a segment rather than an asset (CGU) level and concluded 
that this is appropriate at this stage of the assets’ development, given 
no definitive field development plan has been submitted and based on 
the nature of the agreements and negotiations relating to the assets. GENEL ENERGY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the directors considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to 
Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form 
of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain 
opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the group
As a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), we are required 
to report to you if we have anything material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 — The directors’ confirmation on page 27 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
 — The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
 — The directors’ explanation on page 31 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.
Other Code Provisions
As a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the Code, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — The statement given by the directors, on page 42, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group obtained in the course of performing our audit.
 — The section of the Annual Report on page 42 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.
Opinion on additional disclosures
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report and Governance
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the ‘Directors’ Report and Governance’ for the financial year for which the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Genel Energy Plc (the Company) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (together “IFRS”); 
are prepared under the historical cost convention except as where stated; and comply with Company (Jersey) Law 1991. The significant 
accounting policies are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the period.
Items included in the financial information of each of the Company‘s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars 
to the nearest million ($m) rounded to one decimal place, except where otherwise indicated. 
For explanation of the key judgements and estimates made by the Company in applying the Company’s accounting policies, refer to significant 
accounting estimates and judgement on pages 20 and 22.
The Company provides non-Gaap measures to provide greater understanding of its financial performance and financial position. EBITDAX is 
presented in order for the users of the financial statements to understand the cash profitability of the Company, which excludes the impact of 
costs attributable to exploration activity, which tend to be one-off in nature, and the non-cash costs relating to depreciation, amortisation and 
impairments. Free cash flow is presented in order to show the free cash flow generated that is available for the Board to invest in the business. 
Net debt is reported in order for users of the financial statements to understand how much debt remains unpaid if the Company paid its debt 
obligations from its available cash. There have been no changes in related parties since last year-end and there are not significant seasonal 
or cyclical variations in the Company’s total revenues.
Going concern
At the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 12 months from the balance sheet date and therefore its consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the relevant entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions or at the balance sheet date where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income or finance costs.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the Company and its subsidiaries. These accounting policies have been adopted by 
all companies. 
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries 
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between companies are eliminated. 
Joint arrangements
Arrangements under which the Company has contractually agreed to share control with another party, or parties, are joint ventures where 
the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, or joint operations where the parties have rights to the assets and obligations 
for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Investments in entities over which the Company has the right to exercise significant influence 
but has neither control nor joint control are classified as associates and accounted for under the equity method. 
The Company recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held jointly and liabilities 
incurred jointly with other partners. 
Acquisitions
The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Company recognises any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value at time of recognition or at the non-controlling interest‘s proportionate share of net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Farm-in/farm-out 
Farm-out transactions relate to the relinquishment of an interest in oil and gas assets in return for services rendered by a third party or where 
a third party agrees to pay a portion of the Company’s share of the development costs (cost carry). Farm-in transactions relate to the acquisition 
by the Company of an interest in oil and gas assets in return for services rendered or cost-carry provided by the Company.
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the development or production phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for as an acquisition 
or disposal of oil and gas assets. The consideration given is measured as the fair value of the services rendered or cost-carry provided and any 
gain or loss arising on the farm-in/farm-out is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. A profit is recognised for any consideration 
received in the form of cash to the extent that the cash receipt exceeds the carrying value of the associated asset.
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the exploration phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for on a no gain/no loss basis 
due to inherent uncertainties in the exploration phase and associated difficulties in determining fair values reliably prior to the determination 
of commercially recoverable proved reserves. The resulting exploration and evaluation asset is then assessed for impairment indicators 
under IFRS6.
1.2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make judgements and assumptions that affect 
the reported results, assets and liabilities. Where judgements and estimates are made, there is a risk that the actual outcome could differ 
from the judgement or estimate made. The Company has assessed the following as being areas where changes in judgements, estimates 
or assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Estimation of future oil price
The estimation of future oil price has a significant impact throughout the financial statements, primarily in relation to the estimation of the 
recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and the gain arising from the RSA. It is also relevant to the assessment 
of going concern and the viability statement. 
The Company’s forecast of average Brent oil price for future years is based on a range of publicly available market estimates and is summarised 
in the table below, with the 2022 price then inflated at 2% per annum.
$/bbl 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
Forecast 65 63 66 72 74
Prior year forecast 60 68 72 76 78
Estimation of hydrocarbon reserves and resources and associated production profiles
Estimates of hydrocarbon reserves and resources are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject to future 
revision. The Company’s estimation of the quantum of oil and gas reserves and resources and the timing of its production and monetisation 
impact the Company’s financial statements in a number of ways, including: testing recoverable values for impairment; the calculation of 
depreciation and amortisation; assessing the cost and likely timing of decommissioning activity and associated costs and, in the current year, 
estimating the values of the intangible assets arising from the RSA. This estimation also impacts the assessment of going concern and the 
viability statement.
Proven and probable reserves are estimates of the amount of hydrocarbons that can be economically extracted from the Company’s assets. The 
Company estimates its reserves using standard recognised evaluation techniques. Generally, the Company considers proven and probable reserves 
to be the best estimate for future production and quantity of oil within an asset when assessing its recoverable amount, and therefore usually 
forms the basis of calculating depreciation and amortisation of oil and gas assets and testing for impairment. Assets assessed as 2P are generally 
classified as property, plant and equipment as development or producing assets and depreciated using the units of production methodology.
Hydrocarbons that are not assessed as 2P are considered to be resources and are classified as exploration and evaluation assets. These 
assets are expenditures incurred before technical feasibility and commercial viability is demonstrable. Estimates of resources for undeveloped 
or partially developed fields are subject to greater uncertainty over their future life than estimates of reserves for fields that are substantially 
developed and being depleted and are likely to contain estimates and judgements with a wide range of possibilities. These assets are considered 
for impairment under IFRS6.
Once a field commences production, the amount of proved reserves will be subject to future revision once additional information becomes 
available through, for example, the drilling of additional wells or the observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing 
conditions. As those fields are further developed, new information may lead to revisions.
Assessment of reserves and resources are determined using estimates of oil and gas in place, recovery factors and future commodity prices, 
the latter having an impact on the total amount of recoverable reserves. GENEL ENERGY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Change in accounting estimate
The Company has updated its estimated reserves and resources with the accounting impact summarised below under estimation of oil 
and gas asset values.
Estimation of oil and gas asset values
Estimation of the asset value of oil and gas assets is calculated from a number of inputs that require varying degrees of estimation. 
Principally oil and gas assets are valued by estimating the future cash flows based on a combination of reserves and resources, costs 
of appraisal, development and production, production profile and future sales price and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate 
discount rate.
Future costs of appraisal, development and production are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce 
those reserves and are based on past costs, experience and data from similar assets in the region, future petroleum prices and the planned 
development of the asset. However, actual costs may be different from those estimated. 
Discount rate is assessed by the Company using various inputs from market data, external advisers and internal calculations. A discount rate 
of 15% has been used for impairment testing of oil assets.
In addition, the estimation of the recoverable amount of the Miran/Bina Bawi CGU, which is classified under IFRS as an exploration and 
evaluation intangible asset and consequently carries the inherent uncertainty explained above, includes the key assessment that the project 
will progress, which is outside of the control of management and is dependent on the progress of government to government discussions 
regarding supply of gas an sanctioning of development of both of the midstream for gas and the upstream for oil. Lack of progress could 
result in significant delays in value realisation and consequently a lower asset value.
Change in accounting estimate – Taq Taq PSC (property, plant and equipment)
Management assessment of Taq Taq production has resulted in a production profile forecast that is less favourable than the 2P production 
profile generated by the Competent Persons Report in Q1 2017 and also below the profile generated in Q1 2018. At this point in time, with full 
evaluation of the TT-29 well not completed, capital expenditure in the short term is not forecast to be in line with the CPR and consequently 
it is not appropriate to use the latest CPR 2P production profile for estimating the value of the asset. This has resulted in a reduction in the 
recoverable value of the Taq Taq PSC and, when combined with other inputs, such as oil price, results in an impairment expense of $58.2 million. 
If the 2P production profile from the Q1 2018 CPR had been used, the impairment would have been circa $20 million, circa $40 million lower 
than the reported impairment expense.
Estimation of netback price and entitlement used to calculate reported revenue, trade receivables and forecast future cash flows
Netback price is used to value the Company’s revenue, trade receivables and its forecast cash flows used for impairment testing and viability. 
It is the aggregation of realised price less transportation and handling costs. The Company does not have direct visibility on the components 
of the netback price realised for its oil because sales are managed by the KRG, but invoices are currently raised for payments on account using 
a netback price agreed with the KRG. For revenue recognition, the Company has estimated the netback price using the methodology agreed 
with the KRG for raising invoices for all sales of oil: this results in a $12/bbl discount to Brent for Tawke; $12/bbl discount to Brent for Peshkabir; 
and a $5/bbl discount to Brent for Taq Taq.
The netback adjustment price agreed with the KRG may change in the future. A $1/bbl difference in netback price would impact current year 
revenue by circa $3 million and trade receivables by circa $1 million.
Overdue KRG receivables / RSA deal
On 23 August 2017 the Company signed documentation confirming an agreement had been reached with the KRG to put in place a definitive 
mechanisms for the payment to the Company of trade receivables built up from overdue amounts with nominal value of $469 million owed for 
sales since mid-2014 (‘overdue KRG receivable’) together with nominal value of circa $300m amounts owed for export sales marketed by SOMO 
made before 2014 for which the Company has never recognised revenue (‘overdue pre-2014 receivable’).
Until the RSA, the Company reported the overdue KRG receivable in the balance sheet at its amortised cost. Key inputs to the assessment of 
amortised cost were: oil price, production forecast and mechanism for payment. Estimates of oil price and production forecast were based on 
the inputs used for testing of property, plant and equipment for impairment. When estimating the payment mechanism, although the Company 
expected either an increase in payments, or an alternative structure to be agreed to accelerate payments, it was assessed that there was not 
sufficient evidence to support the use of anything other than the existing payment mechanism, which was 5% of the asset level revenue for 
the Tawke and Taq Taq licences. At the year-ended 31 December 2016, this resulted in the amortised cost being lower than carrying value and 
consequently the overdue KRG receivable was impaired to its reported book value of $207 million compared to its nominal value of $469 million.   ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
In the current year, the RSA resulted in the overdue KRG receivable balance being waived and in return the Company received: (1) a 4.5% royalty 
interest on gross Tawke PSC revenue lasting for 5 years (“the ORRI); (2) the waiver of capacity building payments due on all profit oil received 
under the Tawke PSC; and (3) the waiver of $4.6 million of amounts due to the KRG.
 
As the RSA occurred at arm’s length, the fair value of the consideration received from the KRG described above, which is recognised as 
an intangible asset ‘Tawke RSA’, is considered to be equal to the fair value of the receivables. The Tawke RSA exceeds the carrying amount 
of receivables at the time of settlement resulting in a gain of $293.8 million being recognised in the profit or loss.
Assessing the fair value of both items requires the estimation of future oil price, production profile and reserves and the appropriate discount 
rate. Because management assess that the cash flows have the same risk profile as revenue generated from the Tawke PSC, the Company has 
assessed oil price, production profile, reserves and discount rate using the same methodology as those that would be used for the impairment 
testing of that property, plant and equipment cash generating unit as explained above, albeit at July 2017 rather than at year-end. 
Change in accounting estimate
Previously the present value of trade receivable was estimated using the payment mechanism existing at the time – 5% of asset level revenue 
from the Tawke and Taq Taq licences. Following the RSA in August 2017, which is explained above, the Company estimated the present value of 
the overdue KRG receivable based on the new mechanism under which they expect it to be settled, which is a combination of the fair value of the 
ORRI and the fair value of the CBP waiver. This change in accounting estimate has resulted in the recognition of a gain in the income statement 
of $293.8 million which represents the difference in carrying value of the overdue KRG receivable at the time of derecognition and the value 
of the intangible assets for which it was exchanged.
Estimation of cost and timing of decommissioning cost
Key inputs to the reported decommissioning provision is the cost, timing and discount rate to apply to the cash flows. The cost has been 
estimated based on a report prepared by a third party in April 2017, with timing of costs estimated to be incurred between 2028 and 2038, 
from the latest life of field plans. The estimated cash flows have been discounted using a discount rate of 4%, which is estimated using a risk 
free rate adjusted for timing uncertainty. 
Business combinations
The recognition of business combinations requires the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the net book value of assets acquired 
to be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity. The Company makes judgements and estimates in relation to the fair value 
allocation of the purchase price.
The fair value exercise is performed at the date of acquisition. Owing to the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and gas industry, 
the purchase price allocation exercise and acquisition date fair value determinations require subjective judgements based on a wide range 
of complex variables at a point in time. The Company uses all available information to make the fair value determinations. 
In determining fair value for acquisitions, the Company utilises valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow analysis. The 
assumptions made in performing these valuations include assumptions as to discount rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, 
the timing of development, capital costs, and future operating costs. Any significant change in key assumptions may cause the acquisition 
accounting to be revised.
1.3 Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in preparation of these financial statements are consistent with those used in preparation of the annual 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
Revenue
Revenue for petroleum sales is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed to have passed to the customer, 
it can be measured reliably and it is assessed as probable that economic benefit will flow to the Company. For exports this is when the oil 
enters the export pipe, for domestic sales this is when oil is collected by truck by the customer.  GENEL ENERGY

1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Revenue is recognised at fair value. The fair value is comprised of entitlement, which is earned under the terms of the relevant PSC; ORRI, 
which is earned on 4.5% of gross field revenue from the Tawke licence until July 2022; and royalty income, which is earned on the Taq Taq 
licence from the Company’s partner. Entitlement has two components: cost oil, which is the mechanism by which the Company recovers 
its costs incurred on an asset, and profit oil, which is the mechanism through which profits are shared between the Company, its partners 
and the KRG. The Company pays capacity building payments on profit oil, which becomes due for payment once the Company has received 
the relevant proceeds. Profit oil revenue is always reported net of any capacity building payments that will become due. Capacity building 
payments due on Tawke profit oil receipts were waived from August 2017 onwards as part of the RSA. ORRI is calculated as 4.5% of Tawke 
PSC field revenue. Royalty income is earned on partner sales from the Taq Taq PSC and is recognised when it becomes due or, when 
received in advance, amortised in line with partner entitlement. 
The Company’s oil sales are made to the KRG and are valued at a netback price, which is calculated from the estimated realised sales price 
for each barrel of oil sold, less selling, transportation and handling costs and estimates to cover additional costs. A netback adjustment is used 
to estimate the price per barrel that is used in the calculation of entitlement and is explained further in significant accounting estimates and 
judgements. The Company is not able to measure the tax that has been paid on its behalf and consequently revenue is not reported gross 
of income tax paid.
Intangible assets 
Exploration and evaluation assets
Oil and gas assets classified as exploration and evaluation assets are explained under Oil and Gas assets below.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortisation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets of between 3 and 5 years from the date 
that they are available for use. 
Intangible assets include the additional income streams arising from the Receivable Settlement Agreement effective from 1 August 2017, 
in exchange for trade receivables due from KRG for Taq Taq and Tawke past sales, recognised at cost and amortised on a units of production 
basis in line with the economic lives of the rights acquired, as further explained in Note 8. 
Property, plant and equipment
The Company’s oil and gas assets classified as property, plant and equipment are explained under Oil and Gas assets below.
Other property, plant and equipment
Other property, plant and equipment are principally the Company’s leasehold improvements and other assets and are carried at cost, less any 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include purchase price and construction cost. Depreciation of these assets 
commences is expensed on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years from the date they are available for 
use. 
Oil and gas assets
Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to explore are expensed to the statement of comprehensive income.
Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is accounted for under the successful efforts method. Under the successful efforts method 
only costs that relate directly to the discovery and development of specific oil and gas reserves are capitalised as exploration and evaluation 
assets within intangible assets so long as the activity is assessed to be de-risking the asset and the Company expects continued activity on 
the asset into the foreseeable future. Costs of activity that do not identify oil and gas reserves or are expensed.
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration, evaluation and development 
are capitalised as intangible assets or property, plant and equipment according to their nature. Intangible assets comprise costs relating to the 
exploration and evaluation of properties which the directors consider to be unevaluated until assessed as being 2P reserves and commercially 
viable.
Once assessed as being 2P reserves they are tested for impairment and transferred to property, plant and equipment as development assets. 
Where properties are appraised to have no commercial value, the associated costs are expensed as an impairment loss in the period in which 
the determination is made.   ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Development expenditure is accounted for in accordance with IAS 16–Property, plant and equipment. Assets are depreciated once they are 
available for use and are depleted on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method. The sum of carrying value and the estimated 
future development costs are divided by total forecast 2P production to provide a $/barrel unit depreciation cost. Changes to depreciation 
rates as a result of changes in reserve quantities and estimates of future development expenditure are reflected prospectively. 
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and changes in useful lives 
are accounted for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the relevant period.
Where exploration licences are relinquished or exited for no consideration or costs incurred are neither de-risking nor adding value to the asset, 
the associated costs are expensed to the income statement.
Impairment testing of oil and gas assets is considered in the context of each cash generating unit. A cash generating unit is generally a licence, 
with the discounted value of the future cash flows of the CGU compared to the book value of the relevant assets and liabilities. As an example, 
the Tawke CGU is comprised of the Tawke RSA intangible asset, property, plant and equipment (relating to both the Tawke field and the 
Peshkabir field) and the associated decommissioning provision.
For the Miran PSC and Bina Bawi PSCs, these assets are tested as one CGU (the Miran/Bina Bawi CGU because of the alignment of equity 
interests and current strong linkage between the two assets when both the Company assesses delivery of its gas to the midstream and similarly 
when the midstream assesses its commitment of delivery of gas to Turkey. It may be that one asset is prioritised above the other, which would 
lead to an increase in value to one, increasing its forecast revenue, and an offsetting decrease in value to the other as its forecast revenue 
would decrease.
Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company, and its cost can be measured reliably. The net book value of the replaced 
part is expensed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are expensed to the statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Financial assets and liabilities
Classification
The Company assesses the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition as either at fair value through profit and loss, loans and 
receivables or available for sale. The Company assesses the classification of its financial liabilities on initial recognition at either fair value 
through profit and loss or amortised cost.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised at fair value on the trade-date – the date on which the Company commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from crude oil sales, sales of gas or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If payment 
is expected within one year or less, trade receivables are classified as current assets otherwise they are presented as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held 
on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments and includes the Company’s share of cash held in joint operations.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of any discount in issuance and transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that 
it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates. GENEL ENERGY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Borrowings are presented as long or short-term based on the maturity of the respective borrowings in accordance with the loan or other 
agreement. Borrowings with maturities of less than twelve months are classified as short-term. Amounts are classified as long-term where 
maturity is greater than twelve months. Where no objective evidence of maturity exists, related amounts are classified as short-term.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Company will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Company’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. The unwinding of any discount is recognised as finance 
costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
Decommissioning
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such provision represents 
the estimated discounted liability for costs which are expected to be incurred in removing production facilities and site restoration at the end of 
the producing life of each field. A corresponding cost is capitalised to property, plant and equipment and subsequently depreciated as part of the 
capital costs of the production facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates 
of the cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision.
Offsetting 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment 
Oil and gas assets
The carrying amounts of the Company’s oil and gas assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash 
generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. For value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
arising from the Company’s future plans for the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For fair value less costs of disposal, an estimation is made of the 
fair value of consideration that would be received to sell an asset less associated selling costs.
Assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (cash generating unit).
The estimated recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying value of the asset. Where the estimated recoverable amount is materially 
lower than the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss is recognised. Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Impairment testing of oil and gas assets is explained above. When impairment indicators exist for other non-financial assets, impairment testing 
is performed based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. The Company assets’ recoverable amount is determined 
by fair value less costs of disposal.
Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is 
considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimate of future cash flows 
of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. All impairment losses are 
recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Employee benefits
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed to the statement of comprehensive income as the related service is provided. A liability 
is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.  ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
1. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding shares and share options 
to employees is recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair 
value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The charge is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the award. 
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision 
to the original estimates is reflected in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately 
to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on cash invested, foreign currency gains and the unwind of discount on any assets held at amortised 
cost. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, foreign currency losses and discount unwind on any liabilities held at amortised 
cost. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset are capitalised over the 
respective assets.
Taxation
Under the terms of the KRI PSCs, the Company is not required to pay any cash taxes although it is uncertain whether the Company is exempt 
from tax or whether tax has been paid on its behalf. If tax has been paid on its behalf by the government, then it is not known at what rate tax 
has been paid due to uncertainty in relation to the workings of any existing tax payment mechanism. It is estimated that the tax rate would be 
between 0% and 40%. If tax has been paid it would result in a gross up of revenue with a corresponding debit entry to taxation expense with 
no net impact on the income statement or on cash. In addition, it would be assessed whether any deferred tax asset or liability was required 
to be recognised.
Segmental reporting 
IFRS8 requires the Company to disclose information about its business segments and the geographic areas in which it operates. It requires 
identification of business segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the CEO, the chief operating decision maker, 
in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. 
Related parties
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the party 
in making financial or operational decisions. Parties are also related if they are subject to common control. Transactions between related parties 
are transfers of resources, services or obligations, regardless of whether a price is charged and are disclosed separately within the notes to the 
consolidated financial information.
New standards
Effective 1 January 2017, the Company has adopted the following standards and amendments to standards: Amendments to IAS 7 – Statement 
of Cash Flows, Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle – financial information 
for held for sale assets. The adoption of these standards and amendments has had no material impact on the Company’s results or financial 
statement disclosures. 
The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation that was issued but is not yet effective.
The following new accounting standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued by the IASB and endorsed by the 
EU have yet to be adopted by the Group: IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018), IFRS 9 – Financial 
Instruments (effective 1 January 2018), IFRS 16 – Leases (effective 1 January 2019), Amendments to IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement 
of Share Based Payments (effective 1 January 2018), Amendments to IAS 40 – Transfers of Investment Property (effective 1 January 2018), 
and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle – exemptions and investment accounting (effective 1 January 2018). 
The Company has assessed the impact of IFRS 15 – Financial Instruments, IFRS 9 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 – Leases 
on its financial statements. IFRS 15 requires a 5-step approach, which is definition of the customer, performance obligations, price, allocation 
of price into performance obligations and recognising the revenue when the conditions are met. The Company’s single performance obligation 
in its contract with customers is the delivery of crude oil at a pre-determined netback adjustment to Dated Brent and the control is transferred 
to the buyer at the metering point when the revenue is recognised. Therefore, the Company does not expect a material impact when IFRS 15 
is adopted. The Company has also reviewed the implications of IFRS 9 when it becomes in effect. The accounting treatment of the buyback of 
Company bonds and the replacement of its existing bonds maturing 2019 with bonds that mature in 2022, which is described further in Note 15 
is in line with the IFRS 9 derecognition of financial liabilities and no further transitional adjustment is required when IFRS 9 is adopted. Further, 
the impact of changes to impairment model from incurred credit losses to expected credit loss model with the revised standard is considered 
to be low due to the trade receivables balance being at a normal level, with no issues with payment in the last two years. The Company reviewed 
its leases under IFRS 16. The leases are mostly short term and/or low value, which will not require significant changes under the new standard. 
As a result, the Company concluded that these new standards are not expected to have a material impact on the results or financial statements 
of the Company as at 31 December 2017. GENEL ENERGY

The Company has three reportable business segments: Oil, Miran/Bina Bawi (‘MBB’) and Exploration (‘Expl.’). Capital allocation decisions for the 
oil segment are considered in the context of the cash flows expected from the production and sale of crude oil. The oil segment is comprised of 
the producing fields on the Tawke PSC and the Taq Taq PSC, which are located in the KRI and make sales predominantly to the KRG. The Miran/
Bina Bawi segment is comprised of the oil and gas upstream and midstream activity on the Miran PSC and the Bina Bawi PSC, which are both 
in the KRI – this was previously labelled as the ‘Gas’ segment. The exploration segment is comprised of exploration activity, principally located 
in Somaliland and Morocco.

Trade receivables are amounts owed by the KRG for oil sales. The balance owed has reduced significantly in the period as a result of the 
RSA, which is explained in the significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in note 1. The RSA has resulted in a gain, 
which is comprised of the following items:
$m
Gain arising from RSA 289.2
Write-off of trade receivable balance (425.1)
Recognition of Tawke intangible assets (ORRI + CBP waiver) 425.1
Waiver of related obligations arising from RSA 4.6
Net gain arising from the RSA 293.8
The $293.8 million gain increased the book value of overdue receivables to $425.1 million (nominal value of c. $769 million), which was written 
off and replaced by the Tawke RSA intangible asset at cost of $425.1 million.
For comparison purposes, assuming that the agreement had been completed in the beginning of 2017, it is estimated that revenue would have 
been $59.2 million higher this year.

Contingent consideration includes a balance of $60.5 million (2016: $82.7 million) recognised at its discounted fair value, which has been 
re-estimated in the year resulting in a reduction that has been deducted from the book value of Miran/Bina Bawi intangible assets. The nominal 
value of this balance is $145.0 million and its payment is contingent on gas production at the Bina Bawi and Miran assets meeting a certain 
volume threshold. The unwind of the discount is capitalised against the relevant intangible assets.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
15. Borrowings and net debt continued
In March 2017, the Company repurchased $252.8 million nominal value of its own bonds for net cash of $216.7 million – the purchased bonds 
had a book value of $249.3 million resulting in Company net debt reducing by $32.6 million. 
In June 2017, the Company cancelled these bonds, together with the $55.4 million nominal value of bonds repurchased in March 2016, 
resulting in a reduction in total outstanding debt from $730 million to $421.8 million.
In December 2017, the Company completed its refinancing of the bonds by reducing the outstanding bond debt from $421.8 million to 
$300 million by way of an early redemption of $121.8 million for cash of $125.5 million. The maturity of the $300 million nominal value 
of remaining bonds was extended to December 2022, with some other changes in terms. The refinancing has been accounted for under 
IAS39 as an extinguishment and consequently has resulted in a net finance expense of $19.7 million, representing the acceleration of 
the recognition of the associated discount unwind expense and the premium paid for the early redemption of the bonds.
The fair value of the bonds is materially in line with the carrying value.

16. Financial Risk Management
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and other assets. The carrying amount of financial assets 
represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum credit exposure to credit risk at 31 December was:
2017  
$m
2016  
$m
Trade and other receivables 76.8 265.8
Cash and cash equivalents 162.0 407.0
238.8 672.8
Credit risk for trade receivables is explained in note 10 and relates to there being a single customer. There are no receivables overdue at 
the period end and no provision for doubtful debt has been made. Cash is deposited in US treasury bills or term deposits with banks that are 
assessed as appropriate based on, among other things, sovereign risk, CDS pricing and credit rating. Credit risk is managed on Company basis. 
Liquidity risk
The Company is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due. At 31 December 2017 the Company 
had cash and cash equivalents of $162.0 million (2016: $407.0 million).
Oil price risk
The Company’s revenues are calculated from Dated Brent oil price, and a $5/bbl change in average Dated Brent would result in a profit before 
tax change of $12 million. Sensitivity of the carrying value of its assets to oil price risk is provided in notes 8 and 9.
Currency risk
As substantially all of the Company’s transactions are measured and denominated in US dollars, the exposure to currency risk is not material 
and therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
Interest rate risk 
The Company reported borrowings of $296.8 million (2016: $648.2 million) in the form of a bond maturing in December 2022, with fixed coupon 
interest payable of 10% on the nominal value of $300 million. Although interest is fixed on existing debt, whenever the Company wishes to 
borrow new debt or refinance existing debt, it will be exposed to interest rate risk. A 1% increase in interest rate payable on a balance similar 
to the existing debt of the Company would result in an additional cost of $3 million per annum. 
Capital management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise shareholder 
value. The Company’s short term funding needs are met principally from the cash flows generated from its operations and available cash 
of $162.0 million.  ANNUALREPORT2017

The range of exercise prices for share options outstanding at the end of the period is nil to 1,046.00p. The weighted average remaining 
contractual life of the outstanding share options is 2 years. The blended exercise price for SOPs is 890p.
Fair value of options granted has been measured either by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model or by use of a formula based on past 
calculations. The model takes into account assumptions regarding expected volatility, expected dividends and expected time to exercise. In the 
absence of sufficient historical volatility for the Company, expected volatility was estimated by analysing the historical volatility of FTSE-listed 
oil and gas producers over the three years prior to the date of grant. The expected dividend assumption was set at 0%. The risk-free interest 
rate incorporated into the model is based on the term structure of UK Government zero coupon bonds. The inputs into the fair value calculation 
for RSP and PSP awards granted in 2017 and fair values per share using the model were as follows:

19. Capital commitments and operating lease commitments
The Company had no material outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases.
Under the terms of its PSCs and JOAs, the Company has certain commitments that are generally defined by activity rather than spend. The 
Company’s capital programme for the next few years is explained in the operating review and is in excess of the activity required by its PSCs and 
JOAs. The Company leases temporary production and office facilities under operating leases. During the period ended 31 December 2017 $1.2 
million (2016: $3.7 million) was expensed to the statement of comprehensive income in respect of these operating leases. Drill rigs are leased on 
a day-rate basis for the purpose of drilling exploration or development wells. The aggregate payments under drilling contracts are determined 
by the number of days required to drill each well and are capitalised as exploration or development assets as appropriate.  ANNUALREPORT2017

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Introduction and basis for preparation
This report sets out details of the payments made to governments by Genel Energy plc and its subsidiary undertakings (“Genel”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 as required under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the ‘DTRs’) and in 
accordance with our interpretation of the Industry Guidance issued for the UK’s Report on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014, as 
amended in December 2015 (‘the Regulations’). The DTRs require companies in the UK and operating in the extractives sector to publically 
disclose payments made to governments in the countries where they undertake exploration, prospection, development and extraction of 
oil and natural gas deposits or other materials. 
This report is available to download at www.genelenergy.com/investor-relations/results-reports-presentations. 
Governments
All of the payments made in relation to licences in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (‘KRI’) have been made to the Ministry of Natural Resources 
of the Kurdistan Regional Government (‘KRG’). 
Production entitlements
Production entitlements are the host government’s share of production during the reporting period from projects operated by Genel. 
Production entitlements from projects that are not operated by Genel are not covered by this report. The figures reported have been produced 
on an entitlement basis rather than on a liftings basis. Production entitlements are paid in-kind and the monetary value disclosed is derived 
from management’s calculation of revenue from the field.
Royalties
Royalties represent royalties paid in-kind to governments during the year for the extraction of oil. The terms of the Royalties are described 
within our Production Sharing Contracts and can vary from project to project. Royalties have been calculated on the same barrels of oil 
equivalent basis as production entitlements.
Materiality threshold
Total payments below £86,000 made to a government are excluded from this report as permitted under the Regulations.

1. Under the lifting arrangements implemented by the KRG, the KRG takes title to crude at the wellhead and then transports it to Ceyhan in Turkey by pipeline. The crude 
is then sold by the KRG into the international market. All proceeds of sale are received by or on behalf of the KRG, out of which the KRG then makes payment for cost and 
profit oil in accordance with the PSC to Genel, in exchange for the crude delivered to the KRG. Under these arrangements, payments are in fact made by or on behalf of the 
KRG to Genel, rather than by Genel to the KRG. For the purposes of the reporting requirements under the Regulations however, we are required to characterise the value 
of the KRG’s entitlement under the PSC (for which they receive payment directly from the market) as a payment made to the KRG. Therefore, estimated value in $millions 
is not paid to the KRG, and is calculated to meeting the reporting requirements under the regulations. 
2. The amount reported for Taq Taq, is the gross payment made to the KRI by the operating company (TTOPCO), Genel’s share of these payments is equal to 55% 
(with the exception of capacity building payments).
3. Payment for the cumulative production bonuses reported above were waived by the KRG under the Receive Settlement Agreement (‘RSA’) entered into by the Company 
and KRG in August 2017.
4. Capacity building payments reported are payments made by Genel directly to the KRI in cash as required by the PSC. The payment reported above excludes the value 
of any capacity building payments waived by the KRG under the RSA, please refer to note 1 to the financial statements in our 2017 annual report for further information 
on the RSA.
