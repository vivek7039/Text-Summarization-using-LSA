Our convenience‑led, community‑ 
focused retail and leisure portfolio 
is ideally positioned to cater for the 
non‑discretionary, essential needs  
of the UK consumer. 
Retail represents 84% of our portfolio 
and notwithstanding the uncertain 
economic landscape, the UK retail 
market is forecast to continue to grow, 
with convenience‑driven categories 
dominating total physical store spend. 
In 2016, convenience and value retail 
operators accounted for the greatest 
share of new store openings. 
Moreover, the physical store continues to 
be fundamental to the retail mix, with the 
top 10 multichannel retailers accounting  
for nearly 50% of total online sales.

The UK retail market is forecast to grow  
with convenience-driven categories leading 
the way for physical spend
• In 2016, total retail spend in the UK was £317.9bn, with physical sales 
and click & collect accounting for £276.1bn of total spend.
• By 2021 total retail spend is forecast to increase to £362.4bn, with physical 
and click & collect sales accounting for £305.9bn, an increase of 11%.
• By 2026 total retail spend is forecast to increase to £406.6bn, 
with physical and click & collect sales accounting for £332.9bn, 
a further increase of 9%.
• Although online penetration is forecast to increase from 14.8% to 18.0% 
by 2021 (and to 21.4% in 2026), convenience‑driven/non‑discretionary 
spend is forecast to remain resilient to the growth of online and has the 
strongest growth prospects across retail over the coming years.

8 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Forecast growth in retail spend is 
underpinned by changing demographics
• Between 2016 and 2026, GlobalData forecasts that a further £64.7bn 
will be added to the retail market due to sales made either in store or 
through click & collect. Of this, 57.5% will come from shoppers aged 
55 and over.
• The under 35s are less financially mobile than their older generations, 
suffering lower disposable incomes, reduced car ownership and 
significant barriers to getting on to the property ladder.
• The ageing of the comparatively asset‑rich, baby‑boomer generation, 
means that spending and, in particular, spending through stores and 
click & collect, is set to be driven by the baby‑boomers.
The 55+ age-group is set to account for 57.5% of all store and 
click & collect sales growth over the next ten years
Spend growth by age 2016-2026
Convenience and value retailers 
continue to expand
• Bucking the trend for margin depletion over 
the past decade or so, the store‑only value 
retailers, including B&M and Home Bargains, 
have historically performed well in challenging 
economic environments. These retailers have 
successfully expanded, maintaining healthy 
operating margins, and are looking to  
continue to expand.

NewRiver’s top 10 retailers is comprised of

• With 64% of shoppers across NewRiver’s portfolio in 2017 aged 45 and 
over, NewRiver is well placed to benefit from this key growth segment  
of the population over the next ten years.
• Older shoppers appreciate the ease of access and free parking offered 
by retail parks, which now constitute 14% of the NewRiver portfolio.

STRATEGIC REPORT Continued growth in uncertain times
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
Following graduation from AIM to a Premium Listing 
on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange 
in August 2016, the Company became a constituent 
of the FTSE 250 and FTSE All‑Share indices on 
19 December 2016. From the same date, it was also 
included in the EPRA indices which measure the 
performance of the European listed REIT sector. 
I would like to welcome all new shareholders joining 
the register as a result of these significant events.
On admission to the Main Market, NewRiver REIT plc 
became the ultimate parent company, replacing 
NewRiver Retail Limited. The change in name 
reflected the combination of the Company’s 
portfolio now including both retail and leisure 
assets as well as its high dividend pay‑out ratio as 
a UK‑registered Real Estate Investment Trust. The 
core business strategy remains unchanged and the 
Company continues to operate according to its strict 
Paul Roy
Chairman
I am delighted to report that NewRiver REIT plc 
(“NewRiver”) produced excellent financial results for the 
year ended 31 March 2017. Funds From Operations grew 
by 24% to £58 million, and the Company increased the 
ordinary dividend for the period by 8% to 20.0 pence per 
share (FY16 18.5 pence), as well as declaring an additional 
special dividend of 3.0 pence per share.
founding principles of active asset management and 
risk‑controlled development.
NewRiver’s specialism is owning convenience‑led, 
community‑focused assets, primarily serving 
family shopping and leisure requirements. Its 
occupiers are, in the main, value‑led retailers, 
paying affordable rents and providing shoppers with 
everyday non‑discretionary items such as clothing 
and groceries. From the perspective of the landlord, 
this sector consistently proves itself to be a highly 
resilient segment of the retail market, capable of 
sustaining cash flows in most economic conditions. 
The strength of the Company’s key operating 
metrics demonstrated the soundness of its business 
model during what was at times a turbulent year 
for the retail sector generally. Notably, like‑for‑like 
footfall and occupancy levels both improved 
compared to the previous period.
12 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Company showed agility in the acquisitions 
market over the year with the purchase of a major 
shopping centre in Bexleyheath, South East London, 
a retail park in Dumfries and a retail warehouse 
in Sheffield. The latter purchase subsequently 
generated cash receipts of £11.5 million, which, 
in accounting terms, fall within the definition of 
Funds From Operations. The Board has therefore 
approved a further special dividend of 3.0 pence 
to be paid on 4 August 2017 to shareholders on the 
register on 16 June 2017. The ex‑dividend date will 
be 15 June 2017.
I am also delighted to announce that the first quarter 
dividend for FY18 will be increased to 5.25 pence 
per share (Q1 FY17: 5.00 pence), payable on 
4 August 2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 16 June 2017. The ex‑dividend date will be 
15 June 2017.
As previously announced, Chris Taylor, Senior 
Independent Director, stepped down from the Board 
with effect from 9 April 2017. On behalf of NewRiver, 
I would like to thank Chris for his major contribution 
over five years as a Non‑Executive Director and 
to wish him well for the future. On behalf of the 
Board, I would also like to thank NewRiver’s 
management and employees, whose hard work, 
enthusiasm and entrepreneurial flair delivered 
another strong performance. Finally, I am grateful to 
the Company’s advisers and shareholders for their 
continuing support.
While the Board is aware of general economic 
caution in light of uncertainty over Brexit 
negotiations and the potential for rises in inflation 
and interest rates, it believes that NewRiver is 
well placed to meet the challenges that could 
arise in this environment. The Company owns 
a sizeable portfolio with critical mass. It is highly 
cash generative with an occupier base representing 
some of the strongest covenants in the UK retail and 
leisure sectors. Assets are geographically diversified 
with a focus on day to day shopping needs which 
the Company considers to be significantly less 
volatile than other segments of the retail market.
The Board remains optimistic in its outlook for 
the Company and looks forward to the future 
with confidence.

STRATEGIC REPORT Focused strategy delivering  
growing cash profits
Our Executive Committee
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW
“ Our convenience‑led, 
community‑focused retail & 
leisure portfolio has proved 
well‑positioned in what has been 
an uncertain twelve months at 
the macro economic and 
political levels.”
This has been another outstanding year for 
NewRiver, which is reflected in a strong set of full 
year results. These results also demonstrate that 
our focused business model, which we have strictly 
adhered to since our IPO, is clearly working well.
Our convenience‑led, community‑focused retail and 
leisure portfolio has proved well‑positioned and 
well‑placed in what has been an uncertain twelve 
months at the macro economic and political levels. 
As a business, we have maintained our disciplined 
approach to stock selection, remained active 
asset managers, progressed our risk‑controlled 
development pipeline and recycled capital 
profitably, all of which has allowed us to continue 
to deliver growing and sustainable cash profits to 
our shareholders.
Our Funds From Operations (‘FFO’) of £58.2 million 
were up 24% compared to the same period last 
year due to acquisitions made in the last 12 months 
as well as our highly active asset management 
programme. The Board recently approved a final 
quarterly dividend of 5.0 pence per share, resulting 
in a fully covered ordinary dividend for the year of 
20.0 pence per share, up over 8% compared to last 
year. We are delighted to announce an additional 
3.0 pence per share special dividend linked to our 
acquisition in Sheffield, taking the total dividend 
for the year to 23.0 pence per share, an increase 
of 24%. This special dividend demonstrates our 
commitment to continue to distribute growing cash 
returns to our shareholders. Looking ahead, the 
increase in our Q1 FY18 dividend to 5.25 pence per 
share, an increase of 5% on Q1 FY17, reflects our 
confidence in the security and sustainability of our 
cash flows.
Our assets under management now stand at 
£1.3 billion, £1.1 billion at NewRiver’s share, with our 
EPRA net asset value per share down marginally by 
3 pence to 292 pence reflecting the absorption of 
acquisition costs and Main Market move costs as 
well as a small 0.6% reduction in portfolio valuation. 
Importantly, this reduction came in the first half of 
our financial year, when real estate values were

14 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 impacted by Brexit fears, and our valuations showed 
improvement in the second half. Our IFRS net assets 
have decreased by 0.8%, due principally to the 
same factors.
During the year, we completed acquisitions totalling 
£158 million at an equivalent yield of 7.2%. In 
April 2016 we completed our largest acquisition 
to date, buying the Broadway Shopping Centre 
and Broadway Square Retail Park in Bexleyheath, 
South East London, for £120 million at a blended 
equivalent yield of 7.0%. We have been active in the 
year since acquisition, improving rental tone in the 
shopping centre by 15% and working in partnership 
with the London Borough of Bexley to design 
a masterplan for the shopping centre, retail park 
and surrounding council owned land. In April 2017, 
following a comprehensive fit out, London based 
Morleys Department Stores opened at the centre in 
the 40,000 sq ft unit formerly occupied by BHS. The 
opening of this new store has been a real success 
for Morleys, and we have benefitted from increased 
footfall across the rest of the shopping centre.
We completed the acquisition of Cuckoo Bridge 
Retail Park in Dumfries in June 2016 in an off‑market 
transaction for £20 million. At the time of acquisition, 
we identified several opportunities to drive income 
and capital growth by improving the occupier line‑up 
and have agreed heads of terms with a fashion/
homeware occupier to introduce a 20,000 sq ft full 
line store subject to obtaining planning consent 
which is anticipated in the next few months.
In September 2016, we moved quickly to acquire 
a retail warehouse in Sheffield from an open‑ended 
property fund for £18 million. As we completed 
the acquisition, we exchanged contracts with the 
occupier to accept a surrender premium of up to 
£12.25 million by May 2017, meaning that in essence 
we acquired a 110,000 sq ft prominently located 
retail warehouse on an 11 acre site for a net price 
of £6 million. In March 2017, having moved into 
advanced negotiations with a number of potential 
occupiers and purchasers, we requested and 
received the surrender premium, having received 
rent in the interim, the majority of which we are 
paying to our shareholders as a 3.0 pence per share 
special dividend. Pleasingly, the asset has been 
independently valued at 50% more than our net 
purchase price.
Across our retail portfolio we continued our track 
record of strong and improving operational metrics, 
with the increase in occupancy from 96% in March 
2016 to 97% in March 2017 reflecting the compelling 
nature of our convenience‑led, community‑focused 
portfolio to occupiers. Our highly active approach 
to asset management resulted in the completion 
of more than 300 new lettings and renewals, with 
long term deals completed on terms 3.9% ahead 
of ERV. Importantly our rents remain affordable for 
our occupiers, at £12.45 per sq ft on average. The 
combination of our high occupancy and affordable 
average rents indicates to us that retailers are 
trading profitably at our assets, underpinning the 
sustainability of our income. This affordability will 
be further supported by this year’s business rates 
revaluation, with draft rateable values across our 
retail portfolio in England, Scotland and Wales falling 
by over 19% on average. Our pub operators will also 
benefit from the rates revaluation, saving on average 
40% on business rates from 1 April 2017.
During the year, we successfully applied our active 
asset management approach to our pub portfolio. 
At the time of the Trent portfolio acquisition, we 
signed a four year leaseback agreement with 
Marston’s Plc which ends later this year.

STRATEGIC REPORT Of the 189 pubs held in the Trent portfolio, we have 
now successfully transferred the management of 
44 pubs from Marston’s, and during the year we 
secured contracted income on a further 22 pubs 
by surrendering the leaseback arrangement early 
and agreeing new 15 year RPI linked leases with 
Marston’s. The remaining pubs will be transferred 
in small batches over the remainder of the calendar 
year. We have continued to make selective and 
profitable disposals from our pub portfolio, selling 
seven pubs for £4 million in the year representing 
a 10% premium to March 2016 valuation and over 
a 30% premium to purchase price.
We have made good progress on our 1.9 million sq ft 
risk‑controlled development pipeline during the year. 
At our 465,000 sq ft consented regeneration project 
in Burgess Hill, we have pre‑let 49% of the retail 
and leisure element, up from 41% just six months 
ago, with leases now signed with Next and Nandos. 
On the residential element of the scheme, we have 
agreed terms with a residential investment company 
for a significant pre‑sale. In order to facilitate the 
development, we recently agreed terms with Lidl 
and Iceland to surrender and relocate to sites 
adjacent to the shopping centre, as well as agreeing 
to re‑locate the local council owned library. All of this 
progress means that we hope to be in a position to 
start on site later in the summer.
Elsewhere in our risk‑controlled development 
pipeline, in November 2016 we received planning 
consent at Canvey Island for a 62,000 sq ft retail 
park which is already 52% pre‑let. In the same 
month we also submitted the planning application 
for our exciting 236,000 sq ft mixed‑use 
regeneration in Cowley, Oxford. Our current 
development commitment is modest, with 
26,000 sq ft under construction all of which is 
pre‑let. Our risk‑controlled approach to development 
means we will not commit to further developments 
without substantial pre‑letting.
The convenience store programme within our pub 
portfolio continued to progress, and we handed 
over a further eight c‑stores to the Co‑operative 
in the period taking the total number completed 
to date to 11. In early 2017 we completed our first 
c‑store disposal for £970,000, representing an initial 
yield of 4.85%, and over 11% ahead of valuation. We 
are on site for the construction of a further three 
c‑stores totalling 11,000 sq ft and we have consent 
to construct a further 15 totalling 53,400 sq ft.
Our L TV was 37% at 31 March 2017, up from 27% at 
March 2016 predominantly due to the acquisition 
of our assets in Bexleyheath which completed in 
April 2016. Our interest cover remained robust at 
4.5x and our weighted average cost of debt was 
3.5%, down from 3.7% in March 2016.
We completed our move from AIM to a Premium 
Listing on the Main Market in August 2016 marking 
a significant milestone for NewRiver and we 
continued this impressive momentum into 
December, when we qualified for admission  
into the FTSE 250, FTSE All‑Share and EPRA  
indices at the first attempt.
We have a fantastic, talented and enthusiastic team 
at NewRiver and I would like to thank them all for 
their hard work and significant contribution to this 
year’s results.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
“ We believe that with our convenience and 
community specialism, strong operational 
metrics, affordable rents and conservative 
balance sheet we are well‑positioned to 
continue to deliver secure and sustainable 
cash returns to our shareholders and 
we look forward to the coming year 
with confidence.”
16 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Outlook
We believe that with our convenience and 
community focus, strong operational metrics, 
affordable rents and conservative balance sheet 
we are well‑positioned to continue to grow and 
deliver secure and sustainable cash returns to 
our shareholders.
In the context of the slowdown in the investment 
market since the EU Referendum we are pleased 
to have bided our time and believe that current 
market conditions and the pricing for typical assets 
which NewRiver wishes to acquire are beginning to 
provide opportunities for the Company.
We have never relied on the market to drive returns 
for our shareholders, instead we have ourselves 
created value by applying our proven business 
model, and focusing on the convenience‑led, 
community‑focused retail and leisure sectors where 
the UK household budget is spent day in, day out. 
We remind ourselves that the business was founded 
in 2009 during a severe recession and has grown 
into a FTSE 250 entity in less than eight years.
NewRiver is highly capable of enhancing 
shareholder value through its very active asset 
management programme and our strict adherence 
to risk‑controlled development practices. Our 
business model remains highly scalable and we 
view the future with excitement and confidence.

Disciplined stock selection
We target high yielding assets with low

approach, and our significant experience 
in our market means we are able to price 
risk appropriately and so buy assets at 
the right price.
Active asset management & 
risk-controlled development
Our core strategy is to enhance and

asset management initiatives. A deep 
understanding of our market and strong 
relationships with our high quality retailers 
means we are able to deliver the right 
space in the right locations at affordable

Our risk‑controlled development program 
seeks to create income and capital growth 
from within our portfolio. We are able to 
create value using our in‑house expertise 
to obtain planning consents, which we can 
then choose to either develop ourselves 
or realise through capital recycling. Our 
risk‑controlled approach means that we 
will not commit to developments without 
securing significant pre‑lets or pre‑sales.
We regularly assess potential upside 
opportunities in trading out of assets 
and recycle capital into new opportunities 
where appropriate. We have a track record 
of doing this profitability.

STRATEGIC REPORT OUR KPIS
T otal property return is a measure of the income and capital growth 
generated across our portfolio. It is calculated by MSCI Real Estate 
(formerly known as IPD) on our behalf, using information provided by our 
independent valuers, and we assess our performance against the market 
by comparing our returns to the MSCI‑IPD All Retail benchmark.
Annualised rent roll
Annualised rent roll is a measure of the scale of our business and 
the success of our active asset management and risk‑controlled 
development. It is disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis, 
including rental income from joint ventures at our share. 
Retail occupancy
Retail Occupancy is the estimated rental value of units expressed as 
a percentage of the total estimated rental value of the retail portfolio, 
excluding development activities. 
Leasing events
The number of leasing events completed is a measure of how active 
we have been in our asset management over the year. Leasing events 
include new leases, lease renewals and lease regears.
Measuring our  
strategic progress
We measure our progress against our strategic objectives with reference to our key performance 
indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are linked to our strategic priorities and in some instances are used to 
determine how management and employees are remunerated.

All Retail benchmark by 400 bps. We delivered an income return of 7.4%, 
outperforming the benchmark by 230 bps, and a capital return of ‑0.6%, 
outperforming the benchmark by 170 bps.
1 2 & 3
We completed £158.4 million of acquisitions during the year, increasing 
our annualised rent roll by £12.6 million**. Like‑for‑like net income 
increased by 1.2% due principally to our active asset management and 
risk‑controlled development.
1 2 & 3
Retail occupancy increased from 96% to 97% in the period, due to our 
active asset management activity. This is the highest level of occupancy 
we have seen since the Company was founded almost 8 years ago.
2 & 3
We completed 355 leasing events in the year, across both our retail and 
pub portfolios, which compares to the 235 leasing deals completed 
in FY16. These leasing deals were completed across 1.1 million sq ft 
of space, compared to 0.5 million sq ft in FY16. Long term deals were 
completed 3.9% ahead of our valuers’ estimate of rental values.

23 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT OUR KPIS CONTINUED 
T otal Accounting Return
T otal Accounting Return (‘TAR’) measures the change in EPRA Net Asset 
Value per share over the year, plus dividends paid, as a percentage 
of the EPRA Net Asset Value at the start of the financial year. TAR 
performance relative to UK listed Real Estate Investment Trusts is a key 
metric used in setting the long‑term incentive plan (‘Performance Share 
Plan’) remuneration for Executive Directors and senior members of staff.
Loan to Value
Loan to Value (‘L TV’) is the proportion of our properties that are 
funded by borrowings. The measure is presented on a proportionally 
consolidated basis, including our share of properties and borrowings 
held in joint ventures. Maintaining an L TV of less than 50% is one of 
our four key Financial Policies, and compliance with these policies 
contributes towards Executive Director variable pay.
Interest cover
Interest cover is the ratio of our operating profit to our net financing 
costs, on a proportionally consolidated basis, including our share of 
operating profit and net financing costs from joint ventures. Maintaining 
interest cover of more than 2.0x is one of our four key Financial Policies, 
and compliance with these policies forms part of Executive Director 
variable pay.
Admin cost ratio
The Admin cost ratio the ratio of administrative expenses to gross 
revenue on a proportionally consolidated basis, including our share of 
administrative expenses and gross revenue from joint ventures. It is a 
measure of the operational efficiency of the Company.
Funds From Operations
Funds From Operations (‘FFO’) is a Company measure determined by 
cash profits which includes realised recurring cash profits plus realised 
cash profits or losses on the sale of properties and excludes other one 
off or non‑cash adjustments. FFO per share is used by the Company 
when considering our dividend policy.

24 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 T otal Accounting Return was 5.7% on a paid basis. This return is 
principally due to 19.75 pence per share of dividend paid in the year, 
offset by a marginal decline in EPRA Net Asset Value per share of 
3 pence.
Our L TV was 37% at 31 March 2017, increased from 27% at 
31 March 2016 due principally to acquisitions made in the year. 
While L TV has increased in the year, we have no intention of 
increasing our L TV in the near term and we are significantly 
below our upper limit of 50% as stated in our Financial Policies.
Our interest cover was 4.5x in FY17, increased from 4.3x in FY16,  
due to acquisition activity and a reduction in our cost of debt from 
3.7% to 3.5%.
Our Admin cost ratio was 15% in FY17, reduced from 19% in FY16 as 
we have continued to benefit from our increasing scale.
FFO increased by 24% to £58.2 million in FY17, from £47.1 million 
in FY16. This increase was principally due to acquisition activity, 
including the surrender premium received on our retail warehouse 
acquisition in Sheffield.

Active approach creating secure 
and sustainable income
Allan Lockhart
Property Director
Overview
Conveniently positioned at the heart of 
the community
We are experts in the convenience‑led, 
community‑focused UK retail and leisure market 
and own, operate and actively manage a high 
quality, necessity based portfolio of assets that cater 
to the day to day needs of our consumers, retailers 
and communities. We are relevant, progressive and 
create attractive venues that cater to all daily needs.
T o successfully drive value and returns for our 
shareholders we are focused on consistent and 
sustainable cash flows, the realisation of embedded 
asset management opportunities and the unlocking 
of redevelopment and development value.
We successfully apply a disciplined and focused 
plan to achieve the desired value and returns.
Strategic: Our stock selection is supported by 
a wealth of experience and discipline which 
means that we are able to assess and price 
risk appropriately.
Active: We are able to grow income and unlock 
value from within our portfolio through active asset 
management and risk‑controlled developments. 
Either opportunistically or once we have successfully 
implemented our business plans, we are able to 
realise and distribute the value we have created to 
our shareholders, through profitable capital recycling.
Intelligence through research and local market 
knowledge: Across our retail portfolio, we conduct 
regular consumer surveys, so we understand how 
local residents are using our assets, what they value 
and what we can do to make their lives easier. These 
show a trend of high frequency visits and loyalty 
by our core customers. In our view, demographic

changes will be as influential if not more so than 
technology over the coming years and we are well 
positioned to benefit from the growth of the grey 
pound and undoubted benefits of click and collect.
Engagement: We have close and well established 
relationships with our retail and leisure occupiers. 
We understand their challenges, not least from rising 
input and staff costs, and we are focused on working

the majority of the increase, offset by a marginally negative capital return 
of ‑0.6%, which includes acquisition costs and capital expenditure incurred. 
Capital returns fell in the first half by 1.0%, as the investment market stalled 
in the immediate aftermath of the EU Referendum, but importantly capital 
returns for the second half of the financial year were +0.5%.
Our capital return compares favourably to the market, outperforming the 
MSCI‑IPD All Retail benchmark of ‑2.3% by 170 bps. Moreover, we delivered 
a total property return of 6.8%, significantly outperforming the benchmark 
of 2.8% by 400 bps.
The portfolio equivalent yield stands at 8.1% in March 2017, from 8.2% in 
March 2016. The equivalent yield on our Shopping Centres, which account 
for 61% of our portfolio, has compressed from 7.9% to 7.7%, principally 
following the acquisition of our assets in Bexleyheath.

Bexleyheath
Our most significant acquisition was in Bexleyheath, 
South East London, where in April 2016 we 
purchased both the Broadway Shopping Centre 
and the Broadway Square Retail Park for a total cost 
of £120.3 million at a blended equivalent yield of 
7.0%. The assets were acquired from an institutional 
vendor, and represent NewRiver’s largest single 
asset acquisition to date. The Bexleyheath assets 
were 100% occupied at acquisition, and provide 
a balanced range of convenience, food and 
fashion retailers to the local community, in‑line with 
our wider portfolio. In total, the assets comprise 
525,000 sq ft of space, representing over 60% of 
the town’s retail space and provide the principal 
retail destination for a South East London borough 
earmarked for significant growth with attractive and 
sustained footfall of over 9 million per annum.
We believe that the assets are well placed to 
benefit from rental growth due to the combination 
of an affluent and growing local population, 
high occupancy and strong underlying retailer 
sales. Furthermore, having purchased from an 
institution, at acquisition we identified a number of 
opportunities to use our active asset management 
and risk‑controlled development approach to unlock 
capital growth.
We have been active in the year since acquisition, 
completing 23,300 sq ft of leasing activity with 
WH Smiths, Vodafone, Card Factory, Claire’s and 
McDonalds and improving the rental tone of the 
shopping centre by 15% which is already ahead 
of our underwriting assumptions. On 13 April 2017, 
following a comprehensive fit out, London based 
Morleys Department Stores opened at the centre 
in the 40,000 sq ft unit vacated by BHS in August 
2016. The opening of this new store has been a real 
success for Morleys, and we have benefitted from 
increased footfall across the rest of the shopping 
centre. After absorbing acquisition costs, we have 
already seen a 3.7% capital return in our first year 
of ownership, and as we underwrite all acquisitions 
on a five year view we have identified a number of 
other active asset management initiatives which we 
will roll out over the next few years.
We have worked in partnership with the London 
Borough of Bexley to design a masterplan for 
the shopping centre, retail park and surrounding 
council owned land. As part of this process we have 
identified the potential to build a number of towers 
in the airspace above our existing ownership, and 
whilst we are unlikely to build all of these towers, 
we have now included provision for up to 300 units 
within the ‘early feasibility stage’ section of our 
risk‑controlled development pipeline. Importantly, 
although we commissioned a structural assessment 
of the assets as part of our pre‑acquisition due 
diligence, we did not include any upside regarding 
the development potential in our conservative 
acquisition underwriting assumptions.
Dumfries
In June 2016, we completed the acquisition 
of Cuckoo Bridge Retail Park, Dumfries, in an 
off‑market transaction for total consideration of 
£20.2 million. The asset is 100% occupied and 
comprises 130,000 sq ft of income generating space 
across seven retail and two drive through units, with 
550 car park spaces. The acquisition equated to 
an equivalent yield of 7.9% with net rental income 
of £1.5 million per annum and a weighted average 
lease expiry at acquisition of 8.3 years. Cuckoo 
Bridge is the dominant retail park in Dumfries, with 
a strong and isolated catchment, and is located 
adjacent to a 24 hour T esco supermarket which 
provides the main food offer for the town. Anchored 
by Homebase, the retail park offers a good mix 
of occupiers including B&M, Poundstretcher, 
Laura Ashley, KFC and Costa Coffee.
At the time of acquisition, we identified several 
opportunities to drive income and capital growth 
by further improving the occupier line‑up and have 
Since 1 April 2016 we have completed £158.4 million of acquisitions in three separate transactions, at an average 
equivalent yield of 7.2%.

PROPERTY REVIEW CONTINUED 
28 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 having moved into advanced negotiations with 
a number of potential occupiers and purchasers, 
we requested and received a surrender premium 
of £10.8 million, having received £0.7 million of 
rent in the interim. While our plans are not final at 
this stage, it is likely we will subdivide the existing 
retail warehouse into 4‑5 units, build two drive 
through units in the car park and sell a portion of 
the site to a value food retailer or a self‑storage 
operator. Pleasingly, at 31 March 2017 the asset has 
been valued at over 50% more than our effective 
purchase price.
Profitable capital recycling
Since 1 April 2016 we have completed £10.7 million 
of disposals, on terms 7% ahead of valuation and 
almost 30% ahead of total cost (being purchase 
price plus subsequent capex).
During the year we completed the disposal of 
two assets which were acquired in July 2015 
as part of the Ramsay portfolio. At acquisition, 
the Ramsay portfolio included nine retail parks 
and four development sites located adjacent to 
upper‑quartile performing Morrison’s foodstores. 
In August 2016 we sold a development site in 
Newquay for £700,000, and in September we sold 
Leafield Retail Park in Dumfries for £2.7 million. 
These disposals were completed marginally ahead 
of March 2016 book value, and 33% ahead of the 
price paid in July 2015.
We made a number of disposals across our pub 
portfolio comprising pub sales to tenants, sales 
of non‑core ancillary land and the sale of our first 
convenience store. In total we sold seven pubs for 
£4.1 million, a 10% premium to March 2016 valuation, 
and over a 30% premium to purchase price. We 
sold two plots of land adjacent to pubs at the Royal 
Oak, Kings Bromley and the Ostrich Inn, Longford 
for £86,000 in aggregate. These plots were held 
at zero value, and so although small in size they 
demonstrate the incremental value we are able to 
extract from the pub portfolio.
In early 2017 we decided to test the convenience 
store investment market by offering the Spital 
Lane Co‑op, a c‑store pub conversion completed 
in April 2016 and let to the Co‑op on a 15 year 
RPI linked lease, for sale at auction. The auction 
was held in February 2017 and the c‑store was sold 
to a private investor for £970,000, representing 
an initial yield of 4.85%, and over 11% ahead 
of valuation.
We will continue to recycle mature assets, assets 
where our estimates of forward looking returns 
are below acceptable levels and assets where we 
believe that the risk profile has changed.
agreed heads of terms with a fashion/homeware 
occupier to introduce a 20,000 sq ft full line store 
subject to obtaining planning consent which is 
anticipated in the next few months.
Sheffield
In September 2016, we moved quickly to complete 
the acquisition of a retail warehouse in Sheffield 
from an open‑ended property fund for £17.9 million, 
representing an equivalent yield of 7.6%. The 11 acre 
site comprises a 110,000 sq ft retail warehouse unit 
and 580 car parking spaces, and is well located 
2.5 miles east of Sheffield city centre and in close 
proximity to Meadowhall shopping centre.
The asset presented an attractive value‑creating 
opportunity for NewRiver with the unit let to a home 
improvement retailer no longer in occupation due 
to over representation in the area. As we completed 
the acquisition, we simultaneously exchanged 
contracts with the home improvement retailer to 
accept a surrender premium of up to £12.25 million 
to release them from their lease obligations, 
meaning that in essence we acquired a prominently 
located retail warehouse for £6 million or less than 
£55 per sq ft in capital value terms. The timing of the 
surrender premium was flexible, and we had until 
early May 2017 to exercise the option.
Since acquisition, we have made good progress in 
our plans to reposition the asset and in March 2017,

STRATEGIC REPORT Our active asset management is a key driver of 
long‑term capital value and the generation of cash 
returns to shareholders.
We have an active and hands on approach to 
asset management utilising our in‑house expertise, 
a deep understanding of our market and strong 
relationships with our occupiers which means we are 
able to deliver the right space in the right locations.
Retail
We continued to sign leases on terms ahead of 
valuers’ estimates in the year, completing 333 new 
lettings and renewals across our retail portfolio, 
with long term deals secured on average 3.9% 
ahead of March 2016 ERV. These deals were 
spread evenly over the year, across 993,300 sq ft 
which is over 10% of the lettable space in our retail 
portfolio, reflecting our active asset management 
approach. Our increased scale means that we can 
offer occupiers the opportunity to complete deals on 
a portfolio basis and during the year we completed 
8 lease renewals with Peacocks/Edinburgh Woollen 
Mill across 54,400 sq ft, securing a 13.4% increase 
in passing rent to £634,000. This high volume of 
leasing activity means that our occupancy rate was 
97% at March 2017, a significant increase from 96% 
in March 2016.
Our average rents remain affordable at 
£12.45 per sq ft, with the increase from £12.14 
at March 2016 due predominantly to the assets 
purchased in Bexleyheath. The combination of 
our high occupancy and affordable average rents 
indicates to us that retailers are trading profitably 
at our assets, underpinning the sustainability of our 
income. This affordability will be further supported 
by the 2017 business rates revaluation, with draft 
rateable values showing that across our retail 
portfolio in England, Scotland and Wales rateable 
values will fall by over 19% on average, with over 
90% of our occupiers benefitting from this saving.
Footfall across the shopping centre portfolio totalled 
149 million during the year, up 0.5% compared to 
last year on a like‑for‑like basis and outperforming 
the national benchmark by 210 bps. Footfall 
was particularly strong at assets where we have 
recently completed active asset management 
or risk‑controlled development initiatives. For 
example, at The Forum Shopping Centre, Wallsend, 
like‑for‑like footfall was up 11%, due principally 
to the opening of a new 18,500 sq ft Aldi and 
1,450 sq ft Burger King in the second half of the year. 
Downward footfall movements were often linked 
to ongoing and planned development activity. For 
example, at the Abbey Centre, Newtownabbey, 
footfall was down almost 9% mainly due to the 
volume of ongoing development and enhancement 
works at the centre, such as the new Next anchor 
store which opened in December 2016, which we 
believe will drive future footfall. Reflecting the impact 
of our actions, we saw ERV growth of almost 7% in 
the year at the Abbey Centre, and a capital return of 
almost 3%.
A year ago we had exposure of 1% of total rent 
to BHS, spread across three centres. Ahead of 
the BHS administration, we advanced plans to 
secure alternative occupiers and we have made 
good progress in re‑letting these units. At the 
Abbey Centre, we agreed a temporary letting of 
the former BHS unit to Dunnes Stores, the leading 
Irish department store operator, to allow them to 
continue to trade whilst we extend their current unit 
by 15,000 sq ft. We have terms agreed with a best in 
class retailer to take occupation of the 40,000 sq ft 
former BHS unit at the end of the temporary Dunnes 
lease. At Priory Meadow, Hastings we have 
terms agreed with a major flagship retailer that 
we believe will be a major attraction to the 
centre and at the Burns Mall Shopping Centre, 
Kilmarnock, we are actively pursuing a subdivision 
and are in discussions with a range of retail and 
leisure operators.
As well as our shopping centre portfolio, we 
remained active across our retail warehouse 
portfolio. During the year we completed 
a comprehensive programme of asset management 
enhancements at Clough Road Retail Park in Hull, 
having acquired the asset in June 2014 as part of 
the Linear Portfolio. We paid £7.5 million for the 
95,500 sq ft park which was only 85% let, was in 
need of investment and had adjacent PC World and 
Currys units. Within a year of acquisition, we had let 
the vacant unit to Go Outdoors and the park was 
fully occupied. In the year under review, we signed 
a new 10 year lease with Currys and negotiated 
the surrender of the PC World unit, which we then 
sub‑divided and re‑let to Office Outlet and Halfords 
at an improved rental level. In November 2016, we 
completed the construction of a Costa coffee pod in 
the car park, signed on a 15 year lease, taking total 
investment in the asset to £1.2 million, and driving 
a valuation uplift since acquisition of over 30%.

Marketing & commercialisation
The principal objective of our shopping centre 
marketing is to drive footfall, dwell time and spend 
because if our retailers are successful, our shopping 
centres and our business are successful. We seek 
to achieve these marketing objectives by delivering 
an outstanding customer experience through 
innovative, high‑quality and consistent marketing.
In today’s retail and leisure environment achieving 
these objectives requires highly targeted, smart and 
creative marketing by working in close partnership 
with our retailers to ensure that our marketing 
achieves the greatest return on investment. 
Successful engagement with our shoppers and 
retailers relies on a detailed understanding of our 
shoppers’ needs and the goals and challenges of 
our retailers. T o this effect, this year we have begun 
developing bespoke retailer campaigns that utilise 
the brands of the world‑class retailers we have 
within our portfolio to deliver marketing campaigns 
that integrate the brick and click by driving click and 
collect usage for our physical store retailers.
Our 33 shopping centres are convenience‑led, 
community‑focused retail and leisure hubs so 
providing consistent convenience, affordability and 
accessibility is paramount. Our 2017 shopping centre 
consumer surveys reported a 4‑fold increase in the 
usage of click and collect at our centres, with 2.3% of 
shoppers who visited using click and collect, up from 
0.6% in 2015. In 2017, the average click and collect 
spend (online spend collected at the centre) was 
£44. Importantly, 57% of those shoppers went on to 
make an additional spend of £24.82 on retail and 
24% made an additional spend of £5.40 on catering. 
The NewRiver click and collect shopper is therefore 
worth an average of £60 versus the non‑click and 
collect shopper who is spending £25.46 on average 
per visit. In summary, from 2015 we have grown 
click and collect user volumes by almost four times, 
those shoppers are worth over twice as much as 
the non‑user and are a highly valuable customer to 
target for the benefit of our retailers.
We are working on ways to bridge the gap between 
online and offline shopping across our portfolio and 
channel customer spend back into store. During 
this financial year we ran a sector‑first marketing 
initiative with Amazon called “Lucky Codes”, 
becoming the first UK shopping centre owner to 
partner with Amazon in a bespoke campaign to 
drive awareness and usage of the Amazon Lockers 
located at 20 of our centres. Importantly, it was an 
exciting opportunity for us to offer our customers 
new ways to shop with us. Click and collect works 
well for both our customers and our shopping 
centres. Our customers enjoy free and convenient 
deliveries and returns whilst our centres benefit 
from uplifts in sales and footfall as a result of people 
choosing the lockers as their means of delivery.
The Outcome:
• Lucky Codes rewarded customers using the 
lockers and shopping in the centre between 
Black Friday (25 November 2016) through to 
2 December 2016 and featured a fully integrated 
marketing campaign.
• The campaign was targeted specifically at the 
over 35 age bracket linked to research recently 
published by Savills that the Over 35’s are the 
largest users of click and collect, with a large 
number owning their own houses, cars and 
having families as well as being primary shoppers 
within the NewRiver portfolio. We therefore saw 
an opportunity to capture a new customer within 
our catchments.
• 18,000 emails were issued from Amazon to 
their Amazon customers within the postcode 
sectors of all 20 participating centres. That email 
achieved a 28% open‑rate, being opened by over 
5,000 customers who are now aware they can 
click and collect at our centres.
• As a result of the campaign, footfall across the 
participating centres was +4% and was +2% 
ahead of the target.
• Amazon Locker usage was up +40% and +30% 
ahead of target.
We continue to drive our marketing forward 
creating significant economies of scale as we drive 
innovation, improve sophistication, consistency 
and co‑ordination at a corporate and asset level in 
a variety of ways to ensure our shoppers are happy 
and our marketing is achieving the greatest return 
on investment for our retailers.
34 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Increasing the volume of commercialisation activity 
across our retail portfolio has been an area of focus 
for NewRiver for a number of years, as it represents 
a significant opportunity to generate incremental 
income from our existing assets as well as 
increasing customer dwell time and basket spend. 
During the year to March 2017, commercialisation 
income grew by an impressive 41% to £3.2 million 
from £2.3 million in March 2016. Whilst this increase 
was fuelled by acquisitions, even on a like‑for‑like 
basis the growth was still almost 9%.
Highlights for the year have included investing 
in purpose‑built kiosks for temporary promotions 
to improve mall aesthetics. They have also 
generated increased income and a second phase 
of investment is now underway. We have seen 
a dramatic improvement in mall aesthetics with over 
80 bespoke mall kiosks now installed, 26 of which 
are independent retailers all investing in a future 
with NewRiver. At Bexleyheath we have introduced 
Krispy Kreme and Mr Pretzels to our portfolio, both 
of which are now in discussions to expand across 
other centres in the portfolio.
During the year we signed ten year leases with our 
preferred mobile phone accessories operator, T op 
Gift, which include scheduled kiosk upgrades to 
keep the offer fresh. Contracts are now also in place 
with Elonex for the installation of digital advertising 
screens in the 17 centres and four further centres 
now have large format external advertising panels.

PROPERTY REVIEW CONTINUED – ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT
In October 2013, we acquired a portfolio of 202 
pubs from Marston’s Plc (the ‘Trent’ portfolio). 
Each pub in the portfolio was handpicked by 
management for its high roadside visibility, high 
passing footfall and prominent location, with the 
intention of converting a significant number of 
them for retail/residential use. The pubs in the 
portfolio traded strongly, with high occupancy and 
strong income returns, and consequently in August 
2015 we acquired a second portfolio of 158 pubs 
from Punch Taverns (the ‘Mantle’ portfolio). We 
have since sold nine pubs, many of which were to 
existing tenants, and closed seven for convenience 
store conversion meaning we now have 344 pubs 
remaining in our portfolio.
At the time of the Trent portfolio acquisition, we 
signed a four year leaseback agreement with 
Marston’s Plc, which comes to an end at the end 
of 2017. We have been active in negotiating the 
transfer of a number of pubs in advance of the 
deadline, with 35 pubs transferred to NewRiver with 
existing tenancies in place and 9 pubs transferred 
to be operated by L T Management, the specialist 
pub management company that already manages 
the Mantle portfolio on our behalf. Further to these 
transfers, in December 2016 we secured contracted 
income on 22 pubs by surrendering the leaseback 
arrangement 13 months early and agreeing new 
15 year RPI linked leases with Marston’s PLC.
We have in place a structured programme to 
transfer the remaining 123 Trent pubs to the 
management of NewRiver and L T Management, 
and through a detailed estate review, involving 
all relevant stakeholders, we have split the 
transfer into small batches in order to manage 
the programme effectively. The first tranche of 
pubs will be transferred in May 2017 with the last 
batch transferring by the end of the agreement. 
Throughout the programme our team will be 
visiting each site and working with the publicans to 
ensure a smooth transition. We are confident that 
the majority of publicans will remain in their pubs 
during the transfer and our operations managers 
and instructed solicitors will ensure that new leases 
and tenancies are implemented seamlessly. For 
the minority of pubs where the publican intends 
to vacate, we will implement our tried and tested 
lettings programme to recruit high quality publicans 
who will continue to grow the business. Throughout 
the transfer programme we are working closely with 
Marston’s to ensure that the process is as smooth 
as possible.

Company Update, with one additional pub added subsequently
Across our entire pub portfolio we are making 
targeted capital investment in order to drive trade 
and increase values. Since 1 April 2016, we have 
completed works on nine of our pubs, investing 
more than £100,000 in projects including external 
redecoration and improved signage to enhance 
curb appeal, internal refurbishment to enhance 
the customer experience and extensive works to 
improve kitchens, toilets and tenant accommodation. 
At those pubs where we have completed 
refurbishment works we have seen significant 
improvements to both rental income and sales 
volumes, and we have a further £2.3 million of capital 
expenditure planned over the next twelve months.
Lastly, as part of the 2017 business rates revaluation 
our pub operators will save 40% on average on 
business rates from 1 April 2017 when the business 
rate relief threshold rose from £6,000 to £12,000.

We have made significant progress on our 
risk‑controlled development pipeline which 
now totals 1.9 million sq ft (1.4 million sq ft in the 
near‑term) across our retail (1,653,100 sq ft) and 
pub (271,500 sq ft) portfolios, and which we 
believe will be a key driver of long term returns 
for our shareholders.
Our development strategy includes:
• Regeneration of existing space (e.g. new food 
court at Montague Centre, Worthing)
• Development of sites acquired in portfolio 
acquisitions (e.g. Canvey Island retail park)
• Capitalising on opportunities above or adjacent 
to existing assets (e.g. Cowley, Oxford, new build 
c‑store/residential development)
• Complete redevelopment of existing 
assets (e.g. Burgess Hill, c‑store/residential 
pub conversions)
PROPERTY REVIEW CONTINUED
Risk-controlled development
During the period, we completed 77,100 sq ft of 
development across 11 assets, with 26,000 sq ft 
of development currently under construction.
Since the start of the period, we have secured 
planning permission for 192,900 sq ft of 
development, including Canvey Island Retail Park 
and an 85 bedroom hotel in Romford. We have 
submitted planning applications on 384,800 sq ft 
of development, including 236,000 sq ft mixed‑use 
regeneration in Cowley, Oxford and a 100 unit 
residential scheme in Stamford.
Retail
Completed in period/Under construction
Abbey Centre, Newtownabbey: At the Abbey 
Centre, located 6 miles to the north of Belfast, a new 
44,000 sq ft Next anchor store was handed over 
for fit‑out in August 2016 on schedule and within 
budget and Next were delighted with the finished 
product. The store opened on 14 December 2016 
40 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and we understand that early trading has been 
ahead of forecast. We are now on‑site with the 
subsequent phase of development works at the 
centre, constructing a 15,000 sq ft extension to 
create a 35,000 sq ft flagship unit for Dunnes Stores, 
the leading Irish department store operator, which 
we will hand over for fit‑out works by the end of the 
summer 2017.
Planning granted
Canvey Island: We acquired the site in Canvey Island, 
Essex, in July 2015 as part of the Ramsay portfolio, 
and submitted a planning application in June 2016 
to create a 62,000 sq ft (87 ,000 sq ft including 
mezzanine) retail park. We received planning 
consent in early November 2016, and this consent 
was granted with no section 106 requirement nor 
any restriction on opening hours. The park is already 
52% pre‑let to B&M and Sports Direct, with a further 
23% in solicitors’ hands. This pre‑letting activity has 
significantly de‑risked the development, and so it is 
our intention to begin onsite works within the next 
six months.
Burgess Hill: We secured full detailed planning 
consent for our £65 million mixed‑use 
redevelopment of Burgess Hill town centre in 
March 2016. The 465,000 sq ft project will provide 
a 10‑screen multiplex cinema, a 63 bed hotel pre‑let 
to Travelodge, a higher quality retail offer and new 
restaurant and leisure provisions, 174 additional car 
park spaces and an improved public realm, together 
with 142 new residential units and a new purpose 
built library. In the first half of the financial year, 
we exchanged contracts with Cineworld so that at 
30 September 2016, the retail and leisure element 
of the scheme was 41% pre‑let. Since then we have 
exchanged contracts on a further 24,500 sq ft with 
Next and Nandos, meaning that the retail and leisure 
element of the scheme is now 49% pre‑let, with 
a further 10% in solicitors’ hands. On the residential 
element of the scheme, we have terms agreed with 
a residential investment company for a significant 
pre‑sale.
In order to facilitate the development, we have 
agreed terms with Lidl and Iceland to surrender and 
relocate to sites adjacent to the shopping centre, as 
well as agreeing to re‑locate the local council owned 
library. All of this progress means that we hope to be 
in a position to start on site later in the summer.
In planning
Cowley, Oxford: T emplars Square shopping centre 
has been at the heart of Cowley, less than 2 miles 
from Oxford city centre, for over fifty years and its 
future success is of great importance to the local 
community. We have owned T emplars Square 
since December 2012 and in November 2016 we 
submitted a planning application for a 236,000 sq ft 
mixed‑use development to rejuvenate the shopping 
centre, meet strong demand for new housing in 
the local area and add a much needed choice of 
restaurants and hotels to Cowley. The development 
will include a 71‑bed hotel, 226 new residential 
apartments, modernised car parks and major 
improvement of the public realm. The leisure 
element of the scheme is already 82% pre‑let, 
having exchanged contracts with Travelodge 
last year.
A combination of rationalisation of the existing 
car park provision, capitalising on the air space 
above the centre and site assembly have enabled 
a proposal with significant massing. The existing 
shopping centre will continue to trade throughout 
and we are confident that its rental tone will benefit 
from the improvement works. Having completed 
a comprehensive programme of community 
engagement and consultation both prior to and 
following the submission of our planning application, 
we anticipate that our planning application will be 
determined at Planning Committee in July 2017.
Stamford: We acquired the 8 acre site in Stamford, 
Lincolnshire, in July 2015 as part of the Ramsay 
portfolio, along with our Canvey Island development 
site and two other development sites. The site 
is well located less than 1 mile from the centre 
of Stamford and in March 2017 we submitted an 
outline planning application for the provision of up 
to 100 dwellings comprising a mix of house types 
and tenures.
Pre-planning
Capitol Shopping Centre, Cardiff: We are in 
pre‑application consultation with Cardiff Council to 
bring forward a major re‑positioning of the Capitol 
Shopping Centre, acquired in January 2016 as part 
of the Neptune Portfolio. The centre is well located 
in the city centre, benefitting from a high volume 
of commuter traffic from Cardiff Queen Street 
Station as well as a significant student population. 
We plan to reposition the centre as a mixed retail 
and leisure destination, and construct 400 student 
accommodation units in the air space above 
the centre.
Early feasibility stages
We believe that our risk‑controlled development 
pipeline will be a key driver of future growth and we 
are currently reviewing a number of medium‑term 
opportunities across our retail portfolio. These 
opportunities include 127,600 sq ft of extensions 
across our shopping centre portfolio and over 
250,000 sq ft of residential potential above our 
Greater London shopping centres in Bexleyheath 
and Penge.

Pubs
As well as generating high levels of low risk cash 
returns, our portfolio of 344 pubs contains a number 
of inbuilt value creating development opportunities. 
These include the potential to build convenience 
stores or residential units on surplus land adjacent to 
pubs which was effectively acquired with zero value, 
and opportunities to convert pubs into convenience 
stores or residential units.
Convenience stores
We signed a conditional agreement with the 
Co‑operative in September 2014, which was varied 
in January 2016, to deliver up to 45 c‑stores for 
fixed lease terms of 15 years at rents ranging from 
£15.00‑17.50 per sq ft, with RPI linked increases 
capped at 4% and collared at 1%. In January 2017, 
we signed a supplemental agreement with the 
Co‑operative revising this number to 40 c‑stores. 
The agreement also includes performance fees of 
up to £3.4 million, with the first payment triggered by 
the delivery of our 15
th
 c‑store to the Co‑operative, 
which we expect to occur in the first half of the next 
financial year.
T o date we have handed over 11 c‑stores 
to the Co‑op, with eight c‑stores totalling 
29,800 sq ft handed over since 1 April 2016. Of 
the stores delivered to date, eight utilised surplus 
land adjacent to the existing pubs, two were pub 
conversions and one was a new build on a site 
previously occupied by a pub. We completed our 
first c‑store disposal, selling the Spital Lane Co‑op 
for £970,000 in February 2017, representing an initial 
yield of 4.85% and over 11% ahead of valuation.
We are on site for the construction of a further three 
c‑stores totalling 11,000 sq ft and we have consent to 
construct a further 15 totalling 53,400 sq ft.

Our pubs portfolio development pipeline includes

55 pub sites. T o date we have received planning 
consent for 71 residential units across 25 pub sites, 
with consent received for 50 units across 16 pub 
sites in the current financial year. Using our in‑house 
residential planning expertise, our strategy with 
these residential opportunities is to create value 
by obtaining planning consent, and then to realise 
value by selling on to local developers. We currently 
have 13 opportunities on the market, five of which 
are in solicitors’ hands at pricing ahead of March 
2017 valuation.

“ The Co‑op has had a brilliant impact on  
the pub and already business at the start  
of this year has been much better than last 
year. Previously, people used to visit the 
small shopping precinct across the road  
and didn’t see the pub, but now that the 
Co‑op is here there is more passing trade 
and more people notice the pub and  
come in for a drink. Having the Co‑op 
here is definitely a bonus.”

• Refinanced debt on the Trent portfolio with major US insurance company
• Reducing the cost of the facility by 30%
• Increasing the cash returns from the pubs
Disciplined stock selection
In October 2013 we acquired a portfolio of 202 pubs from Marston’s Plc (‘Trent’ 
portfolio), each was handpicked by for its high roadside visibility, passing footfall 
and prominent location.
Due to the success of the Trent portfolio, in August 2015 we acquired a portfolio 
of 158 public houses from Punch Taverns (‘Mantle’ portfolio).

Active asset management
On acquisition of the Trent portfolio, Marston’s entered into a leaseback 
agreement to manage and operate the portfolio as pubs on our behalf, which 
expires at the end of 2017. Ahead of this expiry we are now in the process of 
transferring the management of the Trent pubs from Marston’s.
In December 2016 we secured contracted income on 22 pubs by surrendering 
the leaseback arrangement early and agreeing new 15 year RPI linked leases 
with Marston’s PLC.
Risk-controlled development
Following the Trent portfolio acquisition, we signed a conditional agreement 
with the Co‑operative to deliver up to 40 c‑stores for fixed lease terms of 
15 years at rents ranging from £15.00‑17.50 per sq ft, with RPI linked increases 
capped at 4% and collared at 1%.
• 11 c‑stores completed and handed over to the Co‑op to date
• 3 currently under construction
• 15 with planning granted
• 5 in planning

FINANCIAL REVIEW
“ Our convenience‑led, community focused 
retail & leisure portfolio has delivered 
another highly profitable year for our 
shareholders”
Mark Davies
Chief Financial Officer
Key performance measures
The Group financial statements are prepared under 
IFRS where the Group’s interests in joint ventures 
are shown as a single line item on the income 
statement and balance sheet (in accordance with 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements) and all subsidiaries are 
consolidated at 100%.
Management reviews the performance of the 
business principally on a proportionally consolidated 
basis which includes the Group’s share of joint 
ventures on a line‑by‑line basis. The Group’s 
financial key performance indicators are also 
presented on this basis.
Alternative Performance Measures (‘ APMs’), 
being financial measures which are not specified 
under IFRS, are also used by Management 
to assess the Group’s performance. These 
APMs include a number of European Public Real 
Estate Association (‘EPRA’) measures, prepared 
in accordance with the EPRA Best Practice 
Recommendations (BPR) reporting framework. 
We report a number of these measures because 
Management considers them to improve the 
transparency and relevance of our published 
results as well as the comparability with 
other listed European real estate companies. 
Definitions for APMs are included in the Glossary. 
The measures used in this review are all 
APMs presented on a proportionally consolidated 
basis unless otherwise stated.
The APM on which Management places most focus, 
reflecting the Company’s commitment to driving 
cash income returns and growing the dividend, is 
Funds From Operations (‘FFO’). We feel that this 
measure is most appropriate when considering 
our dividend policy as it is a cash measure and 
it is familiar to non‑property and international 
investors. FFO is a Company measure determined 
by cash profits which includes realised recurring 
cash profits, realised cash profits or losses on the 
sale of properties and excludes other one off or 
non‑cash adjustments. Previously, we referred to 
this measure as EPRA Adjusted earnings.
Overview
Our convenience‑led, community‑focused  
retail and leisure portfolio has delivered another 
highly profitable year for our shareholders, with 
FFO increasing by 23.6% to £58.2 million, from 
£47.1 million in FY16. FFO per share was 24.9 pence, 
and our ordinary dividend per share increased by 
8.1% to 20.0 pence (FY16: 18.5 pence).

= Cash returns 
48 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Reflecting our commitment to continue to deliver 
growing cash returns to shareholders, we declared 
a special dividend of 3.0 pence per share taking 
our fully covered total dividend for the year to 
23.0 pence, an increase on FY16 of 24.3%. Including 
the special dividend and based on our opening 
EPRA NAV per share, we provided a high income 
yield of 7.8% to our shareholders.
IFRS Profit for the period after tax of £36.2 million 
decreased by £33.2 million from £69.4 million in 
FY16 due predominantly to £24.0 million of non‑cash 
property revaluation surplus generated in FY16, 
compared to a decline of £15.4 million and some 
mark to market non‑cash adjustments to interest 
rate instruments in the current year.
IFRS net assets have proved robust decreasing 
by only 0.8% to £684.5 million, from £689.9 million 
at 31 March 2016. When our portfolio was last 
independently valued in September 2016 we 
reported IFRS net assets of £674.6 million, 
reflecting exceptional costs linked to our move 
to the Main Market as well as the adverse impact 
of the EU Referendum on our portfolio valuation, 
and so we are pleased to report a positive NAV 
performance in the second half of the year. EPRA 
NAV per share decreased by 1.0% to 292 pence per 
share, from 295 pence per share at 31 March 2016.
Our operations are underpinned by a conservatively 
positioned balance sheet which we have maintained 
well within our stated Financial Policies, with L TV of 
37% (March 2016: 27%) and interest cover of 4.5x 
Highlights
• FFO increased by 23.6% to £58.2 million 
(FY16: £47.1 million) delivering an FFO per share  
of 24.9 pence
• Ordinary dividend per share increased by 8.1% to 
20.0 pence (FY16: 18.5 pence) and fully covered  
in line with Company’s Financial Policy
• Special dividend declared of 3.0 pence per share 
taking total dividend to 23.0 pence, an increase  
of 24.3% on prior year
• FY18 first quarter dividend announced today 
of 5.25 pence per share, an increase of 5.0% 
(Q1 FY17: 5.00 pence)
• EPRA NAV per share decreased by 1.0% to 
292 pence (March 2016: 295 pence); increased 
from 290 pence reported in H1 due to capital 
return of +0.5% in H2 
• IFRS profit after tax of £36.2 million 
(FY16: £69.4 million) including £19.4 million of 
non‑cash fair value reductions; IFRS basic EPS 
15.5 pence (FY16 39.2 pence); IFRS net assets 
£684.5 million (March 2016: £689.9 million)
• T otal accounting return (dividend paid basis) 
+5.7%; total accounting return (dividend declared 
basis) +6.8%
• Loan to value increased to 37% (March 2016: 27%) 
due to £158.4 million of acquisitions completed 
in the period; well within the Company’s stated 
Financial Policy 
• Cost of debt 3.5% (March 2016: 3.7%); interest 
cover of 4.5x (March 2016: 4.3x) 
• Refinancing exercise underway, expected to 
complete in FY18 with Management intending to 
increase maturity and convert the majority of the 
Company’s debt to unsecured
(March 2016: 4.3x). The increase in L TV was due 
predominantly to the acquisition of our assets in 
Bexleyheath which completed in April 2016, and on 
a proforma basis our L TV at March 2016 was 35%. 
This acquisition was completed utilising our existing 
cash resources and taking on a new debt facility, 
which, along with our other refinancing activities, 
contributed to the reduction in our cost of debt  
from 3.7% in March 2016 to 3.5% in March 2017.
The provider of the new facility, DekaBank, was 
keen to put in place a longer term loan but we 
agreed to just a two year maturity, knowing that 
a balance sheet refinance in the near future would 
be a more effective longer term solution. This meant 
that as at 31 March 2017 our weighted average debt 
maturity was deliberately lower at 2.5 years.
We recently appointed Rothschild & Co as 
independent debt advisor to assist Management 
in completing this refinancing in the next twelve 
months. A low debt maturity puts the Company 
in the best possible position to complete this 
exercise in a cost‑efficient and timely manner, 
maximising the cost benefit to our shareholders. 
As part of the proposed refinancing, we intend to 
increase our debt maturity and become an issuer 
of unsecured debt.
Reflecting our confidence in the strength and 
sustainability of our underlying cash profits, 
the Board has approved a Q1 FY18 dividend of 
5.25 pence per share, a further increase of 5%  
(Q1 FY17 5.00 pence).

50 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Group net property income increased by 47% 
to £80.4 million, from £54.6 million in FY16. This 
increase was due primarily to £158.4 million of 
acquisition activity completed in the current year, 
as well as the full year impact of acquisition activity 
completed in the year to March 2016.
On a proportionally consolidated basis, net property 
income increased by 33.5% to £89.7 million, from 
£67.2 million in FY16 with the key driver being the 
acquisition activity described above.
The full year impact of net acquisitions completed 
in the year to March 2016 added £5.9 million to 
net property income. Current year net acquisitions 
added £8.7 million to net property income. In 
April 2016, we acquired the Broadway Shopping 
Centre and the Broadway Square Retail Park in 
Bexleyheath for a total cost of £120.3 million. In 
June 2016 we completed the acquisition of Cuckoo 
Bridge Retail Park in Dumfries for £20.2 million and 
in September 2016 we completed the acquisition of 
a retail warehouse in Sheffield for £17.9 million.
Linked to our acquisition in Sheffield, as well as 
receiving rent from the date of acquisition we also 
received a surrender premium from the incumbent 
occupier. Including rent received and the premium 
itself, receipts totalled £11.5 million.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by 7.1% during 
the year, to £13.6 million from £12.7 million in FY16, 
but importantly our cost ratio reduced to 15.1% 
(FY16: 18.5%) demonstrating the benefits of  
scale to the business.
In addition to these administrative costs, 
we incurred exceptional costs of £1.2 million 
(March 2016: £0.9 million) linked to our move to 
the Main Market which completed in August 2016. 
While the Main Market move costs of £2.1 million 
are significant, we are confident that the benefits 
of access to a wider pool of capital and improved 
liquidity in our shares will outweigh this cost over the 
longer term. We qualified for the FTSE 250, All‑Share 
and EPRA indices in December 2016, and have 
already welcomed a number of new shareholders 
to our share register as a consequence.
Net financing costs
In FY17, net financing costs increased by 10.3% 
to £17.1 million from £15.5 million in FY16. Over the 
same period, our property portfolio has increased by 
16.5% to £1,130.6 million, which is significantly more 
than the increase in finance costs. This differential 
is caused by our growing scale and the reduction in 
our cost of debt from 3.7% to 3.5% due to refinancing 
activity completed in the year, which is explained in 
the ‘Net debt & financing’ section of this Review.
Profit on disposal of investment properties
During the year ended 31 March 2017 we completed 
a modest level of property disposals compared 
to the prior year, reflecting the slowdown in the 
investment market following the EU Referendum 
in June 2016. The proceeds of our disposals were 
£10.7 million at NewRiver share, and these disposals 
were completed at a premium to book value of 
£0.3 million. This level of activity compares to 
£48.2 million of disposals completed in the year 
to March 2016, at a premium to book value of 
£8.3 million.
Profitable capital recycling is a key aspect of our 
business model, and we remain committed to 
recycling mature assets, assets where our estimates 
of forward looking returns are below acceptable 
levels and assets where we believe that the risk 
profile has changed.
Taxation
As a REIT, the Company is not exposed to tax 
on qualifying UK property rental income and 
gains arising from disposal of exempt property 
assets. In the year ended March 2017, we incurred 
a corporation tax charge of £1.2 million, compared 
to a £0.1 million charge incurred in the year to 
March 2016.
The majority of the charge incurred relates to 
income received from the Mantle portfolio of pubs, 
which we purchased from Punch Taverns in August 
2015. The occupational agreement for some of 
these pubs is on a ‘managed’ basis, which means 
that we receive a profit from the pubs rather than 
just a rental income.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
On 16 May 2017 we also announced our ordinary 
dividend for the first quarter of FY18 of 5.25 pence, 
an increase of 5.0% from the 5.00 pence paid in 
the first quarter of FY17. The ordinary dividend will 
be paid on 4 August 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 16 June 2017. The 
ex‑dividend date will be 15 June 2017. The quarterly 
dividend will be payable as a REIT Property Income 
Distribution (PID).
Balance sheet
EPRA net assets include a number of adjustments 
to the IFRS reported net assets and both measures 
are presented above on a proportionally 
consolidated basis.
Net assets
At 31 March 2017, IFRS net assets decreased by 
0.8% to £684.5 million, from £689.9 million at 
Our growing dividend
At NewRiver, we are proud of our track record 
of delivering a growing ordinary dividend to our 
shareholders, and we are committed to maintaining 
this discipline in the future. Our dividend policy is 
driven by two key objectives:
• Growing cash FFO and FFO per share so that 
we can continue to pay a growing and fully 
covered dividend
• The REIT requirement to pay out at least 90% 
of recurring cash profits
We are committed to a fully covered dividend, and 
this is one of our four key Financial Policies. Our 
Financial Policies are explained in the ‘Net debt & 
financing’ section of this Review.
In FY17, we increased our ordinary dividend by 
8.1% to 20.0 pence, from 18.5 pence in FY16. 
Further to this, on 16 May 2017 we announced an 
additional 3.0 pence special dividend linked to the 
retail warehouse acquisition in Sheffield which we 
completed in September 2016. We acquired the 
Sheffield asset for £17.9 million, and during the year 
we received a surrender premium and rent from 
the incumbent occupier totalling £11.5 million, the 
majority of which we will pay to our shareholders as 
a special dividend. The special dividend will be paid 
on 4 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at 
close of business on 16 June 2017. The ex‑dividend 
date will be 15 June 2017. The dividend will be 
payable as a REIT Property Income Distribution (PID).
31 March 2016. This decrease is after absorbing 
purchase costs on £158.4 million of acquisitions, one 
off Main Market move costs and a 0.6% reduction in 
capital values. At 30 September 2016 we reported 
IFRS net assets of £674.6 million, and so in the 
second half of the financial year we saw an increase 
in net assets, driven by a capital return across our 
portfolio of 0.5%.
EPRA net assets (‘EPRA NAV’) is calculated by 
adjusting IFRS net assets to reflect the potential 
impact of dilutive ordinary shares, and to remove 
the fair value of any derivatives held on the balance 
sheet. These adjustments are made with the aim of 
improving comparability with other European real 
estate companies. EPRA NAV per share decreased 
by 1.0% to 292 pence per share, from 295 pence per 
share at 31 March 2016.

Net debt increased by £156.2 million in the period predominantly due to £162.2 million of acquisitions 
(including purchase costs). This included our largest acquisition to date in Bexleyheath where we purchased 
a retail park and shopping centre for £120.3 million.
Net cash inflow from operations was £60.0 million, £1.8 million in excess of FFO and demonstrating the highly 
cash generative nature of our business and our efficient working capital management. We paid £46.0 million 
of dividends to our shareholders, being 19.75 pence on a per share basis.
We completed £11.3 million of disposals in the year on terms 7% above valuation, including £5.2 million of 
disposals across our pub portfolio and the disposal of two assets from our Ramsay retail warehouse portfolio, 
totalling £3.4 million.
We invested £17.3 million into our portfolio, either through active asset management initiatives or on our 
risk‑controlled developments. During the year we spent £6.7 million on our pub portfolio, principally on the 
construction of eight convenience stores for the Co‑operative, £1.3 million on asset enhancement works on 
the Piazza in Paisley, £1.2 million at The Forum in Wallsend (including a drive through unit for Burger King) and 
£0.8 million at Clough Road Retail Park in Hull where we sub‑divided and re‑let the former PC World unit and 
constructed a Costa coffee pod in the car park.
53 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Our conservative Financial Policies were put 
in place in consultation with shareholders and 
form a key component of our financial risk 
management strategy.
• Our Loan to Value was 37% at 31 March 2017, 
increased from 27% at 31 March 2016 due to the 
£158.4 million of acquisitions made in the period. 
Our balance sheet gearing increased to 52% 
from 29% in the year, again due to acquisitions 
completed. Both of these measures are 
significantly below our stated upper limits, but we 
are comfortable at these levels and do not intent 
to increase our Loan to Value or balance sheet 
gearing in the near term.
• Our interest cover was 4.5x at 
31 March 2017, increased from 4.3x in March 2016 
and significantly ahead of our financing policy 
which requires a minimum cover of 2.0x.
• Our dividend cover, calculated with reference 
to FFO per share and including both 
ordinary and special dividends, was 108% at 
31 March 2017, in line with our policy of at least 
100% dividend cover.
Financing
We attribute significant value to the strength of the 
relationships we enjoy with our lenders, and during 
FY17 we continued to build on our existing strong 
relationships with Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Lloyds 
and AIG, as well as establishing a new relationship 
with DekaBank.
The DekaBank facility formed part of our largest 
acquisition to date in Bexleyheath where we 
purchased a retail park and shopping centre for 
£120.3 million in April 2016. This acquisition was part 
funded by a new £49 million facility with DekaBank, 
at an all in cost of 2.2%.
In July 2016 we signed an improved £85.3 million 
debt facility with AIG on our pub and convenience 
store portfolio. Under the terms of the new facility, 
the bank margin was reduced by 30% and the 
loan maturity was extended from 2018 to 2021. 
Following this refinancing activity, our weighted 
average interest rate reduced to 3.5%, from 3.7% 
at March 2016.
Our weighted average debt maturity is deliberately 
low at 2.5 years, and in February 2017 we appointed 
Rothschild & Co as our independent debt advisor to 
assist Management in completing a balance sheet 
refinancing exercise. Unhindered by legacy debt 
issues and with a low debt maturity we are well 
placed to complete this exercise in a cost‑efficient 
manner, maximising the benefit to our shareholders. 
Our strategy is to refinance almost all of our existing 
secured facilities with a range of unsecured facilities, 
significantly extending our weighted average debt 
maturity and reducing our cost of debt. Balance 
sheet scale and a strong interest cover are important 
factors in our ability to achieve this objective and we 
believe that our conservative Financial Policies leave 
us well placed.
Summary
We have built a highly cash generative and 
profitable business that has once again delivered 
a fully covered and growing cash dividend 
to our shareholders. Looking ahead, with the 
positive feedback we have already received at 
this early stage of our refinancing exercise, and 
with our ongoing active asset management and 
risk‑controlled development initiatives, we feel 
confident in our ability to continue to deliver a fully 
covered and growing dividend to our shareholders.

management on a day‑to‑day basis and monitors 
strategic and other risks. It delegates accountability 
for risk management to the asset managers and 
monitors their performance.
The Asset Manager is responsible for risk within 
their portfolio of assets and ensures that they are 
within the risk appetite set by the Board. Regular 
reviews are undertaken of the assets which include 
monitoring risk levels.
A risk and internal controls assessment register has 
been produced covering the following areas:
• General Commercial
• Financial
• Compliance
• Asset Management, including shopping centres, 
retail warehouses and pubs
• Development, including health & safety
The register is maintained by the Company 
Secretary in consultation with the asset managers 
and development team within the Group and is 
reviewed at each Audit Committee meeting. 
The register is run on a traffic lights system with:
• Red being high risk both in terms of impact 
and likelihood;
• Amber being medium risk with high impact but 
low likelihood;
• Y ellow being low risk with low impact but high 
likelihood; and 
• Green being low risk in terms of both impact 
and likelihood.

How it links to our 
strategic priorities
General Commercial
Economic recession due to 
uncertainty from Brexit and 
world events
This is a red risk, 
both in terms 
of impact and 
likelihood
Macro‑economic and property market reviews are 
considered at each Board meeting and ongoing 
updates are evaluated by the Executive Committee 
with the view to limit the impact such a recession 
might have on the Group
1 2 3 4 5
Future Government policy 
which adversely affects the 
Company’s ability to manage 
its assets effectively
This is a red risk, 
both in terms 
of impact and 
likelihood
The Executive Committee considers regular 
updates from its external advisers and the 
Company is a member of various industry bodies, 
with representatives on advisory panels
1 2 3 4 5
Corporate Strategy and Performance
Failure to communicate 
sufficiently and effectively 
with investors, leading to 
a depressed share price and 
demand for equity
This is an amber  
risk, with high 
impact but low 
likelihood
There is a full programme of investor meetings 
throughout the year as well as specific rounds  
of meetings post half and full‑year results
4
Growth in online retail spend 
could be perceived as 
a threat to traditional bricks 
and mortar retailers
This is an amber  
risk, with high 
impact but 
low likelihood
The management team are embracing the digital 
age as part of the strategy for the shopping 
centres, working with online retailers such as 
Amazon to offer “click and collect” lockers, as 
well as our traditional retailers to offer click and 
collect facilities. This helps drive footfall to the 
centres. Management also commissioned research 
on the future of the retail sector. It found that the 
55+ age bracket is set to account for 57.5% of 
all store and click and collect sales growth in the 
next ten years. The same age bracket also shop 
more frequently and prefer the convenience and 
accessibility of retails parks and convenience led 
shopping centres, all of which are included within 
our portfolio. In addition, 48% of NewRiver’s 150m 
annual footfall are shoppers aged 55+

Financial
Breach of debt covenants 
could trigger loan defaults 
and repayment of facilities 
putting pressure on surplus 
cash resources
This is an amber 
risk, with high 
impact but 
low likelihood
Management actively engages with its key 
lenders, ensuring transparency when it comes to 
monitoring the assets secured by debt. The team 
actively monitor the debt covenants and a debt 
analysis is presented at each Board meeting

Ensuring that there is 
adequate working capital 
for capital expenditure, 
development projects 
and acquisitions
This is an amber  
risk, with high 
impact but 
low likelihood
Management actively engages with its key lenders, 
ensuring transparency when it comes to the asset 
management and development of assets and what 
funding is required for these. A weekly working 
capital and cash flow analysis is completed by the 
finance team and circulated to management to 
assist with this. Start times of development projects 
are staggered to ensure that there is no over 
demand on resources at any one time in the year
1 2 3 5
Compliance
Breach of any of the 
regulations governing the 
business of the Group, such 
as listing rules, UK Corporate 
Governance Code and The 
Pubs Code
This is an amber  
risk, with high 
impact but 
low likelihood
The Company and its advisers monitor any 
changes to the relevant legislations that affect 
the Group’s business and how these changes 
may affect it. Any breaches would be resolved

Asset Management
Instability and subdued 
economic activity could 
lead to reductions in 
disposable income, 
impacting demand for 
retailer goods and ultimately 
leading to business failure 
and administrations
This is a green 
risk, with both 
low impact and 
low likelihood
Management monitor rent arrears on a weekly 
basis and regularly monitor the credit status of 
retailers. We apply a strategy to increase weighted 
average lease length to secure future income 
stream and to limit exposure to voids. Retailer 
diversification is high, with no one retailer making 
up more than 2.6% of total rental income

Failure in performance by 
individual assets against  
their business plans
This is an amber  
risk, with high 
impact but 
low likelihood
Business plans for each asset are regularly 
reviewed by their asset manager and updated 
twice yearly. These revised business plans are then 
reviewed by the Executive Committee 
2
Development
Poor control of development 
projects could lead 
to inadequate returns 
on investment
This is an amber  
risk with high  
impact but 
low likelihood 
of happening
The Group applies a risk‑controlled development 
strategy through negotiating long‑dated pre‑lets 
(typically at least 70% of a development has to be 
pre‑let prior to commitment) and tight cost control 
help to de‑risk our developments
3
Over‑exposure to 
developments could put 
pressure on cash flow and 
debt financing
This is an amber 
risk, with high 
impact but

STRATEGIC REPORT SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW
Our people
Corporate Culture
With total assets under management of £1.3 billion, 
the Company has a relatively lean yet highly 
effective number of employees with a total 
headcount of 52. 
Led by the Board, since the Company’s inception 
in 2009, NewRiver has a prided itself on its strong 
entrepreneurial and inclusive culture that fosters 
collaboration, transparency and diligence.
The team includes a range of skill‑sets and expertise 
across management, property, development, 
finance, corporate, FP&A, marketing and support 
teams all working towards creating maximum value, 
achieving our KPIs and delivering results.
Core to the success of this is the unique collegiate 
culture of the business. Ahead of the Company’s 
move to the Main Market, we undertook 
a light‑touch brand refresh, evolving to become 
NewRiver REIT plc from NewRiver Retail Limited. 
Our Stakeholders
During the brand refresh process we defined 
who the Company’s core stakeholders are, the six 
identified stakeholders are: the NewRiver team;  
our investors, our advisers/consultants who help us 
achieve our KPIs; our retailers; our customers; and 
the local authorities of the towns we are invested in.  
At the heart of this group are the people within 
the NewRiver team. At NewRiver, we have a high 
satisfaction and retention rate, allowing us to attract 
and retain talent. 
Defining our Core Values
This re‑branding process included internal and 
external interviews to understand how the Company 
is perceived by some of these stakeholders and 
the outcomes clearly identified the strength of 
the Company’s team culture, ethos and focused 
expertise. From this exercise we were able to define 
the core values of the business – operating as one 
team, deploying the various skill‑sets from across 
the business in a collaborative, supportive and 
dynamic way alongside our valued partners and 
stakeholders. In this way, we are reputed for our 
high standards and our detail‑focused, high quality 
outputs underpinning our drive to deliver beyond 
expectations. We are brave and ambitious in our 
pursuits to achieve our clear objectives; and we are 
smart and trusted in our execution of driving the 
business forward.

58 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Creating Vibrant Environments
NewRiver is invested in over 400 local towns and 
communities up and down the UK. As a significant 
stakeholder in these localities, we have an important 
role and responsibility to our convenience‑led and 
community‑focused portfolio to help make them 
thriving retail and leisure locations. 
As part of our commitment to creating vibrant 
and sustainable environments, NewRiver 
appointed Cushman & Wakefield to help develop 
a comprehensive Environmental & Social 
Governance (ESG) programme to ensure the 
business is conducting activities that enhance 
NewRiver’s reputation, provides social benefit,  
drive cost efficiency and increase the long‑term 
value of NewRiver’s business. 
Since appointing Cushman & Wakefield in 2015, 
NewRiver has developed a comprehensive 
Environmental & Social Governance (ESG) strategy 
for the business and is undertaking a number of 
initiates and measures within this.
NewRiver’s ESG Strategy:  
Creating Vibrant Environments
The NewRiver portfolio is convenience‑led and 
community‑focused and the vision for our ESG 
strategy reflects NewRiver’s customer‑first approach, 
managing our assets as though we ourselves are 
retailers and customers. We focus on building 
partnerships with all our key stakeholders, including 
our investors, retailers, consumers and local 
authorities to ensure our goals and aspirations are 
aligned to deliver mutual objectives. 
We have identified five key priorities that strengthen 
the core offering of our business that link directly to 
our key stakeholders: 
Within this strategy are a number of targets to 
measure progress and include the following 
key areas:
1. Employee empowerment
2. Performance and risk control
3.  Effective asset management responding to 
occupier needs
4. Community engagement
5. Customer satisfaction
We have made excellent progress on these targets 
in Y ear 1, with almost all criteria met.
Given NewRiver’s strong performance on our ESG 
strategy during our first year as a Main‑Market 
listed company following our move up from the AIM 
market, the business is committed to setting longer 
term targets that can be tracked over the coming 
years and this is one of NewRiver’s key objectives 
with Cushman & Wakefield for FY18.
Key achievements that NewRiver has accomplished 
in the last year include:
Shopping Centre Energy Audits Generating 
Savings T otalling Half a Million Pounds
Cushman & Wakefield have carried out 19 detailed 
asset energy audits for NewRiver’s largest shopping 
centres (by area), highlighting a range of energy 
efficiency and cost reduction opportunities in the 
areas within NewRiver’s ownership.
Implementation is already underway and planned to 
be carried out throughout FY18.

STRATEGIC REPORT SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW CONTINUED
The audit programme has highlighted over 
£500,000 in terms of potential annual energy cost 
savings thus far. Key efficiency measures include: 
1. Data collection/management/monitoring; 
using this to minimise wastage and generate 
quick savings
2. LED/Lighting & controls upgrades (lighting 
represents the single biggest energy cost across 
the portfolio) 
3. Replacing HVAC (heating, ventilation and  
air conditioning) fan motors with a) new  
Electronically Commutated Motors that sit within 
the HVAC systems, and/or b) variable speed 
drives with the aim of providing thermal comfort 
and high indoor air quality 
4. Replacing ageing electric water heaters with new, 
more efficient models
5. Thermal de‑stratification fans in malls with treated 
air, a method to ensure temperature equalisation 
throughout the building
6. Energy sub‑metering
7. Solar PV opportunities
In order to deliver economies of scale, 
additional value measures will be procured 
and/or implemented across multiple assets 
where appropriate.
Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 
(GRESB)
NewRiver submitted its maiden entry to the GRESB 
Benchmark in FY17, demonstrating our portfolio 
level commitment to assessing ESG performance 
against real estate competitors both in the UK and 
globally. GRESB offers a consistent framework to 
collect and compare key ESG indicators and related 
performance metrics across global real estate and 
infrastructure portfolios. NewRiver have taken the 
results and incorporated these into their ESG action 
plan for FY18.
Appointment of Co-operative Power as new 
Energy Broker
The Company carried out a substantive tender for 
an energy broker and appointed the Co‑operative 
Power as the Company’s new energy broker in 
January 2016. 
The mobilisation of Co‑operative Power has 
progressed well. Additionally, Co‑operative Power 
have led on an Automatic Meter Reading roll‑out 
across all sites/supplies which fall under the 
P272 legislation. NewRiver have extended this 
roll‑out to over 50 additional supplies to better 
track, monitor and report consumption data within 
their portfolio.
Co‑operative Power are currently mobilising a  
new data platform which will allow all energy 
data and documentation to be stored in one 
place with multiple access rights including the 
managing agent, all centre managers and NewRiver 
themselves. The benefits of this platform feed 
into the audit process, day‑to‑day management, 
regulatory reporting and wider ESG performance.
Health & Wellbeing: UK Green Building 
Council Retail
NewRiver is looking to further develop its already 
comprehensive Health & Wellbeing metrics 
framework in line with UK Green Building Council 
Retail framework. At present, NewRiver collect and 
report on a number of Health & Wellbeing metrics 
for all of their shopping centres. This includes 
perceptual metrics such as cleanliness and security, 
the quality of key facilities, cosmetics of the 
shopping centre and parking facilities.
Shopper Economic Metrics
The Company has also advanced data sets 
relating to economic metrics via their consumer 
surveys, conducted by CACI to determine and 
monitor average spend per person, dwell time and 
frequency of visits. A workshop was carried out with 
the UKGBC to collate and organise this data into 
a clear health & wellbeing framework with a plan 
of action for improvement.
Legislation & Risk Mitigation
Cushman & Wakefield have been working with 
NewRiver on a number of legislative risks including 
the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards which 
comes into force in 2018 and requires Energy 
Performance Certificates to be carried out for 
a number of NewRiver’s portfolio units. Co‑operative 
Power and Cushman’s have collated data for 
Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting, which 
is reported on the next page.

60 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013, the Company 
is required to report annual greenhouse gas 
emissions. The details for the financial year ending 
31 March 2017 appear in the table below.
Sources of greenhouse gas emissions 2016/17 tCO2e
Scope 1
Gas, refrigerants and car fuel 1,432.03
Scope 2
Landlord controlled electricity 11,799.08
T otal footprint 13,231.11
Intensity measure tCO2e/sq ft
Emissions per sq ft 0.119
We have used the operational control method to 
outline our carbon footprint boundary. Occupiers’ 
usage or emissions are not included as we do not 
have control over those items. Emissions from 
vacant space has been included.
We have measured emissions based on the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Standard 
(revised edition) and guidance provided by the 
UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA) on mandatory carbon reporting. The 
emissions factors and conversions used were from 
the DEFRA greenhouse gas reporting tool.
Giving Back
Since NewRiver’s inception, we have always been 
very charitable and supportive to good causes 
both local to our assets and on a national level. 
We recognise that with the Company’s rapid growth 
we have a big opportunity to leverage our scale 
and raise funds and increase the profile of charities 
in a more concerted and strategic manner and this 
financial year we developed a dedicated Charities 
Strategy. The annual strategy is two‑fold:
1. Raise funds for a single charitable cause at 
a corporate and portfolio level with an agreed 
fundraising target set at the beginning of the year
2. Each NewRiver shopping centre will support 
a single charity important to the local community 
they belong to, with a fundraising target set at 
the beginning of the year.
Activation
We will raise funds and the charity’s profile through 
a combination of sporting, educational, family, 
retailer and community events appropriate to our 
sector and shopping centre communities as well 
as activating our PR, design and communications 
expertise to deliver this. As well as raising funds 
and profile, charitable programmes can have an 
important role in driving teamwork and ensuring 
social responsibility is on the agenda locally.
Our FY17 charity of the year was Pancreatic Cancer 
Research UK, in memory of our greatly respected 
and successful Development Director François 
Nairac. François played a huge role in driving 
forward our 1.9 million sq ft development pipeline 
which includes the major regeneration of key UK 
communities creating better social environments, 
improved amenities, enhanced retail and leisure, 
more homes and importantly, creating new jobs.
We are delighted to say that through various events 
we have raised £27,000 for Pancreatic Cancer.

STRATEGIC REPORT Snapshot of the charities we have supported
Way of the Roses
Our flagship fundraiser saw 24 riders 
cycle coast to coast on the Way of 
Roses, beginning at our shopping 
centre in Morecambe and finishing 
at our shopping centre in Bridlington. 
The team, affectionately named 
Nairac’s Rogue Riders, cycled 170 miles, 
scaled 3,225 metres and endured 
torrential rain, multiple flocks of sheep 
on the move and very tight quads to 
raise £26,938 for Pancreatic Cancer 
Research UK. The “home team” which 
involved many of NewRiver’s partners 
as well as staff covered the same 
mileage on static bikes located at 
NewRiver’s offices.
Age Concern: The Ridings Shopping Centre, Wakefield
Why it matters: Most people will feel lonely at some point in their lives. Age UK 
cites this as a deeply personal experience that in many cases will thankfully pass, 
but for a growing number of people, particularly those in later life, loneliness can 
define their lives and have a significant impact on their wellbeing. With 30% of 
the NewRiver shopper base being aged 65+ or over and The Ridings Shopping 
Centre in Wakefield’s percentage being even higher at 34%, the centre wanted 
to tackle loneliness amongst older people in Wakefield.
What we did: In collaboration with Age UK Wakefield District, the centre 
hosted a “Find Friends” Afternoon T ea Event for Valentine’s Day providing 
complementary hot drinks and cakes and hosting bingo and table top games. 
Age UK Wakefield District had an information stand highlighting their local 
services and had 63 interactions, with the hope that these people can enjoy 
some longer‑term benefits from the event. The Wakefield Friendship Centre  
also distributed flyers about their fortnightly events.
The impact it made: Over 120 people aged 55+ attended, one of whom had not 
been out socially for three years. Age UK connected with 64 new clients.
The event secured 3 minutes of coverage on BBC Look North News that evening 
and received excellent feedback from attendees, retailers and wider shoppers. 
The centre received several letters from local people praising the event and 
enquiring about similar events.
The event has spurred the centre to work more closely with Age UK Wakefield, 
planning a series of similar regular events, under the event brand ‘Cuppa Club’, 
to help older people avoid loneliness.
SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW CONTINUED
62 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 One Great Day
For the past two years NewRiver have taken part 
in a growing charity campaign called One Great 
Day – a nationwide shopping centre event that 
takes place in the summer to raise money for 
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). In FY17 
NewRiver contributed to the total fundraising sum, 
with NewRiver Shopping Centres hosting their own 
“One Great Day” community events as well as the 
Corporate team not only partaking in but winning 
the inaugural London One Great Day Race, to be the 
fastest property team!
FY18 Charity of the Y ear
We are delighted to announce that our FY18 
NewRiver Charity of the Y ear is Great Ormond Street 
Hospital (GOSH), an important medical institute that 
touches the lives of hundreds of families up and 
down the UK, including many of the towns we are 
invested in.

Children’s Rights: The Avenue Shopping Centre, Newton Mearns
Why it matters: Mearns Primary School has been 
recognised as a Right’s Respecting School by UNICEF 
since 2009–an initiative encouraging schools to place the 
UN Convention of the Rights of the Child at the heart of its 
ethos and curriculum. One of the assessment criteria for 
Mearns Primary this year was measuring how the school 
promotes children’s rights within the local community so 
The Avenue partnered with the school to help achieve this, 
forming the Mearns Global Citizens Committee, led by the 
pupils and centre management.
What we did: Pupils at Mearns Primary School were invited 
to participate in a competition to create a poster illustrating 
one children’s right, such as the right to an education or 
the right to have friends. One winner was selected from 
each class including the nursery, to create eight posters 
which were then displayed in the windows or our retailers. 
Shoppers were then invited to partake in the Children’s 
Rights Treasure Hunt to find all eight Children’s Rights in 
the centre.
The impact it made: The Principle T eacher was 
over‑whelmed by the support and profile the campaign 
achieved, meeting the objective of demonstrating the 
pupils’ ability to be a Responsible Citizen. With eight 
retailers partaking as well as 187 children in the treasure 
hunt, the campaign brought together the various 
community stakeholders.

 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
 
Welcome to NewRiver’s Governance Report for the year 
ending 31 March 2017. This describes how the Board and 
its Committees worked on behalf of shareholders and other 
stakeholders, driving the culture and discipline necessary 
for the Company to achieve its goals. 
NewRiver’s good financial results for the year in part reflect 
successful strategic leadership from the Board in the period to 
date and I would like to thank the Directors for their dedication 
and hard work, which was essential to this achievement. 
Since NewRiver’s inception, the Board has regarded high 
standards of governance as a fundamental pre-condition 
for the Company’s success. I am pleased to report that the 
Company is an early adopter of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code published in April 2016 and that most of the requirements 
placed upon FTSE 350 companies under the Code had 
already been met by NewRiver before it decided to apply for 
a main listing, and that all Code requirements were met by 
the time of its joining the Main Market last August. 
The Company tested the effectiveness of the Board with 
an independent evaluation in February 2017, the results of 
which are described on page 70. The evaluation report was 
encouraging and provided positive feedback with regard to 
the strategy process, Board relationships, quality of external 
inputs and other key items. Areas for improvement, as shown 
on page 70, have been noted and will be addressed in the 
coming year. 
 
“NewRiver is an early adopter of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
published in April 2016. The Board 
is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance.” 
 
As part of its commitment to high standards of governance, 
NewRiver maintains a regular, open dialogue with shareholders. 
This dialogue was instrumental in the refinement of the 
Company’s remuneration policy, which is included in this 
Annual Report for the first time. The Board consulted with 
investors representing almost two-thirds of the Company’s 
issued share capital before recommending the policy 
to shareholders. 
The Board looks forward to building on its progress in creating 
a governance framework that recognises and respects the 
interests of NewRiver’s stakeholders in a fair and balanced 
manner. The Board is grateful to those stakeholders for their 
contributions to this process to date and looks forward to 
continuing engagement in the future.

Board Evaluation Process 
In light of the move to the Main Market, th e Nomination Committee also reviewed the Board evaluation process. As an AIM-listed 
company, NewRiver Retail’s Board did not have to undergo regular evaluations. It nonetheless undertook such evaluations 
annually by means of an internal questionnaire. For NewRiver REIT, as a Main Market company and constituent of the FTSE250 
index, such evaluations are required under the UK Corporate Governance Code, with externally led reviews required every three 
years. The Nomination Committee decided to appoint an external evaluator to undertak e its first Board evaluation. This decision 
was designed to establish firm foundations for future evaluations and thus to ensure continuing high standards of governance for 
the Company. 
The Nomination Committee delegated authority to the Chairman and the Company Secretary to review external evaluators and to 
recommend one for approval. They selected Prism Boardroom wh ich had not undertaken any work for the Company before and 
was therefore deemed independent. 
Scope, key findings and recommendations 
The scope of the evaluation was discussed and agreed between the evaluator, the Chairman and the Company Secretary in the 
context of a three-year evaluation plan. One-to-one discussions with each member of the Board and the Company Secretary were 
conducted in February with Prism Boardroom reporting its findings to the Board at its March meeting.

each Committee 
• There were a number of house-keeping

benefit from a greater degree of 
formality around its operation 
The Board is reviewing the report and its recommendations. Actions taken by the Board as a result of this review will be reported in 
next year’s report. 
Induction of New Directors 
No new Director was appointed to the Board during the year . However, when a new Director does join, the Chairman and 
Company Secretary will implement an induction process which will ensure that the new Director is fully briefed about the Compan y 
and its operations; meets with its senior management; visits various assets and be briefed on their legal and regulatory obliga tions 
as a Director of a public limited company.  
Directors’ Training 
During the year, the Directors’ were traine d by the Company’s advisers on their obligations as Directors’ of a Main Market listed 
company and also on the requirements of the Market Abuse Regulations which came into force during the period.

The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director are available to meet with shareholders to discuss governance 
or any other concerns that they may have and which is not a ppropriate to discuss through normal channels of communication 
or where normal channels of communication have failed to reso lve the concern. No shareholder has requested such a meeting 
to date. 
The Chairman attends the financial results presentations to hear shareholder and analysts queries. In addition, the Board is ke pt 
regularly updated of the meetings that the Executive Directors have with shareholders and analysts. The Head of Investor Relati ons 
provides the Board with a weekly report updating them of the ma rket for the Company’s shares, what its peers are doing and any 
reports issued about the sector generally and the Company specifically. 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
The AGM is the annual opportunity for all shareholders to meet with the Directors and to discuss with them the business and its 
strategy. All Directors are available to meet informally with the shareholders before and after the meeting.  
The Notice of AGM is posted to all sharehol ders at least 21 working days before the meeting. Separate resolutions are proposed on 
all substantive issues and voting is conducted by a poll. The Board believes this method of voting is more democratic than voti ng 
via a show of hands since all shares voted at the meeting, incl uding proxy votes submitted in advance of the meeting, are count ed.  
For each resolution, shareholders will have the opportunity to vote for or against a resolution, or to withhold their vote. Fol lowing 
the meeting, the results of votes lodged will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and displayed on the Company’s website.

Dear Shareholders, 
I am pleased to present my firs t report on behalf of the Audit 
Committee having succeeded Chris Taylor who stood down in 
March of this year. I would like to thank Chris for his invaluable 
contribution to this committee since becoming Audit 
Committee Chairman in 2012. 
The principle role for the Committee is to provide 
independent review and monitoring of the risk management 
and control procedures within the Company. The risk 
management process reviews both external risks as well as 
internal control risks and ensures that risks are being properly 
identified, their potential impact on the company measured 
and then adequately managed and mitigated. Each identified 
risk is assigned to a specific Director or Directors who and 
then responsible for monitoring that risk and taking 
mitigating actions. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the 
half year and annual financial statements and the process 
that is used to produce them. As part of this process the 
Committee meets with the Company’s auditors, Deloitte, who 
produce a detailed report covering their audit plans, materiality 
criteria and any issues identified during the course of their 
audit together with recommendations for improving accounting 
processes. There have been no material issues raised.  
In common with other property companies, asset valuations 
are a key focus in preparing the financial statements. During 
the year, independently of the Company’s management, the 
Committee met in April with the Company’s valuer, Colliers 
International, to ensure that it was comfortable with the process 
followed and to ensure their independence. I can confirm that 
a robust valuation process has been followed. 
Committee Members & Discharge of Responsibility 
Each Committee member is independent and has broad 
commercial experience as a director. Chris Taylor and Kay 
Chaldecott have provided strong and relevant property 
experience which has complimented my relevant financial 
experience thereby ensuring that the Committee has the right 
balance of skills and experience to properly discharge its 
responsibilities. As a Chartered Accountant and, until recently, 
being the Chief Financial Officer of New Look Group, the Board 
considers that I have significant, recent and relevant financial 
experience as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
I consider that the regular discussions and meetings that are 
held by the Committee, and the challenge that the Committee 
has with the Company’s management, the auditor and 
property valuer, together with the quality of the reports and 
information prepared for the Committee meetings, has 
enabled the Committee members to discharge their duties 
and responsibilities. 
Alastair Miller 
Committee Chairman 
15 May 2017 
How the Committee operates 
The Committee meets at least three times a year but also holds 
ad-hoc meetings when required. It met three times during the 
year to discuss the half-year an d annual financial statements, 
risk management reviews and internal control processes. 
Only members of the Committee are entitled to attend the 
meetings, however a standing invitation is extended to Mark 
Davies, CFO; the Head of Fi nance and representatives of 
Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), the Company’s external auditor. 
Matthew Jones, as Company Secretary, attends each meeting 
and acts as secretary to the Committee.  
Responsibilities of the Committee during the year 
During the year, the Committee was responsible for: 
• overseeing the Group’s relationship with Deloitte, including 
its remuneration; 
• monitoring the integrity of the half-year and annual financial 
statements before submission to the Board; 
• discussing any issues arising from the half-year review and 
year-end audit of the Group; 
• reviewing significant financial reporting matters and 
judgments, with a particular focus on matters of material 
financial impact on the Group; 
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls; 
• reviewing and monitoring the Group’s risk management 
processes; 
• conducting an annual review of the need to establish an 
internal audit function; 
• monitoring and annually reviewing the auditor’s 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the audit 
process; and 
• evaluating the Committee’s own performance, which was 
undertaken as part of the Bo ard evaluation process referred 
to on page 70. 
The Company has not had any interaction with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s corporate reporting team. 
The principal matters discussed du ring the year were as follows: 
• Valuation of assets. The 2017 year-end balance sheet 
shows assets under management of £1.3bn. The 
Committee, independently of management, met with 
Colliers International at the end of April 2017 to discuss 
with them the valuation of the assets, to understand the 
process that was followed and to ensure that a robust and 
independent valuation had taken place. 
• Risk management. The Committee reviews the risk register 
at each meeting and, as part of the process of moving the 
Company’s listing from AIM to the Main Market, the 
register’s format was revised to make it easier to highlight 
the key risks within the business. 
• Accounting treatment and revenue recognition for the 
acquisitions of Bexleyheath and Sheffield. 
 
GOVERNANCE
73 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED 
74
 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
• Taxation and REIT compliance: The Committee was aware 
that, should the Group not comply with the REIT regulations, 
it could incur tax penalties or ultimately be expelled from the 
REIT regime which would have a significant effect on the 
financial statements. The Committee noted the frequency 
with which compliance with the regulations was reported to 
the Board and considered the margin by which the Group 
complied. Based on this and the level of headroom shown 
in the latest Group forecasts the Committee agreed that no 
further action was required for the current year. 
• Audit process. The Committee and the auditor, Deloitte, 
discussed the resourcing required to audit a FTSE250 
company. Deloitte provided additional resource and the 
audit process commencenced earlier.  
Risk Management 
The Board overseas the Group’s risk management and internal 
controls and determines the Group’s risk appetite. The Audit 
Committee at each of its meetings monitors the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems 
at each Committee meeting.  
Further details of the Company’s risk management process, 
together with the principal risks, can be found in the Risk 
Management report on pages 55 to 57. Details of the 
Company’s internal controls are below. 
Internal Control Structure 
The Group does not have an inte rnal audit team. The need for 
this is reviewed annually by the Committee, however due to 
the Group’s size and relative lack of complexity, it is felt that 
there is no requirement for such a team just yet.  
However, while there may not be an internal audit team in 
place, BDO UK LLP, as an independent third party, are 
engaged to undertake an annual review of the Group’s internal 
control system to ensure that the Company has sufficient 
controls in place and they did this during February 2017. The 
results of the review were enco uraging and stated that there 
was an appropriate system in place to achieve the current 
financial and operational controls required and to ensure that 
the Company’s compliance obligations were met. While all of 
the necessary checks and balances were being done, the 
documentation confirming this was not always completed in a 
timely manner and this will be addressed during the current year. 
In addition, as part of the Co mpany’s move from AIM to the 
Main Market in August 2016, Deloitte were engaged to 
undertake a Financial Position and Prospects Procedures 
review (“the FPPP review”). The FPPP review documented 
the nature of the Group’s financial position and prospects 
procedures and the steps taken by the Directors to enable 
them to make their confirmation, in the prospectus for the 
move to the Main Market, that they had established 
procedures which provided a reasonable basis for them 
to make proper judgements on an ongoing basis as to 
the financial position and prospects of the Group. 
The FPPP review was very thorough and took about three 
months to complete. It covered all functions and processes 
within the Group, including internal controls, governance 
surrounding Board and Committee meetings, IT, forecasting & 
budgeting and management reporting.  
Even though the Company was listed on AIM, it had been 
conducting itself as a Main Market company and the FPPP 
review concluded that all of the necessary internal controls and 
procedures were in place and were being followed. 
External auditor 
The Committee considers the nature, scope and results of the 
external auditor’s work and reviews, develops and implements 
policy on the supply of any non-audit services that are to be 
provided by the external auditor. It receives and reviews 
reports from the Group’s auditors relating to the Group’s 
annual report and accounts and the external audit process. 
Audit Plan 
In respect of the audit for the financial year ended 31 March 
2017, Deloitte presented their audit plan (prepared in 
consultation with management) to the Committee. The audit 
plan took into account key changes in the business, materiality 
levels, valuation of the portfolio, especially focusing on how the 
pub element was valued, and the development pipeline.  
Following discussions with both Deloitte and management, the 
Committee approved the implementation of the plan.  
Audit & Non-audit Fees 
The Company paid £287,000 in audit and audited related fees 
for the financial year ended 31 March 2017. 
The Company has a non-audit services policy in place which 
limits Deloitte to working on the audit or such other matters 
where their expertise as the Company’s auditor makes them 
the logical choice for the work . This is to preserve their 
independence and objectivity. The Company paid £220,000 
in non-audit fees to Deloitte for the financial year ended 
31 March 2017. The amount paid in non-audit fees is high this 
year because Deloitte were engaged in undertaking the FPPP 
review and other reporting accountant work required as part 
of the process of moving the Company from its AIM listing to 
its Main Market listing.  
BDO UK LLP has been engaged to provide tax advice to the 
Company and to undertake the an nual internal control review. 
Effectiveness and Independence 
The Chair of the Committee speaks regularly to the audit 
partner to ascertain if there are any concerns, to discuss the 
audit reports and to ensure that the auditor has received 
support and information requested from management. 
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the 2016 
external audit process by considering the extent to which the 
audit plan was met, the degree of challenge involved in the 
process, the depth of understanding, the review of key 
accounting policies and audit judgements, and the content of 
the auditor’s reports to the Committee. It was noted that the 
audit had been completed to a high standard, however 
additional resource allocated to the audit would be beneficial 
to the process.

the auditors in both the audit and non-audit services it 
provides, the Committee has recommended to the Board that 
a resolution is proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting to reappoint Deloitte as the Group’s external auditor. 
Tenure 
Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s auditor since 2010. David 
Becker is the audit partner from Deloitte and he was appointed 
in 2015. Under the regulations, the last audit that he could sign 
off would be the 2019 audit and he would have to rotate off in 
2020. Under The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, the audit should be tendered 
every ten years. No tender has been undertaken since 
Delloitte’s appointment as auditor. As such, the Committee will 
give consideration in due course to such a tender, taking into 
account the complexity and time that such tenders take. 
Statement of Compliance 
The Company confirms that is has complied with terms of 
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory User of Competitive Tender 
Processes an Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 
(“the Order”) throughout the year. 
In addition to requiring mandatory audit re-tendering at least 
every ten years for FTSE 350 co mpanies, the Order provides 
that only the Audit Committee, acting collectively or through 
its Chair, and for and on behalf of the Board is permitted: 
• to the extent permissible in law and regulation, to negotiate 
and agree the statutory audit fee and the scope of the 
statutory audit; 
• to initiate and supervise a competitive tender process; 
•  to make recommendations to the Directors as to the 
auditor appointment pursuant to a competitive 
tended process; 
• to influence the appointment of the audit engagement 
partner; and 
• to authorise an auditor to provide any non-audit services 
to the Group, prior to the commencement of those 
non-audit services. 
Fair, Balanced and Understandable 
The Directors are required to confirm that they consider, 
taken as a whole, that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
The Committee has satisfied itself that the controls over the 
accuracy and consistency of information presented in the 
Annual Report are robust and has confirmed to the Board 
that the processes and controls around the preparation of the 
Annual Report are appropriate allowing the Board to make 
the “fair, balanced and understandable statement” which is 
on page 105. 
Viability Statement 
The Committee provides advice to the Board on the Viability 
Statement which can be found on page 104.  
The Committee ensured sufficient review was undertaken 
of the adequacy of the financial arrangements, cash flow 
forecasts and lender covenant compliance. Accordingly, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that the statement 
be approved.

Dear Shareholders, 
In August 2016, the Company successfully moved its listing 
from the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange to the 
Main Market. In preparation for that move, the Committee 
reviewed the Board composition to ensure that it was fully 
compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
had a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
In light of the move to the Main Market, the Committee also 
reviewed its Board evaluation process. As an AIM-listed 
company, NewRiver Retail’s Board did not have to undergo 
regular evaluations. It nonetheless undertook such evaluations 
annually by means of an internal questionnaire. For NewRiver 
REIT, as a Main Market company and constituent of the 
FTSE250 index, such evaluations are required under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, with externally led reviews 
required every three years. The Committee decided to appoint 
an external evaluator to undertake its first Board evaluation. 
This decision was designed to establish firm foundations 
for future evaluations and thus to ensure continuing high 
standards of governance for the Company. Further details 
of the process and its results are to be found in the 
Corporate Governance report on page 70. 
In January 2017, the Company announced that Chris Taylor 
would stand down as a Non-Executive Director in April 2017. 
The Company is currently in the process of searching for a 
suitable candidate to succeed Mr Taylor. The details of this 
process are to be found on the following page. 
During the current year, the Committee will continue to 
focus on succession planning and on implementing the 
recommendations of the Board evaluation.

How the Committee operates 
The Committee meets at least tw ice a year and holds ad-hoc 
meetings when required. It met three times during the year to 
discuss succession planning, Board evaluation and the process 
to be followed in the search for a new Non-Executive Director 
following the resignation of Chris Taylor. 
Only members of the Committee are entitled to attend the 
meetings, with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, David 
Lockhart, having a standing invitation to attend. This is so 
that the Committee can understand the views of executive 
management when making its deliberations, especially on 
succession planning. Matthew Jones, Company Secretary, 
attends each meeting and acts as secretary to the Committee.  
Activities of the Committee during the year 
Succession planning 
The Committee considers succession planning a key part 
of its remit. It recognises the importance of creating robust 
succession plans for both the Board and the internal talent 
so that it can fulfil the Company’s long-term strategy. 
The Committee acknowledges that the plans should be 
regularly reviewed to ensure that employees and Board 
members have sufficient skills and experience to ensure the 
continuing success and good governance of the Company.  
The Committee also works with the Executive Directors to 
nurture a pipeline of talented employees below board level 
who will be able to serve as the next generation of plc 
Board directors. 
As part of the current year’s revi ew of the plans, short, medium 
and long-term horizons will be considered to ensure that the 
plans allow for sudden and unforeseen departures, for the 
orderly replacement of Board members and senior members 
of staff, and to ensure that su fficient skills and experience 
remain in the business to ensure that the Company’s 
strategy and objectives are met going forward. 
Recruitment of a new Non-Executive Director 
In January 2017, Chris Taylor advised the Company that he 
would be resigning as a director and standing down from the 
Board with effect from April 2017, triggering the process to 
identify and appoint a suitable successor. 
The Chairman, CEO and Company Secretary were delegated 
to meet two executive search firms, both of whom were 
signatories to the Revised UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for 
Executive Search Firms. The appointment of Spencer Stuart, 
which had not undertaken any work for the Company before 
and was therefore deemed independent, was recommended. 
The Board approved a detailed brief to be used to compile 
a short list of candidates. The brief specified that candidates 
needed a good range of experience that did not necessarily 
have to come from the property or retail sectors. 
Spencer Stuart is currently in discussions with proposed 
candidates with a view to putt ing five forward for the Board’s 
consideration. Each member of the Board will have the 
opportunity to meet with the proposed candidates prior to a 
final appointment being made. This is designed to ensure the 
future cohesiveness of the Board following the new 
appointment. The Company will inform the market as and 
when an appointment is made. 
Diversity Policy 
The Company has developed a culture which recognises the 
benefits of diversity and has been successful at recruiting key 
members of its team from a range of different backgrounds. 
Before the Company became a REIT in 2010, 50% of its Board 
directors were female and the culture and discrimination 
policies the Company has adopted since this time have always 
embraced all aspects of diversity. 
The Board currently comprises one female non-executive 
director, Kay Chaldecott. Recognising the benefits of diversity 
the Company would like to see th e female Board representation 
increase further. 
When recruiting, the Company has always considered all 
aspects of diversity during the process. The Company ensures 
there is a selection of candidates who have a good balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience. The Company aims to recruit 
the best candidates on the basi s of their merit and ability. 
Recognising the current ongoing debate around diversity 
the Company is intending to draft a policy in the future that 
will give regard to updates to best practice and the 
recommendations of the Hampton Alexander and McGregor 
Smith reviews when doing so.

Dear Shareholders, 
Introduction 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce the 
Remuneration Committee report for the financial year ended 
31 March 2017. In the past, as an AIM listed company, we 
produced a Remuneration Committee report which provided 
information over and above the requirements of our listing. 
However, this is the first formal remuneration report that the 
Company has had to produce following its listing on the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
It has been a busy year for the Committee. In addition to 
the normal business of the Committee, we introduced new 
performance conditions for the Company’s Performance 
Share Plan, oversaw new Executive Director service contracts 
as part of the Group’s move to the Main Market, made an 
additional long term incentive award to the Chief Financial 
Officer and introduced a formal Remuneration Policy in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendments) Regulations 
2013 and consulted with shareholders on its implementation. 
Alongside the development of the Remuneration Policy, the 
Company developed a new annual bonus plan to operate 
from the 2017/18 financial year. 
Link between remuneration and strategy 
The principal role for the Committee is to operate the Group’s 
remuneration policy which is to ensure that the Directors and 
senior managers are paid in a way that attracts, retains, 
motivates and rewards management of the highest quality, 
aligns Shareholders’ and executives’ interests and promotes 
a direct relationship between results and reward, reflecting 
best practice appropriate to the size and stature of the Group.  
The strategy of the Company is to deliver superior returns to 
shareholders, both in dividends and capital growth, over the 
long term and within a prudent risk management framework. 
The remuneration policy of the Company supports this in its 
choice and pitching of performance targets for both annual 
bonus and performance share awards which include strong 
comparative performance elements. The policies on bonus 
deferral into shares, the new additional two year holding 
period following vesting for performance share awards and 
the shareholding guideline aligns executives with shareholders 
to support the Company’s long term objectives. The principles 
behind these policies are disseminated in the remuneration 
arrangements of all employees as appropriate in the light 
of seniority. 
Performance and decisions on remuneration taken  
in 2016/17 
The Company produced excellent financial results for the 
year with cash profits from operations growing by 24% to 
£58 million, and the Company increasing its fully covered 
ordinary dividend by over 8% to 20.0 pence per share. In 
addition, a special dividend of 3.0 pence per share has also 
been declared. Assets under management increased by 14% 
to £1.3 billion. 
The normal maximum bonus for 2016/17 was 100% of basic 
salary, however this could be increased to 150% on the basis 
of exceptional performance. The Executive Directors delivered 
successfully against a range of financial, operational and 
strategic objectives including, but not exclusively, paying a 
progressive, fully covered dividend, increasing the value of 
assets under management and transitioning the business from 
AIM to the Main Market. Bonuses paid in respect of the year to 
31 March 2017 to each of the Executive Directors was 100% of 
base salary received for the year and are set out in the table  
on page 94. The amount of this bonus which will be deferred 
into shares is 30%. 
No performance share awards were made to Executive 
Directors during the 2014 financial year and so none vested 
during the financial year 2017. 
In July 2016, the Committee granted awards under the 
Performance Share Plan which introduced new performance 
conditions. 50% of the award is subject to a Total Shareholder 
Return performance condition measured against the FTSE 
All Share Index. 50% is subject to a Total Accounting Return 
performance condition measured against UK REITs that report 
their NAV on an EPRA basis. The Committee believes that 
these performance conditions better reflect the strategy and 
objectives of the Company and provide improved alignment 
with shareholders. Further details on these performance 
conditions can be found on pages 94 to 95. 
As part of the move to the Main Market, the Group changed 
its domicile from Guernsey to the UK and a new UK holding 
company was incorporated. This necessitated new service 
contracts having to be drafted for the Executive Directors 
which complied with UK laws and listing regulations. Some 
legacy terms of the old service contracts were retained and 
further details of these can be found on page 90. 
Our executive team is rated high ly in the sector and our aim 
is to ensure that their remunera tion is competitive, motivating 
and sufficient to retain them. In the latter quarter of 2016, we 
held discussions with the Chief Financial Officer with the aim 
of securing his long term future with the Company. The 
remainder of the Board as a whole, took the view that the 
CFO played a key part in the Group’s success, was highly 
rated by its investors and therefore it was important to secure 
his long term future with the bu siness. Accordingly, with effect 
from 1 January 2017, his salary was increased from £350,000 
to £400,000 and later in January he was granted an additional 
award over 119,850 shares under the Performance Share Plan, 
being one times’ his new base salary. The performance 
conditions for which are described on pages 94 to 95. 
  
GOVERNANCE

80
 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
At this time, the Committee determined to increase the salary 
of the CEO from £425,000 to £4 50,000 and the salary of the 
Property Director from £400,000 to £425,000 from also 
effective 1 January 2017. These salary levels remain effective 
1 April 2017. 
New Remuneration Policy 
The Remuneration Policy to be put to the 2017 AGM is 
intended to comply with the Investment Association Principles 
of Remuneration and to reflect current best practice. The 
Company has consulted on it with ten of its largest investors, 
holding 63% of the total voting rights in issue. 
Key features of the policy which I would like to draw to your 
attention are set out below: 
• the bulk of the policy remains in line with previous 
disclosures. The approaches to salary, benefits and pension 
are largely unchanged to what has been done in the past. 
The normal performance share plan award will remain 100% 
of salary with the exceptional maximum remaining at 200% 
of salary; 
• the Company intends in the future normally to apply 
a two-year holding period following the vesting of PSP 
awards, lengthening the total period from award to 
release to five years; 
• the Company will introduce a shareholding guideline for 
Executive Directors. Over five years from appointment, the 
Chief Executive Officer will be required to build up a holding 
of 200% of his base salary and other executives 100% of 
base salary. Currently each of the Executive Directors’ 
shareholding meets this guideline; 
• Malus and clawback will apply to both annual bonus and 
PSP awards; 
• It is proposed under the policy that the maximum bonus will 
be 125% of salary. The Company intends to continue to 
defer 30% of bonus into an award over shares with a two 
year vesting period; and 
• at the point of the move to the Main Market, some special 
terms in relation to termination were agreed between the 
Company and David Lockhart, Allan Lockhart and Mark 
Davies, the Founding Executive Directors. These special 
terms were agreed to reflect the rights under these 
Directors’ 2009 contract which the Directors gave up on 
entering into new contracts in August 2016 to bring their 
employment terms more closely into line with best practice. 
They are laid out on page 90 and principally relate to 
protections on termination, including rights in the event of 
a change of control and rights to annual bonus, deferred 
bonus shares and performance share awards granted 
before August 2016. These provisions will not form part of 
arrangements entered into with new Executive Directors. 
Implementation of policy for 2017/18 
As the focus on executive pay continues, the Committee 
remains mindful of the developing remuneration landscape.  
Subject to approval at the AGM, the Committee will manage 
remuneration in line with the policy during 2017/2018. Detail on 
the proposed annual bonus structure and objectives is set out 
later in this report. The Committee anticipates making 2017 
PSP awards to Executive Directors with a value of 100% of 
salary following the AGM. 
I would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their 
hard work and support during this busy year. I hope that you 
find the report helpful and informative and I look forward to 
receiving further feedback from our investors on the 
information presented.

(b) Proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
  NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
81
 
The remuneration policy is intended to apply, subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 14 July 2017, from 1 April 2017 for a period of 
three years. 
When setting the remuneration policy, the Remuneration 
Committee (“the Committee”) has compared the levels 
being offered with those of its peers in the listed real estate 
investment trust sector. The policy is reviewed regularly to 
ensure that it continues to align the interests of Executive 
Directors with those of the Company’s Shareholders and 
to remain competitive. 
Discretions 
The Committee retains the absolute discretion to make any 
payments, even though they are not in line with the policy 
set out below, where the terms of the payment were agreed 
(a) before the policy came into effect; or (b) at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company 
and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not 
in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of 
the Company.  
Payments may include the Committee satisfying awards 
of variable remuneration and, in relation to any awards over 
shares, the terms of the paymen t will be determined by the 
Committee at the time the award is granted. Details of any 
such payments will be disclosed in the annual report on 
remuneration for the relevant year. 
Details of the relevant terms of the service agreements for the 
Founding Executive Directors (“FED”), being David Lockhart, 
Allan Lockhart and Mark Davies, under which payments were 
agreed prior to the policy coming into effect are described later 
in the policy on page 90.  
Subject to the discretion of the Committee, the Remuneration 
Policy may be amended to accommodate minor changes for 
administrative or legislative purposes without obtaining 
shareholder approval. 
Executive Directors hold awards granted under the NewRiver 
Retail Limited Deferred Bonus Plan 2015 (2015 DBP), the 
NewRiver Retail Limited Performance Share Plan 2009 (2009 
PSP), the NewRiver Retail Limited Unapproved Share Option 
Plan 2009 (2009 USOP) and the NewRiver REIT plc 
Performance Share Plan 2016 (2016 PSP).  
The Committee will operate the NewRiver REIT plc Annual 
Bonus Plan 2016 (ABP), the 20 15 DBP, the NewRiver REIT plc 
Deferred Bonus Plan 2016 (2016 DBP), the 2009 PSP, the 
2016 PSP, the 2009 USOP, the NewRiver REIT plc 
Unapproved Share Option Plan 2016 (2016 USOP) and the 
NewRiver REIT plc Company Share Option Plan 2016 (2016 
CSOP) according to their respective rules and in accordance 
with the Listing Rules where relevant. Consistent with market 
practice, the Committee retains certain discretions in respect 
of the operation and administration of these plans which 
include, but are not limited to:  
1. in respect of the ABP and the 2016 PSP, the annual 
review of performance measures, weighting and targets 
from year to year; 
2. the determination of the extent to which performance 
measures have been met and the corresponding vesting 
or payment levels; 
3. discretion required when dealing with a change of  
control or restructuring of the Group, special dividends 
and rights issues; 
4. determination of the treatment of leavers based on the 
rules of the respective arrangement and the appropriate 
treatment chosen, including the pro-rating of awards; and 
5. the manner in which share awards can be satisfied (i.e. 
from the Employee Benefit Trust, newly issued shares, 
treasury shares, or market purchased shares). 
In relation to awards granted under the 2009 PSP and/or the 
2016 PSP, the Committee has discretion to waive or amend 
performance targets on the occurrence of any event or events 
which causes the Committee reasonably to consider that such 
target should be waived or that a different or amended target 
would be a fairer measure of performance provided that any 
amendment may not cause the achievement of a target to be 
materially more difficult to perform or harder to achieve than 
the original task or target prior to such amendment. The 
Committee will not use this disc retion to waive performance 
targets other than in exceptional circumstances or, in relation 
to the FEDs, as set out in this remuneration policy. It will consult 
with major shareholders in advance of using this discretion. 
The performance targets which apply to subsisting awards 
granted under the 2009 PSP and the 2016 PSP include a 
provision which provides that notwithstanding the extent to 
which performance targets have been met, the awards will only 
vest to the extent that the Committee (in its absolute discretion) 
is satisfied that the performance against the performance 
targets is a fair reflection of the underlying performance of 
the Company during the applicable performance period.  
Any use of the above discretions will be explained in the 
Annual Report for the financial year in which they were 
exercised and may, as appropriate, be the subject of 
consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.

Dividend equivalents 
Dividend equivalent shares will be added on to unvested 
awards under the 2015 DBP and the 2016 DBP and to 
unvested awards (including during any holding period) under 
the 2009 PSP and the 2016 PSP on a reinvested basis 
although this can be calculated in an alternative manner 
at the discretion of the Committee. 
Clawback and Malus 
In the event of gross misconduct, the material misstatement of 
financial information or an error is discovered in the calculation 
of award levels, the Committee has discretion to exercise 
malus and clawback provisions in respect of all share awards 
(other than the 2009 USOP and 2016 CSOP). The Committee 
may reduce the vesting of awards prior to vesting and/or 
require the repayment or reimbursement of awards which have 
already vested and been exercised across all incentive plans. 
The Committee may operate clawback on the terms stated 
above during the 24 months following the vesting date (after 
any holding period) of an award granted on the terms of the 
2009 PSP and the 2016 PSP and at any time prior to the 
vesting date of an award granted on the terms of the 2015 
DBP and the 2016 DBP. 
The Committee may also operate clawback in relation to 
cash bonuses paid under the ABP if the circumstances set 
out above apply during the 24 months following the payment 
of the cash bonus. 
Shareholder consultation 
The Committee’s policy is to consult with major Shareholders 
in respect of significant decisions on executive remuneration 
and has done so regularly. The Company has consulted with 
shareholders representing 63% of its register in respect of the 
formulation of this policy. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company 
The Committee does not consult directly with employees 
regarding Executive Director remuneration. However, pay and 
conditions throughout the Group are taken into consideration 
when setting remuneration policy. For senior employees who 
are not directors, remuneration is similar in structure to the 
executive pay structure but levels of remuneration and the 
weighting of variable pay available is lower.

Bonus 
 
To incentivise 
performance in 
the reporting 
year through the 
setting of targets 
at the beginning 
of the year. 
These annual 
targets are 
intended to be 
consistent with 
the Group’s long 
term strategy.  
The deferral of a 
proportion of the 
bonus in shares 
seeks to align 
directors’ 
interests with 
those of 
shareholders 
and to 
discourage short 
term decision 
making.  
 
 
Awards of annual bonus are made 
pursuant to the ABP. 
All measures and targets will be 
reviewed and set annually by the 
Committee at the beginning of the 
financial year and levels of award 
determined by the Committee after 
the year end are determined based 
on achievement of performance 
against the stipulated measures  
and targets. 
The Committee retains an overriding 
discretion to reduce pay-outs from 
formulaic outcomes to ensure that 
overall bonus payments reflect its 
view of corporate performance 
during the year and are fair to both 
shareholders and participants. Paid 
in cash and in shares. The cash 
element is paid shortly following the 
completion of the audit for the year. 
Currently 30% of bonus is deferred 
into shares but this percentage is at 
the discretion of the Committee. 
The share element is deferred for 
a period which is currently two 
years (but this may be increased 
at the discretion of the Committee). 
Deferral of bonuses is achieved 
by means of awards of nil-cost 
options over shares pursuant to the 
2016 DBP. 
Vesting of the deferred shares will 
normally be subject to continued 
employment. 
Non-pensionable. 
Clawback and malus provisions 
apply as stated on page 82. 
The maximum bonus is 125%  
of salary. 
On target performance would 
result in bonus payment of 60% 
of maximum bonus. Threshold 
performance would result in bonus 
payment of 20% of maximum bonus. 
There is no maximum or minimum 
percentage of the bonus which 
is deferred into shares. The 
Committee has discretion to 
vary this percentage from year 
to year based on its assessment 
of circumstances at the time.  
 
All measures and 
targets relate to a 
financial year of 
the Company and 
are reviewed on 
an annual basis. 
For 2017/18, 80% 
of bonus will be 
paid on the basis 
of corporate 
targets and 20% 
of salary on the 
basis of personal 
performance 
targets. Corporate 
targets include 
relative TAR 
performance, 
relative earnings 
yield and meeting 
the Group’s 
financing policies 
in respect of loan 
to value, balance 
sheet gearing, 
interest cover and 
dividend cover.

Currently, awards are subject 
to the following targets: 
• the target applicable to 50% 
of the shares which are 
subject to an award is based 
on Total Accounting Return 
relative to certain UK-REITs 
that report on an EPRA 
accounting basis; and 
• the target applicable to 50% 
of the shares which are 
subject to an award is based 
on Total Shareholder Return 
relative to the FTSE All 
Share 
Notwithstanding the extent to 
which the performance targets 
are met, awards shall only vest 
if the Committee (in its 
absolute discretion) is satisfied 
that performance against the 
conditions is a fair reflection of 
underlying performance.

allowances for the 2017/18 financial year 
and benefits calculated using the 2016/17 
figures as set out in the table on page 92; 
2. On target 
performance: 
comprising fixed pay, an annual bonus 
payment at 60% of the maximum 
opportunity (75% of salary) and long-term 
incentive awards vesting at 25% of 
maximum opportunity (25% of salary); and 
3. Maximum 
performance: 
comprising fixed pay, 100% of annual bonus 
(125% of salary) and 100% vesting of long-
term incentive awards (100% of salary). 
Service Contracts 
All of the FEDs have a service contract terminable by either 
party giving the other 12 months’ written notice. 
The notice period for new Execut ive Directors will not exceed 
12 months on either side. For new Executive Directors, if notice 
is served by either party, the Executive Director may continue 
to receive base salary, benefits and pension fo r the duration 
of their notice period during which time the Company may 
require the individual to fulfil their current role or may place 
the individual on garden leave. The Company may elect to 
make a payment of base salary, plus an amount in lieu of 
benefits/pension contribution/equivalent or just base salary, 
in lieu of notice. 
At the time of the Company’s admission to trading on the 
Main Market in August 2016, each of the FEDs entered 
into new service contracts. These contracts contain special 
provisions relating to termination of employment (as described 
further in this policy on page 90) reflecting these individuals’ 
status as founder directors and certain terms of their previous 
service contracts.  
These special terms will not be included in the contracts of 
new Executive Directors who are recruited externally or who 
are promoted from within the Group. 
The service agreements are available to shareholders to 
view at the Company’s Registered Office on request from 
the Company Secretary and at the Annual General Meeting. 
Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of appointment 
Non-Executive Directors each have a Letter of Appointment 
and their remuneration is determined by the Board. The initial 
appointment of a Non-Executive Director is for three years 
and their appointment is terminable on three months’ notice 
on either side. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in 
any of the Company’s bonus or share schemes. 
The letters of appointment are available to shareholders to 
view at the Company’s Registered Office on request from 
the Company Secretary and at the Annual General Meeting.

 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
External Directorships and Memberships 
Executive Directors are encouraged to take up one external 
directorship, subject to the prior approval of the Board. In 
considering the appointment, the Board will consider whether 
the appointment will have an ad verse impact on the Director’s 
role within the Company and whether it will be a conflict of 
interest. Fees earned may be retained by the Director. At 
present, no Executive Director has an external directorship. 
Executive Directors and employees are also encouraged 
to join, when invited, advisory committees of industries and 
professional bodies directly related to the Company’s business. 
This helps to keep the Comp any informed of any future 
regulations or trends which may affect it in the future, as well 
as providing the opportunity to influence future decision 
making. Currently, the Company has representatives on 
various committees of the British Property Federation, the 
Property Finance Forum and on the Revo Marketing 
Committee and Purple Apple Marketing Awards Task Force. 
Recruitment Arrangements 
The Committee will apply the same remuneration policy and 
principles when setting the remuneration package for a new 
Executive Director. The Committee will take into consideration 
all relevant factors to ensure th at pay arrangements are in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Ongoing benefits, pension provisions, annual bonus 
participation and awards under both the 2016 DBP and the 
2016 PSP will be in line with those stated in the policy. 
Different performance measures may be set for any initial 
awards under the ABP and 2016 PSP taking into account the 
responsibilities of the individual and the point in the year that 
they joined and the rules of the applicable plan. The rationale 
will be clearly explained in the Annual Report following such 
recruitment. The level of bonus which may be paid will be 
pro-rated to reflect the time in the year when the Executive 
Director joins. 
In addition, the Committee will have discretion to make 
payments or awards to buy out incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above 
the approach outlined in the ta ble above and may exercise the 
discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2R if necessary to do 
so. In doing so, the Committee will seek, to the best possible 
extent, to do no more than match the fair value of the awards 
forfeited, taking account of the applicable performance 
conditions, the likelihood of those conditions being met and 
the proportion of the applicable vesting period remaining.  
Where an Executive Director appointment is an internal 
candidate, the Committee will honour any pre-existing 
remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay 
arrangements that relate to the individual’s previous role. 
The Committee retains the discretion to offer appropriate 
remuneration outside the standard policy where an interim 
appointment is made to fill an executive role on a short term 
basis or where exceptional circumstances require that the 
Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an 
executive function. 
Termination of employment and change of control 
Ongoing policy 
Excepting the service contracts for the FEDs, payments in lieu 
of notice will be limited to th e Director’s basic salary for the 
unexpired portion of the notice period. The Committee will 
aim to minimise the level of payments to that Director, having 
regard to all circumstances, including the Company’s 
contractual obligations to the Director, the reason for 
departure, and the Company’s policy on mitigation.  
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the 
Company in respect of his/her statutory employment rights or 
any other claim arising from the employment or its termination, 
the Committee will be entitled to negotiate settlement terms 
with the Director that the Committee considers to be 
reasonable in the circumstances and is in the best interests 
of the Company, and to enter into a settlement agreement 
with the Director. The Committee has discretion to pay a 
Director’s legal fees in relation to a settlement agreement. 
In addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment 
on termination set out above, the Group’s incentive plans 
and share plans contain provisions relating to termination  
of employment and change of control. The policy in respect  
of the different circumstances is laid out in the table below. 
Certain awards granted to FEDs have different terms, and 
these are set out in the table opposite.

number of shares can, at the discretion of 
the Committee, be reduced on a pro-rata 
basis to reflect the time between grant and 
the leave date compared with the vesting 
period. Other than in the case of death, the 
Committee can determine that the awards 
will become exercisable within the 
6 months following the vesting date. 
 
Outstanding awards will 
immediately lapse in full, unless 
the Committee, in its absolute 
discretion, permits them to be 
exercisable within a period 
determined by the Committee but 
expiring no later than 12 months 
after cessation of employment or

The vesting of awards will be subject to 
the satisfaction of applicable performance 
conditions (which may be modified to

downwards for time at the discretion of 
the Committee.  
If an employee dies, his awards will be 
exercisable within the 12 month period 
following the date of death. In other 
circumstances, awards will normally be 
exercisable during the 12 month period 
following the vesting date of the award, 
save that the Committee may allow the 
awards to be exercised within 12 months 
of the cessation of employment. Pro-rating 
will not apply to any awards if the employee 
ceases employment during a holding

reason. For awards granted under the ABP, the Committee 
also has discretion to determine that any leaver is a 
Good leaver. 
Other leaver relates to individuals who leave for any 
other reason. 
Any discretion exercised by the Committee shall be on a case 
by case basis.  
No payment for compensation for lo ss of office will be made to 
the Chairman or any Non-Executive Director other than where 
the Company determines that fees for the notice period should 
be paid. 
Arrangements for the FEDs 
The Founding Executive Directors founded NewRiver Retail 
Limited in 2009. This company was registered in Guernsey 
and listed on AIM. Each FED had a service contract with that 
company which was considered appropriate for an AIM listed 
company. When NewRiver moved its listing from AIM to the 
main market, NewRiver REIT plc was incorporated in the UK 
and new service contracts which were considered appropriate 
for a main market listed company were entered into.  
When moving to their new service contracts, the FEDs gave 
up certain contractual rights in th eir original contracts to ensure 
that their new contracts were in keeping with best practice and 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. For example, each FED 
gave up the right to: (1) have 12 months’ average bonus 
included in any payment in lieu of notice on termination; 
(2) the right to an immediate payment in lieu of notice, instead 
accepting that the payment should be paid in six monthly 
instalments and subject to reduction in the event of a breach 
discovered after termination; (3) the right to a liquidated 
damages payment in the event that the Company sought 
to terminate the contract in breach other than in limited 
circumstances. In addition, David Lockhart and Allan Lockhart 
gave up rights regarding their notice periods & working and 
payment in lieu of notice. 
Accordingly, the Company has included clauses in the FED’s 
contracts which are unique to them and recognise what they 
have sacrificed so that their new service contracts comply 
more closely with best practice and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. These clauses will not form part of a 
contract for a new Executive Director. 
Clauses Unique to the FEDs 
The Company has discretion to make a payment in lieu of all 
or part of any unexpired notice period at the rate of 125% base 
salary for that period. The Company may choose to pay in 
instalments over a 6 month period.  
Where a FED is constructively dismissed, the Company is 
required to pay 125% of base sala ry. If within 12 months of any 
change of control any FED’s employment is terminated (other 
than for cause) or he is cons tructively dismissed, the Company 
is required to pay 125% of base salary. The Company may put 
a FED on garden leave for up to six months’ at any time after 
notice is given or received, during which period he continues 
to receive salary and all other benefits. Where a FED’s 
employment ceases part-way through a bonus year other than 
(1) for cause; or (2) due to voluntary resignation (which, in the 
case of David Lockhart, shall not include retirement), he will 
be entitled to any unpaid bonu s earned for the prior year and 
remains eligible for a bonus for any part of his notice period 
worked or while on garden le ave. Where a FED’s employment 
is terminated within 12 months of a change of control (other 
than for cause) or he is constructively dismissed, in addition 
to an immediate payment in lieu of notice of 125% base salary 
he will also be entitled to pro- rata bonus up to the termination 
date and compensation for loss of bonus for the notice period 
calculated by reference to his three year average bonus. 
Where a FED resigns within 12 months of a change of control, 
the Company may require him to work the first 6 months of his 
notice period or place him on garden leave for that period and 
shall on the expiry of the applicable period pay an immediate 
lump sum of 125% base salary in lieu of remaining notice. The 
FED shall remain eligible for bonus for any period of worked 
notice and/or garden leave served.  
For awards granted under the 2009 PSP prior to 1 June 2015, 
if David Lockhart or Allan Lockhart is a Good leaver, he may 
normally exercise these awards within the 12 month period 
after cessation of employment. These awards are not pro-rated 
on cessation of employment. 
For awards granted under the 2009 USOP, David Lockhart 
and Allan Lockhart will additionally be a good leaver if they 
terminate office or employment following receipt of notice 
from his employer in accordance with the terms of his service 
agreement (other than where such notice is given in 
circumstances where he may be summarily dismissed in 
accordance with the terms of his service agreement with his 
employer), or in circumstances constituting constructive 
dismissal. If David Lockhart or Allan Lockhart is a Good leaver, 
he may normally exercise his awards granted under the 2009 
USOP within the 12 month period after cessation of 
employment. Awards granted under the 2009 USOP held by

For awards granted under the 2015 DBP and/or the 2016 DBP, 
the Committee is contractually obliged to exercise discretion 
to treat FEDs as good leavers if their employment terminates 
other than for (1) cause or (2) vo luntary resignation so that their 
awards are exercisable at a time determined by the Committee 
no later than the earlier of 12 months from the termination date 
and the 1st anniversary of vesting of the award.  
The Committee is contractually bound to exercise discretion 
to treat the FEDs as good leavers and preserve subsisting 
2009/2016 PSP awards in all circumstances where a FED’s 
employment terminates other than for (1) cause or (2) voluntary 
resignation. The awards remain in force until the usual vesting 
date and vesting is subject to performance targets and time 
pro-rating (subject to the Committee’s discretion to disapply). 
Where the FED is not required to work full notice, pro rating 
(if any) will be applied assuming the full 12 month notice period 
was worked. In respect of all PSP awards, when considering 
the exercise of its discretion in connection with the extent of 
vesting in connection with cessation of employment and/or 
a change of control event, the Committee will act fairly and 
reasonably and in good faith ta king into account the following: 
(1) where relevant, shareholder value derived by shareholders 
during the performance period applicable to the relevant 
award/in connection with the change of control; and/or (2) the 
FED’s actual contribution and the contribution he would have 
likely made during the performance period for the award (but 
for early termination or the change of control occurring); and 
(3) any other factors it considers relevant. 
The Committee is contractually bound to treat David Lockhart 
as a good leaver and to pres erve his 2009 PSP/2016 PSP 
awards (1) on cessation of employment but remaining / moving 
to be a Non-Executive Director (in which case pro-rating is 
disapplied up to the point the NED role ceases), and (2) in 
event of ill-health of his wife or long-term partner (in which case 
time pro-rating applies subject to the Committee’s discretion).

Annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2017 
The Company commenced the year as an AI M company and operated a discretionary annual bonus scheme under which bonuses 
were paid to executives for achieving Group corporate and personal objectives. Based on the Company’s performance, as 
described in the Chief Executive’s strategic review on page 14, bo nuses paid in respect of the year to 31 March 2017 are set ou t 
below and in the table on page 92. 70% was paid in cash and 30 % into nil-cost share options deferred for two years in line with the 
Company’s proposed policy.

Mark Davies:  Total bonus paid:  £362,500 (100% of salary received) 
The normal maximum bonus paid is 100% of base salary, however that could have been increased to 150% of base salary on the 
basis of exceptional performance. 
As described in the Remuneration Policy on page 84, a new bonu s plan for FY18 onwards has been introduced which sets more 
detailed objectives and targets to be met by the Executive Directors which is in co mpliance with market norms. Retrospective 
disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be set out in the Remuneration Report for the year ending 
31 March 2018, provided that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.

Each award is subject to clawback and malus provisions in line with the Company’s proposed policy. 
Each award is subject to two performance conditions which will be tested over a three year period. The performance conditions a re 
outlined in further detail below: 
50% of each award will be based on the Company's total sharehol der return (TSR) compared to that of the FTSE All Share index 
(the TSR Benchmark). 50% of each award will be based on the Co mpany's Total Accounting Return (TAR) compared to those UK 
REITs that report their NAV on an EPRA basis as at the date of award (the TAR Benchmark). TAR is defined as the annualised retu rn 
over the performance period based on the change in EPRA NAV per share and the level of dividends paid per share.  
The range of targets, for both perf ormance conditions, is as follows: 
Range % award vesting 
Less than 100% of the index 0 
Equal to 100% of the index 25 
More than 100% but less than 125% of the index between 25 and 75 on a straight line basis 
More than 125% but less than 150% of the index between 75 and 100 on a straight line basis 
Equal to 150% of the index or more 100

Unapproved Share Option Plan 
The Unapproved Share Option Plan has vested and the participants have until the tenth anniversary from the date of grant for ea ch 
award in which to exercise the options. The exercise price per share to be paid upon exercise is shown against each award. 
Performance Share Plan 
The performance conditions for the 2014 award are based on a three year performance period in terms of absolute Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) and growth in adjusted EPRA earnings per share (“EPS”). The measures ar e weighted 50:50 so that 
half of the award depends on the performance of TSR and half on the growth in EPS. TSR will be measured from grant and EPS 
growth will be measured from the latest completed financial year. The performance period ended at 31 March 2017 and only the 
EPS performance condition had been met. Accordingly, only 50% of the 2014 award vested an d is available to exercise. 
The 2015 PSP award was an enhanced award over 200% of salari es and was split into two awards, with the first award being 
measured against a three year performance period and the second award being measured against a four year performance 
period. The performance conditions are the same for both awards and are as follows: 
TSR performance condition 
• 33.4% of the award is subject to a TSR performance condition. 25% of the award vests if TSR is 9% on a compound annual basis 
over the three year and four year vest ing periods with full vesting at 16% (with straight-line vesting in between). 
EPRA EPS performance condition 
• 33.3% of the award is subject to an EP RA EPS performance condition. 25% of the award vests if the compound annual 
percentage growth in the Adjusted EPRA EPS over the three year and four year ve sting periods is 5% per annum with full 
vesting at 12% (with straight-line vesting in between). 
Net Asset Value per share plus divi dends (‘NAV’) performance condition 
• the remainder of the award is subject to a NAV performance condition. 25% of the award vests if the compound annual 
percentage growth in the Adjusted EPRA NAV on a compound an nual basis over the three year and four year vesting periods 
is 9% per annum with full vesting at 16% (with straight-line vesting in between).

103 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED 
Viability Statement 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 
104
 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2016 revision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has assessed 
the prospects of the Group over a longer period than the 
12 months that has in practice been the focus of the ‘Going 
Concern’ provision. 
The Board, as part of its strategy process, has assessed the 
viability of the Group over a th ree year period to March 2020 
as this timeframe gives greater certainty over the forecasting 
used. When assessing the Group’s long-term viability, the 
Board considered the Group’s existing investment 
commitments, available financial resources and long-term 
financing arrangements. They also considered profits; the 
three year cash flow forecast for the portfolio, the Group’s 
funding requirements, REIT compliance and other key financial 
ratios over the period, as well as the headroom in the financial 
covenants contained in our various loan agreements. 
In making their assessment, the Directors assessed the 
potential impacts, in severe but plausible scenarios, of the 
principal risks as set out on pages 56 and 57 together with the 
likely degree of effectiveness of mitigating actions reasonably 
expected to be available to the Group.  
The most relevant, with the highest potential impact, of these 
risks on viability were considered to be: 
• market/economic changes such as higher interest rates, 
reduced availability of credit and increasing investment 
yields restricting development and causing valuation falls; 
• a decline in property valuations as a result of investment 
decisions could result in lower income and capital returns 
to shareholders than forecast and expose them to 
unforeseen risks and liabilities; and 
• poor control of development projects could lead to 
inadequate returns on investment and over exposure 
to developments could put pressure on cash flow and 
debt financing. 
• the Group has a significant portion of borrowings that 
fall due within one year of the balance sheet date. The 
Directors are currently in advanced negotiations with 
the existing lenders and with some new lenders to agree 
facilities to refinance the existing borrowings. The Directors 
are confident that these bank facilities can be refinanced, 
or in the absence of available bank finance that the 
properties could be sold at a value significantly above 
the associate borrowing. 
The nature of the Group’s business as the owner and asset 
manager of a diverse income producing portfolio of shopping 
centres, retail warehouses, high street assets, and public 
houses located throughout the UK and let to a wide variety 
of national tenants reduces the impact of adverse changes in 
the general economic environment or market conditions in 
any one sector on the Group. 
On the basis of this and other matters considered by the Board 
during the year, the Board has a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their 
detailed assessment. 
Going concern 
The Directors of NewRiver REIT plc have reviewed the current 
and projected financial position of the Group making 
reasonable assumptions about future trading and performance.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
  NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
105
 
The Group’s annual report for the year ended 31 March 2017 
contains the following statement of Directors’ responsibilities. 
Certain parts of the annual report are not included within this 
announcement. 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group’s financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.  
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required by International Accounting Standard 1 to: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IRFSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole; 
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and 
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. 
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of 
Directors on 15 May 2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

Opinion on financial statements  
of NewRiver REIT plc 
106
 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with In ternational Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS 101) “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements that we have audited comprise the Co nsolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 26 and A to D. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.  The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Ki ngdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. 
Summary of our audit approach 
Key risks 
 
The key risks that we identified in the current year were: 
• Valuation of shopping centre, high street and retail warehouse portfolio;  
• Valuation of pub portfolio; and 
• Accounting for investment property acquisitions and disposals  
Within this report, any new risks are identified with          and any risks which are the same as the prior year 
identified with        . 
Materiality 
 
The materiality that we used in the current year was £13,691,000 which was determined on the basis 
of approximately 2% of shareholders equity. 
Scoping 
 
We performed a full scope audit to respond to the risks of material misstatement for the Group and 
performed an audit of specified account balances for the joint venture entities.  
Together these elements account for 100% of the Group's net assets and 100% of profit before tax. 
Significant changes  
in our approach 
 
There have been no significant changes to our audit approach in 2017, other than focussing our 
accounting for investment property acquisitions and disposals risk to the acquisition of the 
Bexleyheath properties.

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the group 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained 
within note 1 to the financial statemen ts and the Directors’ statement on the 
longer-term viability of the group contained within the Directors’ Report on  
page 104. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 74 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; 
• the Disclosures on pages 55 to 57 that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated; 
• the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; and 
• the Directors’ explanation on page 120 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what peri od they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.  
We confirm that we have nothing material 
to add or draw attention to in respect of 
these matters. 
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption 
of the going concern basis of accounting 
and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
Independence 
  
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the group and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. 
 
We confirm that we are independent of the 
group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those 
standards. We also confirm we have not 
provided any of the prohibited non-audit

Valuation of shopping centre, high street and retail warehouse portfolio
Risk description 
 
NewRiver REIT plc owns and manages a portfolio of commercial property assets. The valuation of shopping 
centre, high street and retail ware house portfolio (including a number of development properties) is a 
significant judgement area and is underpinned by a number of assumptions.  
The Group uses professionally qualified external valuers to fair value its portfoli o at six-monthly intervals. 
The portfolio (excluding development properties) is valued using the ‘investment method’ of valuation, 
in which the principal assumptions include estimated include rental values and capitalisation yields. 
Development properties are valued by applying the same methodology, but with a deduction for all future 
costs necessary to complete the development together with an allowance for remaining risk, developers’ 
profit and purchasers’ costs (‘the residual method’).  
The Group's share of property assets are valued at £952.8 million (2016: £797.3 million) of which 
£818.2 million are held by subsidiaries (2016: £663.2 million) and £134.6 million by joint ventures 
(2016: £134.1 million). 
Please see note 1 and 12 to the financial statements and discussion in the report of the Audit Committee 
on page 74. 
How the scope  
of our audit 
responded to  
the risk 
 
We assessed, in consultation with our property valuation specialists, management’s process for reviewing 
and challenging the work of the ex ternal valuer and development appraisals. We also assessed the 
competence, independence and integrity of the external valuer. 
In consultation with our property valuation specialists, we performed detailed analysis of the valuations 
for a sample of properties in the portfolio. We perfor med audit procedures to assess the integrity of 
information provided to the independent valuer including agreement on a sample basis back to 
underlying lease agreements. 
Alongside our property valuation specialists, we held discussions with the external valuers of the portfolio 
to understand the valuation process, performance of the portfolio and significant assumptions and critical 
judgement areas, including estimated rental values and yields. We benchmarked these assumptions to 
relevant external industry data and comparable property transactions, in particular the yield. 
For development properties we assessed future co sts to complete based on development appraisals. 
We assessed the classification of development properties and whether the methodology applied (i.e. 
investment or residual method) was appropriate. We also challenged the allowances in the valuation 
for developers’ profit. 
Key observations 
 
We have concluded that the assumptions applied in arriving at the fair value of the Group's shopping 
centre, high street and retail wa rehouse portfolio by the external valuers were appropriate and that 
resulting valuations were within an acceptable range.

Valuation of pub portfolio 
Risk description 
 
NewRiver REIT plc owns a pub portfolio with fair value of £177.8 million (2016: £176.0 million) comprising 
350 pubs (195 in the Trent portfolio and 155 in the Mantle portfolio).  
The extent and variety of judgements involved in the valuation of the pub portfolio is different to the rest 
of the investment property portfolio due to the specific operational nature of the properties, as well as the 
contractual arrangements in place with Marston’s, the Co-op and LT Pub Management. 
The Group uses professionally qualified external valuers to fair value its portfoli o at six-monthly intervals. 
Within the portfolio, 285 pubs (fair value of £122.6m) are valued as income producing pubs using the 
‘investment method’ of valuation, whereby the principa l assumptions include income from fair maintainable 
trade (“FMT”) and capitalisation multiples.  
The 34 development properties (fair value of £24.7m) are valued using a gross development value 
calculated as initial rent due upon completion of the development with an applied capitalisation yield; less 
a deduction for future costs to complete and an al lowance for planning risk, developers’ profit and 
purchasers’ costs (‘the residual method’). 
In addition to the above there ar e 22 properties where a new rental agreement has been signed with 
Marston’s (fair value of £14.9m) and 9 completed development properties delivered to the Co-op (fair value 
of £14.3m). These are valued using the ‘investment meth od’ of valuation, where the principal inputs include 
rental values and capitalisation yields. 
Please see note 1 and 12 to the financial statements and discussion in the report of the Audit Committee 
on page 74. 
How the scope  
of our audit 
responded to  
the risk 
 
We assessed, in consultation with our property valuation specialists, management’s process for reviewing 
and challenging the work of the ex ternal valuer and development appraisals. We also assessed the 
competence, independence and integrity of the external valuer. 
Alongside our property valuation specialists, we held discussions with the external valuers of the portfolio 
to understand the valuation process, performance of the portfolio and significant assumptions and critical 
judgement areas. This included the following specific procedures for each part of the pub portfolio:  
In respect of the income producing pubs: 
• We engaged with our internal valuation specialists in order to benchmark the capitalisation multiples 
applied by the external valuers against relevant industry data and market transactions. 
• For a sample of pubs we benchmarked FMT adopted by the external valuer against actual historic 
performance (including contracted fixed rent, beer volumes and beer margin), corroborating explanations 
for any differences. 
In respect of the development properties: 
• For a sample of development properties and alongside our internal valuation specialists, we challenged 
and corroborated movements in valuations.  
• This included verification of underlying costs and stage of completion to reports from the Group's 
external quantity surveyors and agreeing planning risk assumptions to reports provided by the Group's 
external planning consultants.  
• Through consultation with our internal valuation specialist, we also considered whether the allowances 
in the valuation for developers’ profit were consistent with industry adopted allowances. 
In respect of the remaining properties: 
• We engaged with our internal valuation specialists in order to benchmark the capitalisation yields applied 
by the external valuers for the Marston's and Co -op leases against relevant industry data and 
comparable property transactions. 
• We agreed contracted rent back to underlying lease agreements with Marston's and the Co-op. 
Key observations 
 
We have concluded that the assumptions applied in arriving at the fair value of the Group's pub portfolio 
by the external valuers were appropriate and that resu lting valuations were within an acceptable range.

Accounting for investment property acquisitions and disposals
Risk description 
 
The structure of acquisition and disposal agreements can be complex and the a ccounting treatment needs 
to accurately reflect the nature of the transaction, which can be dependent on the specific terms within the 
legal documentation. 
The acquisition of Bexleyheath, with a gross property value of £120 million, represents the Group’s largest 
acquisition to date. The transaction was completed through the purchase of two corporate vehicles.  
This transaction was considered to be an area of sign ificant risk as the transaction involved the acquisition 
of two corporate vehicles rather than a direct asse t acquisition. Judgement is required to determine 
whether the transaction was the acquisition a group of assets, or a business combination in the scope of 
IFRS 3. This was determined to represent an asset acquisition and therefore accounted for in accordance 
with the requirements of IAS 40 Investment property. 
The Group continued to recycle capital through a number of other acquisitions and disposals, none 
of which were considered to be material or complex by nature.  
Please see note 1 to the financial statements and discussion in the report of the Audit Committee  
on page 74. 
How the scope  
of our audit 
responded to  
the risk 
 
In respect of Bexleyheath, we considered management’s analysis of the transaction and assessed their 
rationale for concluding that it represented an asset acqusition. In particular, we challenged management 
to demonstrate that the two corporate vehicl es acquired did not constitute a business. 
We have examined relevant documents including th e sale and purchase agreement to confirm the 
consideration paid and other particulars of acquisit ion, including agreement of a sample of related 
costs to supporting documentation. We reviewed the accuracy of the accounting entries made. 
In determining whether other acquisitions and dispos als were considered to be material or complex by 
nature, we made inquiries of management, examined the sale and purchase agreements for a sample 
of transactions and recalculated the relevant accounting entries made. 
We also reviewed the completeness and accuracy of disclosures presented in the financial statements 
in relation to transactions in the year. 
Key observations 
 
We have concluded that the accounting for investment property acquisitions and disposals, including the 
acquisition of the Bexleyheath property, have been appropriately accounted for and disclosed within the 
financial statements. 
 
These matters were addressed in the contex t of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evalua ting the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materi ality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Group materiality  £13,691,000 (2016: £13,620,000) 
Basis for determining 
materiality 
 We determined materiality for the Group based on ap proximately 2% (2016: 2%) of shareholders' equity. 
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied 
 In determining materiality, we considered the balances on which the users of the financial statements 
would judge the performance of the Group. As net asset value takes into consideration the valuation 
of the Group’s property portfolio, we determined the shareholders equity of to be a key performance 
indicator for shareholders. 
In addition to net assets, we consider EPRA earnings to be a critical performance measure for the Group and a measure used 
within the Real Estate industry. For account balances and classes of transactions that affect EPRA earnings we applied a lower level 
materiality threshold of £2,260,000 (2016: £1,349,000), being approximately 5% (2016: 5%) of EPRA earnings. We agreed with the 
Audit Committee that this was appropriate as EPRA earnings is a key performance measure for the Group but is a relatively low 
amount compared to our overall Group materiality set out above. 
 
 
 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £273,000 
(2016: £272,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters th at we identified when assessing the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of th e Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
We performed a full scope audit to respond to the risks of material misstatement for the Group and performed an audit of specif ied 
account balances for the joint venture enti ties. Together these elements account for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group's net asset s 
and 100% (2016: 100%) of Group’s profit before tax. Our audit work was executed at levels of Group or EPRA earnings materiality 
applicable to each account balance.  
The audit of the Group’s joint venture with Morgan Stanley Real Es tate Fund (“MSREF”), which has a 31 December 2016 year end, i s 
carried out by BDO LLP. Other joint ventures of the Group ar e audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP and also have 31 
December 2016 year ends. We have obtained and reviewed audited financial statements and held detailed discussions with the 
joint venture auditors to understand the scope of their audit, findings and overall conclusions.  
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process. We have obtained an understanding of the Group’s system of 
internal controls and undertaken a combination of procedures, all of which are designe d to target the Group’s identified risks of 
material misstatement in the most effective manner possible. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in acco rdance with the Companies Act 
2006;  
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statemen ts 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In the light of the knowledge an d understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have 
not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
 
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with th e accounting records and returns. 
 
We have nothing to 
report arising from 
these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to re view part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
 
We have nothing to 
report arising from 
our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report  
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Irel and), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
 
We confirm that we 
have not identified 
any such 
inconsistencies or 
misleading 
statements.

General information 
NewRiver REIT plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (togethe r the ‘Group’) is a property investment group specialising in 
commercial real estate in the UK.  
Scheme of arrangement 
During the year, the Group completed its move from AIM to the premium listing segment of the official list, trading on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. NewRiver REIT plc became the ultimate parent company, with the former parent company, 
NewRiver Retail Limited, becoming a direct subsidiary of NewR iver REIT plc, in a scheme of arrangement on 18 August 2016. The 
principal steps of the group reorganisation were as follows: 
NewRiver REIT plc was incorporated in the United Kingdom on 8 June 2016 under the Companies Act 2006 as a public company. 
On incorporation, the share capital of NewRiver REIT plc was £50,000.02 divided into 2 ordinary shares of 1 pence and 50,000 
redeemable preference shares of £1. The preferen ce shares were redeemed on 12 October 2016. 
As part of a scheme of arrangement under Gu ernsey law, all issued ordinary shares in the capital of NewRiver Retail Limited, th e 
former holding company of the Group, were cancelled by way of a reduction of capital on 18 August 2016. Following the 
cancellation of the shares, NewRiver Retail Limited issued a corresponding number of ordinary shares to the Company, such that 
the Company held all of the issued shares in the capital of NewR iver Retail Limited. The Company has, in turn, issued ordinary 
shares to the former shareholders of NewRiver Retail Limited on a one-for-one basis. The result of the share cancellation and s hare 
issue is that the Company is now the ultimate parent company of the Group. 
Throughout the period from incorporation to 18 August 2016, Ne wRiver REIT plc was a dormant company with no revenues and no 
assets and did not constitute a business as defined by IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The transaction therefore falls outside th e 
scope of that standard. Following the guidance regarding the selection of an appropriate accounting policy provided by IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the transaction has been accounted for using the principles of 
merger accounting, allowed for group reconstructions, as set out in FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the 
UK and Republic of Ireland.  
This policy, which does not conflict with IFRS, reflects the economic substance of the transaction as a continuation of the pre vious 
Group. The comparatives presented in these consolidated financial statements are therefore the consolidated results and financial 
positon of NewRiver Retail Ltd for the year th en ended. In order to present equity as a continuation of the previous Group, sha re

Going concern 
The Directors of NewRiver REIT plc have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group making reasonable 
assumptions about future trading and performance. The key areas reviewed were: 
• Value of investment property 
• Timing of property transactions 
• Capital expenditure and tenant incentives  
• Rental income 
• Loan covenants 
• Capital and debt funding 
The Group has cash and short-term deposits, as well as profit able rental income streams and as a consequence the Directors 
believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks. Whilst the Group has borrowing facilities in place, as detailed in 
note 19, the Group is currently within all financial covenants. The Group has bank facilities to fund any future risk-controlle d 
developments. The Group has a significant portion of borrowings that fall due within one year of the balance sheet date. The 
Directors are currently in advanced negotiations with the existing lenders and with some new lend ers to agree facilities to ref inance 
the existing borrowings. The Directors are confident that these bank facilities can be refinanced, or in the absence of available 
bank finance that the properties could be sold at a value significantly above the associate borrowing. 
After making enquiries and examining major areas which could give rise to significant financial exposure, the Board has a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparation of these financial statements. 
Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. Thes e 
policies have been consistently applied to all years presented. 
Basis of preparation  
Statement of compliance 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in ac cordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards, as adopted by the European Uni on (‘IFRS’), therefore the Group financial stat ements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation. The financial statements are pr esented in pounds Sterling. The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of in vestment properties and derivatives which are stated at fair va lue. 
Cash flow statement 
The Group has reported the cash flows from operating activities us ing the indirect method. Interest received is presented within 
investing cash flows; interest paid is presented within operati ng cash flows. The acquisitions of investment properties are dis closed 
as cash flows from investing activities because this most appropriately reflects the Group’s business activities. 
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries controlled by th e 
Company, made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to gove rn the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Intra group transactio ns 
are eliminated in full. 
Changes in accounting policy and disclosure 
In the current year, the following new and amended IFRSs and amendments have been adopted but have not had a material effect 
on the financial performance or position of the Group: 
• IAS 1 (Amendments) Disclosure Initiative 
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 (Amendments) – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
• IAS 27 (Amendments) Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 
• IFRS 11 (Amendments) Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 
• IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 (Amendments) Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle  
120 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017  
  NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
121 
• At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that 
have been issued but are not yet effective: 
• IAS 7 (Amendments) Disclosure Initiative 
• IAS 12 (Amendments) Recognition of De ferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 
• IAS 40 (Amendments) Transfers of Investment Property 
• IFRS 2 (Amendments) Classification and Meas urement of Share-based Payment Transactions 
• IFRS 4 (Amendments) – Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
• IFRS 16 Leases 
• IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statem ents 
of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 may impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments, IF RS 
15 may have an impact on revenue recogn ition and related disclosures and IFRS 16 may impact the recognition and measurement 
of leases on the Group’s balance sheet.  
Business combinations 
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of completion, of assets given, liabilitie s incurred or assumed, and equity instrumen ts 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for reco gnition under IFRS are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition. Where the fair value of the 
consideration is less than the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities then the difference is recognised as a bargain 
purchase in the income statement. 
Each acquisition is considered by management in light of the substance of the acquisition to determine whether the acquisition 
is a business combination or acquisition of investment property.  
Joint ventures 
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity me thod of accounting. The Group’s joint ventures are entities ov er 
which the Group has joint control with a partner. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adj usted 
by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net asse ts of the joint venture, less any impairment. In assessing whet her 
a particular entity is controlled, the Group considers all of the contractual terms of the arrangement, whether it has the powe r to 
govern the financial and operating policies of the joint venture so as to obtain benefits from its activities, and the existenc e of any 
legal disputes or challenges to this control in order to conclude whether the Group controls the joint venture.  
Investment property 
Property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, is classified as investment property. Investment property comprises 
both freehold and leasehold land and buildings. 
Investment property is recognised as an asset when: 
• It is probable that the future economic benefits that are associated with the investment prope rty will flow to the Company; 
• There are no material conditions precedent which coul d prevent completion; and 
• The cost of the investment property can be measured reliably. 
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including transaction costs. After initial recognition, investment prope rty is 
carried at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of invest ment property are included in the income statement in the period 
in which they arise. 
When the Group begins to redevelop an investment property fo r continued future use as an in vestment property, the property 
remains an investment property.  
Investment property is derecognised when th e risk and rewards of the property is tran sferred to the purchaser. Gains or losses on 
the sale of properties are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subseque nt 
capital expenditure.

1 Accounting policies continued 
Property, plant and equipment 
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any re cognised impairment loss. Depreciation is 
recognised over the useful lives of the equipment, using the straight-line method at a rate of between 10% to 25% depending 
on the useful life.  
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determ ined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carryin g 
amount of the asset. 
Operating leases 
As lessor 
The cost of securing an operating lease are capitalised within the carrying amount of the related investment property and 
amortised over the lease term. Revenue from operating leas es is recognised as per the revenue recognition policy. 
As lessee 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party, the lessor, are clas sified 
as operating leases. Payments including prepayments, made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the 
lessor) are charged to income statement on a stra ight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which 
are readily accessible.  
Financial instruments  
Financial assets 
Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair valu e through profit or loss or loans and receivables as appropriat e. The 
Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised upon becoming party 
to the contractual terms and are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through pr ofit or 
loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The fair value of a non-interest bearing asset is its discounted receivable amou nt. If the 
due date of the asset is less than one year, discounting is omitted. 
The Group’s financial assets consist of cash, lo ans and receivables and derivative instruments. 
The financial instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include interest rate swap and ca p 
arrangements. Recognition of the derivative financial instruments takes place when the hedging contracts are entered into. 
They are recognised at fair value and transaction costs are included directly in finance costs.  
The fair values of derivative financial assets an d financial liabilities are determined as follows: 
Interest rate swaps and caps are measured using the midpoint of the yi eld curve prevailing on the reporting date. The valuations 
do not include accrued interest from the previous settlement date to the reporting date. The fair value represents the net pres ent 
value of the difference between the contracted rate and the valuat ion rate when applied to the pr ojected balances for the period 
from the reporting date to the contracted expiry dates. 
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Gro up 
transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
The Group assesses at each financial position date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulty of the obligor, breach of contract , or it 
becomes probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy), the as set is tested for impairment. The amount of the loss is measured 
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future ca sh flows (that is the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognit ion). The carrying amount of th e asset is reduced through us e of an allowance account. 
The amount of the loss is recogn ised in the income statement. 
Trade receivables are carried at amortised cost less a provision for impairment where there is objective evidence (such as the 
probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all o f the amounts 
due under the original terms. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. 
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss de creased and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reve rsed to the extent that the 
carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised costs at the reversal date.

  NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
123 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss or as other liabilities. A financial liability is der ecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
All loans and borrowings are classified as other liabilities. Initial recognition is at fair value less directly attributable t ransaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effecti ve 
interest method. 
Financial liabilities included in trade and other payables are re cognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. 
The fair value of a non-interest bearing liability is its discounted repayment amount. If the due date of the liability is less than one 
year, discounting is omitted. 
Hedge accounting 
Hedges of interest rate risk on firm commitments are designated as cash flow hedges where the hedge is expected to be highly 
effective. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedge d 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group docu ments whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of deriv atives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in 
the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss , in the same line of the income statement as the hedged item.  
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accoun ting. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occ ur, 
the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Share capital 
Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. The cost of issuing share capital is 
recognised directly in equity against the proceeds from the share capital. 
Taxation 
Income tax 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of th e tax laws enacted or substantiv ely enacted at the date of the 
balance sheet. Tax is recognised in the income statement. 
Deferred tax 
Any deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the pe riod when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asse t can be 
utilised. 
Value added tax 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax except: 
• Where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case the value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 
applicable; and 
• Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of value added tax included. The net amount of value added tax 
recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of equity settled transactions is me asured with reference to the fair value at the date at which they were granted. Wh ere 
vesting performance conditions are non-market based, the fair valu e excludes the effect these vest ing conditions and an estimate 
is made at each balance sheet date of the number of instruments expected to vest. The fair value is recognised over the vesting 
period in the income statement, with a corresponding increase in equity. Any change to the number of instruments with non-marke t 
vesting conditions expected to vest is recognised in the income statement for that period.

 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1 Accounting policies continued 
Employee Benefit Trust 
The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust for the exclusiv e benefit of the Group’s employees. The investment in the 
Company’s shares held by the trust is recognised at cost and deducted from equity . No gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancel lation of the shares held by the trust.  
Revenue recognition 
Rental income 
Rental income from fixed and minimum guaranteed rent reviews is recognised on a straight-line basis over the entire lease term. 
Where such rental income is recognised ahead of the related cash flow, an adjustment is made to ensure the carrying value of the 
related property including the accrued rent does not exceed the external valuation. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiatin g and 
arranging a new lease are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period from the date of lease commencement to the expiry 
date of the lease. 
Where a rent-free period is included in a le ase, the rental income foregone is allocate d evenly over the period from the date o f 
lease commencement to the expiry date of the lease. 
Where a lease incentive payment, or surrender premiums is paid to enhance the value of a pr operty, it is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the period from the date of lease co mmencement to the expiry date of the lease. It is management’s 
policy to recognise all material lease incentives and lease ince ntives greater than six months. Upon receipt of a surrender 
premium for the early determination of a le ase, the profit, net of dilapidations and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the 
lease concerned, is immediately reflected in income. 
Asset management fees 
Management fees are recognised in the inco me statement as the services are delivered. 
Promote payments 
The Group is contractually entitled to receive a promote payment should the returns from a joint venture to the joint venture p artner 
exceed a certain internal rate of return. This payment is only receivable by the Grou p on disposal of underlying properties hel d by 
the joint venture or other termination events. Any entitlements under th ese arrangements are only accrued for in the financial 
statements once the Group believes that crys tallisation of the fee is virtually certain. 
Dividends 
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, 
this is when paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by equity holders. 
Finance income and costs 
Finance income and costs are recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest ex pense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or rece ipts 
throughout the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the 
financial asset or financial liability. 
Service charge income and expense 
Service charge income is recognised in the accounting period in which the servic es are rendered and the related property 
expenses are recognised in the period in which they are incurred. 
Exceptional items 
Performance measures are adjusted to exclud e exceptional items. Exceptional items are items that are significant in size or nat ure, 
or are non-recurring and are adjusted to explain the performance of the Group. In the current and comparative year exceptional 
items consist of the Group’s expenses in relati on to the move from AIM to the Main Market.

2 Critical accounting judgements and estimates  
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates affe cting the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, of revenues and expenses, and of gains and losses. The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below. Estimates and judgements are 
continually evaluated and are based on hist orical experience as adjusted for current market conditions and other factors. 
Significant judgements  
Investment properties 
The Group’s investment properties are stated at fair value, base d on an independent external appraisal. The valuation of the 
Group’s development property portfolio and its joint ventures is inherently subjective due to, amongst other factors, the indiv idual 
nature of each property, forecast trading EBITDA, the status of planning consent, the assumption that vacant possession will be 
obtained, development cost projections, tenant credit risk and the expected future rental income. As a result, the valuation of the 
Group’s development property portfolio is subject to a degree of uncertainty and is based on information available at the date 
of valuation. 
Taxation 
The Company has elected for REIT status. To continue to qualify from the regime, the Group is re quired to comply with certain 
conditions as defined in the REIT legislation. Management are required to exercise judgement to determine whether each property 
acquisition should be included within the REIT rental property income business and whether, on disposal of that property, any g ain 
arising is capital or trading in nature and therefore whether it has triggered a tax charge to be payable to HMRC. 
The Group has unrecognised tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2017 as detailed in note 9. Judgement is required in assessin g 
the likelihood that taxable income will be available to utilise the losses. 
Accounting for acquisitions 
Management must assess whether the acquisition of property th rough the purchase of a corporate vehicle should be accounted 
for as an asset purchase or a business combination. Management exercise judgement to determine whether the acquired business 
or property contains processes and inputs in addition to property. When management conclude that processes and inputs are 
being acquired in addition to the property then the transaction is accounted for as a business combination. Where there are no 
such items, the transaction is treated as an asset purchase. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair 
value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill and reviewed annually for impairment. Any discount received or 
acquisition related costs are recognised in the income statement. 
Sources of estimation uncertainty 
As noted above, the Group’s investment properties are stated at fair value. The assumptions and estimates used to value the 
properties are detailed in note 12. Small changes in the key esti mates, such as the estimated future rental income, can have a 
significant impact on the valuation of the investment properti es, and therefore a significant im pact on the balance sheet and 
key performances measures such as Net Asset Value per share. Certain estimates require an assessment of factors not within 
management’s control, such as overall market conditions. 
Rents and ERVs have a direct relationship to valuation, while yield has an inverse relationship. Estimated costs of a developme nt 
project will inversely affect the valuation of development properties. There are interrelationships between all these unobserva ble 
inputs as they are determined by market c onditions. The existence of an increase in more than one unobservable input could be 
to magnify the impact on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two unobserva ble 
inputs moving in directions which have an opposite impact on value e.g. an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yie ld, 
resulting in no net impact on the valuation. 
The estimated fair value may differ from the price at which the Group’s assets could be sold. Actual realisation of net assets could 
differ from the valuation used in these financial statemen ts, and the difference could be significant.

3 Segmental reporting 
The chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors are of the opinion that the principal acti vity of 
the Group is to invest in commercial real estate in the UK. 
IFRS requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the Group that are 
regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker i.e. the Board of Directors. The internal financial reports received b y the 
Board contain financial information at a Group level and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these 
reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.  
The property portfolio includes investment properties located throughout the UK, pr edominantly regional investments outside 
London and comprises a diverse portfolio of commercial buildings including shopping centres, retail warehouses, high street ass ets 
and pubs. The Directors consider that these properties all contribute to delivering on a strategy of targeting higher-yielding 
property that offer attractive returns throug h rental income. Therefore, these individual pr operties have been aggregated into a 
single operating segment.  
All of the Group’s properties are based in the UK. No geographica l grouping is contained in any of the internal financial repor ts 
provided to the Board and, therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is disclosed.

Property operating expenses  15,705 6,253
Property operating expenses have increased year on year by 151% whilst property rental and related income has increased by 54%. 
The principal reasons for the increase is presentation of costs in relation to the pub portfolio and the acquisition of a prope rty in 
London with a significant ground rent. An element of the pub portfolio is transitioning from rece iving a net rent to a leased model 
whereby the Group receives gross in come and pays operating expenses.

recognised as an asset due to uncertainty over the availability of taxable income to utilise the losses. The losses do not expi re but 
are reliant on continuity of ownership and source of trade.

Real Estate Investment Trust regime (REIT regime) 
The Group is a member of the REIT regime whereby profits from its UK property rental business are tax exempt. The REIT regime 
only applies to certain property-related profits and has severa l criteria which have to be met. The main criteria are: 
• the assets of the property rental business mu st be at least 75% of the Group’s assets; 
• the profit from the tax-exempt property rental business must exceed 75% of the Group’s total profit 
• at least 90% of the Group’s profit from the property rental business must be paid as dividends. 
The Group continues to meet these conditions and management intends that the Group should continue as a REIT for the 
foreseeable future. 
10 Performance measures 
The Group’s key performance measure is ‘Funds from Operations’ or ‘FFO’. This performance measure is intended to measure the 
underlying profitability of the Group and as such includes real ised gains on disposals and adds back expense recognised for non-
cash share-based payment, unrealised gains and the one-off cost in respect of the costs of the move to the main market. The 
measure is not intended to replace the cash measures disclosed in the cash flow statement. The Group has previously referred to 
this measure as EPRA Adjusted earnings. The Group no longer discloses NAREIT FFO as a performance measure. 
The European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) issued Be st Practices Policy Recommendations in 2014 and additional 
guidance in 2016, which gives recommendations for performanc e measures. The EPRA earnings measure excludes investment 
property revaluations and gains on disposals, intangible asset movements and their related taxation. 
A reconciliation of the performance measures to the nearest IFRS measure is below:

The investments are several retail and leisure assets in the UK with a total carrying amount of £996 million. The valuation was 
determined using an income capitalisation method, which involves applying a yield to rental income streams. Inputs include yiel d, 
current rent and ERV. 
Development properties are valued using a residual method, which involves valuing the completed investment property using an 
investment method and deducting estimated costs to complete, then applying an appropriate discount rate. The relationship of 
unobservable inputs to fair value are the higher the rental values and the lower the yi eld, the higher the fair value. In respect of the 
pub portfolio the valuer makes judgements on whether to use resid ual value or a higher value to include development potential 
where appropriate. Where no conversion opportunity has been identified at present, the valuer has not specifically considered a n 
alternative use valuation.

These inputs include: 
• Rental value – total rental value per annum 
• Equivalent yield – the discount rate of the perpetual cash flow to produce a net present value of zero assuming a purchase at 
the valuation 
• EBITDA multiples and maintainable earnings from each pub 
There were no changes to valuat ion techniques during the year. 
Valuation reports are based on both information provided by the Group, e.g. current rents and le ase terms which is derived from 
the Company’s financial and property management systems and is subject to the Group’s over all control environment, and 
assumptions applied by the valuer, e.g. ERVs and yields. These assumptions are base d on market observation and the valuer’s 
professional judgement. 
Revenues are derived from a large number of tenants with no sing le tenant or group under common control contributing more than 
4% of the Group’s revenue. 
There are interrelationships between all these unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions. The effect of a n 
increase in more than one unobservable input would be to magnify the impact on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be 
mitigated by the interrelationship of two unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions, e.g. an increase in rent may be of fset 
by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation. Expected vacancy rates may impact the yield with higher 
vacancy rates resulting in higher yields.

A number of the Group’s borrowing arrangements place certain re strictions on the rent received each quarter. These do not 
prevent access to or use of this funding within the borrowing entities, however they do place certain restrictions on moving th ose 
funds around the wider group, typically requiring debt servicing costs to be paid before restrictions are lifted. The cash deposited 
under such arrangement totalled £21.2 million (March 2016: £7.1 million).

The Group has a significant portion of borrowings that fall due within one year of the balance sheet date. The Directors are 
currently in advanced negotiations with the existing lenders and with some new lenders to agree facilities to refinance the existing 
borrowings. The Directors are confident that these bank facilities can be refinanced, or in the absence of available bank finan ce 
that the properties could be sold at a value significantly above the associate borrowing.

Secured bank loans 
Bank loans are secured by way of legal charges on properties held by the Group and a hedging policy is adopted which is aligned 
with the property strategy on each of its assets. 
Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock (‘CULS’) (prior year) 
On 22 November 2010 the Group issued £25 million of CULS, £17 million of A CULS and £8 million of B CULS. On issue, the 
stockholder was able to convert all or any of the stock into Ordinary Shares at the ra te of one Ordinary Share for every £2.80. The 
conversion rate was subsequently adjusted on the A CULS and on the B CULS as a result of new shares being issued and 
dividends paid in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Under the terms of the convertible, interest accrued at 5.85% on the 
outstanding loan stock until 31 December 2015 when it would be either converted or repaid. The interest paya ble on the CULS was 
due biannually on the 30 June and 31 December. 
On 18 February 2014, £1.5 million B CULS we re converted at a conversion price of £2 .59 representing 579,151 Ordinary shares. On 
2 July 2015, £6.5 million B CULS were converted at a conversion price of £2.46 representing 2,653,061 Ordinary shares. 
On 25 November 2015, £17 million A CULS were converted at a co nversion price of £2.43 representing 6,995,884 Ordinary shares. 
As at 31 March 2016, all of the CULS had been converted and no CULS are currently outstanding.

21 Share capital and reserves 
Share capital 
During the year the Group completed its move from AIM to the pr emium listing segment of the official list, trading on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. NewRiver REIT plc became the ultimate parent company, with the former parent company, 
NewRiver Retail Limited, becoming a direct subsidiary of NewR iver REIT plc, in a scheme of arrangement on 18 August 2016. The 
principal steps of the group reorganisation were as follows: 
NewRiver REIT plc was incorporated in the United Kingdom on 8 June 2016 under the Companies Act 2006 as a public company. 
On incorporation, the share capital of NewRiver REIT plc was £50,000.02 divided into 2 ordinary shares of one pence each and 
50,000 redeemable preference shares of £1 each. The preference shares were redeemed on 12 October 2016. All ordinary shares 
have one vote per share. There are no voting rights attached to the preference shares. All shares are fully paid.  
As part of a scheme of arrangement under Gu ernsey law, all issued ordinary shares in the capital of NewRiver Retail Limited, th e 
former holding company of the Group, were cancelled by way of a reduction of capital on 18 August 2016. Following the 
cancellation of the shares, NewRiver Retail Limited issued a corresponding number of ordinary shares to the Company, such that 
the Company held all the issued shares in the capital of NewRiver Retail Limited. The Company has, in turn, issued ordinary sha res 
to the former shareholders of NewRiver Retail Limited on a one-for-one basis. The result of the share cancellation and share is sue 
is that the Company is now the ultimate parent company of the Group. 
On 18 August 2016, the Company issued 238 ,588,536 ordinary shares with a nominal value of one pence each to the former 
shareholders. The Company formed a new Empl oyee Benefit Trust (EBT) and the shares pr eviously held by the EBT of NewRiver 
Retail Limited were transferred to the new EBT of the Company.

Warrants 
Shareholders who subscribed for placing shares in the original share listing of NewRiver Retail Limited’s shares received warra nts, 
in aggregate, to subscribe for 3% of the fully diluted share ca pital. The subscription price is adjusted following the payment of 
dividends or share issuance and was 142p as at 31 March 2017. 377,000 remain outstanding (31 March 2016: 420,000). 
Other reserves 
Other reserves consisted of distributable reserves created upon the issue of share capital by NewRiv er Retail Limited. Upon the 
scheme of arrangement becoming effective the distributable reserves have been presented within retained earnings.  
Share option reserve 
Share option reserve consisted of the cumulative charge in rela tion to NewRiver Retail Limited’s employee share schemes. Upon 
the scheme of arrangement becoming effective and new share schemes being issued under the Company, the cumulative charge 
has been reclassified to retained earnings along with the related charge from the income statement.  
Revaluation reserves 
Revaluation reserves represented the unrealised retained earnings recognised based on the new movement in fair value of the 
Group’s investment properties. During the year the charge has been reclassified to retained earnings to be consistent with othe r 
investment property companies. 
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve arose as result of the scheme of arrangement and represents th e nominal amount of share capital that was 
issued to shareholders of NewRiver Retail Limited. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve consists of the fair valu e movement of interest rate derivatives th at are in an effective cash flow hedging 
relationship. 
Retained earnings 
Retained earnings consist of the accumulated net profit of the Group, less dividends paid from distributable reserves, and tran sfers 
from equity issues where those equity issues generated distributable reserves. Dividends are paid from the Company’s 
distributable reserves which were approximately £88 million at 31 March 2017. 
Shares held in Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
As part of the scheme of arrangement and group reorganisation, the Company established an EBT which is registered in Jersey. 
The EBT, at its discretion, may transfer shar es held by it to directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 
maximum number of ordinary shares that may be held by the EBT may not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. It is 
intended that the EBT will not hold more ordinary shares than are required in order to satisfy share options granted under 
employee share incentive plans. 
There are currently 4,613,717 ordinary shares held by the EBT:

Market risk 
Currency risk 
The Group is not subject to any foreign currency risk as nearly all transactions are in Pounds Sterling. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at floating interest rates (see note 19). The Group’s interest rat e risk 
is reviewed quarterly by the Board. The Group manages its exposure to interest rate ri sk on borrowings through the use of inter est 
rate derivatives (see note 16). Interest rate caps and interest rate swaps are used to both mitigate the risk of an increase in interest 
rates but also to allow the Group to benefit from a fall in inte rest rates. 51% of the Group’s interest rate exposure is fixed and the 
remainder is capped. The Group has employed an external adviser when contracting hedging to advise on the structure of the 
hedging. 
Sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of an increase in interest rates on finance costs to the Group. Management 
consider that a significant movement in interest rates would by 200 bps and have therefore carried out sensitivity analysis of the 
impact of such a movement. The impact of a 200 bps increase in interest rates for the year would increase the net interest paya ble 
in the income statement and reduce net assets by £6.2 million (M arch 2016: £0.6 million). The impact of a 200 bps decrease in 
interest rates for the year would reduce the net interest payable in the income statem ent and increase net assets by £7.7 milli on 
(March 2016: £0.7 million). The directors consider this to be a reasonable sensitivity given historic interest rates and the po ssibility 
for short term swings in rates.

Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are ca sh, trade receivables and other receivables. 
The Group manages its credit risk through policies to ensure that rental contracts are made with tenants meeting appropriate 
balance sheet covenants, supplemented by re ntal deposits or bank guarantees from international banks. The amounts presented 
in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables concerned. 
The Group’s monitors its counterparty exposures on cash and s hort-term deposits weekly. The Group monitors the counterparty 
credit rating of the institutions that hold its cash and deposits and spread the exposure across several banks. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 March 2017 was £49 million (31 March 2016: £119 million).  
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient ca sh balances and committed credit facilities. The Board reviews the 
credit facilities in place on a project-by -project basis. Management monitor the Grou p’s liquidity position weekly. Cash flow r eports

Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to provide 
returns to shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group is not subject to any 
external capital requirements. As detailed in note 9, the Group is a REIT and to qualify as a REIT the Group must distribute 90 % of 
its taxable income from its property business.  
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell asse ts to reduce debt. Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capita l on 
the basis of its gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowi ngs, less 
cash and cash equivalents.

146 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 
  NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
147 
A. Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The Company’s separate financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2017 are prepared in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 (FRS 101) “Reduced Disclosure Framework” as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The financial 
statements are presented in pounds Sterling. These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of cert ain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the Directo rs to 
exercise judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. Changes in assumptions may have a significant 
impact on the financial statements in the period the assumption s changed. The Directors believe that the underlying assumptions 
are appropriate. The most critical estimates, assumptions and judgements relate to the determination of carrying value of the 
investment in the Company’s subsidiary undertaking. The nature, facts and circumstance of the investment are taken into account 
on assessing whether there are any indications of impairment. 
Disclosure exemptions  
The Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions al lowed by FRS 101. These financial statements do not include: 
• certain disclosures regarding the Company’s capital; 
• a statement of cash flows; 
• certain disclosures in respect of financial instruments; 
• the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted; and 
• disclosure of related party transactions with wholly-owned members of the Group. 
The above disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclo sures are included in the consolidated Group 
accounts into which the Company is consolidated. 
Dividends 
Dividend information is provided in note 11 to the consolidated accounts. 
Investment in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Financial instruments  
Financial assets 
Financial assets consist of loans and receivables. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction co sts. The Group’s financial assets consist of 
cash, and loans and receivables. 
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the 
Company transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
The Company assesses at each financial position date whether th ere is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulty of the obligor, breach o f contract, or 
it becomes probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy), the asset is tested for impairment. The amount of the loss is measu red 
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future ca sh flows (that is the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognit ion). The carrying amount of th e asset is reduced through us e of an allowance account. The 
amount of the loss is recognised in profit and loss. 
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss de creased and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reve rsed to the extent that the 
carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised costs at the reversal date.  
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as other liabilities. A fi nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is 
discharged or cancelled or expires. 
All loans and borrowings are classified as other liabilities. Initial recognition is at fair value less directly attributable t ransaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effecti ve 
interest method. 
Financial liabilities included in trade and other payables are re cognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. 
The fair value of a non-interest bearing liability is its discounted repayment amount. If the due date of the liability is less than one 
year, discounting is omitted.

 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
A. Accounting policies continued 
Share-based payments 
The cost of equity settled transactions is measured with reference to the fair value at the date at which they were granted. Wh ere 
vesting performance conditions are non-market based, the fair valu e excludes the effect these vest ing conditions and an estimate 
is made at each balance sheet date of the number of instruments expected to vest. The fair value is recognised over the vesting 
period in the income statement of the company that employs the recipient of the share-based payment, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The Company increases the carrying value of the subsidiary by the value of the share-based payment.  
Share capital 
Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. 
Dividends 
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, this 
is when paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by equity holders at a general meeting. 
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve resulted from the acquisition of NewRiver Retail Limited and represents the difference between the value of 
the net assets acquired of £526 million and the nominal value of the shares issued of 239 million, less the impairment in NewRi ver 
Retail Limited following the payment of a di vidend to the Company of £111 million.
