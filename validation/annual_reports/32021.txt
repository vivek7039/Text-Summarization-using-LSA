Pubs portfolio 7 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 6 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
I am delighted to report a strong set of 
results for the 52 weeks ended 24 June 
2017, a year of significant investment in 
new pubs.
The performance has been good in all 
operating divisions in the Company and 
excellent progress has been made 
against our strategic objectives. 
I have been particularly impressed by the 
pace of change in the business in recent 
years as the team modernise the pubs 
and brands portfolio and innovate to 
address the continuous challenge to 
enhance the customer experience. 
Our growth primarily comes from 
reinvesting year after year in our core 
business and from driving ever greater 
efficiency and excellence in execution. 
This year has been notable for a strong 
underlying performance, some excellent 
work to enhance our own brand 
portfolio, important steps to modernise 
the brewing operation and a period of 
significant investment with the 
acquisition of 14 new pubs.
The core strengths of Shepherd Neame  
lie in a strong sense of family, a distinct 
individual character, and a passion for 
quality, for high standards and for  
making continuous improvements  
within a consistent strategic framework.  
These characteristics deliver a strong and 
sustainable business for the long-term 
benefit of shareholders. Equally important 
is our ability to take advantage of good 
opportunities when they arise and to be 
responsive to changes in the market. 
Financial results
Turnover for the period increased by 
+11.7% to £156.2m (2016: £139.9m) driven 
by the acquisitions and strong managed 
house like-for-like growth of +8.1%. 
Underlying operating profit grew by 
+7.2% to £15.3m (2016: £14.2m). 
Underlying profit before tax
1
 grew by 
+8.0% to £11.2m (2016: £10.3m) and 
underlying basic earnings per share are 
up +8.0% to 59.1p (2016: 54.7p). 
Statutory profit before tax is down 
-18.0% to £11.8m (2016: £14.4m), 
predominantly because we achieved  
an unusually high profit on disposal of 
property in the prior year. Basic earnings 
per ordinary share are down to 69.1p 
(2016: 84.0p).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 22.73p (2016: 22.05p) making the  
total dividend for the year 28.35p 
(2016: 27.50p), an increase of +3.1%.  
This represents underlying dividend 
cover of 2.1 times (2016: 2.0 times).  
We will continue to target our dividend 
cover at or above this level in the future. 
The final dividend will be paid on 
13 October 2017 to shareholders on  
the register at the close of business  
on 29 September 2017.
This level of dividend cover is consistent 
with the policy stated at the time of our 
share capital reorganisation in 2014. 
Since then the total annual dividend  
paid to shareholders has increased  
from £3.2m to £4.2m.
Capital and investment
Capital expenditure was £38.0m.  
Within this sum, £24.8m was invested  
in the acquisition of UES, eight pubs  
from Ei Group plc and five pubs in the 
acquisition of VGR in November 2016. 
We realised proceeds from property 
sales of £5.9m (2016: £11.9m). 
Net debt has consequently increased 
from £60.1m at June 2016 to £78.1m  
at June 2017. 
Board of Directors
Following the review of our strategy  
for brewing and brands as set out in  
the Chief Executive’s Report, and as  
part of the transition from brewing Asahi 
Super Dry, the role of Brewing and 
Brands Director is no longer required. 
Graeme Craig is consequently stepping 
down from his role as a Director in 
September 2017 and will be leaving  
the business. Graeme has made a 
considerable contribution to the business 
since joining in 2006. He has greatly 
developed and enhanced the brand 
portfolio, and consolidated the sales, 
marketing and production activities into 
a single brewing and brands division.  
I would like to thank him for what he has 
done and wish him well for the future. 
We are streamlining our management 
roles in this area. We have recently 
appointed Andy Pinnock as Head  
of Sales and Giles Hilton as Head of 
Customer Relations. We are currently 
recruiting a Head of Marketing, Brands 
1   Profit before any profit or loss on the disposal of properties, investment property fair value movements and exceptional items.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“   
A strong set of results  
and a year of significant 
investment.

and Communications and a Head of 
Production, as Richard Frost retires in 
2018. These senior positions will report  
to the Chief Executive.
Government and regulation
The Company makes a substantial 
contribution to the local and national 
economy. In 2017 we have paid £28.7m  
in excise duty alone. It is disappointing, 
therefore, after three years of successive 
excise cuts, that the Chancellor chose  
to increase duty on beer by 3p per pint  
in the last budget. 
This coincides with substantial increases 
in business rates and in the national living 
wage and with the introduction of the 
apprenticeship levy. These inflationary 
pressures come at a time of rising 
inflation in food and imported products, 
and provide cost challenges to all 
businesses in the sector at a time of  
great political uncertainty. 
In July 2016 the Small Business 
Enterprise and Employment Bill which 
introduced the Statutory Code of 
Practice and Market Rent Option (MRO) 
became law. This affects only those large 
companies which have more than 500 
pubs. We believe that effective operation 
of the voluntary code will make extension  
of the statutory code unlikely.
Advisors
Since the year end the Company 
appointed Peel Hunt LLP as its corporate 
broker in place of Panmure Gordon & Co 
with effect from 1 August 2017.
Summary
This has been an excellent year for the 
Company. The Board is focussed on 
investing for the long-term benefit of 
shareholders in line with our aims to be a 
Great British Brewer and to run the best 
pubs. The investment in our brands and 
pubs continues to transform the profile 
and quality of assets in the Company. 
The managed estate has now become our 
largest business division by turnover and 
has been our principal engine for growth. 
Our tenanted business is high quality and 
robust after many years of investing to 
drive up standards. It generates substantial 
and sustainable free cash flow and 
continues to attract exceptional operators.
In the brewing and brands business we 
have an extended period of transition 
ahead of us as the arrangements with 
Asahi come to an end. However, the 
underlying trends in this division are 
encouraging and our emerging, 
innovative and broad brand portfolio 
gives good reason for optimism. 
These three business divisions generate 
strong cash flow and all contribute to  
the growing reputation the Company  
has for offering a great experience to our 
customers. The new brand identity has 
strengthened our profile further. 
Whilst the performance has been good, 
the short-term horizon is clouded by the 
inflationary pressures on the business, 
and the medium-term horizon by the 
uncertainty over the UK's exit from the 
European Union. Shepherd Neame is, as 
has been demonstrated over the years, a 
resilient and flexible business capable of 
rapidly adjusting to and succeeding in an 
ever changing world.
We remain confident to continue to 
invest for the long-term benefit of 
shareholders.

OUR PUBS
TO DRIVE FOOTFALL TO 11 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 10 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
This has been an exciting year of 
development for the Company, with good 
progress in all areas of the business, a 
strong underlying performance and some 
great acquisitions that add real value to 
the Company.
We have successfully pursued our 
strategy to drive long-term value for  
our shareholders based around four  
key objectives:
• To drive footfall to our pubs
•  To develop our offer to enhance  
the customer experience
•  To create demand and build 
awareness for our brands
•  To attract, retain and develop  
the best people
It is this consistent strategy that has 
enabled the Company to outperform  
the national market year after year  
and to excel on a local basis. We have 
modernised and improved our business 
such that the profile and quality of our 
pubs and brands have been greatly 
enhanced and the offer and experience 
for our customer transformed. 
Furthermore, as our heartland of Kent 
enjoys the benefit of infrastructural 
development and the regeneration of the 
coastal areas, our strong local knowledge 
enables us to exploit the opportunities 
that arise.
Whilst the weather conditions have been 
favourable during this year with a long 
hot summer in 2016 and plenty of 
sunshine in the spring of 2017, market 
conditions have become progressively 
harder, as consumer spending is being 
squeezed by inflation. 
Nonetheless, we have achieved 
impressive like-for-like sales growth in  
our managed estate of +8.1% against the 
Coffer Peach Tracker Index* of +1.4% and 
own beer volume growth excluding 
contract of +3.9% against the market of 
-0.2% (Source: BBPA).
In pursuit of our objectives, this year has 
been characterised by some significant 
achievements:
•  Acquisition of 14 pubs
•  The launch of a new brand identity
•  Some exciting new product 
developments
•  Completion of the initial phase of our 
modernisation plan for the brewery 
and its buildings
We have successfully delivered these 
projects whilst maintaining strong 
underlying growth across the business.  
We have also developed our future 
brewing and brands strategy, namely to 
build our own brands, drive necessary cost 
reduction and streamline management 
roles where appropriate, as we exit the 
Asahi contract in the coming year.
We have an outstanding team of  
people, renowned for their passion  
and commitment, their expertise and  
in-depth knowledge of the business,  
their friendliness and approachability. 
These characteristics distinguish 
Shepherd Neame and give it its unique 
personality. It is this personality that is  
the differentiator to build customer 
loyalty, where quality and value for  
money are taken for granted.
All operators in the sector face significant 
cost inflation through increasing business 
rates, the national living wage and the 
apprenticeship levy. The fall in the value of 
sterling following the EU referendum has 
compounded these challenges and is 
driving up prices in food and other 
imported products such as wine. We will 
continue to focus on enhancing the 
customer experience, raising standards 
across our business, and driving 
efficiencies as appropriate to mitigate  
this cost and to take advantage of the 
opportunities that are presented. 
Tenanted and Managed Pub Operations
Overview
At the year-end we operated 327 pubs 
and hotels (2016: 328) of which 285 are 
freehold (2016: 285). Of our total pubs, 
66 (2016: 54) were managed and 253 
(2016: 267) were tenanted or leased  
and eight (2016: seven) operated under 
commercial free of tie leases. 
Our investment focus is to improve the 
quality of our core business and to seek 
high-quality, single-site acquisition 
opportunities within our heartland if they 
improve the overall business or reach 
new markets. We will pursue suitable 
opportunities outside our historic trading 
area, and are alive to opportunities to 
acquire small groups of pubs that meet 
our requirements, as evidenced by  
recent pub purchases. We are seeking  
to acquire sites with unique character  
in landmark or high-footfall locations, 
preferably with the potential for  
further development. 
During the last five years, we have 
acquired 22 pubs and disposed of 49.  
As a consequence of this, and investments 
in the core estate, the profile and quality 
of our pub estate have been transformed 
and, since 2012, the average EBITDAR per 
managed pub has increased by +30.5% 
and per tenanted pub by +25.4%.
This has been a year of record 
investments with total cash invested in 
new pub acquisitions of £24.8m (2016: 
£3.3m), in three separate transactions 
during the year.
First, at the start of the financial year,  
we announced an acquisition of eight 
freehold pubs in Kent, Surrey and Sussex 
from Ei Group plc. All these pubs continue 
to be operated by their existing licensees, 
except the Crown and Anchor, Shoreham 
by Sea which has transferred to the 
managed estate, and Earls, Maidstone 
which will transfer in the coming year.

Good progress in all areas of

11 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 10 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
Simultaneously, we acquired UES and 
transferred the five pubs operated under 
tenancy by UES to the managed estate.  
We invested £12.9m in these two 
transactions in the year. 
Third, at the end of November 2016, we 
acquired VGR for £11.9m. VGR operated 
five very successful freehold pub 
restaurants in and around Maidstone and 
Ashford in the Company’s Kent heartland. 
All the pub restaurants are operated 
under the managed pub division. 
Since the year end, we have opened a 
new outlet in Chatham Maritime called 
Pier Five.
We have realised £5.9m of proceeds 
(2016: £11.9m) from the disposal of  
15 pubs (2016: 13) and two unlicensed 
properties (2016: seven). We continue  
to manage our property actively, aiming 
to dispose of those pubs which no longer 
fit our long-term strategy and to invest to 
maximise the potential of those that do.
Driving Footfall to our Pubs
We aim to drive footfall by designing and 
developing unique pubs and hotels with 
a ‘wow’ factor. We believe continuous 
investment in our facilities will attract  
and retain customers. In particular we 
continue to develop our accommodation 
business and exploit the growth in the 
local visitor economy. 
In addition to the new pub acquisitions 
we have invested £8.3m (2016: £7.3m) of 
capital expeniture in improving the look 
and feel of our pubs and £2.4m (2016: 
£2.2m) in repairs and decorations.
In the managed estate, major 
developments during this year have 
included £1.0m investment at the Minnis 
Bay Bar and Brasserie, £0.9m at the 
Ostrich, Colnbrook where 11 bedrooms 
have been added and the Manor Farm 
Barn, Southfleet. All these investments 
have transformed the outlets and the 
results have been encouraging.
In the tenanted estate we carried out 
major developments at a number of  
sites including the East Kent, Whitstable,  
the Plough, Farnham, the Old House  
at Home, Dormansland and the 
Sportsman, Seasalter.
Following the launch of our new brand 
identity, we have invested an additional 
£0.4m in the development of a new  
pub signage scheme and website with 
enhanced functionality and improved 
user experience. In conjunction with this 
we have improved all the photography 
on our pub microsites to bring out the 
character and individuality of each 
outlet. We intend to roll out the new 
signage scheme over the coming years. 
By the end of the summer, 45 schemes 
were completed. 
Developing our offer to enhance the 
customer experience
We aim to enhance the customer 
experience in our pubs by delivering 
great fresh food, providing 
accommodation of character and 
offering an interesting range of products. 
Our food continues to provide good 
growth in the business, in spite of intense 
competition in casual dining. Food sales 
now represent 33% (2016: 30%) of  
our managed turnover, with drinks 
representing 56% (2016: 58%) and 
accommodation 10% (2016: 11%).
We continue to build the food skills in  
our business and drive the quality of our 
offer. The acquisitions of both UES and 
VGR have brought fresh ideas and we 
have also enjoyed great success with 
new food offers at the Minnis Bay Bar 
and Brasserie and the Ship and Trades, 
Chatham Maritime. 
During the year we have refurbished  
37 rooms (2016: 35) and added 11 rooms 
at the Ostrich (2016: 4 rooms at the  
Ship & Trades) and now offer a total  
of 294 (2016: 283), all presented to a  
high standard.
Occupancy grew again from its record 
high last year to 79% (2016: 78%) whilst 
RevPAR continued to grow to £66  
(2016: £63). 
As the consumer becomes more willing 
to experiment across the drinks range  
we are always looking to innovate or 
introduce new concepts. We are 
constantly looking to introduce more 
premium products to strengthen our 
range and enhance the experience for 
our customers. 
Our beer offer has been greatly 
developed in the last two years.  
We are particularly excited about our 
emerging beer portfolio as we exploit  
the potential from our heritage brands 
and recent innovations. We have further 
expanded our range of premium local 
products, in particular gin, juices and 
English sparkling wine, and developed 
our range of mixers and fresh fruit 
cocktails. During the year our like-for-like 
drinks sales were +8.0% (2016: +3.1%).
Attracting, retaining and developing  
the best people
We aim to attract, retain and develop  
the best people by understanding the 
potential in everyone, inspiring them  
to achieve their goals and by building  
the loyalty and engagement of our 
licensees and employees through the 
professionalism of the support we provide.
I am particularly pleased with the 
progress we have made in recent years 
with our tenanted licensees. We again 
scored highly against a range of 
measures in an independent survey of  13 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 12 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
pubs and companies, and, for the second 
year running, were finalists in the 
Publican Awards Best Tenanted and 
Leased Pub Company (201 + sites) and 
Best Managed Pub Company (51+ sites).
We have made great strides to develop 
our training and are rated by the BII as  
one of the top licensed trade training 
providers. All staff in the managed estate 
have personal development programmes; 
500 offline courses and 1,700 online 
courses have been delivered against 
these in the year. 
Our Love Beer programme to educate 
and inform all staff on beer and brewing 
has proved very successful and has 
driven an increased awareness and 
passion for beer across our business.
We continue to enhance the skills at head 
office in support of our licensees. In the 
last year we have expanded our food 
development and field training teams 
and reduced the number of pubs per 
district manager in the managed and 
tenanted estates to bring even more 
focus to their work.
The Shepherd Neame Pub Awards 
continue to recognise excellence and 
achievement. This year T ony and Shirley 
Pearson of The Belle Vue T avern, Pegwell 
Bay won the Pub of the Year. It is 
particularly pleasing that we now have 
three pubs listed in the T op 50 Gastropubs 
in the country. It is also encouraging that 
we seem able to attract and support 
innovative licensees with diverse offers. 
Tenanted and Managed Pub 
Performance
We have pursued a consistent strategy 
to invest in our pubs over a sustained 
period and this has resulted in a strong 
trading performance year after year.
Total divisional turnover in the managed 
estate grew by +26.2% (2016: +9.8%) 
including the impact of new acquisitions. 
Divisional underlying operating profit 
grew by +18.0% to £9.0m (2016 restated: 
£7.6m). Same outlet like-for-like sales 
grew by +8.1% (2016: +4.4%) with drinks 
+8.0% (2016: +3.1%), food +7.7% (2016: 
+4.2%) and accommodation +10.1% (2016: 
+11.7%). Average EBITDAR per managed 
pub grew by +1.8% (2016: +1.0%).
Margins were impacted in the managed 
estate by the cost pressures affecting all 
operators in the sector. The total inflation 
from business rates, national living wage 
and the apprenticeship levy was £0.2m in 
the year. Looking forward, these 
pressures will continue and this area of 
the business will require like-for-like 
growth of around +3-4% to cover these 
additional costs.
T otal divisional turnover in the tenanted 
and leased estate grew by +2.8% to 
£34.4m (2016: £33.5m) on 14 fewer 
outlets. Divisional underlying operating 
profit was £13.0m (2016 restated: £12.7m).  
Like-for-like EBITDAR per tenanted  
pub grew by +1.6% (2016: +2.7%).  
Average EBITDAR per tenanted  
pub grew by +5.6% (2016: +6.4%).
Brewing and Brands
The brewing and brands division has 
enjoyed a successful year, some exciting 
brand launches and the redevelopment 
of our brewhouse.
The strength of the Shepherd Neame 
offer is a wide portfolio of high-quality 
products that suits many different 
customer needs in an increasingly 
fragmented market. We have continued 
to outperform and have achieved 
impressive volume growth of +3.9% 
against a market of modest decline of 
-0.2% (Source: BBPA). The Whitstable 
Bay Collection has again performed well 
with growth of +20.5% (2016: +19.5%) 
and now represents 10% of our own beer 
excluding contract. The Spitfire range 
has returned to growth of +2.2%  
(2016: -3.7%) and represents 22%  
of own beer excluding contract. 
We have invested £0.7m in restoring the 
fabric and infrastructure of our historic 
site and completing the installation of the 
new mash tuns. In the coming year we are 
planning to instal a new labeller on our 
bottling line together with associated  
line improvements. 
As previously announced our licence to 
brew and sell Asahi Super Dry will 
terminate at the end of February 2018.  
The brand represented 23% of our  
total brewed volume at the year end. In 
anticipation of the end of this contract, 
we have carried out a strategic review of 
our beer business and operation on this 
site so as to mitigate much of its impact. 
Whilst we have investigated other licence 
partnerships, we no longer feel that this 
type of world lager fits our portfolio. 
Furthermore, we see considerable 
opportunity from our emerging  
portfolio as the consumer seeks 
premium British products. 
We anticipate that brewing volumes will 
reduce in the short-term. We believe it is 
the best strategy in the long term to 
allocate more of our limited capacity to 
build our own brands and focus on those 
parts of the market where we have a 
competitive advantage or a strong 
position. We have determined to 
modernise our plant, to drive cost 
efficiency, higher productivity and quality 
enhancements. We expect turnover in this 
division to fall in line with volume in the 
near term. We are taking appropriate 
action to streamline our management 
structure, reduce our overheads and 
operating costs accordingly. As a result of 
these changes a one-off exceptional cost 
is expected in 2018. Going forward we are 
targeting ongoing divisional underlying 
EBITDA of around £3.5m.
The consequence of these actions, 
following a period of transition, will be  
a smaller, higher quality brewing and 
brands business, producing great beers   |StrategicReport |  Governance |  Financial Statements |  Other Information
15 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 14 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
on an upgraded infrastructure, and 
creating strong brands that positions the 
business well for future opportunities. 
Creating demand and building 
awareness for our brands
We aim to create demand and build 
awareness for our brands by developing 
a range of distinctive beers, by instilling a 
passion for quality, and by having a great 
engagement with our customers. 
The brewhouse investment and renovation 
works have driven greater efficiency and 
ever higher standards of quality in our beers.
The marketing team have had a busy  
year as they have developed a very 
compelling and exciting new portfolio 
including the introduction of Cinque, Five 
Grain Premium Lager, and Orchard View,  
a cider made in collaboration with Aspall.
The new brand identity has been well 
received by consumers and we received 
an award for it at the prestigious Mobius 
Awards. Our products receive many 
plaudits and we won three gold medals 
at the British Bottlers Institute Awards, 
and one gold at the International 
Brewing Awards. 
The Whitstable Bay Collection continues 
to enjoy great success with increasing 
distribution and brand awareness. 
Whitstable Bay Red IPA was added to the 
range this year. Spitfire Gold and Spitfire 
Lager, The Lager of Britain, were new 
extensions to the Spitfire brand last year 
and have performed above expectations. 
We have continued to support a variety 
of local and customer events such as the 
Battle of Medway 350th Anniversary 
commemoration through sponsorship 
and marketing activity. 
To raise awareness of our new brands we 
opened a pop-up shop at Bluewater for 
the first time with considerable success. 
The store was named Store of the Week 
by Retail Week. 
Brewing and Brands Performance
Divisional turnover for the year was  
+4.4% at £59.8m (2016: £57.3m).  
Own beer volume excluding contract was 
216,000 barrels (2016: 208,000 barrels) 
and grew by +3.9% (2016: +0.3%). 
Divisional underlying operating profit  
was £1.6m (2016 restated: £1.6m), after 
having absorbed incremental costs of 
water recovery of £0.3m which we are 
working to mitigate now that the 
operation is maturing.
Investment Property
The Company owns £6.8m of investment 
property, revalued at June 2017. The 
principal land holding is the residual land 
at Queen Court, Ospringe. In 2016, 10 
acres of this holding were disposed of 
with planning permission for residential 
development. During 2017, the Company 
promoted two further sites in the local 
plan that we consider suitable for housing. 
These are complex and expensive sites to 
develop and both have been rejected at 
this stage, but we will revisit in due course 
should circumstances change. The rest  
of the land holdings will be held as 
agricultural farm land for the long term. 
The Company reviews all of its property 
holdings on a regular basis.
Current Trading
Since the start of the new financial year 
we have made steady progress, albeit 
with colder and unsettled weather 
compared to 2016. In the 10 weeks  
to 2 September 2017, same outlet 
like-for-like managed sales were up  
+1.5% (2016:+8.2%) and total own beer 
volume excluding contract was up +4.4%  
(2016: +1.2%). In the 9 weeks to 26 August 
like-for-like EDITBAR in the tenanted 
estate was up +0.6% (2016: +2.2%). 
Summary
This has been a good year for the 
Company. The underlying performance 
has been strong; there has been a high 
level of pub acquisition and brand 
activity; the quality of our operations 
continues to improve. 
The profile of our pub assets and brands  
is stronger than ever. Our investments  
in recent years have helped to build a 
high-quality and sustainable platform 
for the future. But the focus in the 
coming year is to continue the rate of 
investment in our core business, to 
consolidate the recent acquisitions and 
effect a smooth transition in the brewing 
and brands business.
We have good reason to be pleased with 
the strategic and financial performance 
this year.  Our investments in recent  
years have helped to build a high-quality 
and sustainable platform for the future. 
But the next twelve months present new 
challenges given the unprecedented  
cost headwinds that the sector is facing 
and signs that consumer income is  
being squeezed.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
This year’s results reflect the continued 
growth of our managed pub estate 
which has seen new pubs acquired 
combined with like-for-like growth ahead 
of the market. The tenanted and leased 
operation has again delivered robust 
turnover and profitability with solid 
like-for-like growth offset by disposals  
of pubs that no longer fit our long-term 
strategy. The brewing and brands 
division has delivered a level of volume 
growth ahead of the market underpinned 
by a strong and diverse brand portfolio. 
The Group remains a cash generative 
business which combined with the 
strength of its balance sheet has enabled 
a record level of capital investment as we 
aim to build a stronger business for the 
long term benefit of shareholders.
Results  Turnover for the 52 weeks ended 
24 June 2017 increased by +11.7% (2016: 
+1.2%) to £156.2m (2016: £139.9m) and 
underlying operating profit was up +7.2% 
(2016: +3.5%) at £15.3m (2016: £14.2m). 
The managed pub estate continues to be 
our fastest growing division following the 
continued investment in this area. As a 
result, our managed pubs turnover grew 
by +26.2% on the prior year with like-for-
like turnover growth of +8.1%. Underlying 
operating profit in this division increased 
by +18.0% to £9.0m (2016 restated: 
£7.6m). The new sites and like-for-like 
growth underpinned the profit growth  
in this area but the operating margin  
fell by -1.1% following a conscious  
growth in the mix of food sales following 
the acquisitions in the year (-0.3%),  
increased head office support costs  
as we build our capability in this division 
for the future (-0.4%) and increased  
cost inflation offset by mitigating  
savings (-0.4%). 
These inflationary impacts have been 
offset by cost efficiencies and purchase 
improvements of +0.4%. 
The tenanted and leased division remains 
our largest division in terms of overall 
profitability. Turnover was up +2.8% with 
good growth in trading sites offset by the 
disposal of 15 pubs. Underlying operating 
profit in this area was £13.0m (2016 
restated: £12.7m) up +2.4% benefiting 
from the increased turnover, offset by  
an increase in property repairs and 
depreciation. 
Within the brewing and brands division  
turnover was up +4.4% on the back of 
increased volume growth with particular 
growth in the Whitstable Bay range. 
Underlying operating profit was £1.6m 
(2016 restated: £1.6m) on the back of  
the increased turnover, offset by higher 
water recovery costs.
Unallocated costs have increased by 
£0.6m including an additional £0.4m 
invested in the new brand identity.  
As a result of the inflation in the  
managed pubs segment and the 
strategic investment in the new brand 
identity total operating margin fell  
-0.4% from 10.2% to 9.8%.
The results and business operations  
are discussed in more detail in the 
Chairman’s statement and Chief 
Executive’s review.
Items excluded from underlying results 
Total items excluded from underlying 
results were a credit of £0.6m 
(2016: credit of £4.0m). This year’s  
items comprised four elements: 
•  The annual impairment review 
resulted in an impairment charge of 
£0.2m relating to two properties 
(2016: £0.3m charge in relation to  
six properties). 
   MARK RIDER 
   Finance and IT Director  |StrategicReport |  Governance |  Financial Statements |  Other Information
19 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 18 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
•  Property profits of £0.6m (2016: £4.2m) 
on the sale of 15 pubs and two 
unlicensed properties (2016: 13 pubs, 
the land at Queen Court outside 
Faversham and six unlicensed 
properties) were recognised as the 
business continues to dispose of 
predominantly small community wet 
led pubs and unlicensed assets that no 
longer fit with the Group’s long-term 
strategy. The prior year property profits 
further benefited from the one-off 
disposal of land at Queen Court,  
outside Faversham. 
•  The annual revaluation to fair value of 
investment properties on the balance 
sheet resulted in an increase in value 
of £0.5m (2016: £0.3m). The total 
value of this asset category sits at 
£6.8m (2016: £6.2m).
•  Exceptional costs of £0.3m were 
incurred in the year in relation to a 
food safety and hygiene regulation 
fine and associated legal costs at  
the Royal Wells Hotel, Tunbridge 
Wells. In the previous financial year 
exceptional costs of £0.2m were 
incurred for legal and professional 
fees relating to the Company’s 
accounting transition to FRS 102 and 
regulatory transition to the Financial 
Conduct Authority regime.
Finance costs Net finance costs 
increased to £4.1m (2016: £3.9m) 
following the acquisition of the new pubs 
in the year and the purchase of VGR in 
November 2016. A further increase in 
finance costs is expected in 2018 as the 
first half of the year is impacted by the 
VGR purchase.
Underlying interest cover was 3.7 times 
(2016: 3.7 times).
Taxation The total tax charge was £1.6m 
(2016: £1.9m), an effective rate of 13.3% 
(2016: 13.5%) following reduction in 
deferred tax balances. The average 
statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK 
for the period was 19.75% (2016: 20.00%). 
The underlying tax rate was 21.8% (2016: 
21.8%). The net tax charge on items 
excluded from underlying results was a 
credit of £0.9m (2016: credit of £0.3m).
The Group expects the underlying tax 
rate to continue to be around 2% higher 
than the average statutory rate in place.
Earnings per share  Underlying basic 
earnings per ordinary share increased by 
+8.0% to 59.1p (2016: 54.7p) following the 
increase in underlying operating profits 
and a lower overall tax rate.
Basic earnings per ordinary share 
decreased to 69.1p (2016: 84.0p)  
due to lower property profits. 
Dividends  Dividend per share paid and 
proposed in respect of the year increased 
by +3.1% to 28.35p per ordinary share 
(2016: 27.50p per ordinary share) to give 
total dividends of £4.2m (2016: £4.1m). 
As expected, total dividend cover has 
fallen to 2.4 times (2016: 3.1 times) due  
to the lower property profits in the year.
Underlying dividend cover increased to 
2.1 times (2016: 2.0 times).
Cash Flow
The increase in underlying operating 
profits meant underlying EBITDA 
increased by +7.7% to £23.4m 
(2016: £21.7m). Working capital was 
again tightly managed with a cash inflow 
from working capital movements of 
£1.4m (2016: £1.1m). Tax cash payments 
increased to £2.7m following higher 
profits. As a result of these three factors 
the net cash inflow from operating 
activities increased by £1.8m to £22.1m 
(2016: £20.3m).

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
The total cash cost of interest and 
dividends increased by £0.2m to £8.1m 
(2016: £7.9m). Interest payments have 
risen as a result of the increase in net 
debt following the acquisition activity in 
the year. Dividend payments reflect the 
increase in payment of the final 2016  
and interim 2017 dividends. 
In order to service the Company’s future 
obligations under employee incentive 
plans 124,514 shares were purchased 
(2016: 49,000) at an average market 
price of £13.22 (2016: £11.92). Within the 
year £0.3m of this consideration was 
settled (2016: £0.3m) with the remaining 
£1.3m falling into the 2018 financial year. 
Total disposal proceeds of £5.9m 
(2016: £11.9m) were realised from the sale 
of 15 pubs and two unlicensed properties 
(2016: 13 pubs, the land at Queen Court, 
outside Faversham and six unlicensed 
properties).
Taking these items together internally 
generated free cash flow was lower at 
£19.0m (2016: £23.7m) due to the lower 
disposal proceeds. This cash flow has 
been used for two purposes aligned to 
our long-term strategy:
•  Cash spend on core capital 
expenditure was £13.2m, up from 
£10.7m in 2016 as we continue to 
invest to strengthen the pub and 
brewery asset base. This was driven by 
the developments at the Minnis Bay, 
Birchington, and the Ostrich, 
Colnbrook, an increase in tenanted 
developments and brewery 
infrastructure projects. 
•  A further £24.8m (2016: £4.7m)  
of acquisition capital expenditure  
was invested in three separate 
transactions. Firstly at the start of the 
financial year both the purchase of 
eight freehold pubs from Ei Group plc 
and the purchase of UES took place at 
a combined cash cost of £12.9m. Later 
in the year an additional £11.9m was 
invested in the purchase of VGR.
Financing and loan facilities 
As previously announced, and to support 
the acquisition activity in the year the 
revolving credit facility maturing in  
2020 was extended to £45m in 
November 2016. This facility provides  
the flexibility to support our growth plans 
with margins above floating rate of 
between 130 and 260 basis points 
depending on the Group’s leverage  
ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
The 20-year term loan maturing in 2026 
remains unchanged meaning total 
committed facilities of £105m are in place 
together with a £2m overdraft facility 
which is renewable in June 2018. 
The floating element of interest on the 
20-year term loan was fixed by swap 
contracts to give an effective rate of 
interest of 5.78%. These swap contracts 
are revalued annually to fair value taking 
into account current prevailing long-term 
interest rates. The value of these 
derivatives at 24 June 2017 was a liability 
of £21.9m (2016: 23.7m). The policy for 
managing treasury and financial risk is  
as set out in note 23.
Balance sheet
There was a £26.4m increase in fixed 
assets (2016: increase of £0.6m) but a 
rise in net debt of £18.0m to £78.1m 
(2016: £60.1m). Balance sheet gearing at 
the year end was 41% (2016: 33%) and the 
ratio of net debt to EBITDA at the year 
end was 3.3 times (2016: 2.8 times). 
Shareholders funds at 24 June 2017  
were £191.1m (2016: £183.9m) meaning 
net assets per share showed an increase 
of +3.9% to £12.86 (2016: £12.38). 
2018 Financial Year
The 2018 financial year will be a 53 week 
period to 30 June 2018 and hence will 
benefit from an additional trading week.   |StrategicReport |  Governance |  Financial Statements |  Other Information

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Principal Risks Mitigation and Monitoring
 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
 Strength of the economy and the United Kingdom’s exit from the 
European Union
The success of the Company’s operations is partly reliant upon the strength 
of the UK and regional economy. Performance could be adversely affected 
by reduced consumer spending as a result of a weakening in the economy, 
rising unemployment or increases in personal taxation.
The business may be exposed to the consequences of exiting the EU, in 
particular the regulatory framework we operate in and our ability to recruit 
and retain key staff.
We monitor changes in the economy and respond by reviewing the 
investment levels in our brands and pubs, by developing our portfolio  
and through active property management, in order to continue 
encouraging a variety of customers to our products and pubs.
 REGULATORY
Regulation and taxation of the sale of alcohol 
The drinks industry is tightly regulated and heavily taxed through excise duty. 
There is a risk that future increases, or other changes in taxation, or alcohol 
regulations, could affect the market, and our profitability.
Legislative developments are monitored and we aim to grow income 
streams derived from food, accommodation and non-alcoholic beverages, 
as well as alcohol. We are committed to acting responsibly and promote 
safe drinking. The Company has membership of the BBPA and Directors are 
members of key industry bodies where regulatory matters are discussed 
and influenced.
Health and safety
Any non-compliance with health and safety legislation, including fire  
safety and food legislation could have serious consequences for our 
employees, tenants and customers.
Health and safety procedures and policies are in place. We provide regular 
training, risk assessments are performed, and all incidents are investigated.
Increased Legislation and regulation
The Company is exposed to increasing levels of regulation and legislation 
across all areas of its operations. Failure to comply with these regulations 
could lead to financial and reputational impacts.
Full procedures and policies are in place to reflect current legislation and 
regulation and external legal advice is used to ensure changes to and new 
legislation are monitored.
External training and consulting services are engaged where appropriate 
to develop training and communication materials for staff and licensees.
 OPERATIONAL
Brands and reputation
The Company has a range of strong brands and an excellent reputation 
in the market. There is a risk that unexpected events or incidents could 
damage the reputation of our brands.
Adherence to high-quality standards throughout the business, regular 
management review, staff training and internal controls reduce the 
operational risk of brand damage. Our communications team monitors all 
external reviews, manages our reputation and liaises with the media.
Licensed brewing contracts
The Company is engaged in various contracts to brew, sell and market  
brands under licence from third-party brewers. Such contracts carry  
different obligations and responsibilities on both parties.  
The agreements are all long-term but subject to renewal from time to time.
There is regular inspection of quality and service levels by brewing 
partners, with the aim of providing reassurance and satisfaction for all 
parties, helping good relations to continue.
We hold regular reviews of brand performance with our partners.
The Company has specific plans in place to mitigate the exit from the  
Asahi licence contract centred around new brand development and  
cost reduction.
Site dependency
The Company’s operations are managed from its sole brewery site in 
Faversham. A disaster at this site may seriously disrupt operations and 
the profitability of the Company.
We have developed a disaster recovery plan to mitigate disruption 
in such circumstances. We have a maintenance programme and 
undertake regular site inspections. Our finished product is decentralised 
and held in a number of warehouse locations through Kuehne and 
Nagel Drinks Logistics.
Water recovery
The Company operates a water recovery plant to clean waste water from 
the brewery site. If this plant were to experience a sustained failure it could 
lead to periods of ceased production. There is also the risk of breach of our 
consent with statutory bodies.
The Company has undertaken business continuity planning with 
alternative procedures for the disposal of waste, albeit at higher cost, to 
mitigate this risk. We regularly review procedures to ensure the highest 
standards of compliance.
Supply chain failure and reliance on suppliers
Prolonged disruption to our supply chain could affect the quality and 
availability of our product.
We rely on a number of key suppliers to service both the brewery site  
and our managed pubs.
We work with established and reliable suppliers wherever possible and 
maintain good relationships with them to assist with monitoring their 
stability and performance. In addition we maintain plans for alternative 
supply where suppliers may come into distress.
Information technology failure
The Company places significant reliance on information systems.  
A prolonged failure of these systems would affect all aspects of  
our business.
The IT function has back-up systems, virus protection, a cyber protection 
strategy, a business continuity plan, external support agreements for 
hardware and software and a disaster recovery plan, which aims to ensure 
that in the event of any problem normal trading would be restored quickly.
Recruitment, retention and development of employees and licensees
The Company’s strategy is dependent on employing high quality staff 
across the business combined with the recruitment and retention of skilful 
licensees for our tenanted pubs.
Failure to recruit or retain key staff could have a detrimental impact on the 
Company’s brand and reputation.
We have a number of internal training and development programmes in 
place for employees across the organisation.
The remuneration policies and packages available to all staff are externally 
benchmarked regularly to ensure the Company remains competitive.
Within the tenanted estate we work actively on, and have built a reputation 
for, flexibility and support to enable licensees to manage successful 
businesses.

Celebrating crafts
We continue to employ 
traditional crafts to  
work on our pubs and 
brewery, including 
Master Shipwright  
Simon Grillet, who  
reclad our new mash 
tuns in teak from the 
original wooden tuns. 
Engaging consumers 
Our pop-up shop in 
Bluewater proved such a 
success its run was extended. 
Customers were given the 
opportunity to try our new 
products, buy merchandise 
and step into a hop garden 
via our 360HOPS virtual 
reality experience. 
Pub signage
Bold new signage is being 
rolled out across the estate 
in a variety of guises 
including oil paintings, 
striking graphics, bold 
typography, 3D modelling 
and iron work.
Shepherd Neame has supported 
the community it serves for many 
years. Our brewery and pubs are 
at the heart of their communities, 
raising large sums each year for 
local and national charities.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company is a private company  
and its shares are quoted on the  
NEX Exchange Growth Market, which 
enjoys certain personal tax advantages 
for our shareholders compared to a  
full stock market listing.
As a NEX company, Shepherd Neame 
Limited is not required to comply with all 
aspects of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. However, the Board is committed 
to maintaining the highest standards 
within the Group.
The Board
The Board currently comprises the 
Non-Executive Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, three Non-Executive and four 
Executive Directors. One Non-Executive 
Director retired from the Board in 
September 2016. The biographical details 
on pages 26 and 27 show the broad 
range of experience and skills the 
Directors bring to the Board.
Each Director is subject to re-election  
at the third Annual General Meeting  
after the meeting at which he or she  
was previously elected or re-elected. 
Non-Executive Directors serving a  
period beyond nine years are subject to 
annual re-election. All newly appointed 
Directors stand for election at the  
Annual General Meeting following  
their appointment.
The Board governs through its Executive 
and other committees. Each Board 
Committee has specific terms of 
reference and there is a list of Matters 
Reserved for the Board, which 
distinguishes which types of decision  
are taken by the Board or delegated to 
management. The terms of reference for 
each Committee are available on the 
Company’s website. The chairmen of 
each Committee report to the Board on 
proceedings of Committee meetings.
The Board meets regularly throughout 
the year. Its responsibilities include 
approving the Group’s strategy, annual 
budget, and the annual and half year 
results. The Board authorises major 
investments, acquisitions and capital 
expenditure, and monitors the 
performance of the business.
Attendance at scheduled meetings held 
during the year is set out on the right:
Committees of the Board
Executive
The Executive Committee of the Board 
comprises the Executive Directors  
and is chaired by the Chief Executive.  
It meets monthly to review operating 
performance and has delegated 
authority from the Board to deal with 
operational matters such as the  
approval of minor capital projects and 
refurbishments, the agreement and 
approval of minor contracts with third 
parties and employee appointments.
Nomination
The Nomination Committee is chaired  
by Miles Templeman and comprises the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
met twice during the year. Attendance is 
shown in the table below. The Committee 
is responsible for identifying and 
proposing prospective candidates  
for Directors for consideration and 
appointment by the Board as a whole.  
It reviews the size, structure and 
composition of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any adjustments deemed 
necessary.
The Committee is responsible for 
considering the Group’s succession plans 
for Board members, and determining 
what skills, knowledge and experience 
will be necessary. Other matters 
considered during the year included  
the re-election of directors.
Before any appointment is made, the 
Committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board, 
and, in the light of this evaluation prepares 
a description of the role and capabilities 
required for a particular appointment.  
In identifying suitable candidates the 
Committee shall:
•  Consider candidates from a wide 
range of backgrounds
•  Consider candidates on merit and 
against objective criteria, taking care 
that appointees have enough time 
available to devote to the position
•  Consider the use of external advisers 
or advertising to facilitate the search, 
if applicable; and
•  Consider the requirements set out in 
the Company’s Memorandum and 
Articles of Association.
Prior to the appointment of any Director 
the committee obtains from the 
proposed appointee details regarding 
any other business interests which may 
result in a conflict of interest and to 
ensure that consideration is given to 
whether these need to be approved by 
the Board prior to appointment.
Disclosure
The disclosure committee comprises the 
Chairman; the Chief Executive and the 
Finance and IT Director. The committee 
meets by exception to consider legal  
and regulatory requirements and  
makes recommendations to the  
Board accordingly.
Audit
The Audit Committee was chaired  
by James Leigh-Pemberton until 
September 2016 and by Richard Oldfield 
since this date. It comprises the Non-
Executive Directors. The Executive 
Directors and external auditor attend its

meetings by invitation. The Committee 
has defined terms of reference, reviews 
the audit appointment periodically, 
discusses the audit plan with the auditor 
and agrees the scope of work, and also 
recommends approval of the financial 
statements to the Board. It is responsible 
for reviewing internal financial controls 
and risk management systems.  
The Committee had two meetings  
during the year. On both occasions  
the Chief Executive and Finance and  
IT Director attended.
The Audit Committee receives reports 
from the Finance and IT Director and 
external auditor on the key accounting 
issues and areas of significant 
judgement. The key matters for this 
financial year were the acquisitions of 
UES and VGR and the results of the 
annual impairment exercise. The 
Chairman of the Committee is in regular 
contact with the audit partner to discuss 
matters relevant to the Group. The 
financial statements and interim results 
were reviewed in detail prior to their 
submission to the Board.
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s 
auditor since 2009. Their performance  
is reviewed by the Committee which 
considers their effectiveness and 
independence, and partner rotation, 
which occurred at the start of 2017.
The auditor provides taxation advisory 
services in addition to audit services and 
from time to time may provide non-audit 
services to the Group. In relation to 2017 
Deloitte provided audit services in 
respect of the Group accounts and 
pension scheme of £128,000 and tax 
services of £38,000.
It is the policy of the Board to seek 
proposals and quotations from a 
number of suppliers when undertaking 
significant non-audit work to ensure 
that the Group benefits from the best 
combination of quality of work and 
value for money.
Remuneration
The activities of the Remuneration 
Committee are explained fully in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 34.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges its ultimate 
responsibility for the system of internal 
control within the Group and for its 
effectiveness. The system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, 
and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Board has 
carried out an assessment of the key 
operational and financial risks for the 
Group, the control exercised at Board 
level, the controls relied upon by the 
Board and the exceptions for 
consideration by the Board. This review  
is updated on a regular basis.
The responsibility for the implementation 
and day-to-day operation of the systems 
of internal control within the business is 
delegated to the Chief Executive and 
Executive Directors and through them to 
members of management and staff. Key 
features of the system of internal control 
include a detailed review of performance 
against budgets and forecasts which are 
subject to scrutiny and approval, reports 
to the Board from each operating area, a 
requirement for authorisation of capital 
expenditure following formal investment 
appraisals and a close involvement of the 
Executive Directors in the operation of 
the business.
The Group does not have an internal 
audit function and the Board does not 
consider that one is required for a 
business of Shepherd Neame’s size. 
Ongoing quality visits and counts by 
independent stocktakers provide 
assurance over activities in the managed 
pub estate. Within the brewery, the 
quality control procedures, ISO 9001 
certification and internal reviews by 
management provide similar assurance.
Investor relations
The Board believes in an open and 
regular dialogue with its shareholders. 
Information is provided to shareholders 
in the interim and annual financial 
statements. The Chairman, Chief 
Executive and Finance and IT Director 
make an annual presentation of the 
Group’s results to professional investors 
and analysts. This presentation is 
simultaneously posted on the Company’s 
website. The Board offers to hold 
individual briefings with its major 
shareholders and twice a year meets with 
the Family Council, which was established 
in 2014 to improve communications with 
major family shareholders, to make 
presentations on the Company’s 
performance. The Chairman and Chief 
Executive discuss governance and 
strategy with major shareholders and the 
Board receives updates on these meetings 
which helps develop the Non-Executive 
Directors’ understanding of the views of 
major shareholders. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive update them on the 
Group’s performance and progress.
Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited and 
JP Morgan Cazenove provided broking 
and advisory services during the year 
and the former was replaced by Peel 
Hunt LLP on 1 August 2017.
The Company’s shares are traded on  
the CREST trading platform.
All formal Group announcements are 
posted on the Company's website and  
on the NEX Exchange Growth Market 
website (www.nexexchange.com).
Employees and pensioners
The health and wellbeing of our 
employees are paramount. We strive  
to improve their safety at work by 
undertaking regular risk assessments  
and training. We believe in open and 
transparent communication with our 
employees and hold regular briefings on 
relevant matters such as the performance 
of the business, forthcoming events, 
initiatives and targets.
We encourage employees to participate 
in activities beyond their daily jobs and 
to contribute to the Group’s community 
involvement. We are supportive of their 
participation in local government, and in 
other voluntary services and we support 
various sporting and social activities for 
employees. We place an emphasis on 
longevity of service and loyalty and 
reward it.
We believe strongly in supporting our 
former employees. In addition to funding 
a pension, the Company maintains an 
active social programme for pensioners, 
which enables them to maintain contact 
with former colleagues.  31 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 30 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT
Overview
The Board has voluntarily included a 
remuneration report. The information 
discussed in this report is not as 
extensive as that required for a fully  
listed entity to disclose.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired 
by Bill Brett. It comprises the Non-
Executive Directors. The Chief Executive 
attends the meetings by invitation.  
The work of the Committee is set out in 
its terms of reference which are available  
on the Company’s website. It meets 
regularly and determines on behalf of  
the Board the remuneration package  
of the Executive Directors.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is decided by the Board as a 
whole. The Remuneration Committee is 
also responsible for approving the bonus 
targets and payments for the Company’s 
Executive Directors and Senior 
Managers.
In coming to these decisions the 
Remuneration Committee considers the 
overall performance of the Group and  
of the individual Directors and Senior 
Managers and the performance of  
our national and regional competitors  
when appropriate. External consultants 
are used periodically to help with  
these decisions. In the last year the 
Remuneration Committee have engaged 
the services of Aon Hewitt Limited to 
conduct a review which is ongoing.
The Group aims to ensure that 
remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors are competitive and 
comparable with companies of a similar 
size, complexity and activity and are 
designed to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors with appropriate 
skills and capabilities.
Director remuneration composition
Executive
Remuneration for Executive Directors 
comprises fixed remuneration (salary, car 
allowance and other taxable benefits), 
pension contributions and performance- 
related remuneration designed to 
motivate maximum performance over  
a sustained period. Salary levels for 
Executive Directors are reviewed 
annually in line with the overall  
company pay review process.
The performance-related pay element  
of Executive Director remuneration has 
three components:
•  A cash bonus scheme providing for 
annual bonuses dependent on a 
combination of corporate financial 
performance and personal bonus 
targets. The targets for these bonuses 
are set annually and currently provide 
for bonuses of up to 20% of salary.
•  Primary options over ordinary shares 
with a value of up to 20% of salary  
in accordance with the rules of the 
2015 Restricted Share Scheme.  
These options are tied to financial 
performance targets of the business 
which are set at the start of the 
financial year to which the targets 
relate and evaluated at the end of  
the financial year. In order for these 
options to then vest, the Director  
has to remain in employment three 
years after the financial year in which 
the performance of the Group has 
been evaluated.
•  Secondary options over ordinary 
shares granted annually to a value of 
up to 25% of salary in accordance with 
the rules of the 2015 Restricted Share 
Scheme. Under this scheme options 
are granted every year but only vest 
three years after grant by reference  
to growth in earnings per share and 
return on capital employed over the 
three-year period.
The Shepherd Neame Limited 2015 
Restricted Share Scheme (the “2015 
Scheme”) was introduced as a 
replacement to the Shepherd Neame 
Limited 2005 Restricted Share Scheme 
(the “2005 Scheme”) which expired on 
28 October 2015. The terms of the 2015 
Scheme are similar to the 2005 Scheme 
except certain terms have been updated 
to reflect current market practice. Like 
the 2005 Scheme, the 2015 Scheme aims 
to make awards which are closely aligned 
to Company performance and the 
interests of shareholders over the long 
term. The 2015 Scheme includes features 
consistent with prevailing market and 
best practices, including malus and 
clawback provisions (which may apply, 
at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, to awards made under the 
2015 Scheme).
The malus provision allows that both 
Primary and Secondary Options may be 
granted on terms that all or a proportion 
of unvested options may be forfeited 
back to the Company in exceptional 
circumstances of fraud, financial 
misstatement and misconduct.
In addition, and if specified at the time of 
grant, the clawback provision allows that 
in exceptional circumstances of fraud, 
financial misstatement and misconduct, 
the Company may reclaim and/or be 
compensated for all or a proportion of 
the Shares acquired by an employee 
under their vested options, whether 
Primary or Secondary.
In addition to these incentives Executive 
Directors are free to participate in the  
All Employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
This scheme is open to all employees 
with 18 months' service at the date of 
award and provides a free award of 
shares based on length of service and 
salary. The maximum award available  
to any employee is £3,600 per annum.  |StrategicReport |Governance |FinancialStatements |OtherInformation

reference to performance criteria to be 
measured against the 2019 results.
No options were exercised by the  
highest paid Director during the year.  
The aggregate gain, subject to tax,  
made by the highest paid Director on  
the exercise of share options in 2016  
was £86,000.
Subject to the approval of the accounts 
the Remuneration Committee will 
consider secondary option awards  
for the reference period to 2017 in 
October 2017 and primary options  
for the 2017 financial year. 
Due to changes in legislation the highest 
paid Director and one other Executive 
Director are no longer contributing 
members of the Company pension 
scheme. In addition, the pension 
contributions for the three remaining 
executives are capped. The highest paid 
Director received payments in lieu of 
pension in the year ended 24 June 2017 
which total £55,000 and are included

The aggregate gain, not included above, made by the highest paid Director on the exercise of share options was £nil (2016: £86,000).
Options benefit is calculated as the share price at the date the shares vest (less the exercise price) multiplied by the number of options 
vesting in the year. Options are considered to have vested if the performance criteria have been met in the financial year, in which case  
the number of vested options is estimated based on performance against performance measures. This benefit is subject to taxation.
SIP benefit is calculated as the share price at the year end multiplied by the number of shares awarded in the year.   |StrategicReport |Governance |FinancialStatements |OtherInformation

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT  
FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable 
law) including FRS 102 "The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland". Under company 
law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs and profit or 
loss of the Group and Company for that 
period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Group’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time, the 
financial position of the Group and 
Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information on 
the Shepherd Neame website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the current 
financial projections, together with the 
bank facilities, as discussed in the Cash 
Flow and Financing sections of the 
Financial Review on pages 18 to 22 and  
in accordance with the capital and risk 
management process set out in note 23; 
and, on the basis of reasonable 
expectation, have concluded that the 
Group and Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future  
and accordingly consider that it is 
appropriate to continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure  
of information to the auditor
The Directors who held office as at the 
date of approval of this Directors’ Report 
confirm that:
•  so far as they are each aware, there  
is no relevant audit information (as 
defined in Section 418(2) of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•  each Director has taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken as a 
director to be aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.  |StrategicReport |Governance |  Financial Statements |OtherInformation

• the related notes 1 to 34.
The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, including Financial 
Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) 
(ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the 
Parent Company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, 
including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters
The key audit matters that we identified in 
the current year were:
•  The fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired under FRS 102 Section 19, 
Business Combinations
•  The discount rate and forecast growth 
rates used as part of the tangible fixed 
assets impairment review
Materiality 
The materiality used in the current year was 
£589,000 which was determined on the 
basis of 5% of profit before taxation. 
Scoping
We performed full scope audit procedures 
over the entire group. This is the first year that 
a group audit has been performed due to the 
acquisition of Village Green Restaurants 
Limited that took place in the period.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in 
respect of the following matters where:
•  the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparation of the 
financial statements is not appropriate; or 
•  the directors have not disclosed in the 
financial statements any identified 
material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt about the group’s or the 
Parent Company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue. 
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include 
the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified. These matters 
included those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired under FRS 102 Section 19, 
Business Combinations
Key audit matter description
During the year the Group acquired Village 
Green Restaurants for a total consideration 
of £11.9m. The acquisition is accounted for as 
a business combination. There are a number 
of significant judgements involved in the 
determination of the fair value of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed, which also 
gives rise to a potential fraud risk. We have 
therefore identified the valuation of the 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
as a significant risk of material misstatement.
A purchase price allocation exercise has 
been performed by Management. The 
primary element of the valuation exercise 
assessed the fair value of the tangible fixed 
assets acquired as part of the combination 
(£13.3m) and the resulting goodwill 
(£506,000). The allocation also considered 
the fair values of other assets and liabilities 
acquired. 
Refer to the accounting policies (page 44) 
and note 16 of the group financial 
statements (page 57).
How the scope of our audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We verified the appropriateness of the 
group’s accounting for the acquisition of 
Village Green Restaurants through use of the 
following key procedures:
1.  Challenged the group’s preliminary 
estimates of fair value to test their 
robustness, by checking completeness of 
the Company’s process to identify the 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
and checking internal consistency of the 
assumptions used in the valuations;
2.  Obtained the group’s internal expert’s 
reports supporting the value of the 
properties acquired and used our real 
estate specialists to verify the 
appropriateness of the valuation 
methodologies and the reasonableness 
of key assumptions and judgements 
made; 
3.  Evaluated the competence of the experts 
used by the group and our in-house 
experts by reference to their 
qualifications and experience; 
4.  Assessed and challenged key 
assumptions and judgements used in the 
valuation of the property assets acquired 
including the valuation multiples and 
EBITDAs used for each property 
acquired. These were challenged through 
use of our real estate specialists engaging 
with management in detailed discussions 
around each property valuation;  38 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF SHEPHERD NEAME LIMITED (CONTINUED)
5.  Engaged with our audit specialists to 
assess the reasonableness of the deferred 
tax liabilities calculated on the fair value 
of the assets and liabilities acquired;
6.  Reviewed the disclosures in the financial 
statements around the acquisitions to 
confirm the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities have been correctly recorded;
7.  Challenged that the Management 
judgements underpinning the goodwill 
amortisation periods were appropriate; 
and
8.  Reviewed sale and purchase agreements 
to identify any contingent or deferred 
consideration.
Key observations
On the basis of the assessment we have 
carried out in respect of the valuations, we 
are satisfied with the approach and 
methodology adopted by the Directors in 
the preparation of the valuations of their 
estate as at 24 June 2017. We believe that 
the valuations are a fair and reasonable 
reflection of the business combination as at 
that date.
The discount rate and forecast growth 
rates used as part of the tangible fixed 
assets impairment review
Key audit matter description
The Group has property, plant and 
equipment with a net book value of £299m 
as at 24 June 2017.
In assessing impairment, Management 
estimates the recoverable amount of each 
cash-generating unit (CGU) by reference to 
the higher of its value in use (based on the 
group’s key assumptions in relation to future 
profits and a discount rate) and fair value 
less costs of disposal. The recoverable 
amount is compared to the carrying value 
of each CGU to determine whether any 
impairment is required. A CGU is defined as 
an individual tenanted or managed public 
house because this is the lowest level at 
which a group of assets (in this case, the 
land, buildings and fixtures and fittings) 
generate independent cash inflows.
There is a significant element of judgement 
in determining the recoverable amount of 
assets, specifically the assumptions used by 
Management in the value in use calculations, 
which also gives rise to a potential fraud risk. 
The discount rate and EBITDA growth rates 
are impacted by various factors, both 
internal as well as wider external economic 
factors (inflationary pressures, tax levies, 
consumer demand).
The discount rate and forecast profit 
calculations therefore have a high degree of 
judgement and carry a higher level of 
inherent risk of material error. These areas 
therefore formed a significant risk for our 
audit purposes.
Refer to accounting policies (page 44) and 
note 14 of the group financial statements 
(page 54).
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We obtained an understanding of the 
group’s process employed to identify 
impairment indicators and to calculate 
appropriate impairments of property, plant 
and equipment at a cash-generating unit 
level. We then performed the following 
procedures in order to address the above 
significant risk:
1.  Engaged our valuation specialists to 
benchmark discount rates against  
market data and competitors and also 
performed sensitivity analysis using our 
specialist’s discount rate thresholds;
2.  T ested the arithmetical accuracy and 
integrity of the model;
3.  Challenged Management’s growth 
forecasts and assumptions used through 
detailed discussions with Management 
and a retrospective review of budget 
accuracy and historic growth;
4.  Reviewed and challenged Management’s 
assessment of where impairment 
indicators trigger the need for 
impairment testing, while challenging 
Management’s value in use calculations 
and assumptions for pubs requiring 
impairment tests. This included those 
deemed “at risk”, which are those pubs 
that have had three years of decreasing 
EBITDA and/or three years where the 
ROCE falls below 8%;
5.  Reviewed and followed up the “at risk” 
properties identified as part of the 2016 
impairment review to note whether these 
were still deemed to be at risk of 
impairment; and
6.  Evaluated the appropriateness, 
sufficiency and clarity of any impairment-
related disclosures provided in the group 
financial statements, including the 
disclosure of key sensitivities.
Key observations
We are satisfied Management’s assumptions 
in growth rates, discount rate and the overall 
impairment review performed are 
reasonable.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement in the financial statements 
that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. We 
use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results 
of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we 
determined materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality
£589,000
Basis for determining materiality
5% of profit before taxation
Rationale for the benchmark applied
We judged profit before taxation to be the 
most appropriate benchmark for 
determining materiality as it is a key 
performance indicator for various 
stakeholders including shareholders. 
Profit before taxation

Reporting threshold
£20,000  |StrategicReport |Governance |  Financial Statements |OtherInformation
39 www.shepherdneame.co.uk
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to the Committee all audit 
differences in excess of £20,000, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group’s operations are all conducted in 
the United Kingdom. The audit was 
performed by one audit team based in the 
head office location in Faversham. The 
Group is made up of Shepherd Neame 
Limited (the Parent Company) and Village 
Green Restaurants Limited which is a wholly 
owned subsidiary. We also attended a 
sample of stock counts as at the year end.
During the year, the Parent Company 
acquired control of Village Green Restaurants. 
We obtained a thorough understanding of 
the entity-level controls of the Group. This 
assisted us in identifying and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement due to fraud 
or error and supported us in determining the 
most appropriate audit strategy.
We performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of all trading 
components which represented 100%  
of the Group’s results for the year.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the  
other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the 
annual report other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in our report, we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies 
or apparent material misstatements, we 
are required to determine whether there is 
a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of 
the other information. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and for 
such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors are responsible for assessing the 
group’s and Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as 
applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either  
intend to liquidate the group or the Parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit for the financial statements is 
located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory 
requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
•  the strategic report and the directors’ 
report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and or the 
Parent Company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have 
not identified any material misstatements in 
the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit; 
or
•  adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
•  the Parent Company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also 
required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have 
not been made. 
We have nothing to report in respect of  
this matter.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS  24 June 2017
1 Accounting Policies
The	principal	accounting	policies	are	summarised	below	and	have	been	consistently	applied	throughout	the	year	and	the	preceding	year.
a General information and basis of accounting
Shepherd	Neame	Limited	(the	Company)	is	a	company	incorporated	in	the	United	Kingdom	under	the	Companies	Act.	The	Company		
is	a	private	company	limited	by	shares	and	is	registered	in	England	and	Wales.	The	registered	office	is	17	Court	Street,	Faversham,	Kent	
ME13	7AX.	The	principal	activities	of	the	Company	and	its	subsidiaries	(the	Group)	and	the	nature	of	the	Group’s	operations	are	set	out		
in	the	Directors’	report	on	page	35.
The	accounts	have	been	prepared	on	a	going	concern	basis	under	the	historical	cost	convention,	modified	to	include	certain	items	at	fair	
value	and	by	the	revaluation	of	freehold	licensed	and	associated	properties.	They	are	prepared	in	accordance	with	Financial	Reporting	
Standard	102	(FRS	102)	issued	by	the	Financial	Reporting	Council.
The	functional	currency	of	the	Company	is	considered	to	be	pounds	sterling	because	that	is	the	currency	of	the	primary	economic	
environment	in	which	the	Company	operates.	The	financial	statements	are	also	presented	in	pounds	sterling,	rounded	to	the	nearest	
thousand	(£’000)	unless	otherwise	stated.
b Basis of consolidation
The	Group	financial	statements	consolidate	the	financial	statements	of	the	Company	and	its	subsidiary	undertakings	made	up	to		
24	June	2017.	A	subsidiary	is	an	entity	that	is	controlled	by	the	parent.	The	results	of	subsidiaries	acquired	or	sold	are	consolidated		
for	the	periods	from	or	to	the	date	on	which	control	passed.	
Business	combinations	are	accounted	for	under	the	purchase	method.	Where	necessary,	adjustments	are	made	to	the	financial	statements	
of	subsidiaries	to	bring	accounting	policies	used	into	line	with	those	used	by	the	Group.	All	intra-group	transactions,	balances,	income	and	
expenses	are	eliminated	on	consolidation.
Under	Section	408	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	the	Company	is	exempt	from	the	requirement	to	present	its	own	profit	and	loss	account.
In	the	parent	financial	statements,	investments	in	subsidiaries	are	carried	at	cost	less	impairment.	
c Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill	arising	on	acquisition	of	subsidiary	undertakings	and	businesses,	representing	any	excess	of	the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	
given	over	the	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	assets	and	liabilities	acquired,	is	capitalised	and	written	off	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	its	useful	
economic	life,	which	is	five	to	ten	years.	Provision	is	made	for	any	impairment.
d Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible	fixed	assets	are	stated	at	cost	or	valuation,	net	of	depreciation	and	any	provision	for	impairment.	Licensed	freehold	properties	
were	revalued	on	transition	to	FRS	102,	with	fair	value	treated	as	deemed	cost.
Assets	under	construction	are	not	depreciated	until	they	are	brought	into	use.	All	other	tangible	assets	are	depreciated	at	varying	rates	
calculated	to	write	off	their	carrying	value,	less	estimated	residual	value,	evenly	over	their	expected	useful	lives	as	follows:
•	 Freehold	brewery	buildings	 25	years
•	 Other	freehold	and	long	leasehold	buildings	 50	years
•	 Short	leaseholds	 over	the	lease	term
•	 Other	plant,	equipment,	fixtures	and	vehicles	 3	to	20	years
•	 Computer	hardware	and	software	 3	to	10	years
Residual	value	represents	the	estimated	amount	which	would	currently	be	obtained	from	disposal	of	an	asset,	after	deducting	estimated	
costs	of	disposal,	if	the	asset	were	already	of	the	age	and	in	the	condition	expected	at	the	end	of	its	useful	life.
e Investment properties
Investment	properties	are	carried	at	fair	value	and	measured	at	each	reporting	date	with	any	change	recognised	in	the	profit	and		
loss	account.
f Fixed asset investments
Fixed	asset	investments	are	measured	at	cost	less	impairment.	The	carrying	values	of	the	fixed	asset	investments	are	reviewed	for	
impairment	if	events	or	changes	in	circumstances	indicate	that	the	carrying	value	may	not	be	recoverable.
g Financial instruments
Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	recognised	when	the	Group	becomes	a	party	to	the	contractual	provisions	of	the	instrument.	
Financial	liabilities	and	equity	instruments	are	classified	according	to	the	substance	of	the	contractual	arrangements	entered	into.		
An	equity	instrument	is	any	contract	that	evidences	a	residual	interest	in	the	assets	of	the	Group	after	deducting	all	of	its	liabilities.  |StrategicReport |Governance |  Financial Statements |OtherInformation
45 www.shepherdneame.co.uk
i) Financial assets and liabilities
All	financial	assets	and	liabilities	are	initially	measured	at	transaction	price	(including	transaction	costs),	except	for	those	financial	assets	
classified	as	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss,	which	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value	(which	is	normally	the	transaction	price	excluding	
transaction	costs),	unless	the	arrangement	constitutes	a	financing	transaction.	If	an	arrangement	constitutes	a	financing	transaction,	the	
financial	asset	or	financial	liability	is	measured	at	the	present	value	of	the	future	payments	discounted	at	a	market	rate	of	interest	for	a	
similar	debt	instrument.
Debt	instruments	are	subsequently	measured	at	amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method.	Debt	instruments	that	are	classified	
as	payable	or	receivable	within	one	year	on	initial	recognition	and	which	meet	certain	conditions,	are	measured	at	the	undiscounted	
amount	of	the	cash	or	other	consideration	expected	to	be	paid	or	received,	net	of	impairment.
Financial	assets	are	derecognised	when	and	only	when	a)	the	contractual	rights	to	the	cash	flows	from	the	financial	asset	expire	or	are	
settled,	b)	the	Group	transfers	to	another	party	substantially	all	of	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	of	the	financial	asset,	or	c)	the	
Group,	despite	having	retained	some,	but	not	all,	significant	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership,	has	transferred	control	of	the	asset	to		
another	party.
Financial	liabilities	are	derecognised	only	when	the	obligation	specified	in	the	contract	is	discharged,	cancelled	or	expires.
ii) Derivative financial instruments – hedge accounting
The	Group	uses	derivative	financial	instruments	(interest	rate	swaps)	to	adjust	interest	rate	exposures.	The	Group	does	not	hold	or	issue	
derivative	financial	instruments	for	speculative	purposes.
Derivatives	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	at	the	date	a	derivative	contract	is	entered	into	and	are	subsequently	re-measured	to	their	
fair	value	at	each	reporting	date.	At	the	inception	of	the	hedge	relationship,	the	economic	relationship	between	the	hedging	instrument	
and	the	hedged	item	is	documented,	along	with	the	risk	management	objectives	and	clear	identification	of	the	risk	in	the	hedged	item	that	
is	being	hedged	by	the	hedging	instrument.	Furthermore,	at	the	inception	of	the	hedge	the	Company	determines	and	documents	causes	
for	hedge	ineffectiveness.
The	interest	rate	swaps	are	classified	as	cash	flow	hedges	because	the	derivative	financial	instruments	hedge	the	variable	interest	rate	risk	
of	the	cash	flows	associated	with	the	recognised	debt	instrument	measured	at	amortised	cost	(the	£60m	long-term	loan	to	2026).
The	effective	portion	of	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	designated	hedging	instrument	is	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income.	
The	gain	or	loss	relating	to	any	ineffective	portion	is	recognised	immediately	in	profit	or	loss.	Amounts	previously	recognised	in	other	
comprehensive	income	and	accumulated	in	equity	are	reclassified	to	profit	or	loss	in	the	periods	in	which	the	hedged	item	affects	profit		
or	loss	or	when	the	hedging	relationship	ends.
Hedge	accounting	is	discontinued	when	the	Group	revokes	the	hedging	relationship,	the	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	terminated,	
or	exercised,	or	no	longer	qualifies	for	hedge	accounting.	Any	gain	or	loss	accumulated	in	equity	at	that	time	is	reclassified	to	profit	or	loss	
when	the	hedged	item	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.	When	a	forecast	transaction	is	no	longer	expected	to	occur,	any	gain	or	loss	that	was	
recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income	is	reclassified	immediately	to	profit	or	loss.
h Stocks
Stocks	are	valued	at	the	lower	of	cost	and	estimated	selling	price	less	costs	to	sell,	which	is	equivalent	to	the	net	realisable	value.	Cost	of	
own	beers	produced	includes	materials	and	directly	attributable	fixed	and	variable	production	overheads.	Cost	is	calculated	using	the	
average	cost	method.	Provision	is	made	for	obsolete,	slow-moving	or	defective	items	where	appropriate.
i Accounting for leases
Rentals	payable	and	receivable	under	operating	leases	are	charged	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term,	even	if	the	payments	are	
not	made	on	such	a	basis.
j Impairment of assets
Assets,	other	than	those	measured	at	fair	value,	are	assessed	for	indicators	of	impairment	at	each	balance	sheet	date.	If	there	is	objective	
evidence	of	impairment,	an	impairment	loss	is	recognised	in	the	profit	and	loss	account	as	described	below.
Non-financial assets
An	asset	is	impaired	where	there	is	objective	evidence	that,	as	a	result	of	one	or	more	events	that	occurred	after	initial	recognition,	the	
estimated	recoverable	value	of	the	asset	has	been	reduced.	The	recoverable	amount	of	an	asset	is	the	higher	of	its	fair	value	less	costs	to	
sell	and	its	value	in	use.
Where	indicators	exist	for	a	decrease	in	impairment	loss,	the	prior	impairment	loss	is	tested	to	determine	reversal.	An	impairment	loss	is	
reversed	on	an	individual	impaired	asset	to	the	extent	that	the	revised	recoverable	value	does	not	lead	to	a	revised	carrying	amount	higher	
than	the	carrying	value	had	no	impairment	been	recognised. 46 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS  24 June 2017
1 Accounting Policies continued
Financial assets
For	financial	assets	carried	at	amortised	cost,	the	amount	of	an	impairment	is	the	difference	between	the	asset’s	carrying	amount	and	the	
present	value	of	estimated	future	cash	flows,	discounted	at	the	financial	asset’s	original	effective	interest	rate.
For	financial	assets	carried	at	cost	less	impairment,	the	impairment	loss	is	the	difference	between	the	asset’s	carrying	amount	and	the	best	
estimate	of	the	amount	that	would	be	received	for	the	asset	if	it	were	to	be	sold	at	the	reporting	date.
Where	indicators	exist	for	a	decrease	in	impairment	loss,	and	the	decrease	can	be	related	objectively	to	an	event	occurring	after	the	
impairment	was	recognised,	the	prior	impairment	loss	is	tested	to	determine	reversal.	An	impairment	loss	is	reversed	on	an	individual	
impaired	financial	asset	to	the	extent	that	the	revised	recoverable	value	does	not	lead	to	a	revised	carrying	amount	higher	than	the	
carrying	value	had	no	impairment	been	recognised.
k Taxation  
Current tax
Corporation	tax	payable	is	provided	at	amounts	expected	to	be	paid	(or	recovered)	using	the	tax	rates	and	laws	that	have	been	enacted		
or	substantively	enacted	by	the	balance	sheet	date.
Deferred tax
Deferred	tax	is	recognised	in	respect	of	all	timing	differences	that	have	originated	but	not	reversed	at	the	balance	sheet	date	where	
transactions	or	events	that	will	result	in	an	obligation	to	pay	more	tax	in	the	future	or	a	right	to	pay	less	tax	in	the	future	have	occurred		
at	the	balance	sheet	date.
Unrelieved	tax	losses	and	other	deferred	tax	assets	are	recognised	only	to	the	extent	that,	on	the	basis	of	all	available	evidence,	it	can	
be	regarded	as	more	likely	than	not	that	there	will	be	suitable	taxable	profits	from	which	the	future	reversal	of	the	underlying	timing	
differences	can	be	deducted.
Deferred	tax	is	measured	on	an	undiscounted	basis	at	the	tax	rates	that	are	expected	to	apply	in	the	periods	in	which	timing	differences	
reverse,	based	on	the	tax	rate	and	laws	that	have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	Deferred	tax	relating	
to	property,	plant	and	equipment	measured	using	the	revaluation	model	and	investment	property	is	measured	using	the	tax	rates	and	
allowances	that	apply	to	sale	of	the	asset.
The	tax	expense	or	income	is	presented	in	the	same	component	of	comprehensive	income	or	equity	as	the	transaction	or	other	event	that	
resulted	in	the	tax	expense	or	income.
l Turnover
Turnover	is	recognised	when	the	significant	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	of	the	goods	have	passed	to	the	buyer,	usually	on	dispatch	or	
delivery	of	the	goods;	or	on	provision	of	services.	Turnover	comprises	the	invoice	value	of	goods	inclusive	of	excise	duty	and	services,	net	
of	VAT	and	discounts.	Rental	income	received	from	tied	estate	properties	is	recognised	in	the	period	in	which	it	arises	on	an	accruals	basis	
or	for	leased	properties	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	lease.
m Exceptional items
Items	which	are	either	material	or	infrequent	in	nature	are	described	as	exceptional	items	and	are	excluded	from	underlying	results.
n Retirement benefits
The	Group	operates	defined	contribution	pension	schemes.	Contributions	are	charged	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	as	they	become	
payable	in	accordance	with	the	rules	of	the	schemes.
Other	long-term	employee	benefits	are	measured	at	the	present	value	of	the	benefit	obligation	at	the	financial	reporting	date.
o Foreign currency
Transactions	expressed	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	into	sterling	and	recorded	at	the	rate	of	exchange	at	the	date	of	the	
transaction.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	denominated	in	foreign	currencies	at	the	balance	sheet	date	are	reported	at	rates	of	exchange	
prevailing	at	that	date.	All	differences	are	taken	to	the	profit	and	loss	account.
p Dividends
Dividends	payable	are	shown	as	a	movement	in	reserves	when	declared	(interim	dividend)	or	approved	(final	dividend).  |StrategicReport |Governance |  Financial Statements |OtherInformation
47 www.shepherdneame.co.uk
q Share-based payment
All	options	are	equity-settled.	The	cost	of	equity-settled	transactions	with	employees	is	measured	by	reference	to	the	fair	value	at	the	
date	at	which	they	are	granted	and	is	recognised	as	an	expense	over	the	vesting	period,	which	ends	on	the	date	on	which	the	relevant	
employees	become	fully	entitled	to	the	award.	Fair	value	is	determined	using	the	Black-Scholes	pricing	model	which	is	considered	by	
management	to	be	the	most	appropriate	method	of	valuation.	In	valuing	equity-settled	transactions,	no	account	is	taken	of	any	vesting	
conditions,	other	than	conditions	linked	to	the	price	of	the	shares	of	the	Group	(market	conditions).	The	amount	recognised	as	an	expense	
is	adjusted	to	reflect	the	actual	number	of	share	options	that	vest	except	where	forfeiture	is	only	due	to	market-based	conditions	not	
achieving	the	threshold	for	vesting.
At	each	balance	sheet	date	before	vesting,	the	cumulative	expense	is	calculated,	representing	the	extent	to	which	the	vesting	period	
has	expired	and	management’s	best	estimate	of	the	achievement	or	otherwise	of	non-market	conditions.	The	movement	in	cumulative	
expense	since	the	previous	balance	sheet	is	recognised	in	the	profit	and	loss	account,	with	a	corresponding	entry	in	equity.
r Investment in subsidiaries
The	Company	recognises	its	investment	in	subsidiaries	at	cost.	Income	is	recognised	from	these	investments	only	in	relation	to	
distributions	received	from	post-acquisition	profits.	Distributions	received	in	excess	of	post-acquisition	profits	are	deducted	from	the		
cost	of	the	investment.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In	the	application	of	the	Group’s	accounting	policies,	which	are	described	in	note	1,	the	Directors	are	required	to	make	judgements,	
estimates	and	assumptions	about	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	that	are	not	readily	apparent	from	other	sources.		
The	estimates	and	associated	assumptions	are	based	on	historical	experience	and	other	factors	that	are	considered	to	be	relevant.		
Actual	results	may	differ	from	these	estimates.
The	estimates	and	underlying	assumptions	are	reviewed	on	an	ongoing	basis.	Revisions	to	accounting	estimates	are	recognised	in	the	
period	in	which	the	estimate	is	revised	if	the	revision	affects	both	current	and	future	periods.
Key source of estimation uncertainty – impairment of assets
Financial	and	non-financial	assets	are	subject	to	impairment	reviews	at	the	balance	sheet	date	based	on	whether	current	or	future	events	
and	circumstances	suggest	that	their	recoverable	amount	may	be	less	than	their	carrying	value.	Recoverable	amount	is	based	on	the	
higher	of	the	value	in	use	and	fair	value	less	costs	to	dispose.	Value	in	use	is	calculated	from	expected	future	cash	flows	using	suitable	
discount	rates	and	includes	management	assumptions	and	estimates	of	future	performance	as	disclosed	in	note	14.
Critical judgements
There	have	been	no	critical	judgements	made	in	the	current	or	prior	financial	years. 48 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS  24 June 2017
3 Segmental reporting
In	adopting	FRS	102,	the	operating	segment	disclosure	requirements	of	IFRS	8	are	required	as	the	Group	has	publicly	traded	equity	
instruments.	The	accounting	policy	for	identifying	segments	is	based	on	internal	management	reporting	information	that	is	regularly	
reviewed	by	the	chief	operating	decision-maker.
The	Group	has	three	operating	segments,	which	are	largely	organised	and	managed	separately	according	to	the	nature	of	the	products	
and	services	provided	and	the	profile	of	the	customers:
•	 Brewing	and	Brands	which	comprises	the	brewing,	marketing	and	sales	of	beer,	wine	and	spirits;
•	 Managed	Pubs	and	Hotels	and;
•	 	 Tenanted	and	Leased	Pubs	which	comprises	pubs	operated	by	third	parties	under	tenancy	or	lease	agreements.	Transfer	prices	
between	operating	segments	are	set	on	an	arm’s	length	basis.
The	measurement	policies	the	Group	uses	for	segment	reporting	under	IFRS	8	are	the	same	as	those	used	in	the	financial	statements.

Certain	items	recognised	in	reported	profit	or	loss	before	tax	can	vary	significantly	from	year	to	year	and	therefore	create	volatility	in	
reported	earnings	which	does	not	reflect	the	underlying	performance	of	the	Group.	The	Directors	believe	that	the	“underlying	operating	
profit”,	“underlying	profit	before	tax”,	“underlying	basic	earnings	per	share”,	“underlying	earnings	before	interest,	tax,	depreciation,	and	
amortisation”	presented	provide	a	clear	and	consistent	presentation	of	the	underlying	performance	of	ongoing	business	for	shareholders.	
Underlying	profit	is	not	defined	by	FRS	102	and	therefore	may	not	be	directly	comparable	with	the	“adjusted”	profit	measures	of	other	
companies.	The	adjusted	items	are:
•	 Profit	or	loss	on	disposal	of	properties
•	 Investment	property	fair	value	movements
•	 	 Exceptional	items	–	these	are	items	which	are	either	material	or	infrequent	in	nature	and	do	not	relate	to	the	underlying	performance.

c Factors that may affect future tax charges
During	the	period	the	Finance	Act	2016	received	Royal	Assent.	The	main	impact	was	the	reduction	of	the	UK	Corporation	tax	rate	from	
18%	to	17%	(effective	from	1	April	2020).	To	the	extent	that	this	rate	change	will	affect	the	amount	of	future	tax	cash	tax	payments	to		
be	made	by	the	Group,	this	will	reduce	the	size	of	both	the	Group’s	deferred	tax	liability	and	tax	asset.	The	impact	in	the	52	weeks	to		
24	June	2017	was	an	exceptional	credit	to	profit	and	loss	of	£315,000	and	a	credit	to	other	comprehensive	income	of	£146,000.	
During	the	53	weeks	beginning	25	June	2017,	the	net	reduction	of	deferred	tax	liabilities	expected	to	be	credited	to	the	profit	and	
loss	account	is	estimated	at	£800,000	due	to	the	reversal	of	accelerated	capital	allowances	and	reduction	in	the	deferred	tax	liability	
on	the	revaluation	of	freehold	pubs.	This	estimate	is	based	upon	a	number	of	assumptions,	including	the	level	of	capital	expenditure	
qualifying	for	capital	allowances,	properties	that	are	to	be	sold	and	increases	in	the	Retail	Price	Index,	which	are	uncertain	and	could	
result	in	a	significantly	different	actual	movement.

Licensed	freehold	properties	were	revalued	to	fair	value	at	28	June	2014,	on	transition	to	FRS	102,	with	subsequent	additions	at	cost.	
The	properties	were	revalued	individually	by	the	Company’s	own	professionally	qualified	staff.	A	sample	was	verified	by	Porters,	a	firm	
of	independent	external	qualified	valuers.	The	revaluation	was	in	accordance	with	the	provisions	of	the	RICS	Valuation	–	Professional	
Standards	January	2014	(“the	Red	Book”).	The	revalued	amounts,	adjusted	for	subsequent	disposals,	have	been	retained.	Valuations	of	
£210,695,000	are	included	in	the	valuation	or	cost	of	the	freehold	properties	at	24	June	2017	(2016:	£215,400,000).
If	they	had	not	been	revalued,	freehold	properties	would	have	been	included	at	the	following	amounts:	
	 			 2017	 2016	
Group	and	Company	 			 £’000	 £’000
Cost	 	 	 	 168,945	 147,589
Accumulated	depreciation	 	 	 	 (5,761)	 (5,792)
Net	book	amount	 	 	 	 163,184	 141,797
The	Group	has	entered	into	certain	operating	leases	as	lessor.	The	gross	cost	of	assets	held	for	use	under	these	leases	amounted	to	
£28,974,000	(2016:	£19,132,000)	and	the	related	accumulated	depreciation	charges	amounted	to	£410,000	(2016:	£336,000)	and	the	
aggregate	rentals	receivable	amounted	to	£1,279,000	(2016:	£912,000).
A	net	impairment	loss	of	£199,000	was	recognised	in	the	year	in	respect	of	two	licensed	properties	to	write	them	down	to	their	
recoverable	amount	(2016:	£307,000	in	respect	of	six	licensed	properties).	The	loss	arose	as	a	result	of	a	decline	in	performance	at		
these	properties.
Impairment	was	assessed	at	the	income-generating	unit	level,	considered	to	be	on	the	basis	of	each	individual	pub.	Whether	an	asset	was	
impaired	or	not	was	determined	by	comparing	the	carrying	value	against	its	estimated	‘recoverable	amount’.	The	recoverable	amount	
was	taken	as	the	higher	of	either	the	net	realisable	value	or	its	value	in	use.	The	value	in	use	was	determined	by	conducting	a	net	present	
value	review	of	all	relevant	cash	flows	from	the	asset	based	upon	the	budget	for	the	forthcoming	financial	year	approved	by	the	Directors.	
Cash	flows	beyond	the	budget	period	are	extrapolated	in	perpetuity	for	freehold	properties	and	over	the	length	of	the	remaining	lease	for	
leasehold	properties.	The	long-term	growth	rates	applied	are	2.5%	for	managed	pubs	and	1.5%	for	tenanted	pubs.	The	pre-tax	discount	
rate	used	in	this	review	was	8.13%	(2016:	8.16%).
Impairments	and	reversal	of	impairments	of	fixed	assets	are	included	in	operating	charges	excluded	from	underlying	results.
b Investment properties
Investment	properties,	which	are	all	freehold,	are	revalued	to	fair	value	at	each	reporting	date	by	the	Company’s	own	professionally	
qualified	staff.	The	valuations	were	performed	by	a	Company	director	who	is	RICS	qualified.	An	independent	valuation	of	the	properties	
has	not	been	performed.
The	fair	values	for	commercial	property	and	land	are	based	on	the	rental	income	earned	on	the	properties	and	average	yields	earned	on	
comparable	properties	from	publicly	available	information	and	for	residential	properties	on	comparable	market	evidence.
As	a	consequence	of	the	vote	to	exit	the	EU,	it	has	not	been	possible	to	gauge	the	effect,	if	any,	of	this	decision	on	property	valuations	at	
24	June	2017	by	reference	to	transactions	in	the	market	place.

22 Derivative financial instruments
The	interest	rate	swaps	are	classified	as	cash	flow	hedges	because	the	derivative	financial	instruments	hedge	the	variable	interest	rate	
risk	of	the	cash	flows	associated	with	the	recognised	debt	instrument	measured	at	amortised	cost	(the	£60m	long-term	loan).	Under	the	
terms	of	the	swaps,	the	Group	receives	floating	rate	interest	and	pays	fixed	rate	interest.
The	fair	values	for	interest	rate	swaps	are	a	volatile	value	often	referred	to	as	“mark	to	market”	value.	This	value	is	determined	by	marking	
the	fixed	rate	within	the	swap	against	the	market	for	forward	interest	rates.	If	forward	interest	rates	are	below	the	fixed	swap	rate	then	the	
swap	will	have	a	negative	fair	value	for	the	Group.	If	forward	interest	rates	are	above	the	swap	rate	then	there	will	be	a	positive	fair	value	for	
the	Group.
The	following	table	details	the	notional	principal	amounts	and	remaining	terms	of	interest	rate	swap	contracts	outstanding	as	at	the	
reporting	date:

The	interest	rate	swaps	settle	on	a	three	monthly	basis.	The	floating	rate	on	the	interest	rate	swaps	is	LIBOR	plus	variable	rates.	The	Group	
settles	the	difference	between	the	fixed	and	floating	interest	rate	on	a	net	basis.
A	gain	of	£2,460,000	(2016:	loss	of	£5,887,000)	was	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income	in	respect	of	the	swaps	in	cash	flow

23 Financial Risk Management
a Financial risks
The	main	risks	associated	with	the	Group’s	financial	assets	and	liabilities	are	interest	rate	risk,	liquidity	risk,	counterparty	credit	risk	and	
foreign	currency	risk,	as	noted	below.	The	policies	for	managing	these	risks	are	regularly	reviewed	and	agreed	by	the	Board	of	Directors.
In	certain	limited	circumstances	the	Group	uses	derivative	instruments	to	change	the	economic	characteristics	of	its	financial	instruments.	
It	is	Group	policy	not	to	enter	into	or	trade	in	financial	instruments	for	speculative	purposes.
Interest rate risk
Currently	it	is	Group	policy	to	manage	the	cost	of	its	borrowings	by	using	a	mixture	of	fixed	and	variable	interest	rates	at	the	balance	
sheet	date.	Debt	is	represented	by	a	20-year	term	loan,	a	five-year	revolving	credit	facility	and	a	short-term	committed	overdraft	facility	
all	of	which	are	secured	by	a	first	floating	charge	over	the	assets	of	the	Group.	They	all	bear	interest	at	variable	rates	based	on	LIBOR	and	
National	Westminster	Bank	base	rate.	The	interest	on	the	rate	subject	to	bank	margin	of	£60m	available	under	the	20-year	term	bank	loan	
is	fixed	by	means	of	interest	rate	swap	contracts	which	run	for	the	same	period	as	the	loan,	as	disclosed	in	notes	21	and	22.	Interest	on	
drawings	on	the	revolving	credit	facility	and	short-term	overdraft	facility	are	not	fixed	as	it	is	Group	policy	to	have	short-term	borrowing	
on	a	variable	rate	basis.
Liquidity risk
The	Group	manages	its	liquidity	risk	by	monitoring	cash	receipts	and	payments	and	preparing	rolling	cash	flow	forecasts	from	which	
to	predict	short-	and	long-term	funding	requirements	and	ensure	that	borrowing	facilities	are	available,	if	required,	and	that	covenants	
in	respect	of	bank	loans	are	not	contravened.	Capital	expenditure	is	approved	by	the	Board	and	investment	appraisal	models	used	to	
evaluate	proposed	expenditure.	It	is	currently	the	Group’s	policy	to	finance	the	majority	of	its	business	need	by	means	of	long-term	bank	
loans	which	amounted	to	£60m	fully	drawn	at	the	year	end.	The	balance	of	its	requirements	at	the	balance	sheet	date	was	provided	by	
a	five-year	revolving	credit	loan	facility	of	£45m,	which	is	due	to	mature	in	September	2020	and	a	committed	overdraft	facility	of	£2m,	
which	matures	in	June	2018.	The	size	of	the	facility	is	regularly	reviewed	and	the	overdraft	facility	is	renewed	annually.	At	the	year	end		
£19m	(2016:	nil)	of	the	revolving	credit	loan	facility	and	£nil	(2016:	£0.7m)	of	the	overdraft	facility	was	being	utilised.
Counterparty credit risk
The	Group	trades	only	with	recognised,	creditworthy	third	parties.	It	is	the	Group’s	policy	that	all	customers	who	wish	to	trade	on	credit	
terms	are	subject	to	credit	verification	procedures	and	are	subject	to	credit	limits	to	control	debt	exposure.	It	has	not	been	possible	to	
maintain	credit	insurance	at	appropriate	cost	in	the	current	market.	In	addition,	receivable	balances	are	monitored	on	an	ongoing	basis.	
The	growth	of	the	Group’s	business	with	national	retailers	has	increased	the	concentration	of	credit	risk.	However,	the	Board	of	Directors	
consider	that	the	credit	risk	from	these	customers	remains	relatively	low.
With	respect	to	credit	risk	arising	from	other	financial	assets	of	the	Group,	which	comprise	cash	and	cash	equivalents,	the	Group’s	
exposure	to	credit	risk	arises	from	the	default	of	a	counterparty,	with	a	maximum	exposure	equal	to	the	carrying	value	amount	of		
these	instruments.
Foreign currency risk
The	principal	financial	instruments	are	denominated	in	sterling	and	the	vast	majority	of	the	Group’s	operations	are	undertaken	within		
the	UK.	Consequently	the	foreign	currency	risk	is	immaterial,	except	for	importation	of	product	and	those	infrequent	occasions	when	the	
Group	purchases	plant	and	equipment	denominated	in	foreign	currency.	In	these	circumstances	it	is	the	policy	of	the	Group	to	consider	
entering	into	forward	exchange	contracts	to	fix	future	payments	as	they	fall	due.	At	the	year	end	the	Group	had	no	outstanding	contracts	
to	purchase	foreign	currency.
b Capital management
The	capital	structure	of	the	Group	consists	of	bank	loans	(see	note	20),	cash	and	shareholders’	equity,	comprising	share	capital,	reserves	
and	retained	earnings	(see	notes	25	and	26).	In	managing	its	capital	the	Group’s	main	objectives	are	to	ensure	that	it	is	able	to	continue	to	
operate	as	a	going	concern	as	noted	in	the	Report	of	the	Directors	and	to	maximise	its	return	to	its	shareholders	through	a	combination	of	
capital	growth	and	distributions.	The	Group	seeks	to	maintain	a	ratio	of	debt	to	equity	that	balances	the	risk	and	returns	at	an	acceptable	
level	and	maintains	sufficient	funds	to	meet	its	working	capital	and	investment	requirements	and	comply	with	bank-lending	covenants.
The	Board	of	Directors	review	the	Group’s	dividend	policy	and	funding	requirements	regularly	throughout	the	year. 62 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017

The	Company	has	a	charge	over	the	mortgaged	property,	the	value	of	which	exceeds	the	guarantee	provided.
The	Company	is	in	dispute	regarding	the	terms	on	which	a	long-term	agreement	with	our	local	water	company	terminated	and	any		
residual	liabilities	under	it	owed	by	the	Company.	The	Board	is	of	the	view	that	there	should	be	no	material	liability	for	the	Group	in	this	
respect	beyond	charges	yet	to	be	invoiced	in	line	with	the	contract	for	the	final	four	years	which	terminated	in	April	2015.	The	Group		
has	made	accruals	in	respect	of	these	amounts.	The	dispute	resolution	procedure	in	the	long-term	agreement	is	arbitration.	In	the	
absence	of	a	consensual	resolution	to	this	dispute,	there	is	a	possibility	that	arbitration	could	commence.	It	is	estimated	that	the	Group’s	
legal	and	associated	costs	of	an	arbitration	case	could	be	up	to	£750,000.	The	Group	would	seek	to	reclaim	these	costs	as	part	of	the	
arbitration	process.

and	Company.
a The Shepherd Neame Employee Share Incentive Plan
The	Shepherd	Neame	Employee	Share	Incentive	Plan	(SIP)	is	open	to	all	employees	with	18	months’	service	at	the	award	date.	A	free	
award	of	shares,	based	on	length	of	service	and	salary	and	subject	to	the	maximum	of	£3,600,	was	made	to	all	eligible	employees	in	all	
years	from	2003	to	2016	with	the	exception	of	2009.	Participants	are	entitled	to	these	free	shares	from	three	years	after	the	date	of	the	
award	if	they	remain	in	the	Company’s	employment.
The	Company	did	not	purchase	any	shares	for	the	Employee	Share	Incentive	Plan	in	either	2017	or	2016.
The	following	table	illustrates	the	number	and	movements	in	shares	in	the	year:

The	employees	do	not	have	to	make	any	payment	for	the	award	of	shares	under	the	Plan.	As	such	the	weighted	average	exercise	price	is	
nil.	The	weighted	average	share	price	at	date	of	distribution	for	the	shares	distributed	was	£12.954	(2016:	£11.740).
The	weighted	average	fair	value	of	the	shares	granted	in	November	2016	was	£12.650	(November	2015:	£11.950).	The	fair	value,	taking	into	
account	the	terms	and	conditions	upon	which	the	shares	were	granted,	equates	to	the	market	price	at	the	date	of	grant.
The	expense	recognised	for	share-based	payments	made	under	SIP	in	respect	of	employee	services	during	the	year	to	24	June	2017	was	
£237,000	(2016:	£200,000).

This	is	a	restricted	share	scheme	for	Senior	Managers	and	Executive	Directors,	including	the	highest	paid	Director	and	four	other	
Directors.	The	scheme	ended	in	2015.	
Under	the	2005	restricted	share	scheme,	primary	options	were	awarded	which	are	exercisable	three	years	after	they	were	awarded	
subject,	normally,	to	the	grantee	remaining	in	the	Company’s	employment.	The	Directors	were	also	granted	secondary	options	which	are	
exercisable	three	years	after	they	were	awarded	if	the	Group	achieves	certain	financial	performance	criteria	and,	normally,	provided	that	
the	Director	remains	in	the	Company’s	employment.
The	contractual	life	of	each	option	granted	is	ten	years	and	the	options	outstanding	at	24	June	2017	had	a	remaining	contractual	life	of	
6.97	years.

for	options	outstanding	at	the	end	of	the	year	was	£0.50	–	£1.00.
The	fair	value	of	the	equity-settled	share	options	granted	under	the	scheme	is	estimated	at	the	date	of	grant	using	the	Black-Scholes

Directors.	This	scheme	replaced	the	2005	Restricted	Share	Scheme	following	its	cessation	in	2015.	The	2015	scheme	provides	for	the	
grant	of	primary	and	secondary	share	options	under	similar	terms	and	restricted	to	the	same	maximum	limits	as	those	that	applied	to		
the	2005	scheme.	It	was	updated	to	reflect	changes	in	market	practice	since	the	2005	scheme	was	adopted.
Under	the	2015	restricted	share	scheme,	primary	options	were	awarded	which	are	exercisable	three	years	after	they	are	awarded	
subject,	normally,	to	the	grantee	remaining	in	the	Company’s	employment.	The	Directors	were	also	granted	secondary	options	which	are	
exercisable	three	years	after	they	were	awarded	if	the	Group	achieves	certain	financial	performance	criteria	and,	normally,	provided	that	
the	Director	remains	in	the	Company’s	employment.
The	contractual	life	of	each	option	granted	is	ten	years	and	the	options	outstanding	at	24	June	2017	had	a	remaining	contractual	life	of	
8.78	years.

amounts	to	£907,000	(2016:	£959,000).	Contributions	of	£132,000	(2016:	£118,000)	were	payable	to	the	schemes	at	the	year	end.	Three	
of	the	executive	Directors	(2016:	three)	are	contributing	members	of	one	of	the	Company’s	defined	contribution	schemes.	Due	to	changes	
in	legislation	the	highest	paid	Director	and	one	other	executive	Director	are	no	longer	contributing	members	of	this	scheme	although	they	
do	have	entitlement	to	deferred	benefits.
The	Company	also	meets	the	pension	costs	of	certain	former	employees	which	have	not	been	funded	through	the	pension	schemes.		
The	amount	of	this	unfunded	liability	is	not	significant.

respect	of	Company	properties	during	the	year	to	24	June	2017	at	a	cost	of	£24,000	including	VAT	and	disbursements	to	third	parties	
(2016:	£41,000).	At	the	year	end	there	was	no	balance	owed	to	the	partnership	by	Shepherd	Neame	Limited	(2016:	nil).

Church	Road,	Faversham	on	Friday

determine	the	auditor’s	remuneration.
Resolution 6	–	That	the	Company	be	
generally	and	unconditionally	authorised	
for	the	purpose	of	section	701	of	the	
Companies	Act	2006	(the	“Act”)	to	make	
market	purchases	(as	defined	in	section	
693	of	the	Act)	of	its	ordinary	shares	
of	50	pence	each	(“ordinary shares”),	
provided	that:
(a)		 the	maximum	number	of	ordinary	
shares	that	may	be	purchased	is	
1,485,750;
(b)		 the	minimum	price	(excluding	
expenses)	which	may	be	paid	for	each

(c)		 the	maximum	price	(excluding	
expenses)	which	may	be	paid	for

quotations	for	such	shares	(as	derived	
from	the	NEX	Exchange	website)	for	
the	five	business	days	immediately	
preceding	the	day	on	which	the	
purchase	is	made;	and	
(d)		 the	authority	conferred	by	this	
resolution	shall	(unless	previously	
renewed	or	revoked)	expire	on	
the	earlier	of	the	conclusion	of	the	
next	Annual	General	Meeting	of	the	
Company	and	13	January	2019	save	
that	the	Company	may	enter	into	a	
contract	to	purchase	ordinary	shares	
before	the	expiry	of	such	authority	
which	will	or	may	be	completed	
wholly	or	partly	thereafter	and	a	
purchase	of	ordinary	shares	may	
be	made	in	pursuance	of	any	such	
contract	or	contracts.
Notes to the Resolutions
Resolutions 3 and 4 – Re-election  
of Directors
The	articles	of	association	of	the	
Company	require	certain	of	the	Directors	
to	retire	by	rotation	at	each	Annual	
General	Meeting	and	require	any	non-
executive	Director	who	has	served	
for	longer	than	nine	years	to	submit	
themselves	for	annual	re-election.	
This	year	Mr	N	J	Bunting	and	Mr	M	H	
Templeman	will	retire	and	are	each	
offering	themselves	for	re-election.	Brief	
biographies	of	the	Directors	are	set	out	
on	pages	26	to	27	of	the	Annual	Report	
and	Accounts	2017.
Resolution 6 – Authority to make market 
purchases of ordinary shares
Resolution	6	seeks	authority	for	the	
Company	to	make	market	purchases	
of	its	own	ordinary	shares.	If	passed,	
the	resolution	gives	authority	for	the	
Company	to	purchase	up	to	1,485,750	of	
its	ordinary	shares,	representing	10	per	
cent.	of	the	Company’s	issued	ordinary	
share	capital	as	at	18	September	2017.	The	
Directors	have	no	present	intention	of	
making	such	purchases,	but	consider	it	is	
prudent	for	them	to	retain	the	ability	to	
do	so.	The	Directors	would	not	propose	
to	exercise	their	authority	to	make	
purchases	unless	the	expected	effect	
of	the	purchase	would	be	to	increase	
earnings	per	share	and	it	is	generally	in	
the	best	interest	of	the	shareholders.	Any	
shares	purchased	under	this	authority	will	
be	cancelled.
The	resolution	specifies	the	highest	and	
lowest	price	which	the	Company	can	pay	
for	any	ordinary	shares	purchased	under	
the	authority	and	when	the	authority	
expires.	The	Directors	presently	intend	
that	a	resolution	to	renew	this	authority	
will	be	proposed	at	each	succeeding	
Annual	General	Meeting.

Explanatory notes
1.	 	 Members	entitled	to	attend	and	vote	
at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	(the	
“Meeting”)	are	entitled	to	appoint	a	
proxy	to	exercise	all	or	any	of	their	
rights	to	attend,	speak	and	vote	on	
their	behalf	at	the	Meeting	and	that	
proxy	need	not	also	be	a	member.	
Members	may	appoint	more	than	
one	proxy	in	relation	to	the	Meeting,	
provided	that	each	proxy	is	appointed	
to	exercise	the	rights	attached	to		
a	different	share	or	shares	held	by		
that	member.
2.  You may appoint a proxy in one of 
the following ways: 
(i)	 	 by	using	the	enclosed	form	of	proxy.	
In	order	to	be	valid,	the	form	of	proxy	
should	be	completed	and	returned,	
together	with	the	power	of	attorney	
or	other	authority	(if	any)	under	which	
it	is	signed	or	a	notarially	certified	
copy	of	the	same,	to	the	Company’s	
Registrars,	Computershare	Investor	
Services	PLC,	The	Pavilions,	
Bridgwater	Road,	Bristol	BS99	6ZY	
as	soon	as	possible	and	in	any	event,	
so	as	to	arrive	by	no	later	than	12.00	
noon	on	Wednesday	11	October	2017;	
(ii) 	online	at	www.investorcentre.co.uk/
eproxy	using	the	Control	Number,	
Shareholder	Reference	Number	and	
PIN	printed	on	the	enclosed	form	of	
proxy	by	no	later	than	12.00	noon	on	
Wednesday	11	October	2017;	or	
(iii)	 	 if	you	hold	your	shares	in	
uncertificated	form,	by	using	the	
CREST	electronic	proxy	appointment	
service	as	described	in	note	4	below.
3.	 	 The	appointment	of	a	proxy	will	not	
prevent	a	member	from	attending	and	
voting	in	person	at	the	Meeting.
4.	 	 CREST	members	who	wish	to	appoint	
a	proxy	or	proxies	through	the	
CREST	electronic	proxy	appointment	
service	should	follow	the	procedures	
described	in	the	CREST	Manual.	
CREST	personal	members	or	
other	CREST	sponsored	members,	
and	those	CREST	members	who	
have	appointed	(a)	voting	service	
provider(s),	should	refer	to	their	
CREST	sponsor	or	voting	service	
provider(s)	to	take	the	appropriate	
action	on	their	behalf.	
	 	 In	order	for	a	proxy	appointment	or	
instruction	made	using	the	CREST	
service	to	be	valid,	the	appropriate	
CREST	message	(a	“CREST Proxy 
Instruction”)	must	be	properly	
authenticated	in	accordance	with	
Euroclear	UK	&	Ireland's	specifications	
and	must	contain	the	information	
required	for	such	instructions,	as	
described	in	the	CREST	Manual.	
The	message,	regardless	of	whether	
it	constitutes	the	appointment	of	
a	proxy	or	an	amendment	to	the	
instruction	given	to	a	previously	
appointed	proxy	must,	in	order	to	
be	valid,	be	transmitted	so	as	to	
be	received	by	the	issuer’s	agent	
(ID	3RA50)	not	less	than	48	hours	
before	the	time	for	holding	the	
Meeting.	For	this	purpose,	the	time	
of	receipt	will	be	taken	to	be	the	time	
(as	determined	by	the	timestamp	
applied	to	the	message	by	the	CREST	
Applications	Host)	from	which	the	
issuer’s	agent	is	able	to	retrieve	the	
message	by	enquiry	to	CREST	in	the	
manner	prescribed	by	CREST.	After	
this	time,	any	change	of	instructions	
to	proxies	appointed	through	CREST	
should	be	communicated	to	the	
appointee	through	other	means.	
	 	 CREST	members	and,	where	
applicable,	their	CREST	sponsors	
or	voting	service	providers	should	
note	that	Euroclear	UK	&	Ireland	
Limited	does	not	make	available	
special	procedures	in	CREST	for	
any	particular	messages.	Normal	
system	timings	and	limitations	will	
therefore	apply	in	relation	to	the	
input	of	CREST	Proxy	Instructions.	
It	is	the	responsibility	of	the	CREST	
member	concerned	to	take	(or,	if	the	
CREST	member	is	a	CREST	personal	
member	or	sponsored	member	or	has	
appointed	a	voting	service	provider,	
to	procure	that	his	CREST	sponsor	or	
voting	service	provider	takes)	such	
action	as	shall	be	necessary	to	ensure	
that	a	message	is	transmitted	by	
means	of	the	CREST	system	by	any	
particular	time.	In	this	connection,	
CREST	members	and,	where	
applicable,	their	CREST	sponsors	or	
voting	service	providers	are	referred,	
in	particular,	to	those	sections	of	the	
CREST	Manual	concerning	practical	
limitations	of	the	CREST	system	and	
timings.	The	CREST	Manual	can	be	
reviewed	at	www.euroclear.com.	
	 	 The	Company	may	treat	as	invalid	
a	CREST	Proxy	Instruction	in	the	
circumstances	set	out	in	Regulation	
35(5)(a)	of	the	Uncertificated	
Securities	Regulations	2001		
(as	amended).	
5.		 	 Pursuant	to	Regulation	41	of	the	
Uncertificated	Securities	Regulations	
2001	(as	amended),	only	shareholders	
registered	in	the	Register	of	Members	
of	the	Company	as	at	6	p.m.	on	
Wednesday	11	October	2017	shall	be	
entitled	to	attend	and	vote	at	the	
Meeting	in	respect	of	the	number	of	
ordinary	shares	registered	in	their	
name	at	such	time.	If	the	Meeting	is	
adjourned,	the	time	by	which	a	person	
must	be	entered	in	the	Register	of	
Members	of	the	Company	in	order	
to	have	the	right	to	attend	and	vote	
at	the	adjourned	meeting	is	6	p.m.	
on	the	date	which	is	two	days	before	
the	time	of	the	adjourned	meeting.	
Changes	to	the	Register	of	Members	
after	the	relevant	times	shall	be	
disregarded	in	determining	the	rights	
of	any	person	to	attend	and	vote	at	
the	Meeting.
6.	 	 In	the	case	of	joint	holders,	the	vote	
of	the	senior	who	tenders	a	vote	
whether	in	person	or	by	proxy	will	be	
accepted	to	the	exclusion	of	the	votes	
of	the	other	joint	holders	and	for	this	
purpose	seniority	will	be	determined	
by	the	order	in	which	the	names	stand	
in	the	Register	of	Members	of	the	
Company	in	respect	of	the	relevant	
joint	holdings.
7.	 	 A	corporate	shareholder	may	
authorise	a	person	to	act	as	its	
representative(s)	at	the	AGM.	In	
accordance	with	the	provisions	of	
the	Act,	each	such	representative	
may	exercise	(on	behalf	of	the	
corporation)	the	same	powers	as	
the	corporation	could	exercise	if	it	
were	an	individual	shareholder	of	the	
Company,	provided	that	they	do	not	
do	so	in	relation	to	the	same	shares.	It	
is	no	longer	necessary	to	nominate	a	
designated	corporate	representative.
