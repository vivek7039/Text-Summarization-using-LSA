Our Business
The Group is a global provider of event rental 
solutions with operations based in 14 depots in 
7 countries across the UK & Europe, ME&A, and US 
regions. 
We operate and manage the business on a regional 
basis and each of our three regional divisions have 
their own management teams and mix of physical 
inventory. 
We provide a full turnkey solution for our customers, 
starting with design and project management, moving 
to delivery and installation. 
We own the large majority of the physical assets which 
we deliver, construct and hand over to clients for their 
events. Our core assets are temporary structures, 
ranging from simple marquees to triple deck 
temporary buildings; temporary seats both indoor and 
outdoor; furniture; scaffolding and ice rinks. On certain 
projects we supplement our own assets with additional 
equipment, for example fencing or portacabins or 
temporary toilets to provide a full turnkey solution to 
the customer. 
The Arena Standard
An integral part of Arena Group’s value, and what 
has contributed to its longstanding history and 
relationships is our ‘Arena Standard’. The Group 
is renowned for delivering the “Arena Standard” of 
service across all regions, promising our customers 
a world class service and product delivery that is 
essential for a client base such as ours. 
Our Customers
We are fortunate to work with some of the best-known 
sports venues, sports organisations, sports clubs, 
cultural and exhibition businesses, brand owners and 
rights owners right across the globe. We focus on 
building strong, lasting relationships based on trust 
and event delivery. This has enabled us to foster long 
term relationships with our customers where we focus 
on becoming part of our clients’ planning and delivery 
teams. We refer to this approach as becoming part of 
our client’s DNA where we completely understand the 
needs of our clients enabling us to deliver at or above 
their expectations.
Employees
Coupled with an emphasis on delivering the ‘Arena 
Standard’ for all our customers we have worked with 
each regional team to create a “One Team” philosophy 
with shared values that include integrity, teamwork, a 
positive attitude, wellness and accountability. We are 
focused on delivering a sense of belonging to Arena 
Group, whether you are working in Kuala Lumpur or 
Milwaukee. This is important not only for our global 
team but also for our global customer base that 
expects that, as a Group, we deliver to the highest 
industry standards anywhere in the world. In the past 
year we have seen the physical manifestation of this 
philosophy with a number of senior employees moving 
to other regional divisions within the Group. 
We believe that this year, more than ever, we are 
beginning to see the benefits of this clear corporate 
philosophy as the business has seen more growth 
in each region than ever before. This is, of course, in 
large part to the commitment and professionalism 
of each and every one of the over 800 employees that 
work with us across our three regions. One of the 
guiding principles of a great business is that “people 
are the primary determinant of a business’s success”. 
We are fortunate that we have a great team of people 
that make what we do happen – and we are eternally 
grateful to each and every one of the Arena Team that 
deliver on this principle. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 7

Chairman’s Statement
Ken Hanna
Arena Group Chairman
The Arena Group listed on the 
AIM market on 25 July 2017 and I 
became Non-Executive Chairman 
on that date. The Board is currently 
made up of four directors, myself, 
Ian Metcalfe, who chairs the 
Remuneration Committee, and two 
Executive Directors. The Board will 
keep this composition under review. 
We have taken the decision as 
a Board, to adopt the highest 
standards of governance whilst 
ensuring the executive team 
continue to have the flexibility 
to manage the business without 
distraction or incurring excessive 
costs. 
There is no doubt that 2017 has 
been a successful first year 
as a public company, with the 
achievement of excellent financial 
results, successful delivery of 
several major contracts and the 
creation of a strong leadership 
team. 
The Board is pleased to recommend 
payment of a final dividend for the 
year ending 31 December 2017 
of 0.9 pence. This gives a total 
dividend for 2017 of 1.35 pence per 
share, subject to approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, on 24 May 
2018. The final dividend will be 
paid in July 2018 to shareholders 
of the Company on the Register of 
Members at the close of business 
on 8 June 2018.
The Group will continue to adopt 
the highest operational standards 
and to deliver the “Arena Standard” 
throughout its operations. We will 
also continue to explore value 
accretive acquisition opportunities 
in line with our stated strategy. 
Finally, I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my sincere 
thanks to all Arena employees for 
their hard work and dedication. In 
a very fragmented and competitive 
industry, the level of service and 
commitment demonstrated by our 
employees differentiates Arena 
from its competitors.

CEO’s Report
I am pleased to present the Group’s first 
Strategic Report to shareholders. 2017 was a 
year of excellent progress for the Group with 
the delivery of a number of key milestones 
that have laid the foundations for the future 
development of the business.
Introduction
The history of the Arena Group is a long one and the 
Company can trace its origins back over 250 years. 
There will, no doubt, have been a number of years 
where significant milestones were achieved during this 
long history, but I do not believe that any previous year 
can match the historic milestones that the Group has 
achieved this year. 
As milestones go, the listing of the Group on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange on 25 July 2017 
has to take pride of place. The Initial Public Offering 
(“IPO”) which raised £56 million, net of expenses, not 
only significantly reduced the Group’s net debt and 
strengthened our balance sheet but has also given us 
the shareholder base to support the value accretive 
acquisitions that are an integral part of the Group’s 
ambitious strategic plan. 
The listing also helped to raise our profile as a leading 
provider of event rental solutions delivering what we 
refer to as the “Arena Standard” wherever we are in 
the world. This standard is part of the Group’s unique 
value proposition and promises that we will deliver to 
the highest standards in our industry - from any of our 
14 bases spread across three regional divisions in the 
UK & Europe, Middle East & Asia, and the US. 
Results 
The Group delivered adjusted EBITDA of £10.6m 
(2016: £8.5m) and an adjusted net income of £4.0m 
(2016: £1.2m). The statutory operating profit was 
£0.3m (2016:£1.2m). The statutory loss before tax was 
£2.9m (2016: £3.6m), which includes £4.9m of costs 
considered to be exceptional or non-recurring, as well 
as the finance costs related to the high debt and loan 
note structure in place prior to the IPO. Given these 
one-off and exceptional costs, and to give a better 
understanding of the underlying performance of the 
business, we present adjusted EBITDA and adjusted 
net income. On this adjusted basis, 2017 was a record 
set of results, with the Group’s adjusted EBITDA of 
£10.6m – exceeding £10m for the first time in the 
Group’s history. 
These results are described in more detail in the 
financial review on page 19 including a reconciliation 
of adjusted numbers to statutory figures. Our results 
were achieved from our normal contracted and 
recurring customer revenues coupled with the addition 
of a number of new multi-year contracts and one-
off events as outlined in more detail in each of the 
regional CEO review sections on pages 24 and 29.
The most significant new multi-year contract win was 
in the US with the addition of a five year contract to 
deliver the three US PGA annual events, including the 
Men’s PGA Championship, which was held in 2017 in 
Quail Hollow, North Carolina. 
Industry Overview
The Global event rental sector is a highly fragmented 
and siloed (single product/service focused) industry. 
There are very few international organisations and 
typically businesses in the sector tend to be very 
single product focused. This landscape has not 
changed significantly during 2017 – with most industry 
transactions focused on increasing the size, rather 
than the product/service offerings, of the relevant 
company. 
A number of significant transactions were, however, 
completed in 2017. 
The main European transaction of note, was the 
acquisition of De Boer Structures by Losberger- 
creating the largest structures business in the world. 
This new group has, for the first time, seen the 
Greg Lawless

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
combination of a major structures manufacturer with a 
major structures rental business. This is a significant 
development as, traditionally, manufacture and rental 
businesses have remained distinctly separate.
In the US, the break-up of the former Classic Party 
Rentals business, based out of Los Angeles, has 
changed the landscape of the North American event 
rental sector. Classic was the largest single, event 
rental, business in the US with operations spread 
across more than ten locations from California to 
Florida. The disposal programme saw a number of 
different transactions with the largest transaction 
being the disposal of the Classic West Coast party 
rental business to Bright Rentals, based out of LA. This 
break-up has now eliminated the only truly national 
party and structures rental company in the US. This 
presents a significant opportunity for the development 
of the Arena business in the US as we outlined at the 
time of the listing.
Apart from these two major developments, the 
industry continues to see a good flow of acquisition 
activity in the smaller scale business units that operate 
within the sector. We continue to be active in this space 
as we look for value-accretive bolt on businesses that 
have the potential to enhance the performance of our 
existing business.
Growth Strategies
We outlined four key components of our strategic plan 
as part of the IPO process in 2017. 
These four components are designed to help us deliver 
not only top line revenue growth, but more importantly 
improvement in EBITDA margins that we believe will 
continue to create demonstrable shareholder value 
over the coming years. 
Geographic expansion
• Future geographic expansion will be initially 
focused on the US where the Group currently has 
approximately one per cent market share, and 
a predominantly Upper Midwest and East Coast 
presence. An improved presence on the West Coast 
would bolster the business’s national tenting reach 
and allow the servicing of national customers across 
the entire North American continent on a more 
economic basis.
Product Extension
• We intend to replicate our UK multi-product offering 
in other parts of the Group. 
• We will continue to review and expand our product 
range and service capabilities in all regions to 
ensure we are providing as broad a product offering 
as possible to our customers in each region.
• The April 2017 acquisition of Wernick Events, a 
seating and mass participation business based in 
Coventry, is a good example of this. This acquisition 
added some 24,000 tiered seats to our existing stock 
of 76,000, but also allowed us to enter the fast-
growing mass participation sports market in the UK 
where we now deliver over 300 events each year for 
Cancer Research UK and other event organisers.
Reduction of seasonality
• Our business by its nature is seasonal in each 
region. This means that typically each region suffers 
losses in the slow season. 
• We plan to continue to expand into complementary 
markets to extend the season in each region, thus 
improving asset and labour utilisation.
• The expansion of our temporary ice rink business 
in the UK is a good example of this, where we now 
deliver 30 temporary ice rinks over the winter 
season including venues such as the Tower of 
London, Hampton Court, Canary Wharf and 
Liverpool. The Group is now EBITDA profitable 
nine months out of twelve and our objective is to 
ultimately have positive EBITDA every month of the 
year as a consequence of this strategic component.
Vertical Integration / manufacturing of temporary 
structures 
• The Group already has two small manufacturing 
facilities, one in Malaysia and the other in the US. 
• These units manufacture certain parts and 
bespoke products for a number of unique client 
requirements. 
• Given the importance of being able to offer bespoke, 
innovative and cost effective product solutions to 
our customers we will look to add to these existing 
manufacturing facilities in order to continue 
providing our customers with state-of-the-art 
solutions across our regional divisions. ARENA GROUP

CEO’s Report Continued
Acquisitions
I am pleased to report that we have, since the year end, 
made progress in a number of these areas with two 
acquisitions, each of which will contribute to the future 
growth of the Group.
Our first acquisition since the IPO was GLD 
Productions, a specialist provider of furniture into 
the music and event sectors, based in the UK. The 
deal was announced on the 2nd February 2018. This 
business has now been successfully integrated into our 
Spaceworks Furniture Hire unit in Membury and we 
believe will be a valuable addition to our UK & Europe 
Division.
We have also agreed the acquisition of Ironmonger 
Events in Hong Kong, a business operated and partly 
owned by the vendor of the structures business we 
acquired in Hong Kong two years ago. This transaction 
will allow us to offer a complete end-to-end event 
solutions business in this dynamic part of the world.
We continue to evaluate a number of other acquisitions 
and we are confident that we will have a number of 
additional acquisitions to announce before the end of 
2018.
United States Attorney’s Office investigation of Arena 
Americas
On 29 March 2018 we notified the market that our 
US subsidiary, Arena Event Services Inc (“Arena 
Americas”), had been informed by the US Attorney’s 
Office (“USAO”) that it had formally charged one of 
Arena Americas previous customers for a violation 
related to the Small Business set-aside program for 
business conducted between 2007 and 2017. 
As a result of this, Arena Americas was notified by the 
USAO that it has launched an investigation into Arena 
America’s relationship with this customer.  Since 2013, 
when Arena acquired the Americas business, total 
revenue generated from contracts with this customer 
has been $4m with EBITDA of approximately $0.5m.  
Based on other similar cases, fines of up to two times 
revenues or profits have been imposed, implying a 
possible range of fines between $1m and $8m.  Due 
to the level of uncertainty over the outcome, the 
Group has not made any provision for future costs 
in the annual financial statements related to this 
investigation.
We continue to pro actively engage with the USAO 
in order to draw this matter to a conclusion as soon 
as possible.  However, at this date, we are not in a 
position to finalise this matter with the USAO.   We 
hope to have further news within the next few months 
and will update the market accordingly.
Looking Ahead
We are pleased to have delivered a strong set of 
inaugural results, post IPO, in 2017. These results, 
on an adjusted basis, represent a significant increase 
over our adjusted 2016 numbers and were, in the main, 
delivered by strong organic growth.
We have started 2018 with the delivery of two value 
accretive acquisitions, a strong pipeline of future 
acquisitions, combined with a healthy first quarter 
trading. We remain confident that we can continue to 
grow the business organically and by way of acquisition 
over the next few years as we continue to leverage our 
new-found Plc status.

Revenue
Revenue in the year to 31 December 2017 grew by 18% 
from £93.2m to £109.6m. Revenue grew in all regions, 
with particularly strong organic revenue growth in the 
US, with the winning and delivery of three events for 
the US PGA adding some £5m of incremental revenue 
in 2017. The main PGA championship delivered higher 
than typical revenue in 2017 due to the location of the 
event and the type of product supplied, which will not 
be repeated in 2018. 
In the Middle East & Asia region revenue grew by £4m, 
with the project for the Dubai World Trade Centre 
generating significant, but one off, sales revenue in 
the year. Finally, in the UK there was revenue growth 
of some £6m, the major factors being a full year of 
scaffolding revenue from the RIM acquisition in late 
2016 and revenue from the Wernick Events seating and 
mass participation sports business acquired on 1 April 
2017.
Gross Margin and Operating expenses
Gross profit margin improved by 1.1% to 32.5% due to 
a focus on operational efficiencies and targeted capital 
expenditure to reduce the need to hire in equipment for 
certain projects. 
Operating expenses, excluding exceptional costs, 
depreciation, amortisation and share option charge, 
grew by £4.2m with additional overheads of the 
acquired Wernick business, the RIM scaffolding 
business (acquired in late 2016) and investment in 
permanent staff in all regions to manage the higher 
level of revenue and gross margin. In addition, from 
July 2017, additional costs were incurred post IPO for 
items such as Non-executive director fees, Nomad, 
registrar and Financial PR costs.
Exceptional Costs
The exceptional costs of £4.9m are set out in more 
detail in note 4 to the accounts, and primarily comprise 
costs incurred related to the IPO in July 2017; the 
finalisation of the restructuring programmes that 
started in 2016 in both the UK and the North East 
region of the US; and legal costs and a doubtful debt 
provision made in the US in relation to the legal matter 
described in the CEO report.
Finance Expenses
Finance costs comprise three main components; 
interest incurred on bank borrowings and finance

leases of £1.4m; interest accrued on loan notes in 
place prior to the IPO of £1.1m (these costs ceased 
from 30 June 2017); and thirdly, the amortisation of 
bank loan and loan note arrangement costs incurred 
both in the year and in previous years of £0.7m, which 
are being amortised over the expected period of the 
facilities. To calculate an adjusted net income figure 
the non-recurring loan note costs and the amortisation 
of arrangement costs have been added back as well as 
an adjustment for the level of pre IPO bank interest, so 
that only normalised bank and finance lease interest is 
included in the adjusted net income figure.
Tax
The tax charge is low both in relative and absolute 
terms in 2016 and 2017 due to a combination of factors, 
including tax free operations in Dubai; no corporation 
tax charge in the US due to tax deductions for fixed 
asset purchases; and high bank interest charges prior 
to the IPO. 
Going forward we expect the tax charge to increase 
modestly but remain lower than the standard UK tax 
rate due a number of factors including the portion 
of profits generated in Dubai, carried forward 
net operating losses in the US and the continued 
availability of significant US tax allowances for capital 
expenditure.
Earnings per share and Dividend
The actual earnings per share in 2017 was negative 
due to exceptional and IPO related costs as well as the 
high level of pre IPO finance costs described above. 
Using an adjusted earnings figure, shown in the table 
below, and the year end number of shares for the full 
year period, the adjusted basic earnings per share 
figure was 3.5 pence.

ADJUSTED EARNINGS 4.0 1.2
No. of shares (m) 114.6 114.6
ADJUSTED BASIC EARNINGS PER 
SHARE (PENCE)

As stated at the time of the IPO we intend to adopt 
a balanced approach to retaining capital for future 
growth opportunities and a progressive, but measured, 
dividend payment. An interim dividend of 0.45 pence 
per share was declared in September 2017; and the 
recommended final dividend is 0.9 pence per share. 
This will bring the total dividend to 1.35 pence per 
share for the 2017 year.
Acquisition
On 1 April 2017 the Group acquired certain business 
and assets from Wernick Events Ltd, comprising of the 
temporary seating business and the mass participation 
sports division, both based near Coventry. Total cash 
consideration for the acquisition was £2.1m.
Debt and Cash Position
At the year end the Group had total bank debt between 
the UK and US of £15.8m and total cash balances 
of £4.3m, to give a year end net bank debt figure of 
£11.5m. The Group has committed bank facilities in 
the US and UK, described in more detail in note 20 to 
the accounts. Subsequent to the year end, the Group 
secured an additional £5m committed facility from 
HSBC to fund small acquisitions.
Working Capital 
The Group had total working capital at 31 December 
2017 of £(0.1)m, compared to £(0.5)m at the previous 
year end. The Group typically operates with a negative 
or close to nil working capital position as a significant 
proportion of customer receipts are invoiced and 
collected ahead of the event date.
Capital Expenditure
Total capital expenditure in 2017 was £6.7m, of 
which £4m was maintenance capital expenditure to 
keep our existing level of rental and other inventory 
up to the standard required to service our existing 
customer and contract base. The balance of £2.7m 
was growth capital expenditure required to support 
additional revenue and margin from new contracts and 
opportunities identified during the year. The largest 
portion of this growth capital expenditure in 2017 was 
in the US and incurred in relation to the new five year 
US PGA contract that generated incremental revenue 
of over £5m in 2017; and in the UK for the purchase 
of a new style of structure (the I-Novation) which was 
used at a number of events in the year and reduced our 
requirement to hire structures from other companies, 
thereby also increasing our gross margin.

Alternative Performance Measures
The Group uses alternative performance measures 
such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share 
and adjusted ROCE (as defined below), to allow the 
users of the financial statements to gain a clearer 
understanding of the underlying performance of the 
business. By presenting these measures in addition 
to the statutory figures, the impact of items such as 
restructuring and reorganisation costs, acquisition 
costs and the costs related to the IPO and the pre-
IPO debt structure of the Group, can be identified 
separately.
Performance Indicators 
The Group monitors a number of key performance 
indicators (“KPIs”) which are reviewed at divisional and 
Board level. The main KPIs reviewed are summarised 
in the table and described in more detail below.
KPIs
Year ended 
31 December 
2017
Year ended 
31 December 
2016
Adjusted EBITDA as a % of revenue 9.8% 9.1%
Adjusted Earnings per share (pence) 3.5 1.0
ROCE % 8.3% 4.2%
Net bank debt to Adjusted EBITDA 1.1x 3.5x
Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue is 
calculated as adjusted EBITDA (excluding exceptional 
costs and share option expense) as a percentage of 
total gross revenue.
Adjusted Earnings per share is the adjusted Group net 
income figure, divided by the average total number of 
shares in issue for the year. In the table above and due 
to the IPO in July 2017, the 31 December 2017 number 
of shares in issue has been used for both periods.
ROCE is calculated as the ratio of adjusted operating 
profit (being adjusted EBITDA less depreciation and 
amortisation) divided by average capital employed 
for the year. Capital employed is defined as the net 
book value of fixed assets, plus goodwill, plus working 
capital.
Net bank debt to adjusted EBITDA is the ratio of gross 
bank debt less cash at year end to the adjusted EBITDA 
figure for the year.
The Directors are satisfied with each of these 
measures in 2017.

Principal Risks, Controls and Mitigation 
Risks are reviewed annually by the Board and appropriate procedures put in place to monitor and mitigate them. 
The main risks identified by the Board and the related controls and mitigation strategies are set out below. 
RISKS CONTROLS AND MITIGATION 
Health and safety
The installation of temporary structures is complex 
and may require working at height. The Group has 
an excellent health and safety record, however, 
an employee incident relating to the use of Group 
equipment could have a detrimental effect on the 
future reputation and performance of the Group.
The Group has a stated commitment to, and a 
reputation for, rigorous health and safety compliance. 
There is a global H&S committee that reviews 
H&S practices and ensures best practice is shared 
between each region.
There are nominated Health & Safety managers in 
each business and regular reporting of any safety 
incidents to the Board each month.
Dependence on key individuals / management
Arena’s future success is substantially dependent on 
a relatively small number of people and the Directors 
therefore view the continued service of certain of 
its Directors, senior management and other key 
personnel as important. 
The Directors are taking steps to ensure that 
knowledge, skills and expertise are shared so as 
to avoid the Group being unduly dependent on 
individuals.
The Board has requested that succession plans be 
developed for key individuals and will review these 
plans in 2018.
Equipment failure
Due to the nature of the business, a catastrophic 
failure of equipment could lead to serious injury or 
loss of life. The repercussions of any such incident 
would almost certainly affect the Group’s ability 
to win or retain business in the local geography 
and internationally, across all sectors in which 
Arena operate. In addition, the Group would likely 
incur significant associated costs that could be 
sizeable and have a material impact on the Group’s 
profitability going forward. 
The Group has a rigorous safety culture to ensure all 
temporary structures are constructed to appropriate 
standards, with third party sign off where relevant.
All temporary structures acquired are designed 
and certified to meet all engineering and safety 
specifications.
Continuous training is provided in safety measures 
and precautions for warehouse and construction staff. 
Reduction in quality of service could have a negative 
impact on reputation
The strength of the Arena brand and the Group’s 
ability to deliver iconic, reliable events is fundamental 
to the Group’s success in winning new business. 
As the Group expands internationally and acquires 
businesses it becomes more challenging to ensure a 
consistent quality of product and service.
To manage this risk the Group develops integration 
plans for any acquired businesses and actively 
promotes the ‘Arena Standard’ to all existing and new 
employees.
Intra-company movements of staff is encouraged, 
enabling senior staff to lend their skills & experience 
to more developing divisions. 23
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
RISKS CONTROLS AND MITIGATION 
Competition 
The event rental industry is highly competitive, and 
the Group regularly comes under pricing pressure 
from competitors. On occasion the Group will there-
fore lose work to a competitor that has a different 
offering, usually priced at a discount to the Arena 
service. Competitive pricing pressure can therefore 
lead to a loss of revenue and margin and could have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial 
performance. 
The Group typically differentiates itself from its 
competitors on quality of service and product and 
does not compete purely on price. 
To mitigate this risk however, the Group focuses 
on securing three to five year contracts with key 
customers for annual events where possible and 
building strong relationships with regular customers 
and event organisers. 
Ability to recruit and retain personnel
As the Group grows it will need to continue hiring 
staff, with a mix of experience in temporary struc-
ture construction and other related skills both in the 
field and office based roles. Any future challenges to 
the recruitment or retention process could have an 
impact on the Group’s ability to take on new business 
or to service existing contracts. 
In the UK, the Group has considered the potential 
impact of Brexit on the ability to hire and retain staff 
for the UK business.
The Group has put in place appropriate recruitment 
and training programmes in each region to source 
and then train employees.
Divisions anticipate and allow adequate time for 
recruiting for temporary positions during the busy 
season – ensuring sufficient training in health & 
safety. 
As noted above the Group has a policy in the UK of 
hiring and training staff required by the business over 
the full year . As the business becomes less seasonal, 
there is no significant reliance upon short term 
European seasonal workers and as such the Group 
considers that there is no material risk from Brexit. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 24

UK & Europe
Introduction
Arena UK & Europe moved into its new six-acre 
state-of-the-art site in April 2017, with 3,700sqm of 
warehouse space and modern offices over two storeys, 
providing a centralised operations base servicing 
structures, seating, interior design, carpentry and 
ice rinks. Having such an impressive base for our 
operations has delivered greater efficiencies, better 
serving the Group’s operations and providing new 
employment and career progression for our people. 
The move into the new St Ives hub was backed up with 
the creation of a new sales and project management 
office in Membury and a huge centralised furniture 
warehouse supporting our UK events and the Group’s 
London tableware operation, Well Dressed Tables. 
The floatation and subsequent investment into 
infrastructure has underpinned our acquisition of GLD 
Productions, adding experienced staff, new product 
ranges and new clients to our furniture hire division. 
The sheer scale of our inventory of events equipment 
is staggering, and was boosted by the purchase of the 
seating and mass participation divisions of Wernick 
Events, including more than 30,000 temporary seats, 
back in the spring.
Outlook for 2018
2018 looks set to be an even bigger year. We have 
renewed many of our long-term contracts and have 
a number of fantastic new projects providing a whole 
set of exciting challenges for our delivery teams. It’s 
a Ryder Cup year, and we will once again be heavily 
involved delivering event infrastructure in Paris. Our 
special projects team is also focussed on Tokyo for 
Rugby World Cup and Olympic related opportunities.  
I am pleased to be able to confirm over £3 million 
of capital investment to ensure that our products 
continually exceed expectations on quality. As always, 
we ensure that health and safety is at the centre of 
everything we do.

Corporate Governance Statement
The Directors recognise the importance of sound 
corporate governance. Although compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code is not compulsory for 
AIM quoted companies, and the Group does not formally 
comply with the Code, it has voluntarily chosen to apply 
certain principles of the Code, as set out below, to the 
extent considered appropriate and practicable for a 
company of our nature and size. 
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively 
responsible for the long term 
success of the Group. It provides 
leadership, sets Group strategy, 
upholds the Group’s culture and 
values, reviews management 
performance and ensures that the 
Group’s obligations to shareholders 
are understood and met.
Board Composition and 
effectiveness
The Board comprises four Directors 
of which two are executives and 
two non-executives, reflecting 
a blend of different experience 
and backgrounds. The skills and 
experience of the Board are set 
out in their biographical details 
in the Board of Directors section. 
The experience and knowledge 
of each of the Directors gives 
them the ability to constructively 
challenge strategy and to scrutinise 
performance. The Board considers 
both of the non-executives to be 
independent. 
Board Meetings
The Board meets regularly to 
review, formulate and approve the 
Group’s strategy, budgets, and 
corporate actions and oversee 
the Group’s progress towards its 
goals. The Board also receives 
each month a Board pack including 
the Group’s internal management 
accounts and a report from the 
CEO and Finance Director. The 
Company Secretary compiles the 
Board and Committee papers which 
are circulated to Directors at least 
48 hours prior to meetings. The 
Company Secretary then provides 
minutes of each meeting and every 
Director is aware of the right to 
have any concerns minuted. 
Since the appointment of the Board 
in July 2017, there were three 
Board meetings held in 2017 and all 
Directors attended each meeting. In 
a full year it is the intention of the 
Board to meet at least six times per 
year, with additional meetings as 
required.
Matters reserved for the Board
Certain matters are reserved for 
approval by the Board. These include: 
• Strategy and business plans 
including annual budget 
• Acquisitions and disposals of 
businesses 
• Share capital and dividends 
• Board membership and 
delegation of authority 
• Remuneration and employment 
benefits for senior management
• Corporate statutory reporting 
• Appointment of auditors 
• New debt facilities 
• Corporate governance, policy 
approval, internal control and

expenditure, commercial contracts, 
litigation and treasury.  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 37
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Management and Internal 
Controls
The Board has ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. 
However, any such system of 
internal control can provide only 
reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Board 
considers that the internal controls 
in place are appropriate for the 
size, complexity and risk profile of 
the Group. The principal elements 
of the Group’s internal control 
system include:
• Day to day management of the 
activities of the Group by the 
executive directors 
• A detailed annual budget is 
prepared including an integrated 
profit and loss, balance sheet 
and cash flow. The budget is 
approved by the Board. 
• Monthly reporting of 
performance against the budget 
is prepared and reviewed by the 
Board. 
• A schedule of delegated 
authority is maintained which 
defines levels of approval 
authority over such items as 
capital expenditure, commercial 
contracts, litigation and treasury 
matters.
An assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, the controls 
and mitigation strategies for each, 
is set out in the Risk review 
Board Committees
In accordance with best practice, 
the Company has established audit 
and remuneration committees 
with formally delegated duties and 
responsibilities and with written 
terms of reference. A report from 
each committee is included in this 
set of Report and Accounts. From 
time to time separate committees 
may be set up by the Board to 
consider specific issues when the 
need arises.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired 
by Ken Hanna, who is a Chartered 
Accountant, and also includes Ian 
Metcalfe. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for monitoring the 
integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements, reviewing significant 
financial reporting issues and 
monitoring the quality of internal 
controls and risk management. It 
is also responsible for overseeing 
the relationship with the Group’s 
external auditor and reviewing 
reports from the auditors relating 
to the annual accounts. The Audit 
Committee will meet not less than 
twice in each financial year and 
will have unrestricted access to the 
external auditors. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee 
is chaired by Ian Metcalfe and 
also includes Ken Hanna. The 
Remuneration Committee 
reviews the performance of the 
executive directors and makes 
recommendations to the Board 
on matters relating to their 
remuneration and terms of service. 
The Remuneration Committee 
will also make recommendations 
to the Board on proposals for the 
granting of share options and 
other equity incentives pursuant 
to any employee share option 
scheme or equity incentive plans 
in operation from time to time. The 
Remuneration Committee will meet 
not less than twice in each financial 
year.
Share Dealing Code
The Company has adopted a share 
dealing code for Directors and 
other applicable employees. The 
Group also has adopted an anti-
bribery policy and whistleblowing 
polices which are included in each 
employee’s staff handbook.
Relations with Shareholders
The Group intends to maintain 
communication with institutional 
shareholders through individual 
meetings with Executive Directors, 
particularly following publication 
of the Group’s interim and full 
year preliminary results. Private 
shareholders are encouraged to 
attend the Annual General Meeting 
at which the Group’s activities 
will be considered and questions 
answered. General information 
about the Group is also available on 
the Group’s website. This includes 
an overview of activities of the 
Group and details of all recent 
Group announcements.

Audit Committee Report
Members of the Audit Committee
The Committee consists of two 
independent non-executive 
directors, Ken Hanna (as Chair) 
and Ian Metcalfe, whose details 
and qualifications are set out in 
the Board of Directors section. 
The Committee met once in the 
period between the IPO in July 2017 
and the year end at which both 
members were present. 
Duties
The main items of business 
considered by the Audit Committee 
included: 
• review of the FY17 audit plan; 
• consideration of key audit 
matters and how they are 
addressed; 
• review of suitability of the 
external auditor; 
• review of the financial 
statements and Annual Report; 
• consideration of the external 
audit report; 
• going concern and viability 
statement review; 
• review of the risk management 
and internal control systems; 
and
• meeting with the external auditor
Role of the external auditor 
The Audit Committee monitors 
the relationship with the external 
auditor, Deloitte LLP, to ensure 
that auditor independence and 
objectivity are maintained. 
Deloitte LLP were appointed in 
2013, following an audit tender 
process; and Jonathan Dodworth 
the current audit partner has held 
this role since the 2016 audit. The 
Committee will keep under review 
the need for an external audit 
tender. 
As part of its review the Committee 
monitors the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor, 
however, no formal policy exists. 
The breakdown of fees between 
audit and non-audit services is 
provided in Note 4 of the Group’s 
financial statements. 
The non-audit fees primarily relate 
to on going tax advice and tax 
compliance work for the Group 
and non recurring work provided in 
relation to the IPO in July 2017. The 
Deloitte work for the IPO included 
tax advice and reporting on the 
historical financial information in 
the Admission document. Deloitte 
was chosen for this work for cost 
and efficiency reasons given their 
prior knowledge of the business.
The Audit Committee also assesses 
the auditor’s performance. 
Having reviewed the auditor’s 
independence and performance, 
the Audit Committee recommends 
that Deloitte LLP be reappointed 
as the Group’s auditor at the next 
AGM, to be held on 24th May. 
Audit process
The auditor prepares an audit 
plan for the review of the financial 
statements. The audit plan sets 
out the scope of the audit, areas 
to be targeted and audit timetable. 
This plan is reviewed and agreed in 
advance by the Audit Committee. 
Following the audit, the auditor 
presented its findings to the 
Audit Committee for discussion. 
Significant issues considered this 
year, included accounting for the 
IPO transaction, valuation of the 
rental assets and the carrying 
value of goodwill. No major areas 
of concern were highlighted by the 
auditor during the period.
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee Report for the period 
ended 31 December 2017. The Audit Committee is primarily 
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group 
is properly reported and reviewed. Its role also includes monitoring 
the integrity of the financial statements, reviewing internal control 
and risk management systems, reviewing key accounting policies 
and advising on the appointment of external auditors. The Terms of 
Reference for the Committee were agreed at the time of the IPO and 
are available from the Group’s registered office.  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 39
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Internal Audit
At present the Group does not 
have an internal audit function 
and the Committee believes that 
management is able to derive 
assurance as to the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal controls 
and risk management procedures 
without one. This decision will be 
reviewed each year.
Risk management and internal 
controls
As described in the corporate 
governance report, the Group has 
established a framework of internal 
control systems, policies and 
procedures. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for reviewing the 
risk management and internal 
control framework and ensuring 
that it operates effectively. During 
the period, the Committee has 
reviewed the principal risks, 
controls and mitigating actions; and 
the Committee is satisfied that the 
internal control systems in place 
are currently operating effectively. 
Whistle blowing
The Group has in place a 
whistleblowing policy which sets 
out the formal process by which 
an employee of the Group may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial 
reporting or other matters. 
Whistleblowing is a standing item 
on the Committee’s agenda. The 
Committee is comfortable that 
the current policy is operating 
effectively. 
Anti-bribery
The Group has in place an anti-
bribery and anti-corruption policy 
which sets out its zero-tolerance 
position and provides information 
and guidance to those working for 
the Group on how to recognise and 
deal with bribery and corruption 
issues. The Committee is 
comfortable that the current policy 
is operating effectively.
Annual Report and Accounts
Having taken all the matters 
considered by the Committee 
and brought to the attention of 
the Board during the year into 
account, we are satisfied that the 
annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable.
The Board believes that the 
disclosures set out on pages 54 
to 96 of the annual report provide 
the information necessary for 
shareholders to fairly assess 
the company’s position and 
performance, business model and 
strategy.

Remuneration Committee Report
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee was created on Admission of the Company to AIM in July 2017. It is chaired by Ian 
Metcalfe and also includes Ken Hanna. The Terms of Reference for the Committee were agreed at the time of the 
IPO and are available from the Group’s registered office. The Committee met once in the period between the IPO 
in July 2017 and the year end, at which both members were present. The Company is listed on the AIM market of 
the London Stock Exchange and, as such, the following disclosures are prepared on a voluntary basis.
Executive directors remuneration
The executive directors remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate directors of the 
highest calibre and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the 
executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is determined by the committee.
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior managers
Basic salary and benefits
Base salary, benefits in kind and company pension contribution are determined by the committee with 
reference to the experience and responsibilities of each individual and having regard to prevailing market 
conditions.
Annual Performance related bonus
Each executive director has an agreed bonus plan for the financial year, with total bonus payment linked 
to a combination of company financial targets and personal performance objectives. In 2017 the maximum 
bonus payable to the executive directors was 50% of base salary. In 2018 the maximum bonus payable to the 
executive directors will be 60% of base salary
Share Options
A Group share option scheme is in place as described in further detail below and the share options issued 
on admission to AIM are set out in the table below.
Directors service contracts
On admission to AIM in July 2017, the executive directors signed new service contracts with a rolling notice 
period of twelve months to be given by either party.
The non-executive directors have appointment letters with a notice period of three months if given by the director 
and one month if given by the Company.

and the related balance owing to the company waived. Under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act of 1992 the total 
deemed value of this waiver, using an unrestricted market value for the shares, was calculated to be £143,969.
Highest Paid Director
Taking into account the remuneration set out in the table above, the value of the one-off Employee Shareholder 
Incentive Scheme and the one off deemed value of the waiver of nil paid and partly paid shares as part of the pre 
IPO reorganisation, P Wilson was, on this basis, considered to be the highest paid director in the year.

Group and held by G Lawless. G Lawless used the proceeds of such sale to subscribe for 2,513,541 new ordinary 
shares of 1p each issued by the Company. As a result, G Lawless now has a total beneficial holding of 6,640,755 
ordinary shares in the Company, representing 5.7% of the Company’s issued share capital.
Group share option scheme (“the Scheme”)
As described above the Executive directors have been granted options under the Scheme set up on Admission to 
AIM in July 2017. Further details of the Scheme are set out below.
The Scheme allows for options to be issued over ordinary shares, up to a maximum of 10% of the Company’s 
ordinary shares in issue at the time of grant, over a ten year period.
The option exercise price will usually be the mid market price of the shares on the date of grant. Total options 
were issued at Admission equal to approximately 4.6% of the number of ordinary shares in issue, with an 
exercise price of 55 pence. These initial option awards have no performance conditions and vest equally after 
two, three and four years from the date of grant. 
It is intended that future option awards will have performance conditions, to be determined at the time of issue, 
and vest equally over three, four and five years from the date of award.
Customary malus and clawback provisions apply to all awards.

Directors’ Report
Review of Business 
The Chief Executive’s review provides a review 
of the business, the Group’s trading for the year 
to 31 December 2017 and an indication of future 
developments.
Dividends 
The Company declared an interim dividend for the 2017 
year on 25 September 2017 of 0.45 pence per share, 
which was paid 3 November 2017. 
The Directors have recommended a final dividend for 
the year ended 31 December 2107 of 0.9 pence per 
share, subject to the approval of shareholders at the 
AGM, payable to those shareholders on the register on 
8 June 2018. This will bring the total dividend for 2017 
to 1.35 pence per share.
Going concern
Based on the overall strength of the Group’s balance 
sheet, including the availability of committed but 
undrawn banking facilities with expiry dates not before 
December 2019; and together with a review of its 
forecast future operating budgets and forecasts, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. This review of 
future operating budgets and forecasts included 
certain reasonable downside scenarios and confirmed 
that even in the case of such downside scenarios the 
Group could continue to operate and comply with all 
covenants in our banking facilities. Accordingly, the 
Directors have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.
Financial risk management (Financial instruments) 
The Group adopts a prudent approach to financial 
risk management, with an appropriate level of debt 
facilities and prepares weekly cash forecasts to provide 
visibility of cash and facility usage. The two main 
financial risks are considered to be:
Credit risk
The Group sets credit limits for all new customers 
granted credit. The Group generally contracts 
with clients with a strong financial strength, and 
credit risk is also mitigated by ensuring that a 
significant proportion of a contract’s value is 
collected before the handover of the project to the 
client. 
Interest rate risk
Since the IPO the Group has far less exposure to 
interest rate risk due to the lower level of total 
bank debt. Bank interest is charged at a fixed 
margin to LIBOR which has been agreed as part 
of the current financing arrangements. Changes 
in LIBOR will have an effect on interest expense 
and cash flows however, this is minimised by 
monitoring interest expense requirements 
against available cash flows and operating within 
agreed cash facilities
Branches outside the UK
The Group has overseas subsidiaries as listed in 
Note 12 and a branch in South Korea.
Directors 
The Directors of the Company who were in office 
during the year and up to the date of signing the 
financial statements were as follows:
G Lawless  
P Wilson  
K Hanna 
I Metcalfe
Details of each director’s interest in the company and 
remuneration details are provided in the Remuneration 
Committee Report.
Directors’ qualifying third party indemnity provision 
(Insurance)
Arena Events Group plc has indemnified, by means 
of directors and officers liability insurance, the 
directors of the company against liability in respect of 
proceedings brought by third parties, subject to the 
conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006. Such 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions were in 
force during the year and are in force as at the date of 
approving the directors’ report.
Material Interests
So far as the Board is aware, no director had any 
material interest in a contract of significance (other 
than their service contract) with the company or any of 
its subsidiary companies during the period.
Political contributions
No political contributions or donations were made 
during the year. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 43

Subsequent Events
Details of events that have occurred after the balance

are also set out below:
Purchase of loan notes and interest
On 5 January 2018 the Company exercised its call 
option to acquire all the remaining loan notes 
issued by the Group, held by G Lawless, CEO, 
and Gaitsford Investments Limited (a company 
owned and controlled by G Lawless) (“Gaitsford”). 
G Lawless and Gaitsford each used the proceeds 
of such sale to subscribe for an aggregate of 
2,513,541 new ordinary shares of 1p each issued 
by the Company. 
The new shares commenced trading on 
11 January 2018 and from that date the total 
number of shares in issue and total voting 
rights was 117,153,481. As a result of these 
transactions, G Lawless has a total beneficial 
holding of 6,640,755 ordinary shares in the 
Company, representing 5.7% of the Company’s 
issued share capital. 
Amendment of HSBC Banking Facilities 
On 12 January 2018 the Group agreed an 
amendment to the Group’s non-US banking 
facilities with HSBC Bank to reduce the interest 
margin on its main facilities to between 1.5% 
and 2.5% depending on the level of leverage. An 
additional acquisition facility of £5m was secured, 
available to be drawn down until January 2019 
on the same terms as the existing facilities 
described in Note 20 to the accounts.
Acquisition of the GLD Productions Ltd business
On 1 February 2018 the Group acquired the 
business and assets of GLD Productions Ltd for 
total expected consideration of £0.9 million. GLD 
supplies furniture to concerts, music festivals, 
fashion shows, sporting occasions and corporate 
hospitality events across the UK. GLD’s stock 
and staff have been incorporated into Arena’s 
Spaceworks Furniture Hire division at its Membury 
facility. This acquisition is expected to add 
approximately £1.5m in annual revenue in 2018.
US Legal matter
Arena Event Services Inc (“Arena Americas”) was 
notified by the US Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) in March 
2018, that it has launched an investigation into Arena 
America’s relationship with a previous customer. 
This customer, we were informed by the USAO, has 
formally been charged for a violation related to the 
Small Business set-aside program for business 
conducted between 2007 and 2017. Since 2013, when 
Arena acquired the Americas business, total revenue 
generated from contracts with this customer has been 
$4m with EBITDA of approximately $0.5m. Based on 
other similar cases, fines of up to 2 times revenues or 
profits have been imposed, implying a possible range 
of fines between $1m and $8m. We continue to pro-
actively engage with the USAO in order to draw this 
matter to a conclusion as soon as possible. However, 
as this date, we are not in a position to finalise this 
matter with the USAO.  ARENA GROUP

Directors’ Report continued
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the 
involvement of its employees and keeps them informed 
on all aspects of the business and its progress, which 
the directors consider to be relevant. Communication 
is effected through regular internal newsletters and 
an annual employee survey is undertaken to better 
understand any employee concerns or suggestions to 
improve our employment practices. 
Disabled employees
The Group is committed to employment policies which 
follow best practice, based on equal opportunities 
for all employees, irrespective of sex, race, colour, 
disability or marital status. The Group gives full and 
fair consideration to applications for employment from 
disabled persons, having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities. Appropriate arrangements 
are made for the continued employment and training, 
career development and promotion of disabled persons 
employed by the Group. If members of staff become 
disabled the Group continues employment, either in 
the same or an alternative position, with appropriate 
retraining being given if necessary. 
Equal opportunities
It is Group policy and practice that selection for 
employment and promotion is based on the objective 
assessment of ability and experience, free from 
discrimination on any grounds.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Given that the Company was only incorporated during 
the year it has not been possible or practical to collect 
any meaningful data with regard to greenhouse gas 
emissions from the groups operating units. However, 
the Group looks to minimise any greenhouse gas 
emissions where possible and further information is 
included in the CSR report. GGE data will be collected 
where possible in 2018 and reported in the 2018 report 
and accounts.
Viability Statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group 
over a three year period, taking account of the Group’s 
current position and prospects, its strategic plan and 
the principal risks and how these are managed. Based 
on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
this period. 
In making this assessment, the Directors have 
considered the resilience of the Group in severe but 
plausible scenarios, taking into account the principal 
risks facing the Group as detailed in the Risk and 
Mitigation report and the effectiveness of any mitigating 
actions. The Directors’ assessment considered the 
potential impacts of these scenarios, both individually 
and in combination, on the Group’s business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity over the 
period. Sensitivity analysis was also used to stress test 
the Group’s strategic plan and to confirm that sufficient 
headroom would remain available under the Group’s 
credit facilities. The Directors consider that under each 
of these scenarios, the mitigating actions would be 
effective and sufficient to ensure the continued viability 
of the Group.
The Directors believe that three years is an appropriate 
period for this assessment, reflecting the nature of the 
Group’s contract base; key markets; and the nature of 
its businesses and products.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of 
approval of this report confirms that:
• so far as the Directors are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditor is 
unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
This information is given, and should be interpreted, 
in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has indicated their willingness to be 
reappointed for another term and a resolution to 
reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting.

Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and have also chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
company and of the profit or loss of the company for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; 
and
• make an assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
loss of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as 
a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Board of Directors on 10 April 2018 and is signed on its

Independent Auditor’s Report to the  
Members of Arena Events Group PLC  
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of Arena Events Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the ‘group’) which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
• the consolidated and parent company cash flow statement;
• the statement of principal accounting policies; and
• the related notes 1 to 36.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Carrying value of goodwill
• Accounting for the IPO transaction
• Valuation of hire fleet 
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £1.1m which was 
determined on the basis of 1% of revenue for the year.
Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at three components, 
representing the Group’s most material marketing operations and assets. These three 
components account for 90% of the Group’s revenue, 99% of the Group’s EBITDA and 
93% of the Group’s total assets.  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 49
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of 
the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified 
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s or 
the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Carrying value of goodwill 
Key audit matter 
description 
di
We consider the carrying value of goodwill (£34.2m recognised for the three CGUs in the 
UK, US, and Middle East/Asia) and potential impairment to be a key audit matter because 
of the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, 
which are the basis of the assessment of recoverability. We consider the key inputs into 
the impairment model to be the growth rate, discount rate and terminal value.
Refer to Note 1 “Principal accounting policies” on goodwill, as well as to Note 9 “Goodwill”. 
How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the key audit 
matter
 
We have challenged the reasonableness of management’s key judgements, by 
performing the following:
• Evaluating the design and implementation of controls around the impairment review 
carried out by management;
• Engaging Deloitte industry valuation specialists to challenge the discount rate 
applied, and the assumptions and inputs used to calculate the discount rate, by 
comparing to independently derived assumptions;
• Testing the clerical accuracy of management’s impairment model; and,
• Assessing one-off items which management has identified as impacting the current 
year and the risk of these items being pervasive in the business of each of the CGU at 
which goodwill has been recognised.
We tested the sensitivity of the impairment test in relation to reasonably possible 
changes in each of the key assumptions and reviewed management’s sensitivity 
disclosure to check compliance with the financial reporting standards.
We also assessed whether the group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of outcomes 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Key observations
 
We concluded that the key assumptions used within management’s goodwill 
impairment assessment were reasonable, and are consistent with the Group’s longer 
term viability and going concern assessment ARENA GROUP

Independent Auditor’s Report Continued
Accounting for the IPO transaction
Key audit matter 
description 
di
During the year the Group floated on the Alternative Investment Market of the London 
Stock Exchange raising net £55.8m. The incremental costs directly attributable to the 
share issue need to be accounted for as a deduction from equity. All other expenses 
should be recognised as an expense for the year. The classification of these expenses 
affects the numbers presented on the income statement, the balance sheet and the 
cash flow statement.
Refer to Note 1 “Significant judgements” on exceptional items and Note 22 “Share 
capital”. 
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
 
Our work focused on tracing expenses recognised against equity as part of the IPO 
transaction to supporting documents. Based on the description of the services provided 
we derived an understanding of the composition of these items and challenged 
management’s assessment as to the incremental and direct nature in relation to the 
IPO based on the services received, their timing and purpose. We assessed the design 
and implementation of related controls. We evaluated the mathematical accuracy of 
these items and the appropriate allocation against equity components. 
Key observations
 
We concluded that the items recognised against equity in the consolidated and Parent 
company balance sheet are reasonable in accounting for the IPO transaction. 
Valuation of hire fleet 
Key audit matter 
description 
di
The underlying assumption used to determine the valuation of the hire fleet (fixed 
assets) of £34.0m at year end, have been reassessed by management during the year . 
In particular management has updated the useful economic life (UEL) for some assets 
to align global depreciation rates and the residual value (RV) of certain metal assets to 
10%-15% of the original cost. Changes to the UEL and updating the RV impact the related 
depreciation charge and the value of the hire fleet (fixed assets) at the reporting date.
Refer to Note 1 “Principal accounting policies” on tangible fixed assets, Note 1 “Key 
estimation uncertainties” on useful economic life and residual value and Note 11 
“Tangible fixed assets”.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
 
We have challenged the assumption employed by Group management by comparing the 
UEL across subsidiaries and the inputs used by local management and assessing the 
reasonableness of these inputs against the past experience the business has had with 
useful lives of equipment. To determine the new RV for the hire fleet we compared the RV 
applied with average scrap metal prices in each geographical location.
In particular we understood the justifications and reasonableness included in the paper 
prepared by management to support the reassessment. We assessed the design and 
implementation of the relevant review process control.
We also tested the application of the new assumptions across the same asset classes and 
the accuracy of the related calculations. 
Key observations
 
We concluded that the valuation of hire fleet and the changes in the accounting estimates 
are reasonable and in-line with the Group’s operations and the valuation. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 51
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use 
materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as 
follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality £1.1m £595,000
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
1% of Group revenue for the year. 1% of Equity 
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Revenue generated by the Group indicates 
its ability to generate returns on assets 
employed and is an indication of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s commercial 
policy. 
The Parent company holds the investment 
is all trading entities of the Group, and does 
not trade itself. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of £55,000 for the group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group operates through a number of legal entities which form reporting components based on geographical 
location. Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed over significant components, representing 90% of 
Group revenue and 99% of Group EBITDA for the year, and 93% of total assets as at year end.
We focused our Group audit scope on components based in the following locations with component materiality 
ranging between £131k to £645k:
• UK
• US
• UAE
At the Parent entity level we tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm 
our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial 
information of the remaining components not subject to audit.
The work on all components was performed by the component auditors based in each location under the 
direction and supervision of the Group engagement partner. During the course of the audit telephone conference 
meetings were held with the local auditors covering planning, fieldwork and completion.  ARENA GROUP

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the 
parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 53
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies of the company are set out below. They have all been applied consistently 
throughout the year and the preceding year.
Arena Events Group Plc (the company) is a public company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom 
under the Companies Act 2006 and is registered in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements of 
Arena Events Group Plc are available from the registered office at 4 Deer Park Road, London SW19 3GY.
The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the nature of the Group’s operations 
are set out in the strategic report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the 
policies set out in note 1.
The financial statements have been prepared for Arena Events Group Plc and its subsidiaries (referred to as “the 
Group”).
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable IFRS including standards and 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the EU and in accordance 
with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost 
convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies below certain items, including derivatives, held for 
trading investments and available for sale investments, are shown at fair value.
The preparation of the financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements. If, in the future, such estimates and assumptions which are based on management’s 
best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original 
estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.
Going concern
In 2017, the Group traded well and generated an operating profit of £0.3m (2016: £1.2m) and complied with all 
covenants on its UK and US bank borrowings (note 20).
The directors have prepared detailed trading forecasts for the Group for 2018 and 2019, and these indicate that 
all interest and capital repayments due for the foreseeable future will be made, and that the Group will be cash 
positive. As such, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to have sufficient 
funds in order to meet all of its financial obligations as they fall due, not only in relation to the renewed financing 
arrangements but also to suppliers and other creditors as part of the ongoing trading of the Group.
Based on this assessment the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have, therefore, prepared the 
historical financial information contained herein on a going concern basis.
Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or 
after 01 January 2017. ARENA GROUP
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 64
Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
Amendments to IAS7 Disclosure Initiative
The Group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year. The amendments require an 
entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising 
from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes.
The Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities consist of borrowings (note 19). A reconciliation between 
the opening and closing balances of these items is provided in note 19. Consistent with the transition provisions 
of the amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior period. Apart from 
the additional disclosure in note 19, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
The Group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year. The amendments clarify how 
an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which it can utilise a 
deductible difference.
The application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements 
as the Group already assesses the sufficiency of future taxable profits in a way that is consistent with these 
amendments.
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (January 2018)
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (January 2018)
IFRS 16 Leases (January 2019)
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment 
Transactions (January 2018)
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate 
or Joint Venture (Date to be confirmed)
Amendments to IAS 40 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle 
(January 2018)
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
(January 2018)
IFRS 15, IFRS 16 and IFRS 9 are detailed further below. The group is not expecting any material changes from 
implementing the remaining other standards noted above.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. It supersedes the previous revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue 
and IAS 11 Construction Contracts, and is effective for the Group from 1 January 2018. The Group will therefore 
adopt IFRS 15 for the year ending 31 December 2018 and will adopt the full retrospective approach with 
restatement of comparatives.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods 
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 65
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following revenue streams have been identified as being impacted by the adoption of the new standard:
Area Current treatment New treatment under IFRS 15
Rental hire Revenue and profit is recognised as 
supplied. For projects that extend over a 
period end, revenue and profit is recognised 
over the total project duration based upon 
estimated costs incurred and an internal 
assessment of the proportion of the project 
that has been delivered to the customer .
Contract revenue will be allocated between 
the four primary components of a contract, 
design, build, rental period and dismantle. 
A proportion of revenue will be allocated to 
each of these obligations and recognised on 
the relevant date in the case of design, build 
and dismantle and over the period between 
handover and dismantle in the case of the 
rental component.
Capital sales Revenue and profit is recognised on 
handover at which point the risks and 
rewards are transferred to the customer .
Revenue and profit will be recognised 
on handover at which point the risks and 
rewards are transferred to the customer . i.e 
no change to current treatment.
The Group is still assessing the level of any potential impact of the adoption of this standard.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting 
treatments for both lessees and lessors. IFRS 16 will supersede the current guidance on leases including IAS 17 
and the related interpretations when it becomes effective for the Group’s financial year commencing 1 January 
2019.
Under IFRS 16, the distinction between operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance 
sheet) are removed for accounting purposes and replaced with a model where a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding liability are recognised for all leases by lessees. As a result, all leases will be on balance sheet 
except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. Subsequently, 
the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments. As a consequence EBITDA will increase because 
operating lease expenses currently included in EBITDA will be recognised instead as amortisation/depreciation 
of the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease liability. However, there may be an overall reduction 
in profit before tax in the early years of a lease because the amortisation and interest charges will likely exceed 
the current straight line expense incurred under IAS 17. In addition, the classification of cash flows will also be 
affected because operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented within operating cash flows, whereas 
under IFRS 16 the payments will be split into a principal and interest portion which will be presented as 
financing and operating cash flows respectively.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £14.3m (see note 
28). A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 
16 and hence the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these 
leases unless they qualify as short-term or low value leases. The new requirement to recognise a right-of-
use asset and related lease liability is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the 
Group’s financial statements. Management are currently assessing the potential impact and at this stage it is 
not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review is complete. ARENA GROUP
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 66
Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including 
a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and the new general hedge 
accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and de-recognition of financial 
instruments from IAS 39. The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements 
resulting from the application of IFRS 9. Our initial review of IFRS 9 has indicated that the impact of this new 
standard on the Group’s results is unlikely to be material.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 31 December 2017. Business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition 
method of accounting. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included in the 
consolidated profit and loss account from the effective date of acquisition. Those companies sold during the 
year are included up to the effective date of disposal. Turnover and profits arising on trading between Group 
companies are eliminated fully on consolidation.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition 
are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. All changes to these assets and liabilities 
that arise after the Group gained control of the subsidiary are charged or credited to the post acquisition profit 
and loss account.
All subsidiary undertakings have an accounting reference date of 31 December.
Reorganisation
On 25 July 2017, the Group completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of its ordinary shares and was admitted 
to the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company was initially incorporated as 
Arena Events Group Limited on 01 June 2017 and was registered as a public company and changed its name to 
Arena Events Group Plc on 07 July 2017. Prior to listing, the Company became the holding company of the Group 
through the acquisition of the full share capital of AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings Limited (“Group 
Holdings”) and its subsidiaries (the “Existing Group”). Shares in Group Holdings were exchanged for 1,906,099 
shares in the Company. These shares were issued and credited as fully paid of 55 pence each giving rise to 
combined share capital and share premium of £1m.
Both the Company and the Existing Group were under common control before and after the reorganisation. As a 
common control transaction, this does not meet the definition of a business combination under IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations and as such, falls outside the scope of that standard. As a consequence, following guidance from 
IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the introduction of the company has 
been prepared under merger accounting principles. This policy, which does not conflict with IFRS, reflects 
the economic substance of the transaction. Under these principles, no acquirer is required to be identified 
and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This accounting treatment leads to 
differences on consolidation between share capital and share premium in issue (£1.1m) and the book value of 
the underlying net assets acquired, this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve. Under these 
principals, the Group has presented its Financial Statements of the Group as though the current Group structure 
had always been in place. Accordingly, the results of the combined entities for both the current and prior period 
are presented as if the Group had been in existence throughout the periods presented, rather than from the 
restructuring date.
Foreign currency translation
During the year foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate in operation on the date on 
which the transaction occurred. Any exchange gain or loss occurring as a result of a business transaction being 
settled at an exchange rate that differs from that used when the transaction was originally recorded is credited 
or charged to the profit and loss account. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 67
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On consolidation, foreign entities balance sheets and profit and loss are recorded using the closing rate method.
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured in line with IFRS 3, being the excess of the sum of consideration transferred over the 
amounts of the acquired net assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit and loss on disposal.
Customer Relationship Costs
Customer relationship costs are an estimated value attributed to key current customers acquired.
The intangible asset arising is being amortised on a straight line basis in line of 3 to 5 years from the date the 
new business assets went into service. This is based on the expected beneficial life of the key customer. The 
directors consider this represents the useful economic benefit of the key customers.
Development Costs
Development costs are calculated as those costs incurred to develop a new product to add to the businesses 
offering.
The intangible asset arising on development is being amortised on a straight line basis over 15 years from the 
date the new product went into service. The directors consider 15 years to represent the useful economic benefit 
of the product.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets, which include assets acquired for hire, are capitalised at their purchase cost, together 
with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is provided by the company to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed 
assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Hire equipment (metal) Between 15 and 25 years
Hire equipment (non-metal) Between 3 and 10 years
Plant and machinery Between 2 and 7 years
Motor vehicles Between 3 and 5 years
Fixtures and fittings Between 3 and 6 years
During the year the Group reviewed the residual value of its hire equipment (metal) and useful economic life of 
its hire equipment assets. This had the effect of reducing the annual depreciation charge associated with these 
assets. ARENA GROUP
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 68
Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at purchase cost of acquisition (including any incidental cost 
of acquisition), together with the amount of any long-term loans advanced to those undertakings.
Where, in the opinion of the directors, there has been an impairment of the investments, appropriate provisions 
are made and charged to the profit and loss account.
Inventories
Raw materials are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw material cost is determined on a first 
in first out basis. Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Work in progress has been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and includes costs incurred on 
long term contracts. Costs include direct materials and direct labour only. Provided that the outcome of any 
material long-term contracts ongoing at the year-end can be assessed with reasonable certainty, attributable 
profit earned to date is recognised in the profit and loss account and work in progress is stated net of amounts 
transferred to cost of sales, net of payments received on account.
Exceptionals
The Group considers material one-off items to be exceptional in nature. These are presented separately on the 
face of the income statement and detailed in note 4. Recognition of these costs as being exceptional in nature is 
to provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits with maturity of 
three months or less, which are used by the Group in the management of its short term commitments.
Finance costs/income
Initial debt issue costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the 
facility. All other borrowing costs and finance income are recognised in the profit and loss in the period in which 
they are incurred.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a 
right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against 
which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences 
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing 
differences are expected to reserve, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively 
enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 69
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue
Revenue, which excludes value added tax, sales between Group companies and trade discounts, represents the 
value of goods and services and is recognised as supplied.
For activities and events that extend over a period of time, revenue is recognised over their duration with the 
estimated revenue on the event evenly allocated over the event period.
Revenue received and receivable in advance of events that have not occurred before the year end are retained in 
deferred income.
Capital sales revenue is recognised on handover at which point the risks and rewards are transferred to the 
customer.
Pension costs
The group contributes to various defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the group in independently administered funds. Contributions to the schemes are 
charged to the profit and loss account in the year/period in which they are incurred.
Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at 
the grant date (note 25). The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the 
original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.
Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset to the lessee, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the corresponding 
capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor, and the finance costs being written off to the profit and loss 
account over the primary period of the lease. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated 
useful lives and the lease period.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial 
asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by 
the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as other financial liabilities at amortised cost.
Related party disclosures
Balances and transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been 
eliminated on consolidation. Transactions between the group and its associates are disclosed in note 31. ARENA GROUP

Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the Group financial statements requires the use of certain judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and 
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which 
the estimate was based or as a result of new information or more experience. Significant key estimation 
uncertainties, and judgements are provided below.
Key estimation uncertainties:
Provision for bad debt Provision for bad debts is made against specific balances that are 
considered by the group to be irrecoverable or where there may exist a 
risk that a debtor balance may not be fully recoverable. Depending on 
the customer profile, the specific provision is supplemented by a general 
amount to take into account a large number of smaller balances and 
the risk profile of customers with whom the Group trades. Trade debtor 
balances are shown net of amounts provided. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Useful economic life and residual 
value of assets
The assessment of the useful economic life and residual value of the Group’s 
fixed assets involves a significant amount of judgement based on historical 
experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which 
may impact their useful life and residual value. A review of useful lives and 
residual value took place during the year .
Significant judgements:
Exceptional items The Group applies judgement in identifying the significant non-recurring 
items of income and expense that are recognised as exceptional to help 
provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance.
Share options and other equity 
instruments
The selection of valuation models, such as the Black–Scholes model, and 
parameters used in order to determine the fair value of certain share awards 
requires judgement.
Other estimates, assumptions and judgements are applied by the Group which are evaluated on a continual basis 
but are not significant. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 71

2 Segment Reporting
The Group has three reportable segments: UK and Europe (UKE), Middle East and Asia (MEA) and America 
(US). For each of the three segments, the Group’s chief operating decision maker (the “Board”) reviews internal 
management reports on a monthly basis.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as described in note 1. Information regarding 
the results of each reportable segment is included below. Segment results before exceptional items are used 
to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the 
performance of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

6. Loss per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity 
holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The acquisition of AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings Ltd by Arena Events Group Plc on 07 July 2017 
has been accounted for using reverse acquisition accounting principles. The effect of using reverse accounting 
principles on share capital is that the capital that existed at the point Arena Events Group Plc legally acquired 
AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings Ltd is accounted for as if it had been in existence as at the 
comparative period (31 December 2016) and as at the opening balance sheet date (01 January 2017).
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the current and prior year has therefore been stated to 
reflect the post IPO share capital structure, this adjustment assumes the total shares issued during the IPO 
were in issue throughout the whole of the current and previous period presented.

of Corporation Tax to 17% (effective 01 April 2020).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Goodwill acquired in 2017 relates to acquisition of business assets of Wernick Seating (2016: investment in 
Arena Hong Kong and the acquisition of business assets of RIM Scaffolding Event Services and Brand Ice). 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that 
are expected to benefit from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying 
amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
CGU
UKE 30.7 29.8
MEA 2.6 2.8
US 0.9 1.0
 34.2 33.6
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from the value in use calculations. The value in use 
calculations are based on a four-year forecast with a terminal value applied based on a long-term rate of 2%.
The key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and margin percentages during the 
period. These assumptions have been reviewed in the year based on market rates and conservative estimates 
about the future. The revenue growth rate of 2% has been applied across all years of the four-year forecast. 
EBITDA % is based on the 2018 budget and has been applied by region to 2019, 2020 and 2021: US 10.8%, MEA 
9.6% and UK 12.9%. Capex has been allowed at a rate of 30% to EBITDA across all regions.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU. A reduction of 2% in growth 
would leave the carrying value of goodwill in excess of its recoverable amount. An increase in the weighted 
average cost of capital of 1% would leave the carrying value of goodwill in excess of its recoverable amount. As 
the business continues to grow its business there is not expected to be any requirement for impairment in the 
foreseeable future.
The rates used to discount the CGU cash flows are a pre-tax discount rate derived from WACC of: UK 8.5%, 
MEA 10.0% and US 9.0% (2016: one rate was used for all CGUs of 8.53%). The WACC calculation used the cost 
of equity based on the CAPM model using available market information in relation to the risk free rate, beta 
coefficient and equity risk premium. The main driver of the difference in discount rate was the equity risk 
premium applied to each region. ARENA GROUP

All of the other receivables and prepayment balances above are deemed to be current; the disclosures below 
relate only to the trade receivables balance.
The directors review the recoverability of trade receivables on a regular basis and calculate the allowance for 
doubtful debts on both a specific, customer by customer basis and a general basis.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of 
counterparties and customers. There is no one customer that accounts for more than 10% of the trade 
receivables balance. Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision risk required in 
excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 85
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Included within the group’s trade receivables (gross) balance are debtors with a carrying value of £1.4m (2016: 
£1.0m) which are more than 90 days past due at the reporting date for which the group has not provided as there 
has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

presented.

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. 
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 57 days (2016: 68 days). For most suppliers, no interest 
is charged on the trade payables. The group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all 
payables are paid within the credit timeframe.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. ARENA GROUP

The company holds no bank and other borrowings and no bank or other borrowings were held in the prior year.
All banking covenants were complied with during the year.
As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group had banking facilities with HSBC and PNC.
The HSBC facility included senior term debt of £5.0m and a revolving credit facility of £3.0m. At 31 December 
2017 £nil of the revolving credit facility had been drawn down (2016 £0.6m).This debt was secured by fixed and 
floating charges over the assets of each of the UK, Middle East and Asia entities within Group. The facility is 
available until December 2019.
The PNC facility provides a $20.0m revolving credit facility subject to limitations based on asset valuation, 
eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances at each month end and bears interest at between 2.25% and 
3.75% plus Libor. The facility is available until December 2019.
Total bank facility arrangement fees of £0.4m (2016: £0.4m) were amortised in the year. There were loan note 
issue costs of £nil in 2017 (2016: £0.3) amortised in the year.
The interest rate on the loan notes is variable based on the classification of loan note. The directors believe that 
there is no difference between the fair value and the book value of the above liabilities.

Each regions working capital is manged through a weekly cashflow forecast that is reviewed at a Group level. 
This ensures that all financial liabilities and bank covenants are met. All bank borrowing requirements were met 
during the year.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates on all borrowings had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the 
Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by £0.1m (2016: £0.3m).
This has been calculated by applying the amended interest rate to the weighted average rate of borrowings for 
the year to 31 December 2017, other than borrowings which are held at a fixed interest rate as those borrowings 
are not sensitive to external variables, such as movement in interest rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity of borrowings is included in note 19. Intercompany balances have no fixed repayment date. All 
other financial liabilities are expected to mature within six months of the year-end. The directors consider that 
the carrying amount of the other financial liabilities is approximate to their fair value.
Carrying value of financial assets
As noted in note 15 the directors do not believe any of the trade receivables to be impaired. A significant 
decrease in the net assets and trade of the owing company or a decline in the financial position of customers 
would trigger an impairment review.
Credit risk
In the opinion of the directors, the only financial instrument that is subject to credit risk is the trade receivables. 
The directors believe that the bad debt provision as disclosed in note 14 represents the directors’ best estimate 
of the maximum expected exposure to credit risk at period-end. In order to minimise credit risk all new 
customers to whom credit is granted are checked through a credit rating company. Trade receivables aging is 
reviewed as part of the overall cash management process. Any potential risks are highlighted and sanctions 
taken where appropriate. ARENA GROUP
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 90
Notes to the Financial Statements Continued
Fair value of financial instruments
In the opinion of the directors, the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their book values.
Liquidity risk management
The directors believe that the receivables are not impaired and that the customers with outstanding balances 
have sufficient net assets to repay the balances. Any potential liquidity risk is kept to a minimum by the use of 
continual cash flow forecasting and evaluation.
Capital risk management 
As stated in the directors’ report, the directors believe that the group is cash generative and self-sufficient 
and does not require additional external finance. The borrowings were taken out for acquisition purposes, not 
working capital funding. The directors maintain detailed cash forecasts which are frequently revised to actuals 
to ensure that the group has sufficient liquid resources to meet its requirements. The capital structure of the 
group consist of debt as described in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders 
of the parent.
Foreign currency financial assets and liabilities
Included within the above table are £37.1m (2016: £35.2m) of assets and £30.0m (2016: £29.9m) of liabilities 
relating to the overseas subsidiaries which have been translated in the consolidation at the period-end rate. 
These balances are subject to movements in exchange rates, as shown in the statement of changes in equity. 
The directors do not believe the risk is significant enough to warrant hedging against the investments in 
overseas companies.
Also included within the above table are foreign currency denominated external trade payables and receivables 
of £6.2m (2016: £5.9m) and £4.3m (2016: £3.8m) respectively.
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on its financial instruments

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Authorised share capital is unlimited.
The company was incorporated on 01 June 2017. The acquisition of AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings 
Ltd by Arena Events Group Plc on 07 July 2017 was accounted for using reverse acquisition accounting 
principles. The effect of using reverse acquisition accounting principles on share capital is that the capital that 
existed as at the point Arena Events Group Plc legally acquired AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings Ltd is 
accounted for as if it had been in existence as at the comparative period end (31 December 2016) and as at the 
opening balance sheet date (01 January 2017).
Share capital therefore comprises the following transactions:
The company was incorporated on 01 June 2017, upon incorporation the company issued 1 ordinary shares at 
£1.00.
On 07 July 2017 the initial share was subdivided into 100 ordinary shares at £0.01. The shareholders of AES 
Arena Events Group Holdings Ltd transferred their shares to Arena Events Group Plc in a share for share 
exchange.
The share capital issued as part of this share for share exchange consisted of 1,906,099 shares of varying 
classes with a nominal value of £19,000. The varying classes were then converted to a single class of ordinary 
share in Arena Events Group Plc. Loan notes held in AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings Ltd by Greg 
Lawless and Gaitsford Investments were exchanged for 3,592,918 ordinary £0.01 shares in Arena Events Group 
Plc. After these transactions the company then had a share capital of 5,499,117 ordinary shares at £0.01 with a 
nominal value of £55,000.
On 25 July 2017 in an initial public offering Arena Events Group Plc issued 109,091,000 ordinary shares at £0.01 
at a price of £0.55 resulting in an increase in share capital of £1,091,000. As part of the initial public offering 
1,332,719 ordinary shares at £0.01 were repurchased from previous investors in AES Arena Event Services Group 
Holdings Ltd and 1,382,542 ordinary shares at £0.01 were issued as incentive shares to group management.
As at the end of 25 July 2017 there were 114,639,940 ordinary shares at £0.01 in issue resulting in £1.1m of share 
capital and £57.3m share premium. All shares carry equal rights.
23 Share premium account
The share premium reserve contains the premium arising on the issue of equity shares, net of issue expenses 
incurred by the company of £3.5m. On the 25 July 2017 in an initial public offering Arena Events Group Plc issued 
109,091,000 ordinary £0.01 shares at a price of £0.55, resulting in additional share premium of £57.3m.

The movement on the merger reserve is as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The effect of reverse acquisition accounting on the merger reserve is that the share capital, share premium 
and other distributable reserves that existed in Arena Events Group Plc (the company) as at the point Arena 
Events Group Plc legally acquired AES Arena Event Services Group Holdings Ltd is accounted for as if it had 
been in existence as at the comparative period end (31 December 2016) and as at the opening balance sheet 
date (1 January 2017). The corresponding entry being the merger reserve so the overall net assets as at the 
comparative dates are not effected. ARENA GROUP

The share option reserve represents the expected cost to the group to satisfy the group’s share option scheme. 
The Black Scholes method was used to determine the value of the charge to the share option reserve.
A group share option scheme was set up on admission to AIM in July 2017. The Scheme allows for options to be 
issued over ordinary shares, up to a maximum of 10% of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue at the time of 
grant, over a ten year period. The option exercise price will usually be the mid market price of the shares on the 
date of grant.
Total options were issued at admission equal to approximately 4.6% of the number of ordinary shares in issue, 
with an exercise price of 55 pence per share. These initial option awards have no performance conditions and 
vest equally after two, three and four years from the date of grant. The total number of shares under option as at 
31 December 2017 were 5,374,545. The options are vesting in three equal amounts of 1,791,515 on 25 July 2019, 
2020 and 2021.

On the 03 of April 2017, Arena Event Services Group Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary), acquired certain business 
assets including staff and contracts from Wernick Event Hire Limited in relation to Wernick Seating for a 
consideration of £2.1m. This acquisition was funded by an additional facility from HSBC of £2m. The acquisition 
was a strategic fit with the Group’s existing Seating business and strengthens its offering within the UK. The 
goodwill recognised consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the 
operations of Wernick Seating with the Group. The acquisition contributed £2.6m of revenue and £0.2m of profit 
to the Group’s results in 2017. Intangible assets recognised consist of ongoing customer relationships acquired.

36 Post balance sheet events
Purchase of loan notes and interest
On 5th January 2018 the Company exercised its call option to acquire all the remaining loan notes issued by 
the Group, held by Greg Lawless, CEO, and Gaitsford Investments Limited (a company owned and controlled by 
Greg Lawless) (“Gaitsford”). Greg Lawless and Gaitsford each used the proceeds of such sale to subscribe for an 
aggregate of 2,513,541 new ordinary shares of 1p each issued by the Company.
The new shares commenced trading on 11 January 2018 and from that date the total number of shares in issue 
and total voting rights was 117,153,481. As a result of these transactions, Greg Lawless has a total beneficial 
holding of 6,640,755 ordinary shares in the Company, representing 5.7% of the Company’s issued share capital.
Amendment of HSBC Banking Facilities
On 12th January 2018 the Group agreed an amendment to the groups non-US banking facilities with HSBC Bank 
to reduce the interest margin on its main facilities to between 1.5% and 2.5% depending on the level of leverage. 
An additional acquisition facility of £5m was secured, available to be drawn down until January 2019 on the same 
terms as the existing facilities described in note 20 to the accounts.
Acquisition of the GLD Productions Ltd business
On 1st February 2018 the Group acquired the business and assets of GLD Productions Ltd for total expected 
consideration of £0.9 million. GLD supplies furniture to concerts, music festivals, fashion shows, sporting 
occasions and corporate hospitality events across the UK. GLD’s stock and staff have been incorporated 
into Arena’s Spaceworks Furniture Hire division at its Membury facility. This acquisition is expected to add 
approximately £1.5m in annual revenue in 2018.
Investigation into Arena America’s relationship with a previous customer
Arena Event Services Inc (“Arena Americas”) was notified by the US Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) in March 
2018, that it has launched an investigation into Arena America’s relationship with a previous customer. This 
customer, we were informed by the USAO, has formally been charged for a violation related to the Small 
Business set-aside program for business conducted between 2007 and 2017. Since 2013, when Arena acquired 
the Americas business, total revenue generated from contracts with this customer has been $4m with EBITDA 
of approximately $0.5m. Based on other similar cases, fines of up to 2 times revenues or profits have been 
imposed, implying a possible range of fines between $1m and $8m. We continue to pro-actively engage with the 
USAO in order to draw this matter to a conclusion as soon as possible. However, as this date, we are not in a 
position to finalise this matter with the USAO. Annual Report & Accounts 2017 97
