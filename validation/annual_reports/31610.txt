Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Maintaining a strong portfolio of businesses
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present the Annual 
Report for 2017, a year in which DMGT 
demonstrated once again the benefits 
of maintaining a strong portfolio of 
businesses that have the potential to 
deliver attractive long-term returns for 
our shareholders. This has been a year 
of transformation as we have made 
significant changes across the Group. We 
have established new strategic priorities 
and we are better positioned to deliver 
long-term shareholder value. That said, 
this year’s financial performance has 
been affected by challenging market 
conditions and the continued volatility 
in the wider media industry, however, 
DMGT has benefited from the resilience 
provided by its diversified portfolio. 
Your Group has also continued to invest 
to take advantage of the trends in both 
B2B and consumer digital markets. 
The strategic focus on operational execution 
under Paul Zwillenberg, your CEO, resulted 
in DMGT maintaining a double-digit adjusted 
operating margin.
We saw encouraging signs of growth from 
investments in several initiatives designed 
to deliver long-term organic returns, albeit 
with reduced expectations for some B2B 
businesses that are facing particularly 
challenging market conditions and which 
resulted in impairments that adversely 
affected our statutory results.
We have continued to take a disciplined 
approach to capital allocation, investing to 
expand our market positions in key sectors. 
During 2017, enhancing our financial 
flexibility has also been one of our strategic 
priorities, with disposals and healthy cash 
flow reducing net debt to 1.4 times EBITDA, 
the lowest level for over 20 years. The Board 
is therefore pleased to recommend a 3% 
increase in the final dividend per share for 
2017, giving a total dividend for the year 
of 22.7 pence per share, an increase of 
3% continuing DMGT’s long-standing 
commitment to delivering sustainable 
annual real dividend growth.
In Consumer Media, dmg media’s 
performance demonstrated that it is 
possible for a modern news media company 
to prosper in a digital world. Our Mail titles, 
in print and online, have continued to 
produce highly valued content for their 
global audience. Providing quality, popular 
journalism has resulted in circulation 
outperformance. In addition, an unparalleled 
cross-media advertising proposition in 
print and digital formats across the Mail 
and Metro titles has benefited performance. 
While print advertising continues its secular 
decline, MailOnline continues to win 
audiences across each platform it partners 
with, delivering strong levels of digital 
advertising growth. 
In our B2B businesses, the requirement to 
have fully integrated data analytic solutions 
has become an increasing priority across all 
industries and our operations are already at 
the forefront of this trend. A major milestone 
was reached this year with the launch of 
Risk Modeler on the RMS(one) platform, 
DMGT’s first truly enterprise class solution. 
This was achieved alongside the release 
of an unprecedented number of new risk 
models. Our Education Technology (EdTech) 
business, Hobsons, is bringing predictive 
analytics and improvements to the customer 
experience across its Naviance, Starfish and 
Intersect platforms. Our European property 
information businesses are using their 
modelling expertise with large data sets 
to launch new products which will enable 
faster decision-making in the insurance and 
banking sectors. Continued investment in 
our events business has supported a strong 
launch programme where innovative organic 
growth is being pursued internationally. 
Beyond operational execution and 
enhancing financial flexibility, one of the 
main considerations of the Board is to 
ensure our portfolio is in optimal shape to 
harness market growth dynamics, as well as 
withstand market volatility. During the year, 
DMGT unlocked significant value by reducing 
its holding in Euromoney Institutional 
Investor PLC (Euromoney) to around 49%. 
DMGT has benefited from the resilience 
provided by its diversified portfolio, 
during continued challenging 
market conditions.
The Viscount Rothermere
Chairman

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report This has also given Euromoney the financial 
flexibility to pursue its own strategy. 
Refocusing and disposals within our 
Consumer Media and B2B divisions have 
enabled us to focus on the most attractive 
growth opportunities. Going forward, 
although we recognise the benefits of 
spreading risk across a diversified portfolio, 
there are clear advantages to operating in 
fewer sectors, especially in terms of resource 
allocation and our ability to expand our 
market shares in the most attractive sectors. 
  Read more in CEO Review,  
pages 10 to 13
The implementation of our Group strategy 
is overseen by the Board of Directors, which 
maintains the high standards of governance 
our shareholders expect. The Governance 
Report sets out the framework for operating 
performance and shareholder value that 
is central to the growth of DMGT. 
I am pleased that Tim Collier joined as the 
Group Chief Financial Officer during the year. 
Tim’s prior experience working for portfolio 
companies in B2B information, events and 
media sectors with a significant US presence 
is aligned with DMGT’s businesses and 
overall Group focus. I am confident 
he will help to lead DMGT to further success.
I would like to thank our Non-Executive 
Directors for their contribution over the past 
year with the Group benefiting from their 
skills and experience at both an individual 
business and Board level. During the year 
François Morin joined DMGT’s Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. François brings an 
international perspective relevant to the 
Group’s global operations and experience of 
regulatory matters across a range of areas. 
Sadly, following a short illness, Nicholas 
Berry, Non-Executive Director, died in 
December 2016. Nicholas had served on 
the DMGT Board for nine years, providing 
invaluable advice and insights across 
a wide range of areas, particularly our 
leadership programmes.
  Read more in Governance Report,  
pages 40 to 56
Throughout its history, DMGT has relied 
upon the talent, experience and skills of its 
employees through their innovation and 
entrepreneurial drive. We also recognise 
that the talent development in critical skills 
must keep pace with our strategic ambitions 
both through leveraging our existing teams 
as well as supplementing our abilities 
with leading-edge external experience. 
For more information on our talent 
development programmes please refer to 
the Our People and Our Communities section. 
As Chairman of the Board, I want to thank 
all our employees for their dedication, 
hard work and significant contribution to 
the Group as well as their wider community. 
Sadly, this came into sharp focus in 2017, 
as DMGT employees supported the relief 
efforts following the Grenfell Tower fire and 
Hurricane Harvey, tragedies that struck at 
the heart of communities where our people 
live and work. 
  Read more in Our People and  
Our Communities, pages 32 to 35
At the senior management level, 
remuneration and incentives drive focus 
on performance aligned to our strategic 
priorities. Our value creation metrics 
and related payments are set out in the 
Remuneration Report.
  Read more in Remuneration Report, 
pages 57 to 80
The Board and I remain confident in 
DMGT’s prospects for long-term growth. 
Our focus in the coming year is to continue 
to execute against the new strategic 
framework, which will position DMGT 
for the next wave of growth, as well 
as manage expected continued market 
volatility. We remain confident that through 
our strong entrepreneurial and innovative 
capability, DMGT will be able to benefit 
from the opportunities being brought by the 
increasing pace of change and complexity 
in our industries. Through harnessing our 
growth opportunities and investing in 
the best ideas we remain confident that 
DMGT will deliver good long-term returns 
to shareholders.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Adapting to continuous change
Market Overview
DMGT comprises a portfolio of businesses working across diverse 
marketplaces. While each has its own individual characteristics, 
some common features exist: 
• Fast-paced and evolving to adopt new technology and business models
• Technology-enabled with high degrees of innovation
• Enduring and resilient
• Content and information-driven
Increased  
volatility
Political  
uncertainty
Cyber  
security
Context to DMGT
• As a provider of proprietary, hard-to-
obtain information, DMGT benefits from 
growing uncertainty in the world as its 
customers rely more heavily on data 
and analysis to inform critical decisions.
Market trend
• Global economic uncertainty, political 
tensions and supply and demand 
disruptions continue to influence our 
customers and their markets in what is 
becoming a ‘new normal’ level of market 
volatility. Extreme weather events, 
commodity price fluctuations and 
continued exchange rate swings have 
directly impacted the economic and 
social environments for both investment 
and business operations.
Our approach
• Our diversification provides beneficial 
offsets in an increasingly volatile world: 
as one industry may be facing headwinds, 
another may benefit from the forces 
of volatility.
• In this sustained-volatile environment, 
DMGT is providing its customers with 
fundamental data, analytics and insights 
that enable them to move away from 
instinct-driven decision-making and 
to embrace market-relevant data as 
a means to navigate uncertain times.
Context to DMGT
• Political policy decisions have direct 
and often unexpected impacts on the 
geographies and industries in which 
DMGT operates and will continue to 
shape where and how DMGT pursues 
commercial and strategic opportunities.
Market trend
• There is still long-term geopolitical and 
economic uncertainty for UK companies’ 
operations abroad. Furthermore, the 
rise of populist policies and changing 
political landscapes throughout the 
world each add to the climate 
of political uncertainty. 
Our approach
• DMGT closely follows political changes 
and implications for the geographies 
and industries in which it participates. 
In many instances, the uncertainty 
of changing political and regulatory 
norms presents commercial opportunities, 
as we help our customers anticipate 
implications for their business. 
Context to DMGT
• As a provider of business-critical data, 
analytic tools for global industries and 
news media, DMGT is exposed to cyber 
security risks across its operations.
Market trend
• Cyber security threat is a permanent 
business risk in the digital age. 
Governments and regulatory bodies 
have awakened to the threat posed to 
individuals and society by data breaches.
• Customer confidence is easily eroded, 
enforcing the highest possible cyber 
security standards is critical for 
maintaining customer and market trust.
Our approach
• DMGT continues to strengthen 
its information security controls with the 
formation of a new Information Security 
Steering Committee, the recruitment 
of a Group Chief Information Officer, 
and in October 2017, a Chief Information 
Security Officer, together with regular 
cyber security audits. 
• RMS has developed a cyber risk 
management tool that seeks to provide 
insurers with a framework to capture 
and report on all cyber exposure and 
facilitate risk transfer in the market.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Our businesses are constantly looking towards the future to identify and manage current and future trends.  
The most significant of these are identified here. 
  More detail on the trends affecting the Group can be found in the Principal Risks section, pages 36 to 39
Context to DMGT
• Technological change and the speed 
at which customers are adopting 
new technologies in our key markets 
are accelerating at a pace never 
seen before, irrevocably changing 
and erasing more traditional 
business models. 
Market trend
• The speed of technology evolution is 
increasing the capital intensity of IT 
investment and product development 
such that business investment horizons 
have changed compared with previous 
economic cycles.
Our approach
• As an entrepreneurial Group focused 
on digital growth, DMGT stays ahead 
by continually fostering innovation 
and embracing new ideas. This is best 
reflected by DMGT’s expectation 
of investing at least 5% of revenue 
in organic initiatives each year. 
• As a company with a family heritage 
which encourages long-term thinking, 
DMGT can invest for the future. 
Throughout DMGT’s history, innovation 
and diversification have been essential 
elements of how we do business, and 
have given us a wealth of experience 
to draw on in order to adapt to 
market changes. 
• DMGT’s investment approach enables 
us to remain close to customers through 
our portfolio of businesses, gaining 
greater insight and understanding 
into exactly what our customers value, 
engage with, and ultimately, want to buy. 
Context to DMGT
• An ever-growing number of 
machines are producing, using, 
and communicating with virtually 
immeasurable amounts of information. 
Machine learning is what makes 
machines appear ‘intelligent’ by 
enabling them to understand concepts 
in their environment and also to learn. 
Through machine learning, a smart 
machine can change its future 
behaviour. These developments 
create opportunities for DMGT 
and its businesses. 
Market trend
• Machine learning gives rise to a spectrum 
of smart machine implementations 
helping to unearth insights in discrete 
datasets that were previously impossible 
to see. 
Our approach
• DMGT’s businesses help their customers 
to identify which information provides 
strategic value, access data from different 
sources and explore how algorithms 
leverage the Internet of Everything to 
fuel new business designs. This area is 
evolving quickly, and DMGT’s businesses 
are embracing the opportunity. 
• BuildFax uses different machine learning 
models, for instance, to estimate roof age 
from property characteristics where the 
business does not have high-confidence 
roof age data, and another model is 
used to estimate property conditions. 
• We are developing products and services 
across a number of our businesses, 
including sensing technology at 
Genscape and statistical analytics 
at Hobsons and RMS. 
Context to DMGT
• Across the global workforce but 
especially with millennials, top 
talent is drawn to companies that 
offer a compelling employee value 
proposition, incorporating purpose 
beyond profit, ongoing learning and 
development opportunities as well 
as competitive remuneration.
Market trend
• Demand for top talent is always fierce, 
however, in the critical areas of big data 
analytics, artificial intelligence and data 
science, demand in many labour markets 
outstrips supply. 
Our approach
• In competing for key employees, 
especially critical technology talent, 
DMGT is committed to enhancing its  
Group-wide employee proposition,  
defining the jobs of the future, for  
instance through its groundbreaking work 
in data science and predictive analytics. 
• DMGT supports training and development 
in order to enhance employees’ capabilities 
and transfer skills throughout the 
businesses. We also provide Group-wide 
initiatives such as our talent development 
programmes and workshops to encourage 
rising talent within DMGT.

CEO Review
Overview
In spite of challenging market conditions 
DMGT has delivered a resilient 
performance in a year of transformation 
at the Company. 
During the reporting period, we strengthened 
our balance sheet by reducing our holding 
in Euromoney; we agreed to divest assets; 
and we delivered cost savings through 
operational efficiency.
At the operating level, dmg media 
outperformed in its markets and many 
of our B2B companies delivered a robust 
performance, with the exception of Genscape 
and Xceligent. As a long-term investor, 
we continued to invest through the cycle, 
particularly at RMS, which successfully 
launched Risk Modeler on RMS(one), and 
dmg information. The Consumer Media 
business delivered good underlying profit 
growth, reflecting the progress made at 
MailOnline, which moved into operating 
profit during the final quarter. Adjusted 
operating and pre-tax profits declined 
year-on-year, mainly due to the reduced 
stake in Euromoney. 
The challenging conditions in many of our 
markets served as a further reminder of the 
need to transform our business. This work 
has begun as part of our Company-wide 
Performance Improvement Programme, 
which we are rolling out to better position 
us for consistent long-term growth.
Already, we have made good progress on 
the strategic priorities laid out at the start 
of the year: improving operational execution, 
increasing portfolio focus and enhancing 
financial flexibility. 
We have delayered management, reduced 
overheads, enhanced our talent and 
refocused each business’s priorities. We have 
sharpened our focus on our strongest brands 
and our financial flexibility has improved 
with net debt to EBITDA now at 1.4 times, 
the lowest level in over 20 years. 
I am confident that our programme of action 
will deliver long-term sustainable growth 
and shareholder returns.
We are building on strong foundations, as 
shown by aspects of our performance in the 
past financial year. For the year covered by 
this report, operational highlights include 
the sustained strong revenue growth and 
transition to profitability of MailOnline 
following a multi-year investment strategy; 
the successful delivery of RMS(one) in the 
Insurance Risk sector; and the restructuring 
and refocusing of our EdTech business, 
Hobsons, into a more growth oriented 
model focused on student success. 
Another focus area has been to strengthen 
our management team, both at the centre 
and throughout the businesses, ensuring we 
have the right talent to improve performance 
and position DMGT for the future. 
We managed our portfolio more actively, 
initially with the reduction in our stake in 
Euromoney and subsequently with the sale 
of Elite Daily in Consumer Media and the 
Admissions business within the EdTech 
sector. This, coupled with a renewed focus 
on cash generation, has lowered our debt, 
strengthened our leverage ratios, and 
ultimately given us the financial flexibility 
to take advantage of opportunities as 
they arise. 
The carrying values of Genscape, the Energy 
Information business, and two early-stage 
US Property Information businesses, 
Xceligent and SiteCompli, were impaired. 
This decision reflected a more cautious 
outlook for each of these businesses.
At Genscape, which faced challenging market 
conditions during the year with low levels of 
price volatility, a sustained low oil price and 
changes to solar energy distribution channels 
in the US, the carrying value of the business 
has been reduced to £141 million, resulting 
in an impairment charge of £140 million.
Expansion into the national market has been 
slower than previously expected at Xceligent 
and SiteCompli, notably Xceligent’s revenue 
growth in New York, which it launched into 
during the year. Given the further investment 
required in Xceligent and the long path to 
cash generation, the prudent decision has 
been taken to incur a full impairment charge 
of £65 million in respect of both businesses. 
I am confident, however, that DMGT is on 
track to becoming a higher performance 
business with a strong balance sheet to 
deliver on our long-term potential. We are 
laying the groundwork to position the 
Group for further success. Above all, 
our commitment remains to deliver 
on DMGT’s full potential.
Financial Performance 
Group revenues grew by 1% on an underlying 
basis, reflecting good growth from our digital 
consumer business, MailOnline, and modest 
progress elsewhere in the Group. Operating 
profit declined by an underlying 2%, 
primarily due to our investments in the 
B2B businesses and amortisation costs at 
RMS. There was encouraging underlying 
profit growth at dmg media, driven by 
good cost control and increasing MailOnline 
profitability. This was offset by profit 
declines at dmg information and RMS. 
The performance of dmg information 
was adversely affected by the challenges 
at Genscape and Xceligent.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Paul Zwillenberg
CEO
In FY 2017 , we started to deliver on the clear 
strategic priorities laid out at the start of the 
year; improving operational execution, 
increasing portfolio focus and enhancing 
financial flexibility .
Statutory operating profit and profit 
before tax were adversely affected by the 
impairments at dmg information but statutory 
earnings per share increased 69% due to 
the gain on the Euromoney transaction. 
Year end net debt of £464 million was 
£214 million lower than in FY 2016, reflecting 
the net operating cash inflow and disposal 
proceeds. The net debt to EBITDA ratio 
of 1.4 times was comfortably below the 
Group’s preferred upper limit of 2.0 times.
The strengthening of the balance sheet was 
an important achievement during the year. 
In the Financial Review (pages 25 to 31), 
Tim Collier, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
describes our financial performance in 
further detail. Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) are used to measure DMGT’s 
performance at a Group level and there is 
an update on how these have progressed 
during the reporting period on pages 14 
and 15 of the Strategic Report.
2017 Strategic Priorities
In December 2016, I outlined three strategic 
priorities that will help position DMGT for 
the future. While there is much more to do, 
we have made good, clear progress 
with the launch of our Performance 
Improvement Programme.
Improving operational execution
The first priority of improving operational 
execution included enhancing our 
performance management system and 
eliminating red tape to ensure that we are 
faster, fitter and more agile. These areas 
will help us deliver on our investments, 
ultimately driving value creation across 
the Group.
As a part of this, we remodelled and 
strengthened our central management team, 
drawing heavily on existing DMGT talent.
Key internal promotions included a 
Group Head of Strategy & Performance 
Management, Group HR Director, Group 
Chief Information Officer, and Group Head of 
M&A, alongside the external appointment of 
a new Group CFO. Among our businesses, we 
also made a number of senior appointments 
including new Presidents, CEOs and Chief 
Operating Officers, supplementing internal 
talent with external hires to broaden the 
industry expertise within the Group.
We have reduced the complexity of the 
management structure in the B2B portfolio, 
bringing the individual operating companies 
closer to the central management team. 
Above all, our aim has been to give each 
company the resources they require to fulfil 
their strategic ambitions, whilst supporting 
the extraordinary entrepreneurial spirit and 
talent that drives our success. In addition, 
we have increased our focus on nurturing 
and developing rising talent as well as 
bolstering skills critical for our future such 
as technology, customer solutions and 
data science capabilities.
From a business perspective, the operational 
improvements have driven significant 
progress in three particular areas. 
Firstly, RMS executed the successful launch 
and rollout of the Risk Modeler application 
on RMS(one), the new platform for digitising 
risk for the insurance industry. RMS also 
delivered RiskLink17 and an unprecedented 
array of modelling solutions, with major 
updates to its core models and the release 
of several entirely new models. With the 
gradual client migration to RMS(one) and 
continued strong model development, RMS 
is poised to deliver good long-term growth 
and returns in support of the Insurance Risk 
sector’s digital transformation.
FY 2017 saw  
a major focus on 
strengthening our 
management teams, 
enhancing our 
performance 
management system 
and eliminating red 
tape to ensure that 
we are faster and 
more agile.”
Reported results were impacted by the 
reduction in our stake of Euromoney to 
c.49% in December 2016, whereupon 
it became an associate for the final nine 
months of the financial year. Pro forma 
reported revenue, adjusting for the 
Euromoney transaction, increased by 3%, 
reflecting the benefit of the stronger US 
dollar versus the British pound. The Group’s 
pro forma operating profit was up 2%, 
with an operating profit margin of 12%.
Group adjusted profit before tax and 
earnings per share were down 13% and 1% 
respectively, although up by 4% and 7% on 
a pro forma basis, and the recommended 
dividend per share was up 3%.
The Board remains committed to delivering 
dividend growth in excess of inflation, 
consistent with our dividend policy.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Secondly, we have been encouraged by 
continued strong growth from MailOnline, 
where revenues reached £119 million, 
up an underlying 20%. The performance 
was driven by its growing global audience, 
content and distribution partnerships with 
global platforms Google, Facebook and 
Snapchat, and strong performance in 
programmatic advertising in the US and 
UK. The increased scale of the business, 
combined with a deep focus on operational 
efficiencies, resulted in MailOnline moving 
into operating profit during the final quarter 
of the financial year.
Finally, in the EdTech sector, Hobsons 
made good progress on strengthening 
its high growth Student Success solutions 
for US High School and College students 
following a refocusing and restructuring 
of the business. In particular, the 
modernisation of the Naviance platform to 
improve customer experience is progressing 
well and will continue to be a core focus of 
Hobsons’ activity this coming year. Looking 
forward, we are optimistic about the future 
growth prospects for its Naviance, Intersect 
and Starfish products.
Increasing portfolio focus
By increasing our portfolio focus, DMGT is 
seeing the benefits of a more streamlined 
structure. In FY 2017 we began a major 
strategic review, working through every 
business in the portfolio to understand 
its potential growth and returns and the 
resources required to achieve this.
The first significant step in delivering 
increased portfolio focus was the reduction 
in our stake in Euromoney in December 2016 
to c.49%. This was followed by the disposal 
of Elite Daily and closure of 7 Days in the 
Consumer Media sector. Within EdTech, 
we split the Hobsons business into the faster 
growing Student Success and the more 
mature Admissions and Solutions businesses 
to enable a distinct approach to managing 
the two parts. Both the Admissions and 
Solutions businesses were disposed of, in 
September and October 2017 respectively. 
The disposal of EDR, the US Property 
Information business, is currently underway 
and will further sharpen DMGT’s focus.
Delivering against clear strategic priorities
CEO Review
A clear strategy and bold vision for the future
We have defined a new strategic vision for DMGT entitled 
‘Intelligent Insights. Consumer Connections’. Due to the Group’s 
strengths and capabilities across B2B and Consumer Media, 
DMGT has a competitive advantage from two important 
converging trends across these sectors. Firstly, in B2B sectors, 
customers increasingly expect to have the same quality of user 
interface as they do with consumer products. Secondly, the 
most successful consumer products are built on robust use of 
data and analytics to gain insight. The agility, speed to market, 
user engagement and audience understanding demonstrated 
by MailOnline can be applied within our B2B businesses. The 
advanced analytics and resilient and secure technology required 
in our B2B sectors can be applied to Consumer Media digital 
businesses. DMGT’s strategy will be focused on seeking 
opportunities, either through organic initiatives or acquisition, 
which can exploit the converging trends across the B2B and 
Consumer Media sectors.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Enhancing financial flexibility
Through our improved operational execution 
and increased portfolio focus, we have 
achieved a stronger balance sheet. At the 
year end, net debt was £464 million with 
a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times, the 
lowest it has been in over 20 years, as a 
result of disposal proceeds and continuing 
healthy cash generation. We now have more 
flexibility to invest behind our businesses, 
both organically and via acquisition, to 
support long-term growth and value creation.
In pursuing a balanced capital allocation 
approach, we remain committed to 
increasing shareholder returns through 
sustainable real dividend growth.
Strategy update
A new strategic vision has been defined 
based on the convergence of trends within 
B2B and Consumer Media and the strong 
position that DMGT is in given the breadth 
of expertise across the Group.
We have begun to execute on the 
Performance Improvement Programme, 
which will deliver results against our three 
key strategic priorities. Building on the solid 
foundations established through recent 
operational initiatives, DMGT’s performance 
and execution will be improved through 
upgrading businesses’ technology, sales 
force effectiveness and pricing capabilities. 
The increasing focus of the portfolio will 
be driven by the Group’s strengths, 
notably where the convergence of B2B and 
Consumer Media gives DMGT a competitive 
advantage. DMGT will also ensure it has the 
financial flexibility to pursue opportunities 
as they arise, notably to build scale in those 
sectors that can deliver focused growth.
Outlook
We have started the new financial year 
with our businesses performing in line 
with our expectations. FY 2018 will be an 
important year of transition for DMGT as we 
continue to lay the necessary groundwork 
for the future. 
The markets in which we operate continue 
to be disrupted by new technologies, volatile 
demand and changing consumption habits 
among the audiences we serve.
In B2B, the financial performance will 
be adversely affected by disposals. 
Despite challenging market conditions, we 
nevertheless expect B2B to deliver modest 
underlying revenue growth, reflecting 
the benefits of increased focus. On the 
Consumer Media side, digital revenues are 
expected to grow further, helping to offset 
anticipated circulation volume and print 
advertising declines, with advertising  
market conditions likely to remain volatile. 
The Consumer Media operating profit is 
expected to reflect lower overall revenues, 
continued cost efficiencies within the 
newspapers and MailOnline being profitable.
The Board remains confident that DMGT 
has good long-term prospects, supported 
by a more flexible balance sheet and by the 
entrepreneurialism, purpose and passion 
that are so distinctive in the Group. 
I am confident that the Performance 
Improvement Programme will generate 
long-term sustainable growth. And it will 
help us to navigate near term challenging 
trading conditions. This will, in turn, enable 
us to maintain our progressive dividend 
policy, with a commitment to growing 
shareholder returns.
We look forward to delivering on  
DMGT’s potential.

Investment criteria 
We have conducted a rigorous evaluation 
of all our businesses as part of our strategic 
review. We aim to position DMGT for the 
future and, in particular, for what we refer 
to as a ‘Digital 4.0’ world, where artificial 
intelligence, machine learning on big data 
and the use of predictive analytics play an 
increasingly important role. 
In maintaining a diversified portfolio, 
with a more focused investment approach, 
we can allocate resources according to each 
individual business’s growth characteristics 
and funding requirements. The five broad 
investment criteria used are shown here:

DMGT is a portfolio of different companies. Many Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are targeted by our individual businesses,  
such as revenue per client as well as non-financial measures including customer numbers and audience reach, are not appropriate at a 
consolidated Group level. The KPIs shown below, however, are considered to be good indicators of the Group’s overall progress against 
its strategic priorities.
A new KPI, Group adjusted cash operating income, has been introduced, reflecting the focus on improving the cash generation of the 
individual businesses within the portfolio over time. International revenues as a percentage of total revenues is no longer a KPI as DMGT 
is not targeting a specific change to the existing mix.

Euromoney
In December 2016, DMGT reduced its stake 
in Euromoney and the company ceased to 
be a subsidiary of DMGT and became an 
associate. To allow a like-for-like comparison, 
2016 pro forma results have been presented 
based on a c.67% stake in Euromoney during 
the first quarter of the year and a c.49% 
stake during the final three-quarters, 
consistent with the actual holding during 
FY 2017. Underlying revenue and operating 
profit growth rates exclude Euromoney. 
The results of Euromoney are described 
within JVs & Associates on page 24.
Performance 
Revenues from B2B totalled £976 million, 
up 9% on a pro forma basis, including the 
benefit of the stronger US dollar versus 
the British pound. On an underlying basis, 
B2B revenues grew 2%, with growth from 
Hobsons, dmg events, RMS and Genscape 
and stable revenues from the Property 
Information businesses. B2B adjusted 
operating profits, excluding any allocation 
of Group corporate costs, were £152 million, 
a reduction of 5% on a pro forma basis and 
an underlying decline of 15%, largely driven 
by RMS, where amortisation costs increased, 
and within dmg information, by Xceligent 
and Genscape. The overall B2B operating 
margin declined to 16%, down from 18% on 
a pro forma basis in FY 2016, reflecting lower 
margins across each of RMS, dmg information 
and dmg events.
dmg information restructure 
DMGT has historically reported the results 
of Property Information, EdTech and 
Energy Information businesses within 
dmg information. In FY 2017, DMGT undertook 
a management delayering project to 
reduce complexity and move the operating 
companies closer to decision-making by 
the Group’s central management team. 
For the purposes of this Annual Report, 
these businesses will appear as part of 
dmg information and from FY 2018 will be 
presented as part of the overall B2B portfolio, 
with dmg information no longer in place. 
Outlook
Our B2B companies are collectively expected 
to deliver low single-digit underlying revenue 
growth in FY 2018, although revenues will be 
adversely affected by the disposals that have 
taken place in the past year and the planned 
disposal of EDR. In the Insurance Risk sector, 
RMS will continue to expand the client 
base for the RMS(one) software platform 
and associated applications, laying the 
groundwork for revenue acceleration 
in FY 2019 and beyond. In the Property 
Information sector, the European businesses 
are expected to continue to experience 
relatively subdued market conditions and 
the remaining US businesses to continue 
to deliver growth. Following the disposal 
of Hobsons’ Admissions and Solutions 
businesses, the remaining EdTech business 
is expected to benefit from increased focus 
and to continue to deliver growth. In the 
Energy Information sector, Genscape is  
also expected to deliver growth across most 
of its sub-sectors, albeit the challenging 
market conditions are expected to persist. 
Despite challenges in some Events and 
Exhibitions end markets, notably the energy 
sector and some Gulf Cooperation Council 
countries, and the expected reduction in 
revenues from Gastech reflecting the change 
in location in 2018, dmg events is well 
positioned to continue delivering underlying 
revenue growth.
There continues to be a focus on improving 
operational execution, combined with laying 
the foundations for long-term growth. The 
adjusted operating profit margin for B2B is 
expected to be in the mid-teens in FY 2018.

RMS is focused on execution and 
investment for organic growth, in both 
its core modelling business and the new 
risk management platform, RMS(one). 
RMS has delivered an unprecedented 
level of modelling solutions in FY 2017, 
with updates to the North American 
Earthquake and North American 
Hurricane models, new models for Asian 
earthquakes and typhoons, and further 
expansion into new lines of risk with 
the second release of our cyber models. 
The release of the second RMS(one) 
application, Risk Modeler, was also a key 
milestone for the business in FY 2017.
Business model
RMS offers models, data, services and 
software to insurers, brokers and reinsurers. 
Its solutions are also increasingly in demand 
from capital market entrants into the risk 
and insurance market.
Revenues are derived mainly from annual 
subscriptions to its models and data 
intellectual property. RMS also offers 
a variety of analytical, managed and 
hosted services.
Performance highlights
RMS produced underlying revenue growth 
of 2%. Reported revenues were up 14% to 
£233 million reflecting the benefit of the 
stronger US dollar versus the British pound. 
The business achieved this solid revenue 
performance, in line with expectations, 
despite the continuing adverse impact of 
some client consolidation. There was good 
demand for RMS core subscription services, 
with renewal rates remaining above 95%.
As previously indicated, capitalisation of 
RMS(one) development activities ceased 
and the amortisation of the RMS(one) asset 
started in August 2016. Consequently, 
operating profit declined by an underlying 
25% to £33 million with an operating margin 
of 14%, broadly in line with the low-teens 
guidance provided in December 2016. RMS 
continue to invest strongly in its modelling 
business to underpin its market position 
and long-term growth trajectory. Excluding 
the benefit of the £13 million of RMS(one) 
capitalisation in the prior period, as well as 
depreciation and amortisation, the EBITDA 
margin was 24%, an improvement on the 
17% in FY 2016. 
RMS continues to lead in the risk modelling 
market. In April 2017, RMS released 
RiskLink17, which included updates to 
five models, notably North American 
Earthquake, and three new models: South 
East Asia Earthquake, Taiwan Typhoon 
and South Korea Typhoon. 
A major milestone was achieved in April 2017, 
with the release of Risk Modeler, the second 
application to run on the RMS(one) risk 
management platform, and over a dozen 
clients are now using applications on 
RMS(one). Given the enterprise acceptance 
testing required during the clients’ adoption 
processes and the relatively slow roll-out, 
the revenues from RMS(one) are expected 
to have a more significant impact on 
RMS’s overall revenue growth and margin 
improvement in FY 2019 and beyond. 
The increasing pace of digitalisation across 
the risk and insurance market combined 
with the requirement for real-time risk 
assessment on one risk modelling evaluation 
platform that has integrated data analytics 
is expected to create progressive demand 
for the RMS(one) platform. 
The appointment of a new President, 
reporting to the CEO, to lead RMS 
market-facing activities has increased the 
client focus during 2017, especially in the 
areas of client service and delivering 
high-value solutions to clients. 
Priorities in the year ahead
The main areas of focus for the RMS 
management team in FY 2018 will be on 
the continued successful development 
and delivery of its core and new models to 
clients and managing the gradual migration 
of clients to the RMS(one) platform. 
The RMS model pipeline remains strong, 
reflecting an ongoing commitment to 
strengthen the business’s market-leading 
position. The model pipeline for 2018 covers 
a wide range of perils, including North 
America Flood, Central and Western 
European Storm, Indian Flood, Japanese 
Earthquake and Typhoon and North American 
Wild Fire. The pipeline includes high 
definition models, which provide increased 
granularity, as a key differentiated offering.

For the purposes of this Annual Report 
for FY 2017, these businesses will appear 
as part of dmg information and from 
FY 2018 will be presented as part 
of the overall B2B portfolio, with 
dmg information no longer in place. 
Performance summary
dmg information revenues were £531 million, 
up 7% on a reported basis and 2% on an 
underlying basis. Growth from the US 
Property Information, EdTech and Energy 
Information businesses was partly offset 
by a decline in revenues from the European 
Property Information businesses. 
Operating profit decreased by an underlying 
13% to £69 million, with an operating margin 
of 13%. The decline in profit compared to 
the previous year was due in large part to 
investment in the roll-out of Xceligent, one 
of the US Property Information companies.

the sectors can be found in the following

Property Information
Revenue
£328m
Business model
The Property Information portfolio  
operates in the US, UK and Germany. 
Companies within the portfolio derive their 
revenues from providing services that use 
technology, data and workflow to streamline 
and help reduce the risk associated with 
commercial and residential property 
transactions. In addition, Trepp in the US 
provides risk, valuation and data solutions 
for the CMBS market. Revenues are 
generated from subscriptions as well  
as volume-related transactions.
Performance highlights
The Property Information portfolio’s 
revenues grew by 7%, including the benefit 
of the stronger US dollar and Euro relative to 
the British pound, and were in line with the 
prior year on an underlying basis. The five 
US-based businesses collectively delivered 
underlying revenue growth of 5%, offset by 
a 3% decline in underlying revenue in Europe. 
Adjusted operating profit declined by 4% on 
a reported basis and 9% on an underlying 
basis, reflecting planned investment in 
Xceligent, which more than offset operating 
profit growth from the European businesses. 
US
Trepp, the securitised mortgage data and 
analytics business, delivered another year 
of underlying revenue growth, reflecting 
continued investment in its core services. 
EDR, which is a leading provider of data and 
workflow for US commercial real estate due 
diligence, was adversely impacted by lower 
real estate transaction volumes and the 
business experienced an underlying decline 
in revenues in the year. EDR is pursuing 
growth opportunities in managed services, 
an area the market is expected to transition 
towards. Service industries are not a 
preferred area of growth for DMGT and 
consequently a process is underway to 
dispose of EDR to a more appropriate owner. 
This will further increase the focus within 
the portfolio and enhance DMGT’s financial 
flexibility. The earlier stage businesses, 
Xceligent, SiteCompli and BuildFax, 
continued to grow in the year. Xceligent’s 
revenue growth in new markets, notably 
New York, has been slower than previously 
expected and, given the significant further 
investment and time required to achieve full 
national coverage, a decision has been taken 
to reduce the carrying value of the business 
to zero, resulting in an impairment charge of 
£42 million. Similarly, SiteCompli’s planned 
expansion into the national retail market has 
proved more challenging than previously 
expected and an impairment charge of 
£24 million has been taken in respect of 
its carrying value. Xceligent now has a new 
management team in place and a strategic 
review of the business is in progress,  
whilst the SiteCompli management team  
are focusing on growth opportunities.
Europe
The European Property Information 
businesses, which include Landmark 
and SearchFlow in the UK and On-Geo in 
Germany, experienced a modest underlying 
revenue decline as lower residential 
property transaction volumes and mortgage 
approvals adversely impacted trading. 
In the legal property market, SearchFlow 
delivered a major upgrade of its ordering 
platform while Landmark continued to 
deliver enhancements to its range of 
conveyancing searches. In the mortgage 
lending market, Landmark successfully 
deployed its new Valuation Risk Hub with the 
first lender and surveyor clients. Landmark 
has also made significant first steps into 
the UK household insurance market with 
long-term agreements to provide its risk 
models to leading providers in the industry. 
At the same time, Landmark has continued 
to focus on operational efficiencies, 
delivering operating margin improvement 
despite lower revenues, and evolving its 
cost base as the business develops. 
Priorities in the year ahead
In the US, there will be continued investment 
in several growth initiatives across the 
portfolio. There will also be ongoing product 
development at Trepp to enhance its 
market-leading position. In Europe, 
Landmark expects to continue with its 
dynamic new product development and 
launch programme.

EdTech
Revenue
£114m
Business model
Hobsons operates in the education 
technology market and is a leading provider 
of college and career readiness and student 
success solutions in the US. Hobsons helps 
students identify their strengths, explore 
careers, create academic plans and match 
these to educational opportunities. 
Hobsons’ revenues are mainly derived 
from subscription contracts with a wide 
range of educational institutions.
Performance highlights 
Hobsons produced another year of 
underlying growth with revenues up 9%. 
There was continued strong growth from its 
K-12 career and college planning platform, 
Naviance, its college matching business, 
Intersect and its higher education student 
retention business, Starfish. Hobsons’ 
Admissions business was operating in 
an increasingly competitive environment 
and experienced declining revenue. 
Following a strategic review of Hobsons, 
the business underwent a refocusing and 
restructuring programme. Hobsons was 
split into two distinct areas to provide a 
dedicated management team for each, 
namely the fast-growing student success 
businesses for college and career readiness, 
matching and retention (Naviance, Intersect 
and Starfish) and the more mature 
Admissions and Solutions businesses. 
Following this restructure, the Admissions 
and Solutions businesses were sold 
in September and October 2017 respectively.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report There was a solid profit performance in core 
Energy areas which was more than offset by 
weaker trading performance at Locus Energy 
and our planned investment in building new 
products and enhancing existing services. 
Genscape is bringing transparency to global 
energy markets by building global product 
offerings and continuing to move up the 
value chain by providing analytics and 
forecasts. For example, Genscape Power 
has expanded its services to deregulated 
markets in Mexico and Japan. Genscape 
is developing a real-time, comprehensive 
and accurate global crude oil supply and 
demand product and is expanding its 
proprietary sensor network to monitor 
industrial facilities.
Given the continued challenges facing the 
Energy Information sector, notably solar, 
and the likely time required before the 
business becomes a major cash generator, 
the carrying value of the Genscape business 
has been reduced to £141 million, resulting 
in an impairment charge of £140 million.
Priorities in the year ahead 
Under Genscape’s new management team, 
the business will continue to invest in new 
products and service development and its 
long-term growth trajectory remains strong, 
despite the current challenging market 
conditions. One of the key priorities will be 
to reposition the Locus Energy product suite 
given recent market changes in distribution.
After delivering some pricing model 
improvements this year, Genscape will 
continue to drive operational improvements, 
particularly around pricing and an enhanced 
go-to-market strategy.

Operationally, Hobsons made good progress 
in strengthening its core products and 
services. The first phase of Naviance 
platform modernisation was launched, 
improving the user interface and mobile 
responsiveness of the student-facing 
components of Naviance. Naviance was 
also successfully transitioned to a cloud 
computing platform during the year. A new 
centralised modern platform for Intersect 
was built. Two new products were delivered 
on the platform and progress is underway 
to incorporate all existing matching 
products into the new platform. In July 2017 
Hobsons released Starfish 7 which includes 
predictive analytics based on the research 
and methodologies developed by PAR 
Framework, a business acquired in 2016, 
that will deliver useful data to advisers 
and institutional leadership teams. This 
product is expected to help support the 
continued growth of this early-stage business.
A major project to upgrade the sales force 
was also undertaken. A more structured, 
focused and data-driven approach has 
been adopted to enhance team capabilities 
and better profile and target customers.
Priorities in the year ahead
FY 2018 will be another year of transition 
for Hobsons as it continues to refocus 
and strengthen its high-value, high-growth 
core products and services. Operational 
improvements are expected to flow 
through as the cost base is streamlined and 
an agile methodology is adopted across core 
internal processes. Hobsons will continue 
with its long-term objective to become 
the trusted partner for institutions and 
communities using digital solutions to 
drive student success.

Business model
Genscape delivers innovative solutions to 
improve market transparency and efficiency 
across several asset classes including oil, 
power, natural gas and liquid natural gas, 
agriculture, maritime and renewables. 
Genscape provides its customers with 
fundamental data, intelligence and real-time 
alerts, workflow tools and predictive 
analytics to better manage volatility, 
make complex decisions and increase the 
efficiency of their supply chains. Revenues 
are mainly subscription based through 
annual and multi-year client contracts.
Performance highlights 
Genscape delivered underlying revenue 
growth of 1% in the year. The core 
businesses operating in the power, oil 
and gas sectors continued to grow despite 
the sustained low oil price and low price 
volatility environment, reflecting good 
ongoing product development and client 
expansion. The solar business, Locus Energy, 
experienced challenging market conditions, 
with sales of monitors adversely affected 
by a market shift in distribution channels.

dmg events is focused on seeking new 
opportunities for customers in emerging 
markets, leading to 10 new events 
being launched in FY 2017 with five 
more planned for FY 2018. dmg events 
hosted over 50 events attracting over 
300,000 visitors and exhibitors from 
more than 100 different countries.
Business model
dmg events is an organiser of B2B exhibitions 
and associated conferences with industry-
leading events in the energy, construction, 
interiors, hotel, hospitality and leisure 
sectors. The strong market and brand 
positions, emerging market experience and 
entrepreneurial culture create opportunities 
for growth through geo-cloning existing 
events into new locations and by creating 
spin-off sections to become standalone 
events. The key branded events are the Big 5, 
ADIPEC, INDEX, Gastech and The Hotel Show 
which all provide opportunities to develop 
our spin-off and geo-clone strategy. 
Revenues are derived from exhibitor, 
sponsorship and delegate fees and over 
60% of revenues are generated from the 
top five events. 
Performance highlights 
dmg events produced a resilient 
performance in FY 2017, delivering 3% 
underlying revenue growth, despite the 
continued weakness in the oil price. 
Reported revenues grew by 11% due 
to the strength of the US dollar relative 
to the British pound. 
The key branded events of the Big 5, 
ADIPEC and Gastech all produced good 
levels of visitor and exhibitor growth. 
Gastech produced double-digit levels of 
revenue growth due to a larger conference 
programme, increased popularity with 
sponsors and exhibitors and the positive 
effect of changing the location to Japan, the 
world’s largest liquefied natural gas market. 
The Global Petroleum Show, however, was 
impacted by the tough Canadian energy 
sector which has experienced strong 
headwinds during FY 2017. 
dmg events continued to geo-clone shows 
by launching into new locations, including 
two South African events, The Hotel Show 
Africa and Oil & Gas Africa, as well as East 
Africa Big 5 and Saudi Stone. A number 
of new spin-off events launched into 
adjacencies from the existing construction, 
energy and hospitality sectors.
Operating profit declined by 7% on an 
underlying basis reflecting the tough 
conditions in the Canadian energy events 
market and investment in the strong launch 
programme for both FY 2017 and FY 2018. 
Action was taken to address the challenging 
market conditions, through disposing of five 
events and closing three events during the 
year. Operating margins were, however, 
a healthy 26% due to strong cost control, 
low overheads and a more effective digital 
marketing approach. 
Revenue
£117m
Events and Exhibitions: dmg events
Key developments
• Robust revenue growth despite 
challenging energy event market 
conditions: Gastech revenues in 
Japan grew by over 20% on the 
previous event.
• Geo-cloning: strong performance 
of new geo-clones in key sectors. 
• Spin-offs: successful development 
of spin-off events.
• Prior year acquisition of Exhibition 
Management Services drove two 
new launches in FY 2017: Oil & Gas 
Africa and The Hotel Show Africa.
Priorities for the year ahead
dmg events will remain focused on 
developing its key large-scale market-leading 
events. These events have the potential to 
continue to grow and are key brands capable 
of future geo-cloning and generating new 
spin-off events. The teams will continue to 
create new relevant event content whilst 
also focusing on enhancing the customer 
experience through the increased use of 
mobile technology and data analytics. 
The five launches planned for 2018 in North 
Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia 
illustrate the continued strong commitment 
to organic growth.

dmg media has continued to focus on 
delivering quality, popular journalism 
to a large audience on a global basis. 
A multi-year investment programme, 
positioning dmg media as a modern news 
media company, has ensured that the 
business has prospered in an increasingly 
digital-oriented consumer market. 
The combined strength of the Mail and 
Metro brands creates opportunities to 
position dmg media’s proposition to 
advertisers through a sophisticated 
and targeted omni-channel approach.
Business model
dmg media’s portfolio of news media 
businesses includes two of the UK’s most 
read paid-for newspapers, the Daily Mail 
and The Mail on Sunday, and MailOnline, 
which attracts an average 15 million unique 
browsers each day. The Mail brand has the 
largest reach of any commercial news media 
brand in the UK and has achieved scale in 
other geographic markets, including the 
US and Australia. Metro, dmg media’s 
free newspaper, has the largest weekday 
newspaper readership in the UK each month. 
Combined, the Mail and Metro brands reach 
c.70% of the UK’s adult population each 
month. dmg media’s revenues are generated 
mainly from advertising and circulation 
revenues. While the newspaper businesses 
continue to generate strong profits and cash 
flow, the digital businesses are the driver 
of dmg media’s future growth.
Performance highlights 
dmg media delivered an encouraging 
performance in the year. Revenues were  
up 1% on an underlying basis, with the 
decline in print advertising revenues of  
5% being more than offset by digital 
advertising growth, up 18%, and a stable 
circulation performance. 
Revenues were £683 million, representing 
an absolute decline of 3%, with the benefit 
of the strong US dollar and the inclusion of 
MailOnline Australia’s revenue being offset 
by the disposal of Elite Daily in April 2017 
and the decline in revenues from reselling 
newsprint. The disposal of Elite Daily has 
enabled dmg media to concentrate its 
digital resources on MailOnline. 
Adjusted operating profit was £77 million, 
an underlying increase of 10%, reflecting 
growth in digital revenues, good progress 
on MailOnline’s path to profitability and 
cost savings in the newspaper businesses, 
primarily the closure of the Didcot printing 
plant. These were partially offset by the 
decline in print advertising revenues. 
The operating margin remained relatively 
healthy at 11%.
Mail businesses
Revenues for the combined newspaper and 
website businesses (the Daily Mail, The Mail 
on Sunday and MailOnline) were in line 
on an underlying basis, at £574 million, 
despite continued challenging conditions 
in the print advertising market. The 10% 
underlying decline in print advertising 
revenue to £131 million was offset by the 
strong performance at MailOnline, which 
grew revenues by an underlying 20% to 
£119 million, whilst circulation revenues 
of £308 million remained stable on an 
underlying basis. 
Total advertising revenues from the Mail 
titles were £248 million, up £7m, representing 
an increase of 2% on an underlying basis. 
Whilst the UK newspaper advertising market 
continued to decline, Mail Newspapers 
outperformed the market. Print advertising 
decreased by an underlying 10%, compared 
to the 13% decline during FY 2016. 
The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday 
continue to outperform their markets, 
holding significant market shares, averaging 
23.4% and 22.1% for the year respectively. 
The robust revenue performance was 
achieved due to the full-year benefit of  
cover price increases in FY 2016 and FY 2017 
offsetting the declining circulation volumes. 
Since the year-end the cover price of The Mail 
on Sunday increased from £1.70 to £1.80 
in October 2017.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report MailOnline generated strong levels of 
underlying revenue growth in FY 2017 
of 20%. In the US, MailOnline’s revenues 
grew by an underlying 36%, reflecting the 
increased traffic, further product innovation 
and the partnerships with Facebook and 
Snapchat. The audience on the core sites 
continues to grow, with 14.9 million average 
daily global unique browsers during the year, 
up 4%, and the site attracted on average 
227 million monthly global unique browsers 
during the year. 
Engagement levels have also increased 
which, alongside the growth in global 
audiences and ability to provide 
programmatic advertising solutions with 
data analytics, creates a compelling offering 
for advertising clients. MailOnline has 
continued to focus on increasing the size 
and engagement level of its global audience, 
particularly in the US and Australian 
markets. The growth strategy is far-reaching 
and includes providing new video advertising 
formats, working in collaboration with 
our key commercial partners, Facebook, 
Snapchat and Google. It also includes 
DailyMailTV, a joint venture which launched 
successfully in the US in September 2017  
and which attracted an average of 1.3 million 
viewers a night by its eighth week. This 
makes DailyMailTV the highest-rated debut 
of a national news magazine show since 2007. 
In the UK, the Mail Advertising team has 
created a compelling, multi-channel 
advertising solution which continues to 
gain traction and has supported continued 
market outperformance. dmg media’s 
approach has created a more effective, 
creative and increasingly targeted 
proposition to advertisers which is vital 
in the dynamic market conditions in which 
we operate. 
Metro
Metro delivered a strong revenue 
performance in the context of a declining 
print advertising market, growing underlying 
revenues by 7% over the year. The 
performance reflects increased circulation 
in London as well as taking on four regional 
franchises from Trinity Mirror in January 
2017. Metro has the largest circulation of any 
weekday newspaper in the UK, is read by an 
average of 3.1 million people each day and 
has the largest Monday to Friday advertising 
market share by volume. The challenging 
print advertising market conditions are 
expected to continue and Metro will 
remain focused on defending its profitability 
whilst ensuring that the quality of the 
newspaper and its creative approach 
to advertising remains. 
Priorities in the year ahead
dmg media will continue to harness the 
value of the Mail brands for both readers 
and advertisers and invest in the quality of 
its popular journalism to drive and engage 
its global audiences. Operating efficiently 
with a relentless focus on an agile cost base, 
combined with initiatives like the partnership 
advertising team, will also be important 
priorities. Significant investment has been 
made to establish MailOnline as a global 
market leader over the last few years  
and it is expected to achieve its first year  
of profitability in the coming year. 
Outlook 
Consumer Media is expected to continue 
to benefit from digital advertising growth 
and to experience circulation volume 
and print advertising declines, although 
advertising revenues will remain volatile. 
In FY 2018, the underlying rate of decline of 
dmg media’s revenues is expected to be in 
the mid-single digits. The operating margin 
is expected to be around 10% in FY 2018, 
compared to the 11% delivered in FY 2017, 
with the revenue reduction being partly 
offset by the benefit of continued cost 
efficiencies within the newspapers and by 
MailOnline achieving profitability for the full 
year in FY 2018.

JVs & Associates
As well as a diverse portfolio of operating 
businesses, DMGT holds two large 
associate interests, in Euromoney 
Institutional Investor PLC (Euromoney) 
and ZPG Plc, formerly Zoopla Property 
Group Plc. Euromoney and ZPG are 
both UK listed companies and as at 
30 September 2017 had a combined 
market value to DMGT of £1,101 million.
Other current JVs & Associates include:
• Insurance Risk – c.30% stake in Praedicat, 
which is dedicated to improving the 
underwriting and management of 
casualty risk;
• Property Information – c.40% stake in 
Real Capital Analytics, an authority on 
the deals, the players and the trends 
that drive the US commercial real estate 
investment markets; 
• Consumer Media – c.24% stake in 
Excalibur, which operates the online 
discount businesses Wowcher and 
LivingSocial UK; and 
• Consumer Media – c.50% stake in 
DailyMailTV. 
In FY 2017, the Group’s share of adjusted 
operating profits from its JVs & Associates 
was £69 million, including £47 million in 
respect of Euromoney for the nine months 
to September 2017, following the reduction 
in the Group’s stake in Euromoney to c.49%. 
Euromoney – DMGT holding c.49%
Euromoney was founded in 1969 by the then 
City editor of the Daily Mail and has grown 
into a FTSE 250, international business-to-
business information and events group. 
The portfolio consists of over 50 specialist 
businesses, spread across primary 
sectors including:
• Asset management – provides 
independent research, critical news and 
data and runs networks and conferences 
for the asset management industry 
– e.g. BCA Research, Ned Davis Research, 
Institutional Investor;
• Pricing, data and market intelligence 
– provides information and analysis 
critical to clients’ business processes 
and workflows across the metals and 
mining, telecoms, insurance, airline and 
banking industries – e.g. Metal Bulletin, 
TelCap, CEIC;
• Banking and finance – provides market 
intelligence, news, training and 
conferences to the global finance industry 
– e.g. Euromoney, IMN, Global Capital; and 
• Commodity events – leading conferences 
in the metals, agriculture and energy 
sectors – e.g. Indaba, Global Grain.
Following the reduction in stake to 
c.49%, Euromoney’s balance sheet is 
now independent of DMGT’s, increasing 
Euromoney’s financial flexibility to 
be acquisitive and to accelerate the 
implementation of its strategy.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report DMGT’s long-term perspective and 
financial strength have enabled 
continued investment to support  
future growth opportunities. 
The Financial Review details DMGT’s 
performance during a year of transition, 
where new strategic priorities were 
established and investment to drive 
long-term growth continued. 
The statutory results reflect the exclusion of 
discontinued operations, namely Euromoney, 
from revenue, operating profit and profit 
before tax. As a result of the impairment of 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible 
assets associated with Genscape, Xceligent 
and SiteCompli, businesses in the Energy 
Information and Property Information 
sectors, DMGT made an operating loss in 
the year. Profit for the year was £342 million, 
an increase of 60% on the prior year, 
benefiting from gains on disposals and, 
similarly, earnings per share grew 69%. Good 
progress was made strengthening DMGT’s 
balance sheet during the year as borrowings 
reduced by 32% and the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes’ position improved, 
as they ended the year with a net surplus. 
The recommended total dividend for the 
year of 22.7 pence is up 3% on the prior year, 
continuing DMGT’s track record of delivering 
annual real dividend growth and reflecting 
the Board’s confidence in the Group’s ability 
to deliver long-term earnings growth.
The Board and management team use 
adjusted results and measures, rather than 
statutory results, to give greater insight to 
the financial performance of the Group and 
the way it is managed. Similarly, adjusted 
results are used in setting management 
remuneration. Adjusted results exclude 
certain items which, if included, could distort 
the understanding of performance during 
the year and the comparability between 
periods and businesses. Consequently, 
the rest of this Financial Review focuses on 
adjusted measures. The explanations for 
the different types of adjustment and the 
reconciliations to statutory results are shown 
on pages 28 to 31. Similarly, when assessing 
revenue and operating profit growth, the 
Board and management focus on underlying 
growth rates as the most meaningful 
like-for-like comparison between the current 
year and the prior year. A more detailed 
explanation and the calculations are shown 
on page 31.
There has been good progress against the 
three strategic priorities during the year, with 
the reduced stake in Euromoney, from c.67% 
to c.49% in December 2016, being the first 
significant step in increasing our portfolio 
focus. Euromoney consequently changed 
from being a subsidiary to being an associate. 
To give a more meaningful year-on-year 
comparison, prior year pro forma figures 
have been prepared assuming the same 
holding profile as during FY 2017, as shown 
on page 28.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Performance highlights
Performance in the year was broadly in line 
with our expectations, delivering underlying 
revenue growth, highlighting the benefit 
of a diversified portfolio in challenging 
market conditions. Operating profit declined 
on an underlying basis, however, as a result 
of the combination of these conditions for 
some of the B2B information businesses 
and our planned investment in long-term 
growth opportunities. 
The Group’s revenue grew 1% on an 
underlying basis including an encouraging 
5% for subscriptions and 3% for advertising, 
with digital growth driven by MailOnline 
outstripping the decline in print. Transaction 
revenues declined by an underlying 4%, 
reflecting challenging market conditions 
for European Property Information and 
the solar part of the Energy Information 
business. Revenues from events and 
training continued to grow whilst circulation 
revenues remained stable. Revenues grew 
3% on a pro forma
Ω
 basis and benefited 
from the stronger US dollar relative to the 
British pound.
The 2% underlying decline in Group 
adjusted operating profit was principally 
due to the increase in RMS(one) related 
amortisation costs, increased losses from 
dmg information’s Xceligent business and 
reduced profits from Genscape, where the 
solar energy business had a particularly 
challenging year. Adjusted profit before 
tax and adjusted earnings per share were 
adversely affected by the Euromoney 
transaction but grew by 4% and 7% 
respectively on a pro forma
Ω
 basis.
DMGT increased the strength of the balance 
sheet over the year, with the year-end net 
debt to EBITDA ratio reducing to 1.4, 
significantly below the Group’s preferred 
upper limit of around 2.0 times. The 
improved financial flexibility reflects 
the benefit from disposal proceeds and 
continued good cash flow generation. 
Revenue performance
Group revenues in the financial year grew 
1% on the prior year on an underlying basis. 
On a pro forma
Ω
 basis, revenues rose by 3% 
to £1,660 million reflecting the stronger 
US dollar relative to the British pound. 
The average exchange rate during the year 
was £1:$1.27 compared with £1:$1.42 in the 
prior year.
Revenues from B2B businesses grew 2% 
on an underlying basis, to £976 million. 
Within dmg information, continued 
underlying growth was achieved by the 
EdTech, US Property Information businesses 
and by the subscription based units within 
the Energy Information company, Genscape. 
This was, however, largely offset by declining 
transaction revenues from European Property 
Information and Genscape’s solar business, 
reflecting challenging market conditions. 
RMS and dmg events also continued to 
deliver underlying revenue growth. Reported 
revenues benefited strongly from favourable 
exchange rates as described above.
Revenues from the Consumer Media 
business, dmg media, were £683 million, 
up 1% on an underlying basis, with strong 
growth from MailOnline more than offsetting 
the decline from print advertising, whilst 
circulation revenues remained stable. 
The charts on page 27 demonstrate DMGT’s 
diverse revenue profile.
  Further detail on each operating 
business’s revenue performance can  
be found on pages 16 to 23
Operating profit performance 
In the financial year, adjusted operating 
profit of £198 million was down by 2% on 
an underlying basis with the reduction being 
largely attributed to the lower margin, as 
expected, at RMS and increased losses from 
Xceligent, and grew by 2% on a pro forma
Ω
 
basis. The reported operating profit 
benefited from the stronger US dollar, as 
previously indicated. The overall operating

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report margin was 12%, in line with the pro forma
Ω
 
margin in the prior year. 
The overall profit of the Group’s B2B 
operations was £152 million, down from 
£160 million, on a pro forma
Ω
 basis, with the 
reduction being attributable to RMS(one) 
amortisation, Xceligent losses and Genscape. 
The profit from dmg media was £77 million, 
an underlying increase of 10%, and 
corporate costs reduced by £11 million 
to £31 million. 
Cash operating income
Cash operating income is a performance 
metric used by DMGT to assess the cash 
generation of its businesses. It is calculated 
by adding back depreciation and amortisation 
expenses, which are non-cash items, to 
adjusted operating profit and then deducting 
capital expenditure. In the financial year, 
cash operating income for the Group as a 
whole was £199 million, up £27 million or 
16% on a pro forma
Ω
 basis, reflecting an 
improving profile at RMS. 
JVs & Associates
The Group’s share of the adjusted operating 
profits* of its JVs & Associates benefited by 
£43m from the inclusion of Euromoney as an 
associate for nine months of the year and, 
£30 million in the prior year on a pro forma
Ω 
basis. The adjusted tax rate for the year of 
12.8% reduced slightly from the pro forma
Ω
 
basis 13.9% in FY 2016, reflecting the 
increased use of historic UK tax losses, 
and was lower than previously anticipated 
due to the expected enactment of new UK 
legislation restricting the use of losses 
not taking place until after the year end. 
Due to the new legislation and to the 
geographical mix of profits, the effective tax 
rate is expected to increase to nearer 18% 
in FY 2018 and to increase further over the 
next few years, to over 20%.
The statutory tax charge for the year was 
£65 million. This excludes the charge of 
£4 million in respect of discontinued 
operations and £5 million in respect of joint 
ventures and associates. There were tax 
credits of £30 million in respect of the 
amortisation and impairment of intangible 
fixed assets, tax charges of £109 million in 
respect of tax losses that can no longer be 
recognised as deferred tax assets and tax 
credits of £35 million on other adjusting items. 
Profit after tax 
Adjusted Group profit after tax and minority 
interests was £196 million, 7% growth on

Further information on our JVs & Associates’ 
performance can be found on page 24 of

Financing costs
Adjusted net finance costs increased by 5% 
to £42 million. DMGT benefited from lower 
average net debt levels during the year but 
the interest payable was adversely affected 
by the stronger US dollar and an increase in 
the share of associates’ interest payable to 
£5 million, from £3 million in the prior year. 
The pension finance charge, which is 
excluded from adjusted results, was £5 million 
for the year, in line with the prior year.
Results before taxation
Adjusted profit before tax was £226 million, 
4% growth on a pro forma

increased finance costs partly offsetting the 
growth in operating profit and the share of

In December 2016, DMGT reduced its stake in Euromoney from c.67% to c.49% and 
Euromoney ceased to be a subsidiary of DMGT and became an associate. Euromoney 
is therefore treated as a discontinued operation and its performance is excluded from 
statutory results, other than earnings per share. DMGT’s adjusted results include 100% 
of Euromoney’s revenues and operating profits whilst it was a subsidiary during all of 
FY 2016 and the first quarter of FY 2017. Thereafter, from January to September 2017, 
the performance of DMGT’s c.49% stake in Euromoney is only included within 
JVs & Associates, which is reflected in the adjusted profit before tax and adjusted 
earnings per share figures. Therefore, to allow for a like-for-like comparison, FY 2016 
pro forma results have been presented based on treating Euromoney as a c.67% 
owned subsidiary during the first quarter and as a c.49% owned associate during the 
remaining nine months of FY 2016, consistent with the actual holding during FY 2017.

Funding payments into the main schemes 
were £13 million in the year and are 
expected to continue, since the schemes 
remain in deficit on an actuarial basis. The 
agreed funding plan includes payments of 
approximately £13 million p.a. to FY 2019 
and £16 million p.a. from FY 2020 to FY 2027. 
Contributions may be discontinued should 
the schemes’ actuary agree the schemes are 
no longer in deficit. The next formal actuarial 
valuation is scheduled for 31 March 2019.
Dividends
The Board aims to deliver sustained dividend 
growth in real terms. The recommended 
final dividend is 15.8 pence which, if 
approved, would make the total dividend for 
the year 22.7 pence, an increase of 3% over 
the prior year. The recommended full year 
dividend is equivalent to 41% of adjusted 
earnings per share and continues DMGT’s 
track record of increasing the dividend in 
excess of inflation. The Board’s decision to 
recommend increasing the dividend, in real 
terms, despite the decline in adjusted 
earnings during the year reflects the Group’s 
dividend policy and the Board’s confidence 
Earnings per share 
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 
55.6 pence, 7% growth on a pro forma
Ω
 basis. 
The weighted average number of shares in 
issue during the year was 353.1 million, down 
slightly from 353.4 million in the prior year.
Net debt and cash flow
Net debt at the end of the year was 
£464 million, a decrease of £214 million 
during the year, and the net debt:EBITDA 
ratio was 1.4. The Group generated operating 
cash flows of £175 million, a conversion rate 
of 88% of operating profits, compared with 
72% in the prior year. Operating cash flows 
included £46 million of exceptional operating 
items and £79 million of capital expenditure. 
During the year there were also payments 
made for £78 million of dividends, £35 million 
of interest, £13 million of pension funding 
and £13 million of taxation.
Net proceeds from disposals, including 
expenditure on acquisitions, were 
£271 million, and included £218 million from 
the reduction of the stake in Euromoney, 
after adjusting for the de-consolidation 
of £96 million cash on Euromoney’s 
balance sheet. 
At the end of the financial year, the Group 
had £424 million of bonds with £216 million 
maturing in December 2018, £10 million 
maturing in April 2021 and £197 million 
maturing in June 2027. At the year-end, the 
committed bank facilities were £611 million, 
of which £565 million was unutilised, and 
cash balances were £7 million. Bond debt 
constitutes less than half of the debt 
available to DMGT.
DMGT’s ratio of year-end net debt to 
adjusted profits before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was 
1.4 times, significantly below the Group’s 
preferred upper limit of 2.0 times. DMGT 
has retained its BBB- investment grade 
corporate credit ratings from each 
of Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. 
Pensions
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes provide retirement benefits for UK 
employees, largely in dmg media. These 
schemes are closed to new entrants. The 
financial position of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes, on an accounting 
basis, improved from a net deficit of 
£246 million at the start of the year to a net 
surplus of £62 million at 30 September 2017, 
calculated in accordance with IAS 19 
(Revised). During the year, the value of the 
assets increased and there was a reduction 
in the value of the defined benefit obligation. 
Action was also taken to further reduce the

in the Group’s ability to deliver future 
long-term earnings growth. The dividend 
policy is to grow the dividend in real terms 
and, in the medium term, to aim to distribute 
around one-third of the Group’s adjusted 
earnings. This policy reflects the combined 
objectives of delivering a reliable and 
predictable dividend growth trajectory while 
also being sufficiently prudent to retain the 
flexibility to make significant investments in 
the long-term future growth of the business.
Exceptional items, impairments 
and amortisation
As explained in more detail below, certain 
items, including exceptional costs, 
impairments and some amortisation, are 
excluded from adjusted results. Exceptional 
operating costs were £50 million in the year, 
compared to £58 million in the prior year, 
including our £7 million (2016 £4 million) 
share of JVs and Associates’ exceptional 
operating costs. There were £17 million 
(2016 £25 million) of severance costs, 
including £11 million (2016 £4 million) in 
respect of dmg information, and £8 million 
(2016 £2 million) of restructuring costs, 
including £4 million in relation to the 
closure of the Didcot printing plant.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Viability Statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company. The Board used a three-year 
review period. The next refinancing of our bank debt facilities and 5.75% bonds is within 
the next three years (April 2019 and December 2018 respectively). Three years is also 
consistent with the Group’s business planning cycle. 
The Board’s assessment of the Company’s future prospects and viability determined 
the Group’s overall risk capacity by considering banking and bond covenants, other 
financial commitments, and borrowing capacity to determine the maximum loss from 
risk events that the Group could endure whilst remaining viable. The assessment has 
also been made with reference to the Group’s current position and prospects, the Group 
strategy, the Board’s risk appetite and principal risks, which the Directors review at 
least annually. The key factors affecting the Group’s future prospects and viability are:
• DMGT manages a portfolio of operating companies with diversity across sector, 
revenue stream and geography. See page 27 in the Financial Review for the Group’s 
revenue profile.
• Financial flexibility through a strong balance sheet with continued good cash flow 
generation and net debt to EBITDA ratio comfortably below our preferred upper limit.
• The Group’s ability to restructure quickly through the portfolio management of 
operating company subsidiaries and investments in JVs and Associates.
• The long-term view of the Company afforded by the family shareholding.
Group forecast revenue, operating profit, EBITDA and cash flows were subject to robust 
downside stress testing over the assessment period, which involved modelling the 
impact of a combination of hypothetical and severe adverse scenarios. This was focused 
on the impact of a number of the Group’s principal risks crystallising, including:
• The impact of successive key product investment failures across the Group.
• The impact of a significantly accelerated decline in print advertising and lower 
growth in digital advertising affecting profits from the Consumer Media businesses.
• The impact of a significant decline in UK housing transaction volumes affecting 
profits of the European Property Information businesses and ZPG. 
• The impact of a severe cyberattack resulting in the loss of high volumes of personal 
data, considering both the reputational impact, recovery costs and regulatory fines.
• The impact of macro-economic factors including large foreign exchange fluctuations, 
significant increases in interest rates and corporation tax increases.
Mitigations considered as part of the stress testing included a number of cost reduction 
programmes and disposals of operating company subsidiaries and dilution of the 
Group’s stake in JVs and Associates.
Based on the analysis described above, the Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the next three years.
Other exceptional costs comprised £14 million 
(2016 £2 million) of legal fees, principally in 
respect of the defence by Xceligent, the US 
Property Information business, of a complaint 
filed by a competitor, and £5 million 
(2016 £10 million) of consultancy charges.
The charge for amortisation of intangible 
assets arising on business combinations, 
including the share from joint ventures 
and associates, reduced by £2 million  
to £50 million. The Group also made an 
impairment charge against goodwill and 
intangible assets of £231 million, primarily 
in respect of the Energy Information 
business, Genscape, and two of the US 
Property Information businesses, Xceligent 
and SiteCompli. This does not affect the 
Group’s cash flows. 
Genscape faced challenging market conditions 
during the year, due to the sustained low oil 
price, a low price volatility environment and, 
most notably, a change in distribution 
channels for the US residential solar market. 
Given the continued challenges, particularly 
for solar, and the likely time required before 
Genscape becomes a major cash generator, 
the carrying value of the business has been 
reduced to £141 million, resulting in an 
impairment charge of £140 million. 
Xceligent expanded into New York, the 
US’s largest commercial real estate market, 
during the year and the revenue growth has 
been significantly slower than previously 
expected and, given the significant further 
investment and time required to achieve full 
national coverage, a decision was taken to 
reduce the carrying value of the business to 
zero, resulting in an impairment charge of 
£42 million. Similarly, SiteCompli’s planned 
expansion into the national retail market has 
proved more challenging than previously 
expected and a full impairment charge  
of £24 million has been taken in respect  
of its carrying value. 
The Group also incurred a £41 million 
impairment charge in respect of the Didcot 
printing plant which was closed during 
the year.
The Group recorded other net gains on 
disposal of businesses and investments 
of £530 million, compared to a net gain 
of £138 million in the prior year. DMGT 
recognised £509 million of gains in respect 
of the reduced holding in Euromoney, 
including the gain on the revaluation 
of the retained c.49% stake. 
Adjusted results 
As explained earlier, the Board and 
management team use adjusted results 
and measures, rather than statutory results, 
to give greater insight to the financial 
performance of the Group and the way it is 
managed. The tables on page 30 show the 
full list of adjustments between statutory 
operating profit and adjusted operating 
profit by business, as well as between 
statutory profit before tax and adjusted 
profit before tax at Group level for both 
FY 2017 and FY 2016. 
Note 13 on page 124 shows the full list  
of adjustments between statutory and 
adjusted results. The table on page 30 shows 
a summarised version of the reconciliation 
from statutory profit before tax to adjusted 
profit before tax. 
The explanation for each adjustment is 
as follows:
i.  Discontinued operations: the adjusted 
results for FY 2017 include the pre-
disposal results of discontinued 
operations, namely Euromoney, in 
which DMGT reduced its stake from 
c.67% to c.49% in December 2016, 
whereas statutory results only include 
continuing operations.
ii.  Exceptional operating costs: businesses 
occasionally incur exceptional costs, 
including severance and consultancy 
fees, in respect of a reorganisation that 
is incremental to normal operations. 
Similarly, for the Group’s B2B businesses, 
29
Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report there may be legal costs in respect of 
litigation that are outside the ordinary 
course of business and sufficiently material 
to be treated as an exceptional cost. 
These are excluded from adjusted results. 
iii.  Impairment of plant: occasionally the 
carrying value of an asset in the balance 
sheet is considered to be greater than the 
value in use or fair value less costs to sell 
and it is appropriate to impair it. The 
associated charge is excluded from adjusted 
results since it is unrelated to the ongoing 
cost of doing business. The ongoing 
depreciation and amortisation of tangible 
assets and software, including products, 
is, however, an everyday cost of doing 
business and is included in both statutory 
and adjusted results. A reorganisation may 
also result in the write-off of the carrying 
value of tangible fixed assets, as was the 
case during FY 2017 when dmg media 
closed its Didcot printing plant, and this 
expense is excluded from adjusted results.
iv.  Intangible impairment and amortisation: 
when acquiring businesses, the premium 
paid relative to the net assets on the 
balance sheet of the acquired business 
is classified as either goodwill or as an 
intangible asset arising on a business 
combination and is recognised on DMGT’s 
balance sheet. This differs to organically 
developed businesses where assets  
such as employee talent and customer 
relationships are not recognised on 
the balance sheet. Impairment and 
amortisation of intangible assets and 
goodwill arising on acquisitions are 
excluded from adjusted results as they 
relate to historical M&A activity and future 
expectations rather than the trading 
performance of the business during the 
year. An example is the impairment in 
FY 2017 of the goodwill and intangible 
assets associated with the US Property 
Information business, Xceligent.
v.  Profit on sale of assets: the Group 
makes gains or losses when disposing of 
businesses, for example on the disposal 
of Euromoney shares when DMGT reduced 
its stake from c.67% to c.49%. These items 
are excluded from adjusted results as they 
reflect the value created since the business 
was formed or acquired rather than the 
operating performance of the business 
during the year. 
vi.  Pension finance charge: the finance charge 
on defined benefit schemes is a formulaic 
calculation that does not necessarily 
reflect the underlying economics 
associated with the relevant pension 
assets and liabilities. It is effectively a 
notional charge and is excluded from 
adjusted results. 
vii.  Other adjustments: other items that are 
excluded from adjusted results include 
changes in the fair value of certain 
financial instruments and changes to 
future acquisition payments. They are 
considered to be unrelated to the ongoing 
cost of doing business. The share of joint 
ventures’ and associates’ tax charges is 
included in statutory profit before tax but, 
since it is a tax charge, is excluded from

Underlying growth
When assessing the performance of the 
different businesses, the Board considers 
the adjusted results. The year-on-year 
change in adjusted results may not, however, 
be a fair like-for-like comparison as there 
are a number of factors which can influence 
growth rates but which do not reflect 
underlying performance.
When calculating underlying growth, 
adjustments are made to give a like-for-like 
comparison. For example, the adjusted 
results in FY 2017 benefited from the 
strengthening of the US dollar relative to 
the British pound. To calculate underlying 
growth, the prior year comparatives are 
restated using the FY 2017 exchange rates. 
Similarly, adjustments are made to 
completely exclude disposals from both 
years. When businesses are acquired, 
the prior year comparatives are adjusted 
to include the acquisition.
The timing of events can also be a distortion. 
To give a fair like-for-like comparison when 
calculating underlying growth, the FY 2016 
comparative is amended to include the 
revenues and profits from the previously 
held events for each FY 2017 show.
In FY 2017, DMGT’s revenues grew by 3% on a 
pro forma
Ω
 basis and the adjusted operating 
profit grew by 2% on the same basis. The 
growth rates benefited from the stronger US 
dollar. After adjusting for this factor as well 
as others, such as acquisitions and disposals, 
the underlying growth rates were 1% for 
revenues and a 2% decline in adjusted 
operating profit, as shown in the table below. 
Outlook 
DMGT’s financial results for the year reflect 
the difficult market environment faced 
by some of our businesses, particularly 
in the Energy Information and Property 
Information sectors and print advertising 
market. Nevertheless, the Group’s relatively 
resilient performance demonstrates the 
benefits of our diversified portfolio and the 
strength of our market-leading businesses. 
Looking forward, we will remain focused on 
prudent financial management to maintain 
our strong balance sheet, alongside delivering 
on the long-term revenue, profit and cash 
flow potential which the Group has 
developed. In 2018, in line with our strategic 
priorities, we will continue to deliver further 
operational efficiencies, increase the portfolio 
focus and enhance our financial flexibility to 
invest in our chosen segments and markets 
while increasing shareholder returns.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Entrepreneurialism, Purpose and Excellence 
Our People and Our Communities
DMGT encourages curiosity and 
innovation amongst our people. 
We value people who stretch themselves 
to achieve high standards, who also act 
with a clear sense of purpose and who 
value the communities in which they live 
and work. In turn our people can expect 
an environment that allows them to 
reach their full potential with the support 
of experienced leaders, high-quality 
learning and development tools and the 
career opportunities afforded by working 
within a diverse, international portfolio 
of businesses. 
Our values
The way DMGT thinks about its 
business and its people is embodied 
in our three overarching values: 
Entrepreneurialism
Purpose 
Excellence
Entrepreneurialism
Entrepreneurs have been a driving force 
for DMGT’s business since brothers Alfred 
and Harold Harmsworth invented popular 
journalism with the launch of the Daily Mail 
in 1896. 
DMGT is dedicated to backing great ideas 
and the people who make them a reality, 
from home-grown success stories like 
MailOnline and Euromoney to early 
investments in innovative businesses like 
RMS, Hobsons and Trepp.
DMGT seeks out entrepreneurs renowned 
in their industries for growing businesses 
and provides them with the backing and 
resources of a multinational public company. 
Many of DMGT’s operating businesses 
continue to be led by the entrepreneurs 
who founded them, a testament to DMGT’s 
culture of nurturing and developing 
talented entrepreneurial people. 
Purpose
Alongside our commitment to 
entrepreneurialism, DMGT’s businesses 
and our people operate with a clear sense 
of purpose, beyond profit. 
DMGT is able to invest for long-term 
sustainable growth and quality, and in 
businesses that share our ethos, whether 
that’s providing insights that make it 
possible to ‘insure the uninsurable’, driving 
towards ever-greater transparency across 
property markets, enriching connections 
between businesses and communities 
with industry-leading exhibitions or 
holding authority to account through 
high-quality journalism. 
DMGT is a responsible business, 
dedicated to its people and communities, 
and operates to a clear set of principles 
and ethical standards. Through a range of 
local partnerships within the communities 
our businesses serve and Group-wide 
programmes such as our CR Champions 
network, DMGT supports and encourages 
purpose within our community.

Excellence
DMGT is committed to excellence, 
demonstrated through its dedication 
to creating the highest quality content, 
proprietary data and products. 
Our aim is to be at the forefront of cutting 
edge technology and within new, exciting, 
high-potential growth sectors. 
As a driver in technological innovation, 
DMGT is defining the jobs of the future 
through its ground-breaking work in data 
science, artificial intelligence, machine 
learning and predictive analytics found 
across businesses including Genscape, 
Hobsons and RMS. 
DMGT holds a wealth of top leadership 
talent and sector expertise at Group level 
and across its operating companies. 
Our people are supported by a range of 
tailored local and Group-wide learning 
and development programmes. 
In FY 2017, the Group initiated a programme 
to leverage our scale and the expertise of our 
people and improve sharing of best practice 
across the Group. The aim is to support 
the Group’s operating companies through 
Centres of Expertise.
DMGT established and upgraded a number 
of business functions including Group HR, 
M&A and performance management, 
building on expert knowledge and best 
practice from around the Group. 
Our People Agenda
DMGT’s people agenda plays a key role 
in helping the Group to deliver against its 
strategic priorities, particularly improving 
operational execution. 
HR centre of expertise 
In FY 2017, led by the Group HR Director, 
DMGT embarked on a fundamental 
re-shaping of its central HR function to 
ensure that the Group’s operating companies 
have access to a world-class people operation, 
backed by the scale and expertise of DMGT.
The HR centre offers a set of services across 
talent, reward and communications that 
support the operational HR business 
partners with leadership, employee 
development and best practice with the aim 
of achieving:
• Better connectivity across our business;
• An increased level of support for HR 
services within operating companies; and
• A more efficient structure for delivering 
key HR services across the business.
Keeping our people informed 
One of the challenges of a geographically 
diverse organisation is ensuring that we 
can effectively communicate with all of our 
people. This year we have launched a new 
global employee portal with increased 
functionality, enabling easier employee 
connectivity, which complements local 
intranet sites. We began our employee 
engagement programme to help ensure that 
our colleagues have the opportunity to have 
their voice heard. We also operate DMGT 
Daily, our daily email news bulletin and we 
have a number of topic-specific employee 
networks such as the Cyber working group, 
bringing people together from across 
the Group to discuss common themes, 
share our strengths and improve local 
operational practices.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Guest Auditor Programme
Responsible business
DMGT is a responsible business that adheres 
to strong ethical standards with a clear, 
robust Code of Conduct.
Our Code of Conduct sets the standards 
for our corporate and individual conduct. 
The code includes standards for equal 
opportunities, anti-bribery, conflicts of 
interest, share dealing and fair competition 
among other topics. Many of the topics in 
the Code are supported by detailed policies 
and procedures.
In a climate where employees, customers 
and other stakeholders are increasingly 
interested in the way companies do 
business, the things we do to encourage 
responsible business practice across the 
Group contribute to the credibility and value 
of DMGT’s reputation and employer brand. 
These include:
• Strong governance and leadership which 
promote responsible business attitudes 
and actions across the Group;
• Ensuring DMGT employees understand 
key legal and reputational issues;
• Operating effective risk management 
and internal controls; and
• Business level participation in CR and 
community support. 
Our Communities
As a diverse, international business, 
DMGT focuses its community efforts on 
a combination of Group-level partnerships 
that allow it to make the most of its 
scale and size, and support for local 
community initiatives and relief efforts, 
through its CR Champions network.
Total charitable donations during the year 
were £817 thousand. Funds donated are in 
addition to initiatives which encourage our 
businesses to allow employees to volunteer 
their time to support local charities.
Following the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower, 
over 80 employees volunteered their time 
to help victims of this tragedy, coordinated 
by DMGT’s local charity partner the K&C 
Foundation. DMGT responded with a £150,000 
donation to the Grenfell Tower Appeal and 
matched individual employee donations. 
Following Hurricane Harvey, which hit 
the US Gulf Coast at the end of August this 
year, colleagues from Genscape, Hobsons, 
RMS and Xceligent all helped out with the 
relief effort. Volunteers assisted at food 
banks and DMGT and Hobsons matched 
individual fundraising donations 
with US$50,000. 
Run by DMGT’s Internal Audit function. 
The aim is to offer an opportunity for 
employees from finance and IT across all 
our businesses to join the Internal Audit 
team on a review of another operating 
company within the DMGT portfolio. 
The benefits of this programme are 
multifaceted. It offers the individual 
a development opportunity, exposing 
them to a different operating company. 
It helps them compare, contrast and 
suggest new or improved processes 
that could be implemented in their 
own team. The programme also assists 
with sharing of knowledge and best 
practice, and professional networking 
across the Group. 
 “The Guest Auditor Programme is 
a brilliant initiative. I took part working 
with the DMGT Internal Audit team at 
our RMS office based in California. 
I spent a week with the managers of 
RMS understanding their business, 
processes and controls alongside a 
high-performing Internal Audit team. 
I had the opportunity to share 
my experience whilst utilising ideas 
from RMS that could apply to my 
own job. I would highly recommend 
the programme to anybody wanting 
to broaden their financial skillset”.
James Traynor (Commercial Analyst, dmg events)
At a Group level, the programme helps 
to further highlight and promote the 
importance of a controlled financial and 
IT Security environment. The business 
under review gains an understanding 
of its importance, at the same time the 
guest auditor will return to their home 
business and cascade information on the 
importance of maintaining this control.
Talent
The DMGT talent centre provides talent 
acquisition and development support for 
the Group’s operating businesses including 
carrying out executive talent reviews and 
identifying and delivering a learning and 
development curriculum. 
Reward
The reward centre provides operating 
companies with access to accurate salary 
benchmarking as well as managing 
employee benefits across the Group. 
Communications 
The DMGT communications centre provides 
a range of support services including  
internal communications, media relations 
and corporate branding. 
Global Mobility
In line with our commitment to support 
and reward exceptional employees, 
creating international opportunities, DMGT 
promoted a number of internal candidates 
to Group-level leadership, including roles 
in Performance Management & Strategy, 
Corporate Development and M&A, HR and 
Technology and we will continue to develop 
our capabilities at the HR Centre to support 
global employment advancement 
opportunities. DMGT offers short-term 
secondment opportunities such as the 
Guest Auditor Programme. (See case study 
for more details.)

Community Champions Awards winners 2017
Personal Achievement Award – 
Susan Caesar & Community First
Susan Caesar, Head of Customer Service, 
dmg media, secured the Personal 
Achievement Award for her work with 
Community First UK. Susan supported 
founders Carol Malone and Pauline Lockhart 
to formally set up Community First UK, a 
not-for-profit social enterprise that facilitates 
projects and initiatives that act locally.
Community First is a start-up. Carol and 
Pauline came up with the concept of 
Community First in 2014 as they were 
delivering digital support within the county 
of Angus, Scotland.
Susan provided essential business advice 
in helping them identify and decide on 
the structure and requirements of a  
not-for-profit social enterprise. With Susan’s 
wealth of knowledge and business acumen, 
this advice was invaluable in formalising 
the company. 
The funds raised by Community First will 
be going towards two main objectives: 
creating an employability and digital 
training programme which will produce a 
talent bank to connect delegates with local 
employers; and creating public training 
courses to promote digital inclusion in the 
local community.
Team Award – Jade Woodall and Bjorn 
Sirum, Livingstone Tanzania Trust (LTT)
Jade Woodall, Project Manager, and 
Bjorn Sirum, Commercial Sales Manager, 
dmg events, were the winners of this year’s 
Team Award. dmg events have been 
supporting the LTT for over six years, 
and Jade and Bjorn helped the charity with 
a project to fund and build the Sawe Primary 
School in Tanzania.
The project will give hundreds of young children 
every year the opportunity to receive an 
education in a safe environment and in total, 
they raised funds for the Sawe School Project.
During a trip in 2017 to Tanzania and the Sawe 
village, they worked alongside builders and 
volunteers from the community to complete 
the foundations of three classrooms. 
Commenting on their win, Jade and Bjorn 
said, “The Livingstone Tanzania Trust is a 
charity we are very passionate about, so 
finding out we had won was a really exciting 
moment! We have been overwhelmed 
with everyone’s support at DMGT and feel 
extremely proud to have received as many 
nominations as we did, let alone actually win! 
We are excited to see the Sawe Primary 
School Project progress to the next stage.”
Green Award – RMS Green Team
The RMS Green Team won the Award 
for their work during RMS Green Week. 
They ensured the changes they made 
were sustainable throughout the year.
Across six RMS offices it is estimated that 
a total of 120 hours were used to plan 
and participate in environmentally 
friendly activities.
Activities included various events and 
several e-waste collections throughout 
the offices, employees signing on pledge 
boards and hosting a clothing drive for 
an organisation that helps provide outfits 
to low-income individuals, enabling them 
to make a good impression at their 
job interviews.
In a few RMS offices, guest speakers were 
invited to lecture on:

Principal Risks
A robust and detailed assessment of the Group Risk Register and the Group’s 
risk management processes was carried out by management and overseen 
by the Audit & Risk Committee. 
The Group’s risks are categorised as either strategic or operational. Strategic risks are linked to the Group’s strategic priorities and impact 
the whole Group. Operational risks are those arising from the execution of the business functions and typically impact on one or more of 
the principal businesses. 
  Further details of the Group’s risk management process, the governance structure surrounding risk and the Audit & Risk Committee 
can be found in the Governance Report on pages 50 to 55. 
Strategic risks
Description and impact Examples Mitigation Trend
Market disruption
Market disruption creates opportunities as well as risks. Disruption 
enables us to move into new markets and geographies to grow 
the business. 
Failure to anticipate and respond to market disruption may affect 
the demand for our products and services and our ability to drive  
long-term growth.
Market disrupters include changes to customer behaviours and demands, new 
technologies, the emergence of competitors or structural changes to markets. 
Examples from the operating companies include: 
• Consumer Media: decline in print advertising revenue and fast-changing 
digital advertising environment;
• Insurance Risk: convergence of reinsurance with capital markets and 
consolidation in insurance industry in RMS;
• EdTech: politically driven change to public school funding and/or the 
regulation of post-secondary education; and
• Energy Information: rapidly evolving solar industry.
• The Group’s diverse and balanced portfolio of businesses and products reduces the 
overall Group impact.
• Organic investment initiatives across the Group to innovate our products and services 
and to remain competitive in the markets we serve. Organic investment was 9% of total 
revenues in FY 2017.
• The Executive Committee, supported by the Performance Management and Strategy 
function and operating companies’ management teams, monitor markets, the 
competitive landscape and technological developments.
• Analysis of the performance management dashboard and detailed financial 
management information for each operating company to highlight and react to early 
indicators of market disruption.
• DMGT executive membership of operating business boards.
Success of new product launches and internal investments 
A lack of innovation in response to competitive pressures or failure 
to successfully develop our products and services may compromise 
their appeal.
Some may fail to achieve customer acceptance and yield expected 
benefits. This could result in lower-than-expected revenue and/or 
impairment losses.
Uncertainty also results from geographic expansion into new and 
emerging markets.
The Group is continually investing in our products and services, developing 
new lines and enriching existing products and services. Examples include:
• Consumer Media: increased monetisation of our online user base and 
execution of DailyMailTV;
• Insurance Risk: client adoption of RMS(one) and the launch of new models;
• Property Information: geographical expansion of Xceligent across the US 
and Trepp's entrance into Collateralized Loan Obligations market;
• Energy Information: Genscape launch of new real-time power generation 
platform and maritime voyages service; and
• Events and Exhibitions: the geo-cloning of events across new locations.
• The autonomous culture of the Group encourages an entrepreneurial approach to 
identifying growth opportunities and new products.
• The Executive Committee, supported by the Performance Management and Strategy 
function, provide oversight of progress from the centre. Analysis of the performance 
management dashboard and detailed financial management information to monitor 
achievement of key milestones.
• Performance Management and Strategy function partners with operating company 
senior management teams to support achievement of key milestones where necessary.
• Significant investments are approved by the Investment & Finance Committee and/or 
the Board.
Portfolio management
¤
Increasing portfolio focus is key to the Group’s strategy. This could be 
compromised by portfolio changes not delivering expected benefits, 
acquisitions and investments not delivering as expected or not 
divesting from non-core businesses at the right time.
¤
 Referred to as ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ in the 2016 Annual Report. 
• Growth opportunities and potential synergies lost through failure to 
identify or succeed with acquisition and investment targets.
• Underperforming acquisitions and investments may lead to reduced return 
on capital and/or impairment losses.
• Underperforming acquisitions and investments could result in a diversion 
of management time.
• Optimal value may not be achieved from divestments.
• The Executive Committee conducted (and continues to conduct) a rigorous evaluation 
of the Group’s portfolio in order to allocate resources according to individual business 
growth characteristics and funding requirements.
• Investments and divestments are approved by the Investment & Finance Committee.
• Extensive due diligence conducted pre-acquisition and comprehensive integration plan 
implemented post-acquisition by dedicated function.
• The Executive and Investment & Finance Committees, supported by the Performance 
Management and Strategy function, monitor post-acquisition performance, and support 
proactive intervention if performance milestones are not being met.
• DMGT executive membership of operating business boards and associate boards 
(Euromoney and ZPG).
This risk increased over FY 2017 due to the increasing 
number of transactions, particularly divestments,  
in the portfolio in the year including the reduction 
in Euromoney holding. 
Economic and geopolitical uncertainty 
The Group performance could be adversely impacted by factors beyond 
our control such as the economic conditions in key markets and sectors, 
and political uncertainty.
• Property Information: volatility in residential and commercial property 
transactions could impact revenue.
• Consumer Media: a weakening of the UK economy, particularly if 
consumer-led, could accelerate the decline in print advertising revenue.
• Energy Information: fluctuations in the global commodities markets 
could impact Genscape’s revenues.
• Insurance Risk: sustained low interest rates could weaken the sector's 
overall performance and impact RMS.
• Events and Exhibitions: fluctuations in the global oil markets could 
impact revenue from associated trade shows if discretionary revenue 
from delegates, exhibitors and sponsorships decline. Political 
uncertainty, particularly in the Middle East, could impact execution 
of events in the region.
• The Group’s diverse and balanced portfolio of businesses and products reduces the 
overall impact of any one disruption or change.
• Analysis of the performance management dashboard and detailed financial management 
information by the Executive Committee and operating companies’ management teams 
to highlight early trends and impacts from economic and geopolitical uncertainty.
This risk increased over FY 2017 reflecting the 
continued uncertainty in political and economic 
landscapes in which we operate.

Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Changes in principal risks during the year 
1.  The risk of ‘Major change projects’ disclosed last year primarily related to the execution of simplification and reorganisation initiatives, 
which are now mostly implemented. For this reason the risk is not currently considered a principal risk for the Group. The operating 
companies continue to undertake operational change projects and the associated risks are tracked on the Group’s risk register.
2.  The principal risk examples below do not include Euromoney’s risks as they are no longer consolidated into the Group’s overall 
risk profile.

Talent
¥
 
Our ability to identify, attract, retain and develop the right people for 
senior and business-critical roles could impact the Group’s performance. 
 
 
 
¥ Referred to as ‘Securing and retaining talent’ in the 2016 Annual Report. 
• Entrepreneurship and leadership skills are a priority for the Group and 
key to the continued success of many of our operating companies.
• Technology and software development skills remain crucial to many of our 
businesses, particularly RMS, Genscape and MailOnline where collectively 
there is significant investment in product development.
• The strategy to build out our data analytics capabilities places focus on 
developing and attracting data scientists and specialists in machine 
learning, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. These 
skills are in high demand which makes attracting and retaining people with 
these skills more competitive.
• Enterprise sales and operational execution expertise with market and 
product knowledge are vital, particularly in our businesses with significant 
expansion plans.
• The Group has established a centre of expertise for HR specialising on recruitment, 
succession planning, critical skills planning, identifying and developing internal talent, 
and reward.
• Executive management is involved in the recruitment of all operating company leadership 
roles and their ongoing development.
• Retention of key management in businesses.
• Payment of competitive rewards for key senior roles, developed using industry benchmarks 
and external specialist input.
• Employee engagement initiatives including Group-wide employee survey with follow-up 
action plans in place in each operating company.
The risk increased over FY 2017 as a result of the 
reorganisational changes implemented. As these 
changes are embedded in the operating companies, 
we expect the risk to stabilise. 
Operational risks
Description and impact Examples Mitigation Trend
Information security breach or cyberattack 
An information security breach, including a failure to prevent or detect 
a malicious cyberattack, could cause reputational damage and financial 
loss. The investigation and management of an incident would result 
in remediation costs and the diversion of management time.
A breach of data protection legislation could result in financial penalties 
for the business affected and potentially the Group. 
The risk is relevant to all businesses in the Group due to the nature of products 
and services across the portfolio. Examples which could impact the Group include:
• Loss or unauthorised access to personal information and sensitive client data;
• Unavailability or disruption of online products and services;
• Integrity of online products, services and data compromised;
• Disruption to critical systems which support business operations; and
• Theft of intellectual property.
• Establishment of an Information Security Steering Committee led by the CEO to provide 
oversight of information security initiatives in the Group.
• Appointment of a Group Chief Information Officer and a Group Chief Information 
Security Officer. 
• Commissioned by the Information Security Steering Committee, a Group-wide 
independent review of information security posture within the operating companies.
• This review has resulted in actionable roadmaps for improvement where necessary.
• Group information security policy and detailed information security standards with 
regular reviews against these standards reported to the Information Security Steering 
Committee. Periodic reviews of the standards themselves are performed to ensure they 
keep pace with best practice.
• Working group with representatives from across the Group meeting regularly and sharing 
information security best practice.
• Information security is reviewed as part of every internal audit of an operating company.
• Cyber insurance policies in place.
This risk increased over FY 2017 as the inherent threat of 
an information security breach or cyberattack continues 
to increase. This is partially offset by continuous 
improvement in information security controls.
Reliance on key third parties
Certain third parties are critical to the operations of our businesses. 
A failure of one of our critical third parties may cause disruption to 
business operations, impact our ability to deliver products and services 
and result in financial loss. The reputation of our businesses may be 
damaged by poor performance or a regulatory breach by critical third 
parties, particularly outsourced service providers.
Key third parties include:
• Data centre and cloud service providers;
• IT development support;
• Data providers for core product;
• Newsprint, flexographic plate and ink suppliers;
• Newspaper distribution and wholesale; and
• Event venues.
• The Group’s diverse and balanced portfolio of businesses and products reduces the 
overall impact of the failure of an individual third party.
• Operational and financial due diligence is undertaken for key suppliers on an 
ongoing basis.
• Close management of key supplier relationships including contracts, service levels 
and outputs.
• Robust business continuity arrangements for the disruption to key third parties.
• Dedicated newsprint-buying team.
• Event cancellation and business interruption insurance policies.
Compliance with laws and regulations
The Group operates across multiple jurisdictions and sectors. 
Increasing regulation increases the risk that the Group is not compliant 
with all applicable laws and regulations across all of the jurisdictions 
in which it operates, which could result in financial penalties and 
reputational damage. 
Increasing regulation also results in increasing costs of compliance.
Particular areas of focus for DMGT businesses are: 
• Data protection, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
and the proposed ePrivacy Regulation;
• Competition and anti-trust legislation;
• EU Market Abuse Regulation;
• Libel legislation;
• Tax compliance;
• UK Bribery Act; 
• Trade sanctions; and
• Entering regulated markets or sectors.
• Changes in laws and regulations are monitored and potential impacts discussed 
with the relevant persons, Board, or Committee, or escalated as appropriate.
• Developments in the legal and regulatory landscape are reviewed by the Audit & 
Risk Committee.
• Implementation and monitoring of Group-wide policies to address new legislation 
and regulation where applicable.
• Group-wide working groups in readiness for key emerging compliance areas, such 
as the GDPR.
Pension scheme deficit 
Defined benefit pension schemes, although now closed to new entrants 
were in operation across the newspaper business, certain other UK 
businesses and DMGT head office. The schemes remain ultimately 
funded by DMGT, with Pension Fund Trustees (Trustees) controlling 
the investment allocation. 
There is a risk that the funding of any deficit could be greater 
than expected.
Future pension costs and funding requirements could be increased by:
• Adverse changes in investment performance;
• Valuation assumptions and methodology; and 
• Inflation and interest rate risks.
• The agreed funding plan gives certainty over the financial commitment until FY 2019.
• Monitoring and management of pension risks is performed by the DMGT Pension 
Sub Committee.
• Company-appointed Trustees.
This risk has decreased over FY 2017 as the Group’s 
defined benefit schemes are in surplus, and exposure to 
future investment and inflation risk was further reduced.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Strong governance is essential to the  
way we operate throughout the Group.  
It is a key factor in our ability to achieve 
growth in a profitable, responsible and 
sustainable manner and in how we 
maximise shareholder value over the 
long term. In practice, this means that 
the Board establishes a framework 
within which our businesses operate  
and deliver shareholder value. DMGT’s 
approach to governance is distinctive,  
as in addition to typical corporate 
procedures, we are able to rely on and 
utilise the significant benefits from the 
family shareholding and the long-term 
view that this permits.
The Board continues to be fully supportive 
of the strategic objectives set out by 
Paul Zwillenberg as described in the CEO’s 
Review on pages 10 to 13. Areas of particular 
focus for the Board include our approach 
to our portfolio of businesses and their 
continued growth, as well as divestments, 
rigorous financial management, balanced 
capital allocation and managing a strong 
balance sheet. Additionally the Board 
has focused on our people agenda and 
leadership capabilities. 
Our Board was strengthened by the 
appointment of Tim Collier as Group 
Chief Financial Officer in May 2017 and 
FranÇois Morin as a Non-Executive in 
February 2017 as detailed on page 3. 
I would like to thank John Hemingway and 
Francisco Balsemão for their contribution  
to the DMGT Board as they both stood down 
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 
February 2017. I would also like to pay tribute 
to Nicholas Berry for his contribution to the 
Board, who sadly died in December 2016. 
This year we have continued to focus the 
Governance Report on the key information 
for shareholders in order to encourage 
clear and concise reporting. More routine 
information such as our Investor Relations 
calendar and the Committee responsibilities 
and Terms of Reference can be found on 
our website.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Family shareholding
Rothermere Continuation Limited (RCL) 
is a holding company incorporated  
in Bermuda. The main asset of RCL is its 
holding of DMGT Ordinary Shares. RCL is 
owned by a trust (Trust) which is held for  
the benefit of Lord Rothermere and his 
immediate family. Both RCL and the Trust 
are administered in Jersey, in the Channel 
Islands. The directors of RCL, of which  
there are seven, included two directors  
of DMGT during the reporting period:  
Lord Rothermere and François Morin.
RCL has controlled the Company for many 
years. RCL maintains that the Company 
should be managed in accordance with high 
standards of corporate governance for the 
benefit of all shareholders; this has been the 
case throughout the period of RCL ’s control.
RCL has again indicated to the Company that 
its intentions for the Company’s governance 
are long-term in nature and that it will 
discuss with the Board of the Company  
any material change in its intentions. In 
particular, RCL has confirmed its intention 
that the Company will:
• Continue to observe the Listing Principles 
in their current form;
• Continue to maintain a securities dealing 
code for certain of its employees;
• Continue to voluntarily observe the UK 
Corporate Governance Code on a ‘comply 
or explain’ basis; and
• Have an appropriate number of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors  
on its Board.
It is also intended by RCL that the Company’s 
independent Directors would take decisions 
on behalf of the Company in relation to any 
proposed transaction between the Company 
and RCL, or between the Company and an 
associate of RCL, where any such proposed 
transaction would have been a related  
party transaction under Chapter 11 of the 
Listing Rules.
Committee structure 
The Board Committee structure is set out in the diagram below.
DMGT Board

Time is allocated at each meeting for both Audit and Risk 
matters, to ensure that all items are adequately addressed.
Investment & Finance Committee
The Investment & Finance Committee evaluates investment 
opportunities and financing proposals and monitors returns 
on investments made.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report How the Board operates
There is a schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board. This details key matters in respect 
of the Company’s management that the 
Board does not delegate. This can be seen 
at www.dmgt.com/about-us/board-and-
governance. If any Director had any concerns 
about the way the Board was operating, 
these would be recorded in the minutes. 
No such concerns were raised during the 
reporting period. Day-to-day management 
of the Company is the responsibility of the 
Executive Committee and of the executive 
management of the operating businesses.
Delegation of authority
The Board has delegated certain activities 
to Board Committees, under formal terms 
of reference, details of which are set out 
on pages 49 to 56.
  Full T erms of Reference can be found 
on DMGT’s website at www.dmgt.com/
about-us/board-and-governance
Division of Chairman and CEO 
responsibilities
In accordance with the Code, the roles 
of Chairman and CEO are separate. The 
Chairman is responsible for leading the 
Board and overseeing operations and 
strategy. The CEO is responsible for the 
execution of the strategy and the day-to-day 
management of the Group and is supported 
by the Executive Committee.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors, as members 
of the Board and its Committees, are 
responsible for ensuring the Company has 
effective systems of internal controls and 
risk management and additionally, for 
monitoring financial performance. All 
Committee Chairmen report to the Board on 
Committee activity at each Board meeting.
UK Corporate Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code (Code) 
is an important part of how we operate. 
It allows a ‘comply or explain’ approach to 
achieving best governance practice. We have 
chosen to explain our governance practices 
if these do not fully meet the provisions  
of the Code. This allows us to recognise  
our requirements under the Code and the 
benefits of our shareholding structure. 
Our explanations where we deviate from 
the code are set out in the relevant sections 
of this Corporate Governance Report. 
Information required under DTR 7.2.6 
is provided on page 81 and forms part 
of this Report.
Leadership
The Board has a duty to promote the 
long-term success of the Company for its 
shareholders. This includes: the review  
and monitoring of strategic objectives; 
approval of major acquisitions, disposals  
and capital expenditure; financial 
performance; reviewing the effectiveness  
of the Group’s systems of internal controls; 
governance; risk management; and training 
and development. 
Persons Discharging Managerial 
Responsibility
As part of the Company’s continuing 
obligation to ensure compliance with the 
Listing Rules and related regulations, we 
have identified that Directors and other 
senior executives who have regular access  
to inside information and the power to make 
managerial decisions affecting the future 
development and business prospects of the 
Company are those on the Board, Executive 
Committee and regular attendees at the 
Investment & Finance Committee.
Senior Independent Director 
The Chairman has an interest in all the 
Ordinary Shares of the Company through 
the Trust and so there is no need for a Senior 
Independent Director to represent Ordinary 
Shareholders. Accordingly the Board has not 
appointed a Senior Independent Director as 
recommended under Code provision A.4.1. 
The Remuneration & Nominations 
Committee (without the Chairman being 
present) annually assesses the Chairman’s 
performance. Other Directors consider that 
they can represent themselves freely to the 
Chairman. However, when a situation arises 
that would best be handled by an individual 
Independent Non-Executive Director, the 
most appropriate person is appointed by 
the Board (with or without the Chairman 
being present, as appropriate). 
Independence
The Board has determined that Lady 
Keswick, Kevin Parry, Heidi Roizen and 
Dominique Trempont are independent 
within the meaning of the Code. 
David Nelson, Andrew Lane and François 
Morin are not considered to be independent 
within the meaning of the Code, as they are 
each advisers to the Chairman and to RCL. 
Nevertheless, the Board believes that these 
Non-Executive Directors make an important 
contribution to its deliberations and have 
invaluable experience of the Company, 
its business and its employees.
The Board believes that its current 
composition is appropriate taking into 
account the heritage of the Group, the 
interests of our operating businesses 
represented on the Board, and that a  
good balance is achieved from the Board’s 
Non-Executive Directors in terms of skill 
and independence. The Board keeps this 
under review. Less than half of the Board are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, which 
is not in line with provision B.1.2 of the Code.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Effectiveness
The Board reviewed its effectiveness within 
the context of the provisions of Section B 
of the Code. In addition to its review of 
independence and the Board evaluation 
process, discussed separately, the Board 
discharged its Code duties as follows:
• Appointments: the Remuneration & 
Nominations Committee is responsible 
for referring potential appointments to 
the Board for approval and is assisted 
by the CEO. Further details are in the 
Remuneration & Nominations Committee 
Report on page 56;
• Time: the time commitment of each 
Non-Executive Director is set out in  
his/her Letter of Engagement. Each Letter 
of Engagement is renewed annually 
following a review by the Remuneration 
& Nominations Committee and the 
shareholder vote at the AGM;
• Multiple commitments: the Remuneration 
& Nominations Committee recognises 
that Board members may be directors 
of other companies and that additional 
experience is likely to enhance discussions 
at the Board. Details of any additional 
directorships are on pages 40 and 41. 
Executive Directors are generally 
permitted to hold non-executive 
directorships as long as it does not 
lead to conflicts of interest or time;
• Development and information: on joining, 
Directors receive a comprehensive, 
tailored induction programme, which 
includes time with the Company Secretary 
and the Legal Adviser, the Executive 
Directors and a range of senior managers 
across the Group. During the year, the 
Board has received updates on key areas 
of finance and governance as well as areas 
of the business; and
• Re-election: in line with the Code, 
all Directors are eligible to stand for 
re-election annually and will do so at 
the 2018 AGM.
Relations with shareholders
Any concerns raised by shareholders in 
relation to the Company and its affairs are 
communicated to the Board through regular 
briefings. Summaries of analysts’ reports 
are circulated to the Board. Feedback 
from meetings held with the executive 
management, or the Investor Relations  
team and institutional shareholders,  
are also communicated to the Board.
DMGT understands the importance of 
considering a company’s responsibilities to 
a broad stakeholder group. When making 
decisions, the Board considers the impact on 
its employees, customers, the communities 
in which we operate, its shareholders and 
its suppliers.
The Company’s website, www.dmgt.com, 
provides the latest news, historical financial 
information, details about forthcoming 
events for shareholders and analysts, and 
other information regarding the Group.
Board Evaluation
In 2017, the Board undertook a review 
of its own performance and those of 
its Committees, which built on the 
results of the 2016 review. The review 
was conducted through an internal 
process facilitated by the Company 
Secretary. A questionnaire was used 
focusing on the remit and key issues 
facing the Board. In particular, the 
Board considered how it was 
discharging its strategic remit and 
reviewed key issues facing the Group 
and its businesses.
Completed questionnaires were 
submitted and reviewed by the 
Chairman. A summary of findings were 
presented to the Board in a manner 
that did not identify individual specific 
responses, ensuring that the 
follow-up discussion with the entire 
Board was open. The responses 
showed that the Board welcomed the 
process and that overall, the Board 
was content with the progress during 
the year and that the Board and its 
Committees continue to function well.
There was a continuous monitoring 
programme to ensure that items 
addressed in the FY 2016 evaluation 
were addressed during the year. 
Actions arising from the evaluation 
included ensuring that time on the 
Board agenda was allocated for:
• Reviews of major projects and 
lessons learnt during the year;
• Continued review of the 
composition of the Board through 
the Remuneration & Nominations 
Committee;
• Continued follow-up on key matters 
and actions arising at Board 
meetings; and
• Continued reviews of strategy, with 
close alignment of the Board and 
the Executive Committee agenda.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Board composition and diversity
We have continued to review the 
composition of the Board during FY 2017 
to ensure that we have the right mix of 
members to contribute effectively to the 
development of our strategy and how we 
operate. We consider diversity in its broadest 
sense in reviewing how the Board operates 
and its composition. 
François Morin and Tim Collier were 
appointed to the Board on 8 February 2017 
and 2 May 2017 respectively to ensure the 
mix of skills and expertise represented 
complements our strategic goals. 
Stephen Daintith and Suresh Kavan stood 
down as Directors during the year. 
The split of the Group’s profits between our 
US and other businesses, the global nature 
of our operations and the range of activities 
undertaken across the Group has been 
reflected over recent years in our Board 
appointments. Maintaining this broad range 
of appropriate skills, international and 
specific sector experience will continue to 
be a factor in our Board succession planning. 
The Board is aware of and takes into account 
the principles regarding diversity of its senior 
management. This is considered as part  
of the senior management appointment 
process. Further details on our approach are 
included in the Remuneration & Nominations 
Committee Report on page 56.

The Board has established an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced by the 
Company. This process has continued 
throughout the year and up to the date 
of approval of the financial statements. 
Monitoring is an ongoing process and 
principal risks are formally reviewed 
at half-year and year-end. 
Risk management function
The Group has separate Risk and Internal 
Audit functions. The Board believes that 
this separation minimises the threat of 
self-review across our ‘three lines of defence’ 
model (see page 48). The Risk function 
provides an increased focus on priority risk 
areas. It is responsible for maintaining the 
Group risk management process, facilitating 
change for selected risks, evolving our 
approach to operational compliance, 
and working with other Group functions. 
The Risk function engages specialist 
external expertise to maintain best practice 
approaches. To ensure an open discussion 
of emerging risks, the Chairman of the 
Audit & Risk Committee meets separately 
with the Head of Risk independent of 
operational management.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function undertakes 
an agreed programme of independent 
assurance reviews. The function sources 
external expertise as required from specialist 
suppliers. This mix of internal and specialist 
resource works well. Internal Audit seeks to 
comply with relevant professional standards, 
notably those issued by the Institute of 
Internal Auditors. 
The Internal Audit Charter (The Charter) sets 
out the purpose and objectives of Internal 
Audit. The Charter takes a systematic and 
disciplined approach to the evaluation and 
improvements in control and governance 
processes. It strengthens the function’s 
independence and objectivity by means of 
the function’s reporting lines and access 
to all records, personnel, property and 
operations of the Group. To ensure his 
independence from management, the 
Director of Internal Audit reports directly to 
the Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee. 
The Charter confirms the high-level 
responsibilities of operational management 
(first line of defence) and ensures that the 
Internal Audit function undertakes its third 
line of defence duties, avoiding any first or 
Board oversight of risk 
management and internal controls
The Board delegates day-to-day oversight  
of management's operations of internal 
controls and risk management to the Audit & 
Risk Committee. The Board considers that 
the Audit & Risk Committee possesses the 
requisite skills and experience to meet  
its obligations and provide the relevant 
assurance to the Board. Operating and 
investment decisions are delegated to the 
Investment & Finance Committee. Further 
details of the activities of these Committees 
are on pages 49 to 55.
The Board has overall responsibility for 
establishing, monitoring and maintaining 
an effective system of risk management 
and internal controls. This system provides 
reasonable rather than absolute assurance 
that the Group’s business objectives will 
be achieved within the risk tolerance levels 
defined by the Board. 
The Group’s operating businesses have 
a level of autonomy regarding the 
establishment of risk management and 
internal control systems, but are overseen 
by a central management team which 
reports to the Board. Certain functions 
are undertaken centrally, including: Group

The evaluation also considered any control 
weaknesses identified by Internal  
or External Audit, or as a result of incidents 
of fraud. Controls over the recording of 
amounts in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements relating to investments 
have also been assessed and considered  
as appropriate. 
Although DMGT does not have the ability  
to dictate or modify controls at its material 
associates, namely Euromoney and ZPG, 
Key features of the risk management 
and internal controls system
The main features of the system of risk 
management and internal controls in 
relation to the financial reporting process  
are described below:
1. Confirmation of key internal controls, 
and the fraud and bribery assessment
Each operating business confirms the 
operation of key internal controls to Group 
Finance and Internal Audit annually. The 
purpose of the assessment is to confirm  
the operation of a framework of internal 
controls, including anti-fraud controls, which 
are expected to be in place in each business 
unit. These internal controls are intended to 
provide standards against which the control 
environments of DMGT’s business units  
can be monitored. An annual fraud and 
bribery risk assessment is completed 
simultaneously, detailing risks and mitigating 
controls. In each case, the Internal Audit 
team reviews and follows up on these 
submissions, as appropriate.
second line duties. The Charter is reviewed 
annually and updated as required to take 
account of changing practices and 
standards. The Audit & Risk Committee is 
satisfied that the provisions of the Charter 
have been achieved in the year. 
The Board formally evaluated the system 
of risk management and internal control in 
conjunction with the Audit & Risk Committee 
during the year (see pages 50 to 55). This 
evaluation focused on material controls 
relating to principal risks and entity-level 
controls, as well as additional controls and 
the Directors review the effectiveness 
of the systems of risk management and 
internal control at these entities via 
Board representation.
Monitoring and oversight 
The Group operates a ‘three lines of defence’ 
model. The benefits of this approach are 
shown in the table below. The Board 
delegates day-to-day responsibility for 
internal controls to operational management 
with oversight by the Executive Committee 
and the Audit & Risk Committee.
2. Review of relevant and timely  
financial information 
Each of the operating businesses and DMGT 
executive management regularly review 
relevant and timely financial information. 
This is produced from a financial information 
system operated across the Group. It is 
supported by a framework of forecasts as 
well as annual budgets that are approved  
by the Executive Committee and confirmed 
by the Investment & Finance Committee.
3. Senior Accounting Officer sign-off
The Group Chief Financial Officer is the 
Senior Accounting Officer and is required, 
by HMRC, to certify that the Company, 
and its subsidiaries, have established and 
maintained appropriate arrangements to 
ensure that tax liabilities are calculated 
accurately in all material respects.
Fair, balanced and understandable
One of the key governance requirements  
of a group’s Annual Report is for it to be  
fair, balanced and understandable. The 
coordination and review of Group-wide input 
into the Annual Report is a specific project, 
with defined time frames, which runs 
alongside the formal audit process 
undertaken by the External Auditor. The 
Audit & Risk Committee’s and the Board’s 
confirmations of satisfaction with the 
process and the statements being made  
is underpinned by:
• Comprehensive guidance being provided 
to the operating businesses in respect of 
each of the requirements for, and each of 
their contributions to, the Annual Report;
• A verification process in respect of the 
factual context of the submissions made;
• Comprehensive sign-off process by 
owners of all statements made; and
• Comprehensive reviews undertaken  
at different levels of the Group with  
the aim of ensuring consistency and 
overall balance.
As a result of this process, the Audit &  
Risk Committee and the Board are satisfied 
with the overall fairness, balance and 
understandability of the Annual Report.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Audit & Risk Committee:  
Chairman’s Introduction
In the context of our changing business, we focus our audit work on 
judgemental areas of accounting and auditing, and our risk work on  
high impact possible events.
There is a comprehensive process to review significant business risks  
to the Group including financial risk, operational risk and compliance  
risk that could affect or impact the achievement of the Group’s strategy 
and business objectives.
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present the Audit & Risk 
Committee Report.
The combination of the former Audit and 
Risk Committees has progressed well 
with care being taken to give appropriate 
emphasis to both aspects of our work 
in line with the financial reporting cycle. 
To recognise the extra workload, we 
introduced an extra meeting in July that 
concentrated on risks. 
Risk has hardly been out of the news over 
the last 12 months. We have addressed 
macro-risks such as Brexit, the minority 
UK government and sanctions, as well as 
corporate risks such as cyber-crime and 
data protection legislation. 
The Group changed significantly during the 
year with the partial disposal of the stake 
in Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 
(Euromoney) which is now no longer a 
subsidiary. As part of the transitional 
services agreement, Internal Audit continued 
to provide its services for the first half of the 
financial year. As the Group no longer has 
management responsibility for Euromoney, 
the work of Internal Audit in respect of that 
business is not addressed in this report, 
but will be described in the Annual Report 
of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC. 
The Audit & Risk Committee spent time 
at the half-year and year-end reviewing 
and challenging the effectiveness of the 
communication of the Group’s results 
in the light of Euromoney becoming an 
associate company. 
The completion of the scheduled triennial 
external review of Internal Audit was 
timely in the light of the de-scoping of its 
responsibility to the Euromoney Audit 
Committee. The independent review 
has resulted in a blueprint for the future 
development of the function that has been 
embraced by both the Director of Internal 
Audit and the Audit & Risk Committee. 
Further details are set out in the 
oversight section.

The following pages set out the 
Audit & Risk Committee’s Report 
for the financial year. The Report 
is structured in four parts:
•  How the Audit & Risk Committee 
operates: membership, key 
responsibilities, governance, 
effectiveness and operating 
practices;
•  Review of the year: key activities 
and the significant financial 
reporting and auditing issues; 
•  Oversight: Risk and controls, and  
Internal Audit; and 
•  External Auditor: appointment, 
independence, effectiveness 
and objectivity.

Corporate Governance
50
Governance
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report The Audit & Risk Committee meets at least 
four times a year. This year the Committee 
met five times to incorporate a meeting to 
focus specifically on risk matters. 
All members of the Audit & Risk Committee 
are Non-Executive Directors and two are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Committee members continue to represent 
the necessary range of financial, risk, control 
and commercial expertise required to 
provide an effective level of challenge to 
management. Kevin Parry is a former senior 
audit partner, former chief financial officer 
and has extensive experience as an audit 
committee chairman. David Nelson is the 
senior partner of an accounting practice. 
Dominique Trempont is a former chief 
financial officer and has extensive 
experience as an audit committee chairman 
and member. Consequently Kevin Parry, 
David Nelson and Dominique Trempont 
are designated for Code purposes as the 
financial experts with competence in 
accounting and auditing.
Key responsibilities
The Audit & Risk Committee’s terms of 
reference are on our website at www.dmgt.
com/about-us/board-and-governance.
Governance
The integrity of the Group’s financial results 
and internal control systems are important 
to the Directors and the shareholders. 
Consequently, the Audit & Risk Committee 
encourages and seeks to safeguard high 
standards of integrity and conduct in 
financial reporting and internal control. 
The Committee tests and challenges the 
results and controls in conjunction with 
management and the Internal and 
External Auditors. 
The Committee has fulfilled its 
responsibilities during the year and confirms 
the Group is in compliance with the Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014. The Committee 
is permitted to obtain its own external 
advice at the Company’s expense. No such 
advice was sought during the year. 
Andrew Lane and David Nelson are 
advisers to the Harmsworth family and not 
Independent Directors. This is a deviation 
from Code Provision C.3.1. The Board 
considers that their membership adds to the 
deliberations of the Audit & Risk Committee 
and I, as the Committee Chairman confirm 
there was no conflict of interest during 
the year. 
Effectiveness
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews its 
Terms of Reference and effectiveness 
annually. The review confirmed that the 
Committee is effective at meeting its 
objectives, the provisions of the Code 
and the needs of the Group. 
The Committee embraced greater 
emphasis being placed on cyber risks 
and restructurings of businesses 
and management.
Operating practices
During the year the Audit & Risk Committee 
meetings were scheduled to take place just 
prior to Board meetings to maximise the 
efficiency of interactions. Reports are made 
to each Board meeting on the activities 
of the Committee, focusing on matters of 
particular relevance to the Board in the 
conduct of its work.
The Committee has been supported in its 
activities during the year by the CEO, Group 
Chief Financial Officer, Risk team, and 
Director of Internal Audit as well as the 
External Auditors. These individuals 
generally sponsor Committee papers, which 
are typically distributed one week prior to 
meetings. The Committee works with all 
contributors to discuss judgemental issues 
at an early and relevant opportunity. 
The Group Chief Financial Officer, the Deputy 
Finance Director, the Group Financial 
Controller, the Director of Internal Audit, 
the Risk managers and the External Auditor 
are invited to each meeting but are recused 
when appropriate. This approach results in 
informed decisions based on quality papers 
and discussion which provides a thorough 
understanding of facts and circumstances.
The Committee met regularly and separately 
with: the External Auditor, Director of 
Internal Audit, the Group Chief Financial 
Officer and Head of Risk, without other 
executive management being present.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Financial reporting and auditing issues 
The Audit & Risk Committee considered and discussed the significant matters relating to financial reporting and accounting,  
as set out in the table below.
The issue and its significance Focus of work Comments and conclusion
Financial reporting 
The content of the Annual and 
Half-Year Reports and trading 
updates needs to be 
appropriate, complying with 
laws and regulation.
We reviewed the reports to improve their clarity, 
focusing particularly on disclosures in connection 
with the partial disposal of Euromoney and 
impairment charges. 
We specifically reviewed:
• All accounting policies for continued 
appropriateness and consistency of application;
• All sections of the Annual Report having 
particular regard for the Audit & Risk Committee’s 
responsibilities for the financial statements;
• Reports from financial management, Legal, 
Risk and Internal Audit which confirmed 
compliance with regulations; and 
• The financial risks and papers to support 
the going concern basis of accounting.
A materiality threshold of £5 million has been set 
for exceptional items unless there was continuation 
of an activity previously disclosed as exceptional.
There were no significant changes to accounting 
policies. Based on our enquiries with management 
and the External Auditors, we concluded the policies 
were being properly applied. 
We were satisfied that judgemental matters were 
explained. 
We were satisfied that the Group complied with 
reporting requirements.
We designed additional disclosures in connection with 
the disposal of Euromoney to allow the performance 
of the Group to be readily understood. 
Taken as a whole, the Annual 
Report needs to be fair, 
balanced and understandable 
so that it is relevant to readers.
We continued our practice of comparing our 
Annual Report with those of other relevant 
companies and asked our External Auditors 
for improvement recommendations. 
Drafts of the Annual Report were reviewed by 
both the Audit & Risk Committee and the Board. 
We used the Executive Directors’, the External 
Auditors’ and the Committee’s knowledge to 
determine the overall fairness, balance and 
understandability of the Report, prior to its 
final approval by the Board.
We received confirmation that individuals’ 
responsibilities had been fulfilled and confirmed that 
the overall Report was consistent with the Directors’ 
knowledge. This allowed the Audit & Risk Committee 
and the Board to be satisfied that the Annual Report 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable. 
We were satisfied that the information presented in the 
Strategic Report was consistent with the performance 
of the business reported in the financial statements. 
In particular, we were satisfied that the estimates, 
outlook and quantified risk disclosures in the financial 
statements are consistent with those identified in 
the Strategic Report. The Committee concluded 
that appropriate judgements had been applied 
in determining the estimates and that sufficient 
disclosure has been made to allow readers to 
understand the uncertainties surrounding outcomes.
We were satisfied that the Viability Statement should 
be over a three-year period, consistent with the 
Group’s business planning cycle and the next 
refinancing of our short-term bank debt facilities.
We will continue to monitor feedback for future 
enhancements to the Annual Report. 
The Annual Report includes 
a number of non-GAAP 
measures. See Note 13  
and page 124.
In addition to the disclosure of operating profit, 
before and after specified adjustments, other 
non-GAAP measures (known as alternative 
performance measures) are disclosed in the 
Annual Report, e.g. underlying revenue growth, 
net debt to EBITDA ratio. We commissioned 
Internal Audit to review other alternative 
performance measures to ensure whenever 
possible that they were third-party sourced 
or otherwise robustly compiled.
We also sought to ensure that equal prominence 
was given to statutory measures and that 
explanations accompanied all alternative 
measures including pro forma figures quoted 
throughout the accounts. 
We decided to continue to adjust operating profit for 
intangible asset amortisation and for compensation 
payments which were capital in nature because they 
are akin to investment payments which are capitalised. 
Additional adjustments have been made to exclude 
the impact of exceptional costs, impairments and 
other fair value adjustments. These adjustments assist 
understanding the outcome for the reporting period. 
We enhanced the prominence of GAAP numbers 
and improved the reconciliation of APMs to GAAP .
We determined that the published data was of a high 
quality and helps shareholders understand progress 
(particularly in the digital arena). Sources of data 
are disclosed.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report The issue and its significance Focus of work Comments and conclusion
Accounting judgements
The Group has capitalised 
software development costs, 
other intangible assets and 
goodwill associated with 
acquisitions. Goodwill and 
intangible assets represent 
40% (2016 185%) and 23% 
(2016 94%) respectively of net 
assets. The carrying values 
need to be justified by 
reference to future economic 
benefits to the Group 
(see Notes 21 and 22).
We ensured capitalised costs were separately 
identifiable and met the requirements of relevant 
accounting standards.
We considered whether there have been events 
triggering an impairment review. Where there was 
such an event and whenever impairment testing 
was otherwise required, we reviewed papers 
prepared by executive management to determine 
whether an impairment event had taken place. 
As there were significant impairments in the 
second half we specifically reassessed the timing 
of the recognition of the impairments to ensure 
that they were recognised in the correct period. 
We focused on facts, assumption, methodologies 
and discount rates. We received input from 
both operational and financial management and 
also reviewed relevant external commentaries 
and valuations.
We were satisfied that costs that had been capitalised 
were appropriately held on the balance sheet. 
Our reviews embraced sensitivities to changes in 
assumptions which allowed us to understand the 
materiality of conclusions in the context of our 
financial reporting.
We focused on RMS, Genscape, Hobsons, Xceligent 
and SiteCompli. 
We were satisfied with the impairments in respect of 
goodwill, capitalised software, and other intangibles 
were charged in the appropriate period and in 
appropriate amounts.
The Audit & Risk Committee noted that the conclusions 
were sensitive to future outcomes. Some combined 
downside sensitivities could trigger impairments if 
they occur in the future. Appropriate disclosures were 
included in financial statements.
The Group carries deferred 
tax assets in respect of 
brought-forward losses and 
deferred interest that represent 
7% (2016 32%) of net assets 
(see Note 37).
At the year end, the Group recognised deferred 
tax assets of £61.5 million (2016 £169.3 million) 
in respect of brought-forward losses and 
deferred interest. 
We ensured deferred tax assets were reduced 
in line with the reduced trading outlook in the 
B2B businesses, notably those which triggered 
impairment reviews.
We reviewed papers prepared by executive 
management in respect of overseas tax losses that 
can no longer be recognised as deferred tax assets.
The assets on the balance sheet were recognised 
following a detailed review of how the brought-forward 
tax losses would be utilised and we were satisfied that 
changes to tax laws internationally did not adversely 
impact the carrying value of the total assets.
Where required tax assets were written off in the year.
The Group actively manages 
its portfolio of investments 
and consequently is active 
in making acquisitions and 
disposals. Transactions that 
contain unusual terms and/or 
innovative structures would 
require the accounting 
treatment to be carefully 
considered.
During the year, £26.7 million 
was incurred on acquisitions 
and £215.8 million was realised 
on disposals (see Notes 17 
and 18). 
The Audit & Risk Committee carefully considers 
judgemental accounting and the carrying value 
of intangible assets and goodwill. 
The Committee considered the accounting 
treatment for both the sell-down of Euromoney 
and the dilution of DMGT’s stake in ZPG. We 
considered the complexity of the Euromoney 
sell-down and the adequacy of the explanation 
of its new status as an associate. 
We reviewed the valuation of fair value of the 
Group’s remaining c.49% stake.
The Internal Audit team audits all significant 
acquisitions within 12 months of the relevant 
acquisition where consideration exceeds  
£10 million. 
The Investment & Finance Committee oversees all 
acquisition and disposal activity. There are three 
common Committee members. We were satisfied 
with the judgements made in the year.
We performed a robust review of the treatment of 
disposals during the year and were satisfied with the 
treatments and calculations.
The Audit & Risk Committee reassessed the timing 
of reviews of acquisitions by Internal Audit and 
approved revised practices. 
The Group has multiple sources 
of revenue, including 
subscriptions, software sales, 
display and native advertising, 
branded and pre-roll videos 
and licence fees. Consequently 
revenue recognition can 
be intricate.
We reviewed the accounting policies for  
revenue recognition and determined their 
appropriateness. We also reviewed deviations  
in the applications of policies and sought  
to eliminate differences in preparation for  
the adoption of IFRS 15 in the year ending  
30 September 2018.
Internal Audit visits all businesses on a rotational 
basis taking account of changed circumstances 
and perceived risk. Their work includes the testing 
of revenue recognition.
One immaterial difference was identified as a result 
of the review.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Other financial matters
In addition to the significant matters 
addressed above, the Audit & Risk Committee 
maintains a rolling agenda of items for its 
review, including: capital strategy; financial 
and treasury management; feedback from 
analysts and investors; reconciliations of 
reported financial results with management 
accounts; tax management; and litigation. 
Nothing of significance arose in respect of 
those reviews during the year. There was 
no interaction with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) corporate reporting team 
during the year. 
There was no disagreement over accounting 
or reporting outcomes with management 
or the External Auditors during the 
reporting period. 
Oversight
The Audit & Risk Committee has oversight 
responsibility for risks and controls and 
direct responsibility for the operation of the 
Internal Audit function.
The Committee approves separate annual 
audit and risk plans that are flexible enough 
to embrace intra-year changes due to 
changed circumstances, such as acquisitions, 
disposals, extensive management change 
etc. The plans changed during the year 
to extend from a one-year to a flexible 
three-year planning cycle. 
At each Committee, the Risk Managers and 
the Director of Internal Audit address key 
matters which have arisen, focusing on  
the most significant findings. Additionally, 
common themes are drawn out so that 
management can make early enquiries  
of businesses not recently visited by the 
assurance functions with a view to heading 
off potential issues. 
In addition to formal reporting, the Audit & 
Risk Committee Chairman meets with the 
Risk team and the Director of Internal Audit. 
Risk and controls
A Group-wide risk assessment process is 
managed biannually by the Risk function, 
reviewing risks to the achievement of 
business plans in operating businesses. This 
process assists management in identifying 
internal and external threats and prioritising 
responses to them. The results are collated 
and an overall Group-wide risk plan is 
derived from these results which is approved 
by the Audit & Risk Committee. The work 
evaluates whether the system, including 
reporting and controls, adequately supports 
the Board in its risk oversight. The Audit & 
Risk Committee focuses on insights into 
material changes and trends in the risk 
profile. For example, the complexity of cyber 
risks and data governance and security risks 
increased during the year. The principal 
risks and mitigating actions are set out 
on pages 36 to 39.
The Committee’s view is that financial risks 
are not the principal risks that the Group faces 
but it places emphasis on the maintenance of 
high standards for controlling financial risks. 
In addition to an annual confirmation from 
financial officers that the environment has 
operated effectively, it gains independent 
assurance from internal audits. During the 
year the Committee reviewed the top financial 
risks facing the Group, including: foreign 
exchange and interest rates; liquidity; credit; 
counterparty and capital management. 
Further, two reports were received on 
proposed developments in the systems 
for financial control and reporting.
During the year a new Group Chief Financial 
Officer, Tim Collier was appointed. To 
simplify reporting lines all operational CFOs 
report to him directly in addition to their 
CEOs. The Committee monitored and 
participated in his induction and was 
satisfied that the more direct reporting line of 
operational companies to the central finance 
function improved transparency. The Audit & 
Risk Committee closely monitored changes 
in financial management and reviewed the 
competence and quantity of the financial 
management resource in discussion with the 
Group Chief Financial Officer. The Committee 
was also satisfied that the Company 
remained able to fulfil its first line of  
defence duties and that there is a culture  
of continuous improvement. 
The Committee reviewed the whistleblowing 
arrangements in place, which enable 
employees to raise concerns in confidence. 
The Committee received analysis of the 
types of concerns raised by employees. 
No significant matters were reported in the 
year and the number of reports made was 
consistent with prior years of operation.
Internal Audit 
The Audit & Risk Committee reviewed and 
approved the Internal Audit Charter. 
Amendments were made to adopt a 
three-year cycle and maintain compliance 
with evolving best practice.
The scope of Internal Audit work is considered 
for each operating company (including Head 
Office) and takes account of assessments of 
risk, input from senior management and the 
Committee, and previous findings. Some 
thematic audits are undertaken for the 
Group as a whole. For example, this year 
there was a further Group-wide emphasis on 
cash collection management, information 
security (including the General Data Protection 
Regulation), cyber-crime and anti-fraud and 
bribery procedures. Other issues selectively 
audited included revenue recognition and 
payroll. At each meeting, the Committee 
assesses recommended changes to the annual 
plan to ensure that total coverage meets 
its requirements and that the budget and 
resource levels are adequate. 
Throughout the year, there was a range of 
outcomes from internal audits. The Audit & 
Risk Committee welcomes the identification 
of areas for improvement and places higher 
emphasis on actions taken as a result of 
review points than on particular findings at 
the time of review. Whenever deficiencies or 
opportunities for improvements are identified, 
the Audit & Risk Committee’s emphasis is on 
the appropriateness of the reaction to the 
identified issue. The Committee looks to 
management to take timely and proportionate 
steps to eliminate weaknesses. The Audit & 
Risk Committee monitors their adherence 
to agreed timescales.
During the year, as planned, the Audit & Risk 
Committee commissioned an external review 
of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function. The review was conducted by 
Deloitte LLP in February 2017 and their overall 
assessment was that in delivering its remit, 
the Internal Audit function is providing an 
effective service to DMGT. 
Recommendations for future developments 
were welcomed by the Director of Internal 
Audit and the Committee and provide a 
blueprint for development over the next three 
years. Some changes have already been 
introduced, such as audit analytics and use 
of audit technology. 
External Auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is the External 
Auditor. The Group lead audit partner is 
Neil Grimes, who has led the audit since the 
beginning of the relationship. Its first audit 
of DMGT was in respect of the year ended 
30 September 2015. The Audit & Risk Committee 
has responsibility for making recommendations 
to the Board on the reappointment of the 
External Auditor, for determining its fees and 
for ensuring its independence of the Group and 
management. The External Auditor stand for 
reappointment at the Annual General Meeting, 
but absent concerns over the quality of their 
service or opinion, we anticipate retaining PwC 
as our auditors for at least the next two years.
Auditor independence
The Audit & Risk Committee considered the 
safeguards in place to protect the External 
Governance
Corporate Governance
54
Governance
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Auditor’s independence. In particular, the 
Committee has ensured that the Company’s 
policy on the External Auditor’s 
independence is consistent with the Ethical 
Standard set out by the FRC in the UK. PwC 
reviewed its own independence in line with 
this criteria and its own ethical guideline 
standards. PwC confirmed to the Committee 
that following this review it was satisfied 
that it had acted in accordance with relevant 
regulatory and professional requirements 
and that its objectivity is not compromised. 
To ensure no conflicts of independence 
arising from Auditors being responsible for 
non-audit work, the Audit & Risk Committee 
reviewed and approved the policy on 
non-audit services. The review included 
consideration of the process to manage the 
engagement of PwC, regulatory changes  
and good practice. 
The audit fee payable to PwC amounts to 
£3.0 million (2016 £2.7 million). The Audit & 
Risk Committee is satisfied that the fee is 
commensurate with permitting PwC to 
provide a quality audit. In addition to the 
Group’s policy, PwC has confirmed that any 
non-audit work commissioned by the Group 
is reviewed for compliance with its internal 
policy on the provision of non-audit services. 
The cap on non-audit service fees is set at 
70% of the average audit fees for the 
preceding three years. The total non-audit 
fees paid to PwC amounted to £0.8 million 
(2016 £0.8 million) which is within the 70% of 
audit fees. The Committee is satisfied that 
PwC was selected based on individuals’ 
particular expertise, knowledge and 
experience and that the work did not impair 
PwC’s independence as External Auditor (see 
Note 5 to the accounts). All non-audit work 
undertaken by PwC was approved by the 
Committee unless it was de minimis and not 
prohibited under our policy. 
The Committee, having taken account of 
PwC’s confirmations, is satisfied that PwC 
is independent of DMGT and its subsidiaries. 
Audit quality and materiality
The Audit & Risk Committee places great 
importance on ensuring that there are high 
standards of quality and effectiveness in the 
external audit process. 
The Committee has reviewed the quality 
of PwC’s audit by way of interviews and 
completion of a questionnaire by Audit & 
Risk Committee members, by regular 
attendance at Audit & Risk Committees and 
by financial management. The Audit & Risk 
Committee is satisfied that its requirements 
were met with some improvement actions 
in respect of communications being noted. 
In addition, the Committee reviewed PwC’s 
scope and approved the external audit plan 
to ensure that it is consistent with the scope 
of the external audit engagement. The 
Committee discussed significant and 
elevated risk areas that are most likely to 
give rise to a material financial reporting 
error or those that are perceived to be of 
a higher risk and requiring audit emphasis 
(including those set out in PwC’s Report on 
pages 86 to 92). It considered the audit scope 
and materiality threshold. This included 
the Group-wide risks and local statutory 
reporting, enhanced by desktop reviews for 
smaller, low-risk entities. 79% (2016 75%) of 
the revenue and 76% (2016 71%) of adjusted 
profit was fully audited; 8% (2016 8%) of 
revenue was subjected to specific procedures 
and the balance of revenue and profit was 
covered by desktop reviews. As scheduled 
this year's audit included Genscape. 
We have discussed the accuracy of financial 
reporting (known as materiality) with PwC, 
both as regards to accounting errors that will 
be brought to the Audit & Risk Committee’s 
attention, and as regards to amounts that 
would need to be adjusted so that the 
financial statements give a true and fair view. 
Errors can arise for many reasons, ranging 
from deliberate errors (fraud), to good 
estimates that were made at a point in time 
that, with the benefit of more time, could 
have been more accurately measured. Overall 
audit materiality has been set at £9 million 
(2016 £10.0 million). This equates to 
approximately 4% (2016 4%) of adjusted 
pre-tax profit, as reported in the income 
statement. This is within the range that audit 
opinions are conventionally thought to be 
reliable. The absolute decline in materiality 
results from Euromoney no longer being a 
subsidiary. To manage the risk that aggregate 
uncorrected errors become material, 
we agreed that audit testing would be 
performed to a lower materiality threshold 
of £6.8 million (2016 £7.5 million). PwC has 
drawn the Committee’s attention to all 
identified uncorrected misstatements greater 
than £0.5 million. The aggregate net 
difference between the reported adjusted 
profit before tax and the Auditor’s judgement 
of net adjusted profit before tax was less than 
£1.2 million which, was significantly less than 
audit materiality. The gross differences were 
attributable to various individual components 
of the income statement. No audit difference 
was material to any line item in either the 
income statement or the balance sheet. 
Accordingly, the Committee did not require 
any adjustment to be made to the financial 
statements as a result of the audit differences 
reported by the External Auditor. 
As in the prior year, we asked PwC to write to 
us to explain how they would respond to the 
findings of the Audit Quality Review team 
of the FRC in its annual review of their firm 
(in so far as comments are relevant to DMGT). 
Additionally, the Committee Chairman, Group 
Chief Financial Officer and Group Financial 
Controller discussed with PwC in detail the 
work it carried out on the audit of DMGT’s 
Annual Report. The Audit & Risk Committee 
was satisfied with the specific responses to 
both sets of enquiries. 
PwC has outlined to the Audit & Risk 
Committee the professional development 
programme applicable to the partners and 
employees engaged on our audit, has 
reviewed key judgements taken during the 
course of the audit, and confirmed the audit 
complies with their internal independent 
review procedures. We have reviewed the 
professional skills, knowledge and scepticism 
of key members of the audit team including 
the Group team and partners responsible 
for the divisional audits. 
We have reviewed PwC's latest available 
transparency report. We have enquired 
whether the audit of DMGT was subject to 
either a quality assurance process undertaken 
internally by PwC or externally by the FRC. 
The Audit & Risk Committee met in private 
with PwC at the conclusion of the audit to 
confirm that they had received a high level 
of cooperation from management and to 
receive private feedback on the quality 
of financial management. 
During the year, the Audit & Risk Committee 
reviewed the quality of the 2016 audit, taking 
account of PwC’s internal assessment, 
management’s assessment and the 
Committee’s assessment. The Committee was 
satisfied with the robustness of the opinion 
and with the audit service. In particular the 
Audit & Risk Committee was pleased with an 
overall improvement in service scores, whilst 
asking PwC to put added emphasis on the 
service provided to some US subsidiaries. 
Based on the information currently available, 
which draws on the enquiries outlined above 
and informal soundings of management, the 
Audit & Risk Committee anticipates it will 
conclude there has been a robust, high-
quality audit for the year ended 30 September 
2017, both in respect of PwC’s opinion and 
service. The Committee has consequently 
recommended that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP be reappointed as Auditor at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting.

• The Committee confirmed that it had 
complied with its Terms of Reference 
throughout the year.
• The combined Remuneration & 
Nominations Committee reviewed and 
updated its Terms of Reference to take 
effect from 30 November 2017.
• The Committee paid particular attention  
to extending the term of any Non-Executive

• The process for appointing Directors 
depends on which role is being filled. 
External recruiters and other methods 
have been used to identify potential 
candidates. 
• In line with Code Provision A.4.2 the 
Non-Executive Directors met with 
the Chairman without the Executive 
Directors present. 
• Following the death of Nicholas Berry

Dominique Trempont was appointed 
on 1 November 2017. 
• The Chairman of the Committee is 
Lord Rothermere and the majority of its 
members are not considered to be 
independent under the Code. Although 
this does not meet Code Provision B.2.1, 
as holder of all the Ordinary Shares of the 
Company through the Trust, the Board 
considers that Lord Rothermere’s interests 
are fully aligned with those of other 
shareholders. Additionally, the Committee 
is confident that its membership ensures 
that it carries out all aspects of its role 
with proper and appropriate regard to 
long-term shareholder interests.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Chairman’s statement  
on remuneration
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Pay for performance continues to be a key 
objective for the business and we believe 
that the refinements we have made to both 
our short and long-term incentives this year 
will ensure that we achieve this. We continue 
to focus on standardising bonus terms and 
conditions for senior executives across all 
our global operations whilst recognising 
the different countries, sectors and stage 
of development of each business.
Our incentive schemes across our businesses 
are designed to reward sustainable 
profitable growth and we focus on ensuring 
that performance targets are in line with 
our long-term strategy and the creation 
of sustained shareholder value. 
Executive Directors’ bonus payments 
for FY 2017
In FY 2017 we broadened the metrics used 
in the Executive Bonus Plan to include 
a revenue and cash flow component in 
addition to a profit metric. The previous 
weighting given to strategic objectives has 
been removed. In FY 2018 it is our intention 
to refine this further and to use two metrics, 
revenue and cash operating income. Cash 
operating income (operating profit plus 
depreciation and amortisation less capital 
expenditure) is a metric that captures both 
profit and underlying cash generation of 
the business.
The FY 2017 plan introduced an adjustment, 
to ensure that participants do not benefit 
from, and are not penalised by, short-term 
currency fluctuations beyond their control. 
This will continue in FY 2018.
The purpose of the Executive Bonus Plan 
is to focus the participants on delivering 
sustainable profitable growth. In this 
year of transformation, the Committee 
considered it was fair and appropriate to 
use its discretion to apply adjustments to 
account for strategic re-structuring decisions 
during the year. These decisions were taken 
to set the business up to deliver long-term 
shareholder value but impacted on the 
ability to meet the performance parameters 
of the plan. As such, the Committee was 
satisfied that an outcome of 85% of target 
was reflective of overall DMGT financial  
and non-financial performance.
Kevin Beatty’s bonus, as CEO of dmg media, 
reflects the relatively strong performance 
of the Consumer Media business in a 
challenging environment. Paul Dacre does 
not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
Details of the Executive Directors’ bonuses 
can be found on page 62.
Pay Review for FY 2018
We regularly review the competitive position 
of remuneration for the Company’s Executive 
Directors. Base pay increases in the last few 
years have been modest and in line with 
increases for the general DMGT workforce 
and the relevant external market. Salaries for 
FY 2017 were frozen for all Executive Directors 
and there was a targeted and modest salary 
increase for other employees across the 
Group. The Committee is keeping base pay 
under review and retains the discretion 
to authorise subsequent increases.
Governance
Remuneration Report
Pay for performance continues to be 
a key objective for the business and 
we believe that the refinements we have 
made to both our short and long-term 
incentives this year will ensure that 
we achieve this.”
Remuneration Policy
In accordance with the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (as amended), shareholders are 
provided with the opportunity to 
endorse the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy through a binding vote. The 
current policy was agreed at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 
8 February 2017 and the policy 
has been operated, as described, 
from that date.

2016 Long-term incentive award 
Our new Long-Term Executive Incentive Plan 
was introduced in 2017. The performance 
period in respect of the 2016 award will be 
from FY 2017 to the end of FY 2019. The plan 
is intended to:
• provide a direct link between pay and 
performance of the business – with the 
opportunity for exceptional levels of 
reward linked to truly exceptional business 
performance; and
• reward the delivery of sustainable 
long-term growth and capital efficiency.
To achieve this, the plan has been designed 
to give participants a share of profit growth 
before tax above a minimum growth 
threshold – ensuring that the award is 
appropriately challenging and an Executive 
Director is not rewarded unless a minimum 
performance threshold is reached.
To ensure that shareholders’ capital is used 
efficiently, a capital charge (or credit) will 
be applied, business-by-business, for any 
additional capital used (or released) relative 
to the starting level. The total reward for 
each participant is subject to a cap. 
At the same time we have also increased 
the shareholding guidelines for the CEO 
(and Chairman) to 500% of base salary. 
The outcome of the 2016 LTIP award will be 
delivered in shares upon vesting at the end 
of FY 2019.
In FY 2018 we intend to make LTIP awards 
on the same basis. 
Long-term incentive awards vesting  
in FY 2017
The vesting of the award made in 
December 2012 was measured against 
the following priorities:
• growing B2B business;
• investing in strong brands of digital 
consumer media, particularly MailOnline;
• growing sustainable earnings and 
dividends; and
• increasing the Company’s exposure to 
growth economies and international 
opportunities.
We have continued to make progress against 
these priorities. Over the last five years, 
B2B revenues (excluding Euromoney) 
achieved an average increase of 7% on 
an underlying basis; MailOnline revenues 
have grown from £28 million in FY 2012 
to £119 million in FY 2017 and made good 
progress on its path to profitability; 
dividends continued to grow in real terms 
and international revenues increased from 
37% to 51% of total revenue. Given this, the 
Committee has determined that the award 
should vest in full in December 2017. For 
more information see table 6.1 on page 64. 
The award made in December 2014 to 
Paul Dacre is measured against the 
following priorities:
• ensuring the financial stability of the Mail 
Titles; and
• investing in strong brands of digital 
consumer media, particularly MailOnline.
We have made good progress against  
these priorities and the Committee has 
determined that the award should vest in  
full in December 2017. For more information 
see table 6.3 on page 65. 
The award to Kevin Beatty made in 
December 2010 under the 2008 Long Term 
Incentive Plan which vested at 53.9% in 
September 2013 became fully realisable 
in December 2016. For more information 
see table 4 on page 62.
Changes to the Executive Directors
Stephen Daintith and Suresh Kavan both 
stood down from the Board during the year 
and I would like to thank them for their 
contribution to the business.
Under the terms of his service contract, 
Suresh Kavan was entitled to a pro-rated 
bonus for FY 2017. On resignation, Stephen 
Daintith was not eligible to participate in 
the bonus for FY 2017 and unvested share 
awards were forfeited in full. Further details 
can be found on page 66.
Tim Collier was appointed as Group Chief 
Financial Officer in May 2017. Details of his 
compensation arrangements can be found 
on page 59. His appointment terms are in 
line with DMGT’s Remuneration Policy and 
include a one-off award of DMGT shares. 
The award is intended to compensate him 
for the forfeiture of unvested incentives from 
his previous employer. The award will vest 
in two tranches in December 2018 (188,284 
shares) and December 2019 (136,681 shares), 
subject to continuing employment.
Reflecting our emphasis on pay for 
performance, the fixed pay (base salary and 
pension allowance) agreed for Tim Collier is 
lower than his predecessor’s, with a greater 
focus on variable pay elements.

Remuneration and Nominations Committee role and activities
The Committee’s responsibilities with respect to remuneration include:
• Group remuneration policy; and
• Setting the remuneration, benefits and terms and conditions of employment of the Company’s Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. 
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the Company’s website. The Committee is chaired by Lord Rothermere with Committee 
members David Nelson and Heidi Roizen. Dominique Trempont was appointed with effect from 1 November 2017.
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) recommends that a remuneration committee should be composed entirely of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that, as the beneficiary of the Company’s largest shareholder, Lord Rothermere’s interests are 
fully aligned with those of other shareholders. The Committee is confident that its make-up ensures that it carries out all aspects of its role 
with proper and appropriate regard to long-term shareholders’ interests and that this alignment is, in fact, stronger as a direct consequence 
of its membership. The Non-Executive Directors meet regularly and independently outside of the formal meetings.
The Committee spends a large portion of its time reviewing the remuneration and incentive plans of businesses which are diverse both in 
geography and sector. There are a variety of incentive plans requiring significant consideration and oversight, which are designed to reflect 
each business type and stage of development, the market it operates in and aims to incentivisation of the delivery of its strategic plan. 
The Committee’s objective is to combine the necessary attention to short-term financial performance, through annual bonus plans, 
with a stronger focus on the fundamentals that drive long-term growth, through long-term incentive schemes.
Committee Performance and Effectiveness
In September 2017, the Committee conducted a formal review of its effectiveness and concluded that it had fulfilled its remit and had been 
effective in the year.
Risk and reward
During the year, the Committee reviewed and confirmed that the plans in operation throughout the Group did not incentivise excessive risk 
and, in particular, that the remuneration incentives in the Company are compatible with its risk policies and systems.
Advice to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee received advice from members of the senior management team during the year. KPMG also provided advice in relation 
to valuation of subsidiaries for the purpose of long-term incentive schemes. Fees paid to KPMG amounted to £16,000 during FY 2017.

Table 2.2: DMGT annual bonus targets (Audited)
Strategic measures were removed as measures in FY 2017. The financial measures are split into three categories and weighted appropriately 
to the role of the Executive Director (shown in table 2.1). Kevin Beatty’s bonus is weighted 70% against targets specific to dmg media and 30% 
against DMGT targets.
The Board considers the performance targets for the measures to be commercially sensitive as it would disclose information of value 
to competitors, and they will not be disclosed. The final targets were adjusted to reflect the final US$/£ average exchange rate over the year.
The purpose of the Executive Bonus Plan is to focus the participants on delivering profitable growth. The Committee considered it was fair and 
appropriate to use its discretion to apply adjustments to account for strategic restructuring during the year and was satisfied that an outcome 
of 85% of target was reflective of overall DMGT performance.
The following tables illustrate performance against DMGT and dmg media bonus targets and the corresponding outcome:

Remuneration Report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s policy for the remuneration of Directors (Policy). The Policy was last approved by shareholders 
at the AGM on 8 February 2017. The Committee has reviewed the Policy and is satisfied that it remains appropriate. The original policy can be 
found on the Company website.
The Policy, as set out on pages 72 to 75, is intended to apply for a three-year period from the date of the 2017 AGM. The Committee will 
continue to review the Policy on an annual basis.
Policy overview
The Committee aims to structure remuneration packages which motivate and retain Directors, drive the right behaviours and pay at market. 
The Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of commercial demands, 
changing market practice and shareholder expectations. Our approach is to align base salary with reference to market levels of pay and to 
ensure that a significant part of executive pay is variable and linked to the success of the Company. 
The new Long-Term Executive Incentive Plan was approved at the AGM in February 2017. The plan directly links payouts to business 
performance by awarding management a share of profit growth, over and above a minimum threshold, after deducting a charge for additional 
capital. The new Long-Term Executive Incentive Plan provides for exceptional pay in cases of truly exceptional performance, while not 
over-rewarding average performance.
The Committee regularly reviews remuneration structures to ensure they are aligned to business strategy. The Policy incorporates a degree 
of flexibility to allow the Committee to manage remuneration over the next three years.
Policy applied to Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary The basic salary for each Executive 
Director is reviewed annually for the 
following year taking into account 
contractual agreements, general 
economic and market conditions and 
the level of increases made across 
the Group as a whole.
Given the location of the Company’s 
principal operations, a particular focus 
is put on US and UK market conditions.
Benchmarking based on media and 
other relevant companies is performed 
periodically and the Committee’s 
intention is to apply judgement 
in evaluating market data.
Annual increases are normally 
in line with average UK and 
US-based employees, subject 
to particular circumstances, 
such as changes in roles, 
responsibilities or 
organisation, or as the 
Committee determines 
otherwise based on factors 
listed under ‘Operation’.
The maximum salary level  
for each Executive Director is 
set at a level the Committee 
considers appropriate taking 
account of the individual’s 
skills, experience and 
performance, and the  
external environment.
Current salary levels are set 
out on page 61.
Not performance related.
To recruit, retain and 
reflect responsibilities of

Pension Executive Directors may participate in a 
defined contribution pension scheme or 
may receive a cash allowance in lieu of 
pension contribution. Any contributions 
paid to the Company pension scheme 
will be offset from the cash allowance.
For executives who 
participated in the defined 
benefit scheme the pension 
allowance has been set at 
a higher level (up to 37%).

Benefits Benefits typically include cash allowances 
and non-cash benefits such as medical 
and car benefits. Where appropriate, the 
Committee may also offer allowances 
for relocation or other benefits where 
it concludes that it is in the interest of 
the Company to do so, having regard 
to the particular circumstances and 
to market practice. 
Allowances do not form part of 
pensionable earnings.
Executives are also eligible to participate 
in the DMGT SharePurchase+ plan, an 
all-employee Share Incentive Plan, on 
the same basis as other employees.
Benefits may vary by role and 
individual circumstances.
The cost of benefits changes 
periodically and may be 
determined by outside 
providers.
Benefits are not performance

Annual bonus The annual bonus is based on in-year 
performance against financial objectives: 
The performance targets and measures 
are determined annually by the 
Committee and may change from year 
to year.
• Up to 100% of total bonus opportunity 
is based on financial performance at 
corporate and business unit level; and
• A proportion of total bonus opportunity 
may be based on performance against 
strategic non-financial objectives.
The bonus weightings applied for each 
of the Executive Directors may vary from 
time to time and may include financial 
measures and targets relating to the 
Group as well as their specific business. 
The weightings that apply to the bonus 
may vary if the Committee determines 
that it is appropriate in order to achieve 
the strategic aims of the business.
Performance is measured separately for 
each item as shown in tables 2.2 and 2.3 
on page 62.
Annual incentive payments do not form 
part of pensionable earnings.
Annual bonus plans are discretionary and 
the Committee reserves the right to make 
adjustments to payments up or down if it 
believes that exceptional circumstances 
warrant doing so.
Bonuses are subject to malus prior to 
payment, and to clawback for two years 
after payment, in circumstances including 
a material misstatement in results, an 
error in calculating/assessing satisfaction 
of any condition, the participant causing 
material reputational damage to any 
member of the Group or serious 
misconduct by the participant causing 
loss to any member of the Group.
Maximum opportunity is 
as follows:
• For The Viscount 
Rothermere, 180% of salary;
• For Paul Zwillenberg, 
140% of salary;
• For Tim Collier 140% of 
salary; and
• For Kevin Beatty, 60% 
of salary
Paul Dacre does not 
participate in the annual 
bonus plan.
The maximum level for new 
recruits will not exceed 200% 
of salary.
The achievement of stretch 
targets results in maximum 
payout. On-target bonus is 
normally 50% of maximum. 
There is normally no payout 
for performance below 
threshold. Payout between 
threshold and target is on  
a straight-line basis.
The performance range sets 
a balance between upside 
opportunity and downside 
risk and is normally based 
on targets in accordance  
with the annual budget.
Bonuses are subject to the 
achievement of financial 
measures set prior to grant by 
the Committee. The measures for 
determining the annual bonus in 
FY 2017 were profit; revenue and 
cash flow. These measures may 
be varied from year to year.
Targets are against budget. 
The performance required for 
a maximum payout is set at a 
stretch performance level that is 
above the level of the Company’s 
forecasts. If performance is in line 
with forecast, then typically an 
on-target level of the annual 
bonus will be paid.
The weightings that were applied 
to the FY 2017 bonus targets are 
as reported in table 2.1 on page 62.
The Board considers the specific 
targets and relative weightings for 
each measure to be commercially 
sensitive and they will not be 
disclosed. Performance against 
targets in the year that bonus 
awards are made will be disclosed 
along with the relevant weightings 
in the Annual Report following 
the payment.

Bonus deferral Awards are delivered through a grant of nil 
cost options.
A proportion of some Executive Directors’ 
annual bonus is deferred for a period of 
two years. 
Annual bonus deferral requirements are 
reported in detail in table 3 on page 62.
Following the exercise of an option, a cash 
payment with a value equivalent to the 
sum of all of the dividends declared for the 
award between the grant date and the 
date of delivery of the shares will be made.
Clawback of vested and unvested awards 
is possible in the event of material 
misstatement of information or 
misconduct.
All Executive Directors (with 
the exception of The Viscount 
Rothermere) are required to 
defer any above-target annual 
bonus into nil cost options for 
two years.
No further performance conditions 
are imposed except for continued 
employment. This is reflective of 
market practice.
To provide an element 
of retention and align 
Executive Directors’ 
interests with those 
of shareholders.
Long-term incentives The Company adopted a new Long-Term 
Executive Incentive plan, following 
shareholder approval at the AGM, 
known as the DMGT Long-Term Executive 
Incentive Plan 2017. This plan will be 
used to grant long-term incentive awards 
to Executive Directors. 
There will be an annual grant of awards, 
which may be in the form of conditional 
share awards, options, restricted shares  
or cash at the discretion of the Committee. 
Awards may vest at the end of a 
performance period of a minimum 
duration of three years, subject to 
achievement of performance targets 
and continued service.
In exceptional cases (e.g. recruitment) 
awards may be made without 
performance conditions if the Committee 
considers this appropriate.
Awards will typically be paid out in 
shares, calculated by reference to the 
share price as at the date of grant, in 
order to ensure further alignment of 
the Executive Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders. The Committee 
may determine that awards will 
alternatively be settled in cash if 
it considers this appropriate. 
Awards may be granted on terms that 
the value of any dividends paid to 
shareholders on their shares in the period 
between the date of grant and the date 
of vesting (or exercise) is paid to the 
individual following the end of that period.
In order to incentivise 
and allow the potential 
to appropriately reward 
Executive Directors for truly 
exceptional performance, 
the maximum annual value 
of shares at grant and which 
can vest is capped at 500% 
for each Executive Director.
Performance below threshold 
results in zero payout.
Paul Dacre will remain on his 
existing arrangements with 
a maximum award of 70% 
of salary and an on-target 
full vesting. 
The Committee may set different 
performance measures, in terms of 
type of measure and the weighting 
given to each measure, for awards 
granted on different dates, 
provided the Committee considers 
that such measures are aligned 
with the Company’s strategic 
goals and with the interests of 
its shareholders.
Performance conditions may also 
be set on an individual basis to 
reflect a particular individual’s role.
The performance measures are 
designed to reflect progress 
towards the achievement of key 
strategic goals which may vary 
from year to year.
For awards granted to Executive 
Directors under the EIP , current 
performance measures link awards 
to cumulative growth in Group 
profits over a minimum growth 
threshold, subject to fair 
adjustment for any change in 
capital usage. The minimum 
growth threshold feature is 
designed to ensure that the awards 
are appropriately challenging 
and Executive Directors are not 
rewarded unless they achieve a 
minimum performance threshold. 
The capital charge/credit feature is 
designed to ensure that Executive 
Directors use capital efficiently 
over the long term, by requiring 
higher profits to be made if more 
capital is used. 
To focus Executive 
Directors on the delivery 
of strategic priorities 
creating sustainable 
long-term value for 
the Company and 
shareholders, thereby 
aligning Executive 
Directors’ interests 
with the interests of 
the Company and 
shareholders.
Specifically, the key 
objective is to incentivise 
Executive Directors to 
grow Company profits in 
an appropriate manner.
Please see the notes 
to this table for further 
details about the link 
between the Executive 
Incentive Plan (EIP) 
and the Group’s 
strategic goals.

Long-term incentives 
continued
The Committee has discretion, within 
the rules of the EIP and the 2012 LTIP , 
to make adjustments taking into 
account exceptional factors that distort 
underlying business performance, such 
as (for example) material M&A activity.
EIP awards are subject to malus prior to 
vesting, and to clawback for three years 
after vesting, in circumstances including a 
material misstatement in results, an error 
in calculating/assessing satisfaction of 
any condition, the participant causing 
material reputational damage to any 
member of the Group or serious 
misconduct by the participant causing 
loss to any member of the Group.
Awards under the 2012 LTIP are subject 
to clawback (whether vested or unvested) 
in the event of material misstatement 
of information or misconduct.
All awards are subject to the rules of 
the plan (as may be amended from time 
to time in accordance with the rules) 
and any other terms and conditions 
applicable to the awards as the 
Committee may determine.
For Paul Dacre performance is 
currently measured against the 
delivery of strategic objectives 
for the Mail titles.
The Committee sets the applicable 
performance targets prior to or at 
the time of the grant of awards 
in accordance with its strategic 
planning. The Board considers the 
specific performance targets for 
each measure and the relative 
performance measure weightings 
to be commercially sensitive. 
Performance against targets 
and the relative weightings will 
be disclosed at the time the 
awards vest.
Shareholding 
requirement
Executive Directors are encouraged 
to build up a substantial shareholding 
in the Company.
Shares which have been awarded subject 
to satisfaction of performance measures 
are not included in the calculation of 
the value of the Executive Director’s 
shareholding.
Hedging by Executive Directors of any

Notes to the policy table
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees:
• Base salary:
Base salary increases elsewhere in the Group are set at a business level, taking into account economic factors, competitive market rates, roles, skills, experience and individual performance. 
The change in wages and salaries for the Company as a whole is reported in chart 2 on page 69.
• Pension:
 − Employees in the UK are auto-enrolled into the Company defined contribution pension scheme. There are a number of schemes in operation, all of which offer levels of employer matching 
contributions.
 − Employees in the US are typically offered 401(k) retirement plans.
• Benefits:
Allowances and benefits for employees reflect the local labour market in which they are based.
• Annual bonus:
 − Many employees participate in some form of cash-based annual incentive, bonus or commission plan.
 − The annual incentive plan for the Executive Directors forms the basis of the annual incentive plan for the head office Executives. Plans across the Group are designed and tailored for each 
business, with the purpose of incentivising the achievement of their annual targets.
• Bonus deferral:
 Most annual incentive plans around the Group do not include a requirement for deferral.
• Long-term incentives:
 − The EIP for the Executive Directors forms the basis of annual awards for the head office Executives.
 − Plans for Executives in other businesses across the Group are considered and approved by the Committee. Plans are designed to be appropriate to the stage of development of the business and 
to incentivise the achievement of the mid- to long-term strategic aims of the business in which they operate.
• Shareholding requirement:
 There is no shareholding requirement for employees below Executive Director level.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Implementation of Remuneration Policy in FY 2018
Executive Directors’ basic fees 
and salary
There are no intentions to increase base salaries for Executive Directors during FY 2018.
Executive Directors’ pension No change to prior year. Pension allowances are reported in the single figure table 1 on page 61 with further 
details in the Pension entitlements and cash allowances section in table 7 on page 67.
Benefits in kind No change to policy since prior year. Allowances and benefits for FY 2017 are reported in detail in the notes 
to the single figure table 1 on page 61.
Executive Directors’  
annual bonus
Annual bonus payments for FY 2017 are reported in detail in tables 2.1 and 2.2. 
Awards in FY 2018 will be measured against two metrics: Group level revenue and cash operating income. 
In addition to Group level performance, Kevin Beatty will be measured on the performance of his division 
against the same metrics (weighting 30% Group, 70% Divisional).
The Board considers the specific targets and relative weightings for each measure to be commercially 
sensitive and they will not be disclosed. 
Bonus deferral There were no nil cost option awards made under the plan for FY 2017. The cash amounts that apply for the 
FY 2017 bonus are shown in table 2.1 on page 62.
Bonus deferral requirements for FY 2018 remain as stated in table 3 on page 62.
Executive Directors’  
long-term incentive
A new Long-Term Executive Incentive Plan (approved by shareholders at the AGM), was introduced in 
FY 2017 which directly links pay outs to business performance by awarding management a share of profit 
growth, over and above a minimum threshold, after deducting a charge for additional capital. The new 
Executive Incentive Plan provides for exceptional pay in cases of truly exceptional performance, while not 
over-rewarding average performance.
Further details of the applicable performance criteria are included in the policy table.
Individual award amounts will be determined at the time of the award and will be subject to the 
performance conditions outlined in the new policy. In addition, subject to approval, the Chairman will 
be eligible to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan.
Paul Dacre will remain on his existing long-term incentive arrangements.
Stephen Daintith and Suresh Kavan did not receive a long-term incentive award in FY 2017.
Outstanding awards will continue to vest according to the Rules of the Plans they were awarded under. 
Details of outstanding awards and their status are shown in detail in tables 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 on page 62.
The Board considers the specific targets and relative weightings for each measure to be commercially 
sensitive and they will not be disclosed. 
Executive Directors’  
service contracts
No changes to service contracts are planned for FY 2018.
External appointments The Company allows its Executive Directors to take a very limited number of outside directorships. 
Individuals retain the payments from such services since these appointments are not expected to impinge 
on their principal employment. The Viscount Rothermere and Paul Zwillenberg are on the Board of 
Euromoney plc and Kevin Beatty is on the Board of ZPG.
Executive Directors’ 
shareholding guidelines
For FY 2017 the guideline increased to 500% of base salary for Lord Rothermere and Paul Zwillenberg. 
All others will remain unchanged at 150% of base salary.
Directors’ interests are reported in detail in table 11 on page 70.
Executive Directors’ pension Pension allowances for any new Executive Director will be limited to a maximum of 30%.
Pension allowances are reported in the single figure table 1 on page 61 with further details in the Pension 
entitlements and cash allowances section in table 7 on page 67.
Recruitment Award In accordance with the terms of his recruitment Tim Collier received a one-off award of 324,965 DMGT 
shares as at 2 May 2017, which will vest subject to his continuing employment and following release of 
audited year-end results, 188,284 in December 2018 and 136,681 in December 2019.

External appointments
The Company allows its Executive Directors to take a very limited number of outside directorships. Individuals retain the payments received 
from such services since these appointments are not expected to impinge on their principal employment. Lord Rothermere and Paul Zwillenberg 
are Directors of Euromoney plc and receive fees of £50,000 per annum which are included in the single figure table shown on page 61. 
Kevin Beatty is a Director of ZPG plc for which there is no fee.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors prior to the approval and implementation of this Policy (such as payment of pensions or the vesting/exercise of past share 
awards), provided that such commitments complied with any Remuneration Policy in effect at the time they were given. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When appointing or recruiting a new Executive Director from outside the Company, the Committee will normally aim to set remuneration at 
a level which is consistent with the remuneration policy in place for other Executive Directors and in particular the Executive Director who 
previously filled the relevant role, although it is recognised that, in order to secure the best candidate for a role, the Company may need to pay 
a new Executive Director more than it pays its existing Executive Directors. Pre-existing contractual agreements for internal candidates may 
be maintained on promotion to an Executive Director role.
78
Governance
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report The Committee may make use of any of the below components in the remuneration package.
Component Approach Maximum annual grant level
Base salary Base salary will be determined by reference to the individual’s role and responsibilities, 
location of employment, and the salary paid to the previous incumbent.
Not applicable.
Pension The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the Group’s defined 
contribution pension plan and/or receive a cash pension allowance.
30% of base salary.
Benefits New appointments may be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Policy for current 
Executive Directors as well as benefits relating to relocation such as (but not limited to) 
cost of living, housing and tax equalisation support.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the Company’s annual 
bonus plan in accordance with the Policy for current Executive Directors and may be 
required to defer some or all of any bonus granted in accordance with the Policy.
200% of base salary.
Long-term 
incentives
The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the Executive 
Incentive Plan in accordance with the Policy for current Executive Directors, save that 
the Committee may provide that an initial award under EIP (within the salary multiple 
limits on page 74) is subject to a requirement of continued service over a specified 
period, rather than the usual performance conditions.
500% of base salary at the time 
the award is made.
Replacement 
awards
If in joining DMGT a new Executive Director would forfeit any existing award under 
variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer, the Committee will 
consider on a case-by-case basis what replacement awards (if any) are reasonably 
necessary to facilitate that individual’s recruitment, taking into account all relevant 
factors such as performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the 
performance period remaining and the form of the award due to be forfeited.
Not applicable.
Exit payment policy
The Company normally sets the notice period of Executive Directors as 12 months, but may decide to vary this in circumstances it deems 
appropriate.
On termination, the Company will normally make a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) which is equal to the aggregate of: the basic salary at the 
date of termination for the applicable notice period; the pension allowance over the relevant period; the cost to the Company of providing all 
other benefits (excluding pension allowance and bonus) or a sum equal to the amount of benefits as specified in the Company’s most recent 
Annual Report; and a bonus payment calculated in accordance with the service contract of the Director. The treatment of awards under the 
Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plans on termination will be in accordance with the rules of the Plan and, where appropriate, at the discretion 
of the Committee.
The Company may pay the PILON either as a lump sum or in equal monthly instalments from the date on which the employment terminates 
until the end of the relevant period. If alternative employment (paid above a pre-agreed rate) is commenced, for each month that instalments 
of the PILON remain payable, the amounts, in aggregate (excluding the pension payment), may be reduced by half of one month’s basic salary 
in excess of the pre-agreed rate.
In the event that a participant’s employment is terminated, treatment of outstanding awards under the Group’s incentive plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules, which are summarised below:
Incentive plan Treatment of awards
DMGT SharePurchase+ All leavers have to exit DMGT SharePurchase+ and either sell or transfer their shares. If identified as a 
‘Good Leaver’, under the rules of DMGT SharePurchase+, no tax or National Insurance Contributions are paid.
Annual bonus If identified as a ‘Good Leaver’ for the purposes of the bonus, the Committee may determine that the leaver’s 
contribution was significant in early or high achievement of targets, in which case, it may decide to make 
a payment which is equivalent of up to a full year bonus.
Deferred bonus plan If identified as a ‘Good Leaver’ under the deferred bonus plan rules (including those identified at the 
discretion of the Committee), outstanding awards shall vest in full on the normal vesting date or on such 
earlier date as the Committee may determine.
Long-term incentive plans If identified as a ‘Good Leaver’ under the rules (including those identified at the discretion of the Committee), 
outstanding awards will vest, either on the normal vesting date or on such earlier date as the Committee 
may determine, to the extent determined by the Committee taking into account the performance conditions, 
the proportion of the performance period which has elapsed at the date of termination and any other factors 
it considers appropriate. If, in the judgement of the Committee, greater progress towards achievement 
of targets has been made as a result of the performance of the leaver, it may, at its absolute discretion, 
decide to vest up to 100% of the outstanding award.

Remuneration Report
The Committee may make payments it considers reasonable in settlement of potential legal claims, e.g. unfair dismissal or where agreed 
under a settlement agreement. This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment 
protection legislation and such reasonable reimbursement of fees for legal and/or tax advice in connection with such agreements and/or costs 
of outplacement services.
Where an Executive Director is a ‘Good Leaver’, the Committee reserves the discretion to approve any or all of the following additional benefits:
• continuation of private health insurance or life assurance for a period of time following termination;
• use of business premises for a period after termination;
• retention of IT equipment by the Executive Director; and/or
• use of a company car and/or driver for a period after termination.
Consideration of pay and employment conditions elsewhere across the Group
The Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when making decisions on remuneration matters affecting 
the Directors. The Committee receives a report annually on the salary budget for each business. The Committee makes reference, where 
appropriate, to pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group (whilst remaining aware of the variety of jurisdictions and markets 
in which it operates) when determining annual salary increases and to external evidence of remuneration levels in other companies.
The Committee makes reference to data provided by and advice sought from internal and external advisers when making decisions on 
remuneration matters affecting the Directors. It does not specifically consult with employees over the effectiveness and appropriateness 
of the Remuneration Policy and framework. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee receives annual updates on the views and best practices of shareholders and their representative bodies and, notwithstanding 
the Company shareholder structure, takes these into account. The Committee seeks the views of shareholders on matters of remuneration 
that it thinks shareholders are interested in. An example of this was the adoption of the 2012 LTIP , when major shareholders were consulted. 
Implementation of Policy for Non-Executive Directors FY 2018
Non-Executive Directors’ fees An increase in base directors fees to £50,000 p.a. was agreed by the Chairman and the CEO, these were 
effective 1 July 2017. The actual fees paid to Non-Executive Directors in FY 2017 are shown in table 8 on 
page 67.
There is currently no intention to increase fees or allowances in FY 2018 but fees may be reviewed within 
the policy terms.
This report covers the reporting period to 30 September 2017 and has been prepared in accordance with the relevant requirements of the 
Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority.

have prepared the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the 
parent Company Financial Statements  
in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for that period. In preparing these 
Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• State whether IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the Group and parent Company Financial 
Statements respectively; and
• Prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standards Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. Each of 
the Directors confirms that, to the best 
of his/her knowledge:
The Company’s External Auditor PwC 
has indicated its willingness to serve and, 
in accordance with Section 489 of the 
Companies Act 2006, a resolution proposing 
the reappointment of PwC will be put to 
the AGM on 7 February 2018.
Directors’ indemnity
A qualifying third-party indemnity (QTPI), 
as permitted by the Company’s Articles of 
Association and Sections 232 and 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006, has been granted by 
the Company to each of the Directors of the 
Company. Under the provisions of the QTPI, 
the Company undertakes to indemnify each 
Director against liability to third parties 
(excluding criminal and regulatory penalties) 
and to pay Directors’ defence costs as 
incurred, provided that they are reimbursed 
to the Company if the Director is found guilty 
or, in an action brought by the Company, 
judgment is given against the Director.
Going concern
A full description of the Group’s business 
activities, financial position, cash flows, 
liquidity position, committed facilities and 
borrowing position, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development and 
performance, is set out in the Strategic 
Report, particularly the Financial Review 
on pages 25 to 31 and in the Notes to the 
accounts on page 99.
The Group has significant financial resources 
and the Directors, having reviewed the 
Group’s operating budgets, investment plans

facilities and cash resources. The Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors

the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report.

Company can be found on page 29.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
• The Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• The Strategic Report contained on 
pages 2 to 39 includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Relationship agreements
Daily Mail and General Trust plc entered 
into a Relationship Deed with Euromoney 
Institutional Investor PLC on 8 December 
2016, and ZPG Plc on 5 June 2014, in each 
case in accordance with the Listing Rules 
and have acted in accordance with the 
terms of the Deeds since execution.
Political donations
No political donations were made during 
the period.
Principal risks
The principal risks and how they are being 
managed or mitigated are shown on pages 
36 to 39. The Directors have reviewed the 
Group’s principal risks including those that 
would threaten the Group’s business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Events after the balance sheet date 
of 30 November 2017
There were no post balance sheet events.
Material contracts
Group companies undertake business with 
a range of customers and suppliers. There is 
no dependence on any particular contractual 
arrangement other than those disclosed in 
Note 41 as regards ink and printing, where 
arrangements are in place until FY 2021 
and FY 2023 respectively in order to obtain 
competitive prices and to secure supplies.
Arrangements are made biannually with 
a range of newsprint suppliers to ensure 
the security of supply at the best available 
prices, having regard to the need for the 
necessary quality. Particularly in light of its 
strategy to create a diversified international 
portfolio of businesses, the Group is not 
dependent on any supplier of other 
commodities for its revenue or any particular 
customer. Distribution arrangements are in 
place to ensure the delivery of newspapers 
to retail outlets.

Governance
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report newspapers are now produced at plants 
designed to be as efficient as possible; this 
reduces energy usage, vehicle movements 
and the volume of waste generated. There is 
also a considerable effort to maximise the 
volume of waste recycled including 
newsprint waste, water and heat recovery.
The Company is, and has for many years 
been, committed to comprehensive and 
transparent reporting of its environmental 
performance. The Company has collected CO

emissions data from each of its businesses. 
This data is collated and independently 
reviewed by environmental consultancy ICF

Articles of Association
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association. Any changes to the 
Articles of Association must be approved 
by the shareholders in accordance with 
the legislation in force from time to time. 
The Directors have authority to issue and 
allot A Shares pursuant to Article 9 of the 
Articles of Association and shareholder 
authority is requested at each AGM. The 
Directors have authority to make market 
purchases of A Shares. This authority is also 
renewed annually at the AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles of Association permit the Board 
to authorise a conflict of interest in respect 
of any matter which would otherwise involve 
a Director breaching his duty under the 
Companies Act 2006 to avoid conflicts 
of interest.
When authorising a conflict of interest the 
Board must do so without the conflicting 
Director counting as part of the quorum. 
In the event that the Board considers it 
appropriate, the conflicted Director may be 
permitted to participate in the debate, but 
will neither be permitted to vote nor count 
in the quorum when the decision is being 
agreed. The Directors are aware that it is

Human rights
The Company believes that our exposure to 
the associated risks in the context of human 
rights frameworks is minimal. DMGT does 
not have a specific human rights policy but 
has a number of policies that cover areas 
such as health and safety, modern slavery, 
bribery and corruption, and a questionnaire 
for evaluating whether new suppliers are 
ethical and lawful. 
Group policies
The Company upholds equal opportunities 
and does not discriminate. DMGT’s 
businesses are required to follow DMGT 
policies that safeguard the welfare of our 
employees. These include policies on equal 
opportunities, anti-bribery, entertainment 
and gifts, information security, share dealing,

Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant 
agreements that would take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid. However, 
certain of the Group’s third-party funding 
arrangements would terminate upon 
a change of control of the Company.

Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Daily Mail and General Trust plc
Report on the audit of the 
financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Daily Mail and General Trust plc’s Group 
financial statements and parent Company 
financial statements (the “financial 
statements”) give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 
and of the Group’s profit and cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent Company financial 
statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We have audited the financial statements, 
included within the Annual Report, which 
comprise: Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position; Consolidated Income 
Statement; Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income; Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity; 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; and 
the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting 
to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) 
(“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further 
described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in 
accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to 
listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we 
declare that non-audit services prohibited by 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the parent Company.
Other than those disclosed in Note 5 to the 
financial statements, we have provided no 
non-audit services to the Group or the parent 
Company in the period from 1 October 2016 
to 30 September 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality 
• Overall Group materiality: £9 million 
(2016: £10 million), based on 4% of 
adjusted profit before tax.
• Overall parent Company materiality: 
£9 million (2016: £10 million), being the 
lower of 1% of total assets and Overall 
Group materiality.
Audit scope
• Of the Group’s four trading reporting 
divisions, we identified that dmg media 
required a full scope audit due to its size. 
In addition we obtain full scope audit 
opinions for the RMS and dmg events 
divisions. 
• For dmg information we scoped our 
audit at a business level, and identified 
six businesses over which we performed 
either a full scope audit or specified 
audit procedures on certain balances 
or transactions.
• Full scope audits were also performed 
for the Group's two material associates 
(ZPG Plc and Euromoney Institutional 
Investor PLC), and in the case of 
Euromoney, specified audit procedures 
were performed on certain balances 
and transactions for the three month 
period prior to deconsolidation.
• We used local teams in the UK, US and 
Dubai to perform those full scope audits 
or specified procedures relating to the 
relevant overseas businesses within RMS, 
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, 
dmg information and dmg events 
divisions. The Group audit team held 
regular meetings with these locations 
to ensure sufficient involvement and 
oversight of the work of these local teams 
and to make sure that we had a full and 
comprehensive understanding of the 
results of their work – particularly insofar 
as it related to the identified areas 
of focus.
Key audit matters
• Impairment of intangible assets and 
goodwill.
• Accounting for Euromoney disposal.
• Presentation of adjusted profit.
• Capitalisation of development costs.
• Accounting for deferred taxation and 
uncertain tax positions.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we 
determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked 
at where the directors made subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in the auditors’ professional judgement, 
were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These 
matters, and any comments we make on 
the results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. This is not a complete list of all 
risks identified by our audit.

Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 50 to 59 
and to Notes 21 and 22 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group had £363.1m of goodwill and a further £213m of 
intangible assets on the balance sheet at 30 September 2017. 
Impairment charges of £117.0m to goodwill and £96.4m to 
intangible assets have been taken in the year principally in 
relation to Genscape, Sitecompli and Xceligent. 
The carrying values of the remaining goodwill and intangibles 
are contingent on future cash flows of the underlying CGUs and 
there is a risk that if these cash flows do not meet the directors’ 
expectations that the assets will be impaired.
We focused our testing on those CGUs where the directors had 
identified an impairment or where headroom was limited. The 
directors’ impairment reviews also identified limited headroom 
in relation to the RMS(one) intangible asset. 
As part of our audit of the directors’ impairment reviews (for both 
goodwill and intangible assets) we evaluated future cash flow 
forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up. This 
included comparing them to the latest Board approved budgets and 
management’s three year plans, and testing the underlying calculations. 
For the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we tested all key assumptions, including:
• revenue and profit assumptions included within budgets and future 
forecasts, by considering the historical accuracy of budgets against 
actual results;
• key assumptions for long term growth rates in the forecasts by 
comparing them to historical results, economic and industry 
forecasts, and comparable companies; 
• the discount rate by comparing the cost of capital for the Group with 
comparable organisations, and assessed the specific risk premium 
applied to the business in question; and
• the directors’ potential bias through performance of our own 
sensitivity analysis on key assumptions particularly those driving 
underlying cash flows.
We engaged our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the 
appropriateness of key market related assumptions in the directors’ 
valuation models, including discount and long term growth rates.
In addition, with regards to Genscape we: 
• reviewed the implied earnings multiple and compared these against 
comparable companies; and 
• considered the third party valuation obtained, which had 
incorporated various valuation methodologies and compared 
them to management’s on value in use calculations.
As part of our testing over the underlying calculations, we recalculated 
the impairment charges recognised.
Having undertaken these procedures we consider management’s 
impairment charge to be appropriate. 
With regards to RMS(one) we met with relevant directors and sales 
staff to obtain corroborative evidence of expected pricing packages 
and client uptake and to confirmed our understanding of the product 
development roadmap. We have corroborated pricing assumptions 
with reference to signed third party contracts.
We considered the need for additional sensitivity disclosures for CGUs 
with limited headroom as required by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ 
and we agree with the directors’ decision to provide these additional 
disclosures for Landmark and Hobsons. 
For those assets where the directors determined that no impairment 
was required and that no additional sensitivity disclosures were 
necessary, we found that these judgements were supported by 
reasonable assumptions that would require significant downside 
changes before any additional material impairment was necessary.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Accounting for Euromoney disposal 
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 50 to 55  
and to Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On 31 December 2017, the Group reduced its stake in Euromoney 
from 67.9% to 49.9% from which point Euromoney was treated 
as an associate. 
The reduction in holding to 49.9% resulted in a gain on disposal 
of £509.3m, comprising both a gain on the 18% holding sold of 
£151.9m, and a gain on the fair value of the retained interest 
of £357.4m.
The calculation of the profit on disposal is complex. 
We considered whether DMGT exercises de facto control over 
Euromoney after the completion of the transaction given its 49.9% 
shareholding and having considered factors such as DMGT’s ability 
to control Euromoney through the Board or other means. 
We determined that the Group does not have control over Euromoney 
and treatment as an associate was appropriate. 
With regards to the calculation of the profit on disposal, we:
• obtained and recalculated the directors’ calculation of the profit 
on disposal;
• recalculated the allocation of gain between the holdings disposed 
and gain on the fair value of retained interest; 
• verified the fair value of consideration received to underlying 
support including cash transactions and the Share Purchase 
Agreements; and
• recalculated foreign exchange differences that were appropriately 
recycled on disposal. 
Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that the 
accounting for the disposal was accurate.
Presentation of adjusted profit
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 50 to 55  
and to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group presents adjusted profit before taxation to enable users 
of the financial statements to gain a better understanding of the 
underlying results.
In arriving at adjusted profit a number of items are considered 
‘exceptional’ by management and are excluded from underling 
earnings. Current year exceptional charges relate to the closure 
of the Didcot printing plant, other restructuring initiatives, and 
significant, non-recurring legal costs. The classification of items 
as non-trading or exceptional is an area of judgement and the 
appropriateness and consistency of the presentation of adjusted 
measures of performance continues to attract scrutiny from the 
financial reporting regulators.
We have considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made 
to statutory profit before taxation to derive adjusted profit before tax. 
We have understood the rationale for classifying items as exceptional 
or non-trading and considered whether this is reasonable and 
consistent, in that it includes items that both increase and decrease 
the adjusted profit measure, are consistent year on year, and are in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. 
We considered the appropriateness of those costs determined to be 
exceptional, specifically we: 
• verified severance costs and confirmed that these reflect permanent 
reductions in head count and where not settled are supported by 
appropriate evidence that these redundancies were sufficiently 
communicated prior to year-end;
• considered the nature and scope of the consulting engagements and 
confirmed the fees classified as exceptional were sufficiently linked 
to the Group restructuring initiatives; 
• tested the value of the assets written off and considered the 
carrying value of the remaining site assets to third party valuations;
• tested the exceptional legal costs to supporting documentation. 
We have also audited the reconciliation of adjusted profit to statutory 
profit in Note 13, and agreed all material adjustments to underlying 
accounting records and our audit work performed over other balances. 
We have determined that the rationale for including or excluding items 
from adjusted profit has been consistently applied across gains and 
losses and year on year.
We consider the Group’s disclosures setting out the reasons for its use 
of alternative performance measures and the reconciliations of these 
measures to the statutory amounts to be in line with the FRC guidance 
in this area.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Capitalisation of development costs
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 50 to 55  
and to Note 22 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
£57.7m of internal costs were capitalised during the year in relation 
to projects undertaken by the Group, primarily relating to the 
development of new computer software within dmg information. 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ (“IAS 38”) requires that the Group 
demonstrates that internal costs satisfy certain requirements to 
qualify for capitalisation some of which require the application 
of judgement. 
£96.4m of capitalised development costs were impaired during 
the year including an amount that had been capitalised during 
the year.
With regards to the costs capitalised during the year, we tested a 
sample to determine whether they meet the criteria of IAS 38, agreeing 
the costs selected to supporting evidence. 
Where these capitalised costs related to time spent by staff developing 
intangible assets, we also:
• agreed that these salary costs were directly attributable to the 
creation of the asset;
• agreed the salary costs capitalised to payroll records; and
• verified time spent and the associated allocations to individual 
projects to timesheets or other supporting evidence.
We considered the directors’ intention and ability to complete the 
project by obtaining and assessing the business cases and current 
budgets for material intangible asset additions. 
We also assessed the consistency of the application of the Group’s 
accounting policy across costs capitalised in the different operating 
divisions. We found that the Group’s accounting policy for 
capitalisation of intangible assets was in accordance with the 
requirements of with IAS 38 and had been consistently applied.
Where costs capitalised were subsequently written off in the year we 
verified that the IAS 38 criteria were met at the time of capitalisation 
and that the impairment arose from subsequent strategic decisions 
taken as part of the strategic review of the businesses at the end of 
the year.
Accounting for deferred taxation and uncertain tax positions
Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 50 to 55  
and to Note 37 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group’s recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of trading 
and non-trading tax losses in the Group is an area of focus due to 
the quantum of the losses and the requirement to make estimates 
of future taxable profits in determining the valuation of deferred 
tax assets.
In addition the Group has provisions for uncertain tax positions 
relating to both historic and current tax arrangements. 
The recognition and measurement of these items in the financial 
statements is judgemental, and we focussed on the directors’ 
forecasts of future profits against which to utilise accumulated 
losses, and the technical interpretation of taxation law in respect 
to transactions giving rise to deferred tax assets and uncertain  
tax positions.
In the period £108.9m of deferred tax assets were written off. 
We involved our in-house tax specialists in our testing of the 
appropriateness of the estimates and judgements taken in relation to 
deferred taxation and in respect of uncertain tax positions recognised 
in the financial statements.
In assessing the likelihood of the Group being able to generate 
sufficient future taxable profits against which to offset accumulated 
losses, we considered:
• key inputs to the calculation including revenue and profit 
assumptions, in line with our work over the carrying value of 
goodwill and intangible assets; and 
• the directors’ ability to accurately forecast future profits.
In understanding and evaluating the directors’ technical interpretation 
of tax law in respect of specific transactions that gave rise to deferred 
tax assets and uncertain tax positions we considered:
• third party tax advice received by the Group;
• the status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries;
• the outturn of previous claims;
• judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year 
estimates; and
• developments in the tax environment. 
We consider the impairment of deferred tax balances in the current 
year of £108.9m appropriate following our evaluation of the technical 
interpretations outlined above. We consider the amounts written off, 
the valuation of the remaining deferred tax assets and the provisions 
for uncertain tax positions recognised to be supportable and the 
level of provisioning to be acceptable in the context of the Group 
financial statements.

Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Daily Mail and General Trust plc
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure 
that we performed enough work to be 
able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account 
the structure of the Group and the parent 
Company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which 
they operate.
The Group consists of a head office 
and four trading reporting divisions: 
RMS; dmg media; dmg information; and 
dmg events. As each of these prepares a 
sub-consolidation, we considered each 
of these to be a separate component, with 
the exception of dmg information. While 
there are consolidated results for dmg 
information, each business is run separately 
and management primarily reviews the 
performance of the individual businesses 
rather than the division as a whole. As such 
we scoped our audit of dmg information 
at a business level.
Of the four divisions we identified one, 
dmg media, which in our view required an 
audit of their complete financial information 
due to their size. In order to obtain sufficient 
and appropriate audit evidence over the 
Group as a whole we also instructed 
component teams to complete full scope 
audits of the RMS and dmg events divisions.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Overall materiality £9 million (2016: £10 million). £9 million (2016: £10 million).
How we determined it 4% of adjusted profit before tax. Lower of 1% of total assets and Group materiality.
Rationale for  
benchmark applied
The Group is profit oriented. Adjusted profit 
before taxation is the adjusted performance 
measure that is reported to investors and 
shareholders and is the measure which the 
directors consider best represents the underlying 
performance of the Group. Due to the inherent 
judgement in classification of certain items as 
non-trading, and therefore non-underlying, we 
have applied a 4% rule of thumb, which is lower 
than the 5% suggested by ISAs (UK) for the audit 
of profit-oriented entities.
The parent Company is not profit oriented. Total 
assets is used as the benchmark as the parent 
Company’s principal activity is to hold investments, 
creditors, and debtors balances. We have applied 
a 1% rule of thumb suggested by ISAs (UK) as the 
parent Company is a public interest entity. As the 
parent Company also contributes to our Group 
audit as a head office entity, we have used the 
Group materiality, which is lower than 1% of the 
parent Company’s total assets.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £1.0 million and £6.8 million (2016: between £1.2 million and £7.0 million).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.5 million (Group audit) 
(2016: £0.5 million) and £0.5 million (parent Company audit) (2016: £0.5 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Within dmg information we identified two UK 
businesses, Searchflow Ltd and Landmark 
Information Group Ltd, for which we perform 
accelerated statutory audits to align with 
the Group audit timetable. In addition we 
performed a full scope audit of two US 
businesses, Hobsons Inc and Genscape Inc. 
For two US businesses for which statutory 
audits are not required, Trepp LLC and 
Environmental Data Resources Inc, we 
conducted specified procedures over higher 
risk financial statement line items, including 
revenue and capitalised development spend. 
Full scope audits were also performed for 
the Group's two material associates (ZPG Plc 
and Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC). 
For Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, we 
instructed our component team to complete 
a full scope audit. For the audit of ZPG Plc 
we rely on an audit opinion from Deloitte 
LLP , who are Zoopla’s auditors, and 
performed additional procedures to 
calculate the Group’s share of these results. 
Taken together, the components where we 
performed audit work accounted for 87% of 
Group revenue and 76% of absolute adjusted 
profit before taxation.
We sent detailed instructions to all 
component audit teams, which included 
communication of the areas of focus above 
and other required communications. 
In addition, regular meetings were held 
with the UK and overseas audit teams and 
members of the Group audit team visited 
the Searchflow Ltd, Landmark Information 
Group Ltd, Hobson Inc, Genscape Inc, 
dmg media and Euromoney component 
audit teams.
This, together with additional procedures 
performed at the Group level (including audit 
procedures over impairment of goodwill and 
intangibles, material head office entities, tax, 
pensions and consolidation adjustments), 
gave us the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements 
as a whole. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced 
by our application of materiality. We 
set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine 
the scope of our audit and the nature, timing 
and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items 
and disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and 
in aggregate on the financial statements 
as a whole.

Governance
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s and the parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and parent Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06) 
and ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise 
stated). Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity  
of the Group
As a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), we are required 
to report to you if we have anything material to add or draw attention to regarding: 
• The directors’ confirmation on page 36 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 29 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility. 
Other Code Provisions
As a result of the directors’ voluntary reporting on how they have applied the Code, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 48, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and parent Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent Company obtained  
in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 50 to 55 describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit & Risk Committee.
We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility. 
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. (CA06)

Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors 
for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with 
the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
The directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the parent Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent 
Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements 
is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
This description forms part of our 
auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, 
has been prepared for and only for the 
parent Company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• the parent Company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the 
audit committee, we were appointed by 
the members on 4 February 2015 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2015 and subsequent financial 
periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is 3 years, covering the 
years ended 30 September 2015 to 
30 September 2017.
Other voluntary reporting
Going concern
The directors have requested that we review 
the statement on page 82 in relation to going 
concern as if the parent Company were a 
premium listed company. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
The directors’ assessment of the 
prospects of the Group and of the 
principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the Group
The directors have requested that we 
perform a review of the directors’ 
statements on pages 36 to 39 that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and in 
relation to the longer-term viability of the 
Group, as if the parent Company were a 
premium listed company. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries 
and considering the directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with 
the relevant provisions of the Code; and 
considering whether the statements 
are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and parent 
Company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit. We have nothing 
to report having performed this review.
Other Code provisions
The directors have prepared a corporate 
governance statement and requested that 
we review it as though the parent Company 
were a premium listed company. We 
have nothing to report in respect of the 
requirement for the auditors of premium 
listed companies to report when the 
directors’ statement relating to the parent 
Company’s compliance with the Code does 
not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by 
the auditors.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 1 Basis of preparation
DMGT plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is Northcliffe House,  
2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 30 September 2017. 
Other than the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and Metro businesses, the Group prepares accounts for a year ending on 30 September. The 
Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and Metro businesses prepare financial statements for a 52- or 53-week financial period ending on a Sunday 
near to the end of September and do not prepare additional financial statements corresponding to the Group’s financial year for consolidation 
purposes as it would be impractical to do so. The Group considers whether there have been any significant transactions or events between 
the end of the financial year of these businesses and the end of the Group’s financial year and makes any material adjustments as appropriate.
The significant accounting policies used in preparing this information are set out in Note 2.
The Group’s financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries together with the Group’s 
share of all of its interests in joint ventures and associates. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
for the revaluation of certain financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group presents the results from discontinued operations separately from those of continuing operations. An operation is classed as 
discontinued if it has been, or is in the process of being disposed and represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical 
area of operations, or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or exit a major geographical area 
of operations.
Prior period amounts have been re-presented to conform to the current period’s presentation, as prescribed by IFRS 5, Non-current Assets 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
All amounts presented have been rounded to the nearest £0. 1 million.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Financial Review and the Strategic Report. 
As highlighted in Notes 33 and 34 to the Accounts, the Company has long-term financing in the form of bonds and meets its day-to-day 
working capital requirements through bank facilities which expire in March 2019. The Board’s forecasts and projections, after taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group is expected to operate within the terms of its current facilities. 
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
2 Significant accounting policies
The following new and amended IFRSs have been adopted during the year:
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28, Accounting for the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture 
(effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendments to IFRS 11, Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38, Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendment to IAS 1, disclosure initiative (effective 1 January 2016)
• Annual Improvements 2010-2012 cycle and 2011-2013 cycle have been implemented in the prior year and had no material impact on 
the Group.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 2 Significant accounting policies continued
Annual improvements 2012-2014 cycle (effective 1 January 2016)
• Amendment to IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
• Amendments to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments disclosures
• IAS 19, Employee Benefits, discount rates for post-employment benefits 
• IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’
The above amendments have not had any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
The Group has not yet adopted certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which have been published 
but are only effective for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2017. These new pronouncements are listed below:
• Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of cash flows (effective 1 January 2017) 
• Amendment to IAS 12, Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (effective 1 January 2017) 
• IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16, Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
Annual improvements 2014-2016 cycle
• Amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (effective 1 January 2018)
• Amendments to IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective 1 January 2017)
• Amendments to IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective 1 January 2018)
A number of new and amended IFRS’s have been adopted in the period, none had any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Other than IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases, the adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations 
which have been issued but are not yet effective is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
IFRS 15, effective for the 2019 fiscal year introduces additional guidance surrounding performance obligations within sales contracts and the 
timing of revenue recognition. In 2016 the Group commenced a project to evaluate the impact of IFRS 15 but due to the complexity of this new 
accounting standard and the number of different revenue streams in the Group, the impact is still being evaluated.
IFRS 16, effective for the 2020 fiscal year will require lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months 
or less or the underlying asset has a low value eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. The new standard will also 
replace the operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the leased assets and an interest expense on the corresponding lease 
liability. Lessors will continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16’s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged 
from its predecessor, IAS 17.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of this standard. Note 41 provides further information on the Group’s operating 
lease obligations.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
Where the consideration for an acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent arrangement, this is measured at 
its discounted fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted through the Consolidated Income 
Statement in Financing. All other changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are measured 
at fair value at each reporting date and changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Put options granted to non-controlling interests are recorded at present value as a reduction in equity on initial recognition, as the 
arrangement represents a transaction with equity holders. Changes in value after initial recognition are recorded in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in Financing.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances 
that existed as of the date of the acquisition that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is a maximum of one year.

Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Business combinations achieved in stages
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value 
at the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts arising from 
interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that were recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated 
Income Statement where such treatment would be appropriate if the interest were disposed of.
Purchases and sales of shares in a controlled entity
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity increases, the non-controlling interests’ share of net assets, excluding any allocation of 
goodwill, is transferred to retained earnings. Any difference between the cost of the additional interest and the existing carrying value of the 
non-controlling interests’ share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings.
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity decreases, but the Group retains control, the share of net assets disposed, excluding any 
allocation of goodwill, is transferred to the non-controlling interests. Any difference between the proceeds of the disposal and the existing 
carrying value of the net assets or liabilities transferred to the non-controlling interests is recorded in retained earnings.
Disposal of controlling interests where non-controlling interest retained
Where the Group disposes of a controlling interest but retains a non-controlling interest in the business, the Group accounts for the disposal 
of a subsidiary and the subsequent acquisition of a joint venture, associate or available-for-sale investment at fair value on initial recognition. 
On disposal of a subsidiary all amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Contingent consideration receivable
Where the consideration for a disposal includes consideration resulting from a contingent arrangement, the contingent consideration 
receivable is discounted to its fair value, with any subsequent movement in fair value being recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement 
in Financing.
Discontinued operations
The Group presents the results from discontinued operations separately from those of continuing operations. An operation is classed as 
discontinued if it has been, or is in the process of being disposed and represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical 
area of operations, or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or exit a major geographical area 
of operations.
Assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale
An asset or disposal group is classified as held-for-sale if its carrying amount is intended to be recovered principally through sale rather 
than continuing use, is available for immediate sale and is highly probable that the sale will be completed within 12 months of classification 
as held-for-sale. Assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any 
impairment is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and is first allocated to the goodwill associated with the disposal group 
and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis. No further depreciation or amortisation is charged on non-current assets 
classified as held-for-sale from the date of classification.
Accounting for subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Group has power over an investee; exposure, or rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective 
date control is obtained or up to the date control is relinquished, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein, either at 
fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis. The total comprehensive 
income of a subsidiary is apportioned between the Group and the non-controlling interest, even if it results in a deficit balance for the 
non-controlling interest.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 2 Significant accounting policies continued
Interests in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint 
control, that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the 
parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control 
over those policies.
The post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are incorporated in the Group’s results using the equity method of accounting. Under 
the equity method, investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost as 
adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture and associate, less any impairment in the 
value of investment. Losses of joint ventures and associates in excess of the of the Group’s interest in that joint venture or associate are not 
recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the joint venture or associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than 
sterling are translated into sterling using exchange rates prevailing on the period end date. Income and expense items and cash flows are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity. On disposal of a 
foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The Group records foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign operations within the translation reserve in equity.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are 
recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each period end date, monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the period end date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the date when 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the 
Consolidated Income Statement for the period. 
Goodwill, intangible assets and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations after transition to IFRS are treated as 
part of the assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate. Goodwill which arose pre-transition to IFRS 
is not translated.
In respect of all foreign operations, any cumulative exchange differences that have arisen before 4 October 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, 
were reset to £nil and will be excluded from the determination of any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets acquired arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Negative 
goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and are translated at the closing exchange rates on the period end date.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired. The Group has 
no other intangible assets with indefinite lives.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known 
as cash-generating units (CGUs). If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit, prorated on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit, but subject to not reducing any asset below its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all of the Group’s CGUs are measured at the higher of value in use or fair value 
less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated by discounting future expected cash flows. These calculations use cash flow projections based on 
Board-approved budgets and projections which reflect management’s current experience and future expectations of the markets in which the 
CGU operates. Risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 11.45% to 19.2% (2016 11.25% to 
25.0%) the choice of rates depending on the risks specific to that CGU. The Directors’ estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
is 8.0% (2016 8.0%). The cash flow projections consist of Board-approved budgets for the following year, together with forecasts for up to five 
additional years and nominal long-term growth rates beyond these periods. The nominal long-term growth rates range between 1.5% and 
3.0% (2016 1.0% and 5.0%) and vary with management’s view of the CGU’s market position, maturity of the relevant market and do not exceed 
the long-term average growth rate for the market in which the CGU operates.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is charged immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible asset 
arising from the Group’s development activity, including software for internal use, is recognised only if the asset can be separately identified, 
it is probable the asset will generate future economic benefits, the development cost can be measured reliably, the project is technically 
feasible and the project will be completed with a view to sell or use the asset. Additionally, guidance in Standing Interpretations Committee 
(SIC) 32 has been applied in accounting for internally developed website development costs.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, when the asset is available 
for use, and are reported net of impairment losses. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, such development 
expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Licences
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. These costs 
are amortised over their estimated useful lives, being three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that are 
expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs and directly attributable overheads, are capitalised as intangible assets. 
Computer software which is integral to a related item of hardware equipment is accounted for as property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to 
the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets from the date they become 
available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Publishing rights, mastheads and titles 5 – 30 years
Brands 3 – 20 years
Market and customer-related databases and customer relationships 3 – 20 years
Computer software 2 – 5 years
Amortisation of intangibles not arising on business combinations is included within operating profit in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Impairment of intangible assets
At each period end date, reviews are carried out of the carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, value in use estimates are made based on the cash 
flows of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its net carrying amount, the net carrying amount of the asset or CGU 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods, 
for an asset other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of that asset. In assessing whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than 
goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased, the Group considers, as a minimum, the following indications:
(i)  whether the asset’s market value has increased significantly during the period;
(ii)  whether any significant changes with a favourable effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the near 
future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which the asset is 
dedicated; and
(iii)  whether market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have decreased during the period, and those decreases 
are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating the asset’s value in use and increase the asset’s recoverable amount materially.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets commences when 
the assets are ready for their intended use.
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between 
the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than property, plant and equipment under construction using the 
straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years
Short leasehold premises the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 – 25 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Group uses the Average Cost 
method in the dmg media segment for newsprint and the First In First Out method for all other inventories.
Exhibitions, training and event costs
Directly attributable costs relating to future exhibitions, training and events are deferred within work in progress and measured at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. These costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement when the exhibition, training or event takes place.
Pre-publication costs
Pre-publication costs represent direct costs incurred in the development of titles prior to their publication. These costs are recognised as work 
in progress on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to the extent that future economic benefit is virtually certain and can be 
measUred reliably. These are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on publication.

Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Marketing costs
Marketing and promotional costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Revenue
Revenue is stated at the fair value of consideration, net of value added tax, trade discounts and commission where applicable and is 
recognised using methods appropriate for the Group’s businesses. 
Where revenue contracts have multiple elements (such as software licences, data subscriptions and support), all aspects of the transaction 
are considered to determine whether these elements can be separately identified. Where transaction elements can be separately identified 
and revenue can be allocated between them on a fair and reliable basis, revenue for each element is accounted for according to the relevant 
policy below. Where transaction elements cannot be separately identified, revenue is recognised over the contract period. 
The dmg media segment enters into agreements with advertising agencies and certain clients, which are subject to a minimum spend and 
typically include a commitment to deliver rebates to the agency or client based on the level of agency spend over the contract period.
The principal revenue recognition policies, as applied by the Group’s major businesses, are as follows:
• subscriptions revenue, including revenue from information services, is recognised over the period of the subscription or contract;
• publishing and circulation revenue is recognised on issue of the publication or report; 
• advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication or over the period of the online campaign;
• contract print revenue is recognised on completion of the print contract; 
• exhibitions, training and events revenues are recognised over the period of the event; 
• software revenue is recognised on delivery of the software or the technology or over a period of time where the transaction is a licence 
(the licence term). If support is unable to be separately identified from hosting and revenue is unable to be allocated on a fair and reliable 
basis, support revenue is recognised over the licence term. Commissions paid to acquire software and services contracts are capitalised 
in prepayments and recognised over the term of the contract;
• support revenue associated with software licences and subscriptions is recognised over the term of the support contract; and
• long-term contract revenue is recognised using the percentage of completion method according to the percentage of work completed at the 
period end date.
Adjusted measures
The Group presents adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax by making adjustments for costs and profits which management 
believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year earnings.
Such items would include, but are not limited to, closure costs, costs associated with business combinations, gains and losses on the disposal 
of businesses, finance costs relating to premia on bond buy-backs, fair value movements, exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill 
and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on business combinations.
The Board and management team believe these adjusted results, used in conjunction with statutory IFRS results, give a greater insight into 
the financial performance of the Group and the way it is managed. Similarly, adjusted results are used in setting management remuneration. 
A description of each adjustment is set out in the Financial Review together with a reconciliation of operating profit to adjusted operating profit.
See Note 13 for a reconciliation of adjusted profit before and after tax.
Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses comprise profit or loss on sale of trading investments, profit or loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, 
impairment of available-for-sale assets, profit or loss on sale of businesses and profit or loss on sale of joint ventures and associates.
EBITDA
The Group discloses EBITDA, being adjusted operating profit before depreciation of property, plant and equipment and investment property. 
EBITDA is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies, investors and the Group’s banks as part of their assessment of the Group’s performance. 
A reconciliation of EBITDA from operating profit is shown in Note 15 and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is disclosed in Note 34.

Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Dividends are 
recognised as a distribution in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the period in 
which they are paid.
Borrowing costs
Unless capitalised under IAS 23, Borrowing Costs, all borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in 
which they are incurred. Finance charges, including premia paid on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs and discounts related to 
borrowings, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Retirement benefits
Pension scheme assets are measured at market value at the period end date. Scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit 
method and discounted at a rate reflecting current yields on high-quality corporate bonds having regard to the duration of the liability profiles 
of the schemes.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is 
recognised as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are taken 
to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes 
in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what 
has actually occurred. For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, 
with actuarial valuations being carried out triennially. In accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries in assessing whether 
to recognise a surplus, the Group has regard to the principles set out in IFRIC 14.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, including the current service cost, 
any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements. The interest cost less the expected return on assets is also charged 
to the Consolidated Income Statement within net finance costs. 
Following the adoption of FRS 101 and FRS 102 in the prior year, the defined benefit pension schemes’ deficits have been allocated to 
Group companies on a buy-out basis – that is, on an estimate of the liabilities and assets of the defined benefit schemes as at 30 September.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax for the year.
The current tax payable or recoverable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
Consolidated Income Statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never 
be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using the UK and foreign tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the period end date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are set off and stated net in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority or on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from 
the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Financial Statements
Notes to the accounts
106
Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising in investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Goodwill arising on business combinations also includes amounts corresponding to deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of acquired 
intangible assets. A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value 
of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each period end date, and is reduced or increased as appropriate to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered, or it becomes probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end date, and is not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are set off when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Actual tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation 
and uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations where uncertainties exist, provision is made for contingent tax 
liabilities and assets when it is more likely than not that there will be a cash impact. These provisions are made for each uncertainty individually 
on the basis of management judgement following consideration of the available relevant information. The measurement basis adopted 
represents the best predictor of the resolution of the uncertainty which is usually based on the most likely cash outflow. The company reviews 
the adequacy of these provisions at the end of each reporting period and adjusts them based on changing facts and circumstances.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and liability simultaneously and where the Group intends to net settle.
Financial assets
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale investments
Investments and financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the time frame established by the market concerned, and are measured at fair 
value, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale. Where securities are held for trading purposes, 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, 
at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
The fair value of listed securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Unlisted securities are recorded at cost less provision for 
impairment, as since there is no active market upon which they are traded, their fair values cannot be reliably measured. The recoverable 
amount is determined by discounting future cash flows to present value using market interest rates.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and 
equity instruments are set out below:
Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the Group’s bonds are subject to fair value hedge 
accounting as explained below and this portion is adjusted for the movement in the hedged risk to the extent hedge effectiveness is achieved. 
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term 
of the borrowing.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 2 Significant accounting policies continued
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position where the 
contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by the Group are 
foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and options. The Group does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Where the derivative instruments do qualify for hedge accounting, the following treatments are applied:
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year together with the 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. When the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the 
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included 
in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the 
forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in equity is included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
Net investment hedges
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity in the 
translation reserve. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in equity to the extent 
that the hedging relationship is effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the 
foreign operation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the period end date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract 
period exceed the forecast income receivable. The provision is calculated based on cash flows to the end of the contract. Vacant property 
provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming vacant. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a binomial pricing model which is calibrated using a Black-Scholes framework. The expected life used in 
the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.

Notes to the accounts

Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each period end date 
for cash-settled share-based payments.
Investment in own shares
Treasury shares
Where the Company purchases its equity share capital as Treasury Shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income taxes) is recorded as a deduction from shareholders’ equity until such shares are cancelled, reissued or 
disposed of.  Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the 
original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) for the purpose of purchasing shares in order to satisfy outstanding share 
options and potential awards under long-term incentive plans.  The assets of the Trust comprise shares in DMGT plc and cash balances. The 
Trust is administered by independent trustees and its assets are held separately from those of the Group. The Group bears the major risks and 
rewards of the assets held by the EBT until the shares vest unconditionally with employees.  The Group recognises the assets and liabilities of 
the Trust in the consolidated financial statements and shares held by the Trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.  
Consideration received for the sale of shares held by the Trust is recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale 
and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In addition to the judgement taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, the Directors have made 
the following judgements concerning the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
Adjusted measures
The Group presents adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax by making adjustments for costs and profits which management 
believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year earnings.
Such items would include, but are not limited to, closure costs, costs associated with business combinations, gains and losses on the disposal 
of businesses, finance costs relating to premia on bond buy-backs, fair value movements, exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill 
and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on business combinations.
The Board and management team believe these adjusted results, used in conjunction with statutory IFRS results, give a greater insight into 
the financial performance of the Group and the way it is managed. Similarly, adjusted results are used in setting management remuneration. 
A description of each adjustment is set out in the Financial Review together with a reconciliation of operating profit to adjusted operating profit.
See Note 13 for a reconciliation of adjusted profit before and after tax.
Investment in Euromoney
Following loss of control the Group has also considered factors which may indicate de facto control. The Group has determined that it does 
not have de facto control over Euromoney since it cannot block any ordinary resolutions, which comprise the majority of corporate actions, 
has no control over the remuneration of Euromoney’s directors and has no control over Euromoney’s day-to-day operations nor budgets. 
In addition, the Group has no material trading activities or relationships which are critical for Euromoney to carry out its business. The Group’s 
relationship with Euromoney is monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure no change in this assessment.
The following represent critical judgements, involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements:
Forecasting
The Group prepares medium-term forecasts based on Board-approved budgets and up to four-year outlooks. These are used to support 
judgements made in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements including the recognition of deferred tax assets, going concern 
assessment and for the purposes of impairment reviews. Longer-term forecasts use long-term growth rates applicable to the relevant businesses.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible or other assets are impaired or whether a reversal of an impairment should be recorded requires 
a comparison of the balance sheet carrying value with the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset or CGU and calculate 
the net present value of these cash flows using a suitable discount rate. A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate and 
the operating cash flows of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows (Note 21). The carrying amount of 
goodwill and intangible assets at the year end was £576. 1 million (2016 £1,480.8 million) after a net impairment charge of £213.4 million 
(2016 £53.6 million) was recognised during the year (Notes 21 and 22). The key assumptions used and associated sensitivity analysis is shown 
in Note 21.
The key assumptions used and associated sensitivity analysis in relation to Genscape, Landmark, Hobsons and RMS(one) are shown in Note 21 
and 22.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 2 Significant accounting policies continued
Acquisitions and intangible assets
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to allocate purchase consideration to the fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with any excess consideration representing goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired requires significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to cash flows 
and unprovided liabilities and commitments, including in respect to tax, to be used. The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part 
of a business combination at fair value at the date of the acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s 
judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an 
appropriate discount rate. Additionally, management must estimate the expected useful economic lives of intangible assets and charge 
amortisation on these assets accordingly.
Contingent consideration and put options payable
Estimates are required in respect of the amount of contingent consideration and put options payable on acquisitions, which is determined 
according to formulae agreed at the time of the business combination, and normally related to the future earnings of the acquired business. 
The Directors review the amount of contingent consideration and put options likely to become payable at each period end date, the 
major assumption being the level of future profits of the acquired business. The Group has made a provision for outstanding contingent 
consideration amounting to £17.0 million (2016 £52.6 million) and put options payable amounting to £8. 0 million (2016 £44.8 million).
Taxation
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure which makes 
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and actual 
tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation and 
uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group accounts for unresolved issues based on its best estimate of the final outcome, however, the inherent uncertainty regarding these 
items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and, therefore, impact the Group’s results 
and future cash flows. In situations where uncertainties exist, provision is made for contingent tax liabilities and assets when it is more likely 
than not that there will be a cash impact. These provisions are made for each uncertainty individually on the basis of management judgement 
following consideration of the available relevant information. The measurement basis adopted represents the best predictor of the resolution 
of the uncertainty which is usually based on the most likely cash outflow. The company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end 
of each reporting period and adjusts them based on changing facts and circumstances.
In addition, the Group makes estimates regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to losses based on forecasts of future 
taxable profits which are, by their nature, uncertain. In the US there has been a significant reduction in forecast future profits since March 2017 
and accordingly it is no longer estimated that the deferred tax asset in respect of US deferred interest will be recovered in the foreseeable 
future. This has resulted in a significant exceptional write off of the deferred tax asset. If the forecast future profits in the US increase in future 
periods then the level of the recognised deferred tax asset may increase. Further detail is provided in Note 37.
Retirement benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations prepared by the Group’s actuaries. This involves making 
certain assumptions concerning discount rates, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, 
such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions and the resulting estimates are reviewed annually and, when 
appropriate, changes are made which affect the actuarial valuations and, hence, the amount of retirement benefit expense recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement and the amounts of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity. The carrying amount of the retirement benefit obligation at 3 0 September 2017 was a surplus of £62.4 million (2016 deficit of 
£246.0 million). The assumptions used and the associated sensitivity analysis is given in Note 35.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 3 Segment analysis
The Group’s business activities are split into four operating divisions: RMS, dmg information, dmg events and dmg media. These divisions are 
the basis on which information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, which has been determined to be the Group Board. 
The segment result is the measure used for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment and represents profit earned by each 
segment, including share of results from joint ventures and associates but before exceptional operating costs, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets arising on business combinations, impairment charges, other gains and losses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues are included within the Strategic Report.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s

of CoStar’s intellectual property. Xceligent has filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that CoStar’s actions are contrary to a Federal Trade

claimed have not been quantified and the Group has made no provision for any claim.

There is a tax charge of £0.2 million in relation to these other gains and losses (2016 £3. 5 million).
(i)  Principally relates to a £6.2 million profit on disposal of Elite Daily in the dmg media segment offset by a loss of £6. 5 million representing 
an adjustment to the net assets sold with Wowcher in the dmg media segment and a loss of £4. 4 million on sale of various businesses 
in the Education sector in the dmg information segment.
  In the prior year this principally relates to a £60.5 million profit on disposal of Wowcher in the dmg media segment, £5.3 million profit 
on sale of Gulf Publishing and £1. 7 million profit on sale of The Petroleum Economist both in the Euromoney segment.
(ii)  Represents cumulative translation differences required to be recycled through the Consolidated Income Statement on disposals.
(iii)  During the year ZPG placed 5.0% of its issued share capital to part fund the acquisition of Hometrack.co.uk Ltd. The Group did not 
participate in this placing and accordingly the Group’s stake in ZPG was diluted. In accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and 
Joint Ventures, the dilution in the Group’s share of ZPG has been treated as a deemed disposal. The carrying value of the investment has 
increased resulting in a gain on dilution. 
(iv)  During the prior period, the Group increased its interests in Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd in the dmg media segment and Instant 
Services AG, The Petrochemical Standard Inc. and Ochresoft Technologies Ltd, in the dmg information segment and obtained control. 
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the difference between the fair value of these investments and their carrying value 
at the date control passed to the Group is been treated as a gain during the relevant period.
(v)  Principally relates to the disposal of the Group’s holding in Fortunegreen, Spaceway Storage Services in the dmg media segment and 
Clipper Data. During the prior period, this principally relates to the disposal of the Group’s 38.7% equity stake in Local World Holdings Ltd, 
held by the dmg media segment.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 11 Tax continued
In the March 2016 Budget the UK Government announced plans to introduce new rules with effect from 1 April 2017 which would restrict the 
deductibility of net interest costs and restrict the amount of tax losses that can be offset against taxable profits to 50% of those losses. The 
proposed changes were substantively enacted after the balance sheet date in November 2017 and therefore their effects are not included in 
these financial statements. If the changes had been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, they would have had no material effect 
on the deferred tax assets and deferred tax expense.
The current and deferred tax implications of Brexit on the Group have been considered by management and are not expected to have any 
material impact.
A deferred tax credit of £49.3 million (2016 £6.4 million charge) relating to the actuarial movement on defined benefit pension schemes and 
a deferred tax credit of £nil (2016 £1.4 million) relating to derivative financial instruments were recognised directly in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. A deferred tax charge of £0.4 million (2016 credit of £1. 4 million) and a current tax credit of £nil 
(2016 £5.4 million) were recognised directly in equity (Notes 39 and 40).
Legislation was passed in November 2015 to reduce the UK corporation tax rate from 20.0% to 19.0% from 1 April 2017. A further 2.0% 
reduction was enacted in September 2016. UK deferred tax balances therefore have been measured at 17.0% as this is the tax rate that will 
apply on reversal unless the timing difference is expected to reverse before April 2020, in which case the appropriate tax rate has been used.
The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.5% (2016 20.0%) representing the weighted 
average annual corporate tax rate for the full financial year. The differences are explained below:

in asymmetrical tax treatments in the territories involved. Some of these are expected to recur in the short term.
(ii) The net prior year credit of £5.7 million (2016 £12.9 million) arose largely from a reassessment of temporary differences.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Adjusted tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items (adjusted tax 
charge) amounted to a charge of £29.0 million (2016 £37.4 million) and the resulting rate is 12.8% (2016 14.4%). The differences between the 
tax charge and the adjusted tax charge are shown in the reconciliation below:

Tax on other adjusting items (34.7) (14.2)
Adjusted tax charge on the profit for the year 13 (29.0) (37.4)
In calculating the adjusted tax rate, the Group excludes the potential future impact of the deferred tax effects of intangible assets (other than 
internally generated and acquired computer software), as the Group prefers to give users of its accounts a view of the tax charge based on the 
current status of such items. Deferred tax would only crystallise on a sale of the relevant businesses, which is not anticipated at the current 
time, and such a sale, being an exceptional item, would result in an exceptional tax impact.
Reassessment of temporary differences includes a net charge of £100.4 million (2016 £31.4 million) relating to the derecognition of overseas 
tax losses and a net charge of £8.5 million (2016 credit of £9.7 million) relating to the derecognition of UK tax losses which are treated as 
exceptional due to their distortive impact on the Group’s adjusted tax charge.
Uncertain tax positions
At 30 September 2017 the Group’s 49.9% associate, Euromoney held provisions for uncertain tax of £10.2 million (30 September 2016 
£12.5 million) relating to permanent establishment risk and challenges by tax authorities. The maximum potential additional exposure to 
Euromoney in relation to challenges by tax authorities not provided for is approximately £28. 0 million if all cases were to be settled at their 
maximum potential liability. These additional exposures include challenges by: the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) on a foreign currency 
trade in 2009, which has a maximum exposure of £20.0 million; and the UK’s HMRC on a share-for-share exchange with Euromoney’s 
investment in Dealogic, which has a maximum exposure of £11.0 million of which £2.8 million has been provided. On 2 3 October 2017, the 
CRA issued a Notice of Reassessment to BCA Research Inc (BCA) based on the CRA view that the loss sustained by BCA on an intra-group 
derivative transaction cannot be deducted in computing income. We are confident that we will be able to set aside these reassessments 
through the normal litigation process, which has already begun. Nonetheless, BCA is obligated either to pay one-half of the consequential  
tax owing or to provide security for payment satisfactory to the CRA.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 14 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 97. 8 pence (2016 57.8 pence) and diluted earnings per share of 96. 3 pence (2016 56.4 pence) are calculated, 
in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per share, on Group profit for the financial year of £345.3 million (2016 £204.2 million) as adjusted 
for the effect of dilutive Ordinary Shares of £0. 1 million (2016 £0.9 million) and earnings from discontinued operations of £519.3 million 
(2016 £32.4 million) and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, as set out below.
As in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative measure gives 
a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings per share of 55.6 pence (2016 56.0 pence) 
are calculated on profit for continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets, amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations, other gains and losses and exceptional financing costs after 
taxation and non-controlling interests associated with those profits, of £196.3 million (2016 £197.8 million), as set out in Note 13 and on the 
basic weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 17 Summary of the effects of acquisitions
On 22 February 2017, the dmg events segment acquired 100% of the assets relating to the Coatings for Africa Symposium and Expo (CFA) 
for total consideration of £0.2 million. The Coatings for Africa Show is a biennial trade show held in Johannesburg, South Africa for paints, 
wallpaper and lacquer industry sectors.
CFA contributed £nil to the Group’s revenue, £nil to the Group’s operating profit and £nil to the Group’s profit after tax for the period between 
the date of acquisition and 30 September 2017.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial period, CFA would have contributed £nil to the Group’s revenue,  
£nil to the Group’s operating profit and £nil to the Group’s adjusted profit after tax.
On 12 September 2017, the dmg information segment acquired 100% of the assets of Cerulean Analytics (CA) for total consideration 
of £0.9 million. CA offers a web-based, interactive software platform used to monitor collateralised loan obligation performance.
CA contributed £nil to the Group’s revenue, £nil to the Group’s operating profit and £nil to the Group’s profit after tax for the period between 
the date of acquisition and 30 September 2017. 
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial period, CA would have contributed £nil to the Group’s revenue,  
£nil to the Group’s operating profit and £nil to the Group’s adjusted profit after tax.

Total consideration at fair value 0.2  0.9  1.1 
(i) The amount of goodwill which is deductible for the purposes of calculating the Group’s tax charge is £nil.
  Goodwill arising on these acquisitions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the Group’s 
products in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.
(ii)  The contingent consideration recognised during the period is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been 
estimated using available data forecasts. It is expected to fall due as follows: £0. 1 million within one year, £0.1 million between one and 
two years and £0.4 million between two and five years.
  The estimated range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent consideration relating to acquisitions in the year is £nil to £1.1 million. 
  The contingent consideration has been discounted back to current values in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. In each case, 
the Group has used acquisition accounting to account for the purchase.
 All of the companies acquired during the period contributed £nil to the Group’s revenue and £nil to the Group’s profit after tax for the period 
between the date of acquisition and 30 September 2017.
 Acquisition-related costs, amounting to £0.2 million, are charged against profits for the period in the Consolidated Income Statement.
 If all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the period, Group revenues for the period would have been £1,564.3 million and 
Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been a profit of £357. 1 million. This information takes into account the 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets together with related income tax effects but excludes any pre-acquisition finance costs and should 
not be viewed as indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisitions had actually been completed on the first 
day of the period.

18 Summary of the effects of disposals
On 8 December 2016, the Group announced its intention to reduce its holding in Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (Euromoney) by the 
sale of approximately 32.3 million shares in Euromoney. The sale comprised two parts: 
(i) a placing and 
(ii)  a buy-back by Euromoney and subsequent cancellation of the bought-back shares. 
The effect of the sale was to reduce the Group’s holding from 67.9% of Euromoney’s issued share capital to 49.9% after which Euromoney 
ceased to be a subsidiary and is accounted for as an associate. 
Following loss of control the Group has also considered factors which may indicate de facto control. The Group has determined that it does 
not have de facto control over Euromoney since it cannot block any ordinary resolutions, which comprise the majority of corporate actions, 
has no control over the remuneration of Euromoney’s directors and has no control over Euromoney’s day-to-day operations nor budgets. 
In addition, the Group has no material trading activities or relationships which are critical for Euromoney to carry out its business. The Group’s 
relationship with Euromoney is monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure no change in this assessment.
On 1 February 2017, the dmg information segment disposed of the assets in Beat the GMAT (BTG) for consideration of £0. 4 million.
On 17 April 2017, the dmg media segment disposed of the assets and brand of Elite Daily for total consideration of £7.2 million.
On 29 September 2017, the dmg information segment disposed of the Admissions software business. The consideration received comprised 
a £15.7 million 9.0% loan note.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report In addition, the Group’s interest in Euromoney, before Euromoney ceased to be a subsidiary undertaking, was diluted during the period by 
0.1%. Under the Group’s accounting policy for the disposal of shares in controlled entities, no adjustment has been recorded to the fair value 
of assets and liabilities already held on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The difference between the Group’s 
share of net assets before and after this dilution is adjusted in retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings in the period was 
a charge of £0.3 million (2016 £0.1 million).
The Group’s tax charge includes £4.4 million in relation to these disposals.
All of the businesses disposed of during the period generated £15. 6 million of the Group’s net operating cash flows, paid £3. 0 million 
in investing activities and paid £0. 8 million in financing activities.
Proceeds from redemption of preference share capital
During the prior period the Group received £14.4 million relating to preference share capital following the prior year sale of Capital DATA Ltd 
in the Euromoney segment. 
19 Discontinued operations
On 8 December 2016, the Group announced its intention to reduce its holding in Euromoney to 49.9% by a sale of approximately 32.3 million 
shares in Euromoney. The sale comprised two parts: 
(i)  a placing and
(ii)  a buy-back by Euromoney and subsequent cancellation for the bought-back shares. 
The effect of the sale was to reduce DMGT’s holding from 67.9% of Euromoney’s issued share capital to 49.9% after which Euromoney ceased 
to be a subsidiary and is accounted for as an Associate. The results of Euromoney up to the point of disposal are included in discontinued 
operations for the current period.

Goodwill impairment losses recognised in the year amounted to £117.0 million (2016 £46.8 million).
The Group’s policy on impairment of goodwill is set out in Note 2.
Further disclosures, in accordance with paragraph 134 of IAS 36, Impairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds an individual 
goodwill item relating to a cash generating unit (CGU) that is significant. The Group considers this to be the case when the goodwill carrying 
value of the individual CGU is 15.0% or more of the Group’s total carrying value of goodwill.
Using this criteria the only significant items of goodwill included in the net book value above relate to Genscape, Landmark and Hobsons 
in the dmg information segment.
Genscape goodwill has a carrying value of £100.5 million (2016 £196.3 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of 
£40.4 million (2016 £97.3 million). The recoverable amount of Genscape has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with 
IAS 36. The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including:
(i) cash flows for the business for the following year derived from budgets for 2018. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable;
(ii) subsequent cash flows for four additional years increased in line with growth expectations of the business;
(ii) cash flows beyond the four-year period extrapolated using a long-term nominal growth rate of 2.5%; and
(iv) a pre-tax discount rate of 19.2%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying value by £140.3 million (2016 exceeding carrying value 
by £10.3 million). Accordingly an impairment charge was recorded in the year amounting to £140.3 million.

Landmark goodwill has a carrying value of £80. 9 million (2016 £80.9 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of 
£22.0 million (2016 £20.5 million). The carrying value of Landmark has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36. 
The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including:
(i) cash flows for the business for the following year derived from budgets for 2018. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable;
(ii) subsequent cash flows for two additional years increased in line with growth expectations of the business;
(iii) cash flows beyond the three-year period extrapolated using a long-term nominal growth rate of 2.0%; and
(iv) a pre-tax discount rate of 13.3%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £169.9 million (2016 £292.8 million). For this 
business the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal to the 
carrying value the discount rate would need to be increased by 15.47% to 26.47% (2016 by 25.78% to 35.78%), the long-term growth rate 
would need to decline by 22.69% to -20.69% (2016 by 31.51% to -28.51%), or the CGU would need to miss budget by 62.4% (2016 77.4%).
Hobsons goodwill has a carrying value of £69. 6 million (2016 £76.1 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of £22.4 million 
(2016 £37.4 million). The carrying value of Hobsons has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36. The methodology 
applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including:
(i) cash flows for the business for the following year derived from budgets for 2018. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable;
(ii) subsequent cash flows for two additional years increased in line with growth expectations of the business;
(iii) cash flows beyond the three-year period extrapolated using a long-term nominal growth rate of 3.0%; and
(iv) a pre-tax discount rate of 18.3%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £25.2 million (2016 £302.9 million). For this 
business the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal to 
the carrying value the discount rate would need to be increased by 1.96% to 12.96% (2016 by 20.27% to 30.27%), the long-term growth rate 
would need to decline by 2.23% to 0.77% (2016 by 24.66% to -21.66%), or the CGU would need to miss budget by 21.3% (2016 71.8%).

The Group’s most significant individual internally developed intangible asset is RMS(one). The development of RMS(one) was completed 
during the prior period and the asset was transfered out of the assets in the course of construction category and amortisation commenced. 
The RMS(one) intangible asset has a carrying value of £71. 3 million (2016 £89.1 million) which has been assessed for recoverability using 
a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36, Impairment of assets. The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past 
experience and external sources of information including:
(i) budget and forecast data which the Directors believe to be reasonably achievable;
(ii) cash flows over five years post-launch;
(iii) the rate at which core clients start using RMS(one) platform;
(iv) a pre-tax discount rate of 17.4% for platform & software and 15.2% for models & data; and
(v) average annual growth rates of 4.0%–15.0% in the core underlying business.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value and accordingly no impairment charge was recorded 
in the year.
The methodologies applied to the Group’s CGUs when testing for impairment and details of the above impairment charge are set out 
in Note 2.
The carrying values of the Group’s larger intangible assets are further analysed as follows:

(ii)  On 8 December 2016, the Group announced its intention to reduce its holding in Euromoney by the sale of approximately 32. 3 million 
shares in Euromoney. The sale comprised two parts: (i) a placing and (ii) a buy-back by Euromoney and subsequent cancellation of the 
bought back shares. The effect of the sale was to reduce the Group’s holding from 67.9% of Euromoney’s issued share capital to 49.9% 
after which Euromoney ceased to be a subsidiary and is accounted for as an associate.

The investments above represent unlisted securities, which are recorded as non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within 
one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets. Since there is no active market upon which they are traded, unlisted securities 
are recorded at cost less provision for impairment, as their fair values cannot be reliably measured.
(i)  During the year, the Group acquired an additional interest in PropStak Services Limited (PropStak), taking its overall holding to 23.17%. 
By virtue of the Group’s board representation and shareholder rights the Group now has significant influence over PropStak and has 
treated this investment as an associate (see Note 24).

Committed borrowing facilities
The Group’s bank loans bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin. The margin varies by bank and is based on the Group’s ratio of net debt 
to EBITDA or the Group’s credit rating. Each committed bank facility contains covenants based on a maximum 3.75 times net debt to EBITDA 
ratio and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times. EBITDA for these purposes is defined as the aggregate of the Group’s consolidated 
operating profit including share of results of joint ventures and associates before deducting depreciation, amortisation and impairment of 
goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, before exceptional items and before interest and finance charges, and the ratio is shown in Note 34. 
These covenants were met at the relevant test dates during the year.
The Group’s total committed bank facilities amount to £611.4 million. Of these facilities £195.0 million are denominated in sterling and 
£416.4 million (US$558.0 million) are denominated in US dollars. Drawings are permitted in all major currencies.

The Group’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts and movements 
in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the effective interest 
method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £0.9 million (2016 £1.2 million) and the unamortised premia £4. 1 million (2016 £6.8 million).
The fair value of the Group’s bonds have been calculated on the basis of quoted market rates.
Further details of the Group’s borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial Review.
Loan notes
The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates which range between approximately 6.0% to LIBID minus 1.0%. The loan notes 
are repayable at the option of the loan note holders with a six-month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.

Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 34 Financial instruments and risk management
The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial instruments are 
used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders’ funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the Group are able 
to continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Debt management
The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile. The Group’s principal sources of 
funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities. The Group is mindful of its credit rating, currently BBB- and 
ensures it has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account the Group’s 
holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist. The Group aims to maximise the term and 
flexibility of indebtedness and retain headroom in the form of undrawn committed bank facilities of approximately £100.0 million. 
Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency 
to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Group’s bond issuances together with its bank facilities are sufficient to cover the likely medium-term cash 
requirements of the Group. 
Associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements. In all cases 
such financing is on a non-recourse basis to the Company.
Whilst the Group’s internal target of a 12-month rolling net debt to EBITDA ratio of no greater than 2.0 times at any point, the limit imposed by 
its bank covenants is no greater than 3.75 times measured in March and September. The bank covenant ratio uses the average exchange rate 
in the calculation of net debt. The resultant net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.38 times (2016 1.77 times). Using a closing rate basis for the valuation 
of net debt, the ratio was 1.33 times (2016 1.87 times).
Cash and liquidity risk management
The Group monitors its cash balances to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet operational requirements as they fall due. 
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due 
consideration to credit risk. A detailed maturity analysis of both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are analysed in the table 
on page 157 of this note. 
Market risk management
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements. 
Interest rate risk management
The limit imposed by the Group’s bank covenants is at least 3.0 times EBITDA to net interest. The actual ratio for the year was 10.07 times 
(2016 9.4 times).
Group debt is largely comprised of floating rate sterling (GBP) and US dollar (USD) bank borrowings and fixed GBP bond debt. 
The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes 
in interest rates. Group policy is to have 70.0% to 80.0% of interest rate exposures fixed with the balance floating.
This is achieved by issuing fixed rate GBP bond debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate interest into 
floating rate. Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless 
such risks exist.
To meet policy the Group: 
• swaps a portion of its fixed GBP bond debt into GBP floating debt using interest rate swaps;
• swaps a portion of its fixed GBP bond debt into USD fixed bond debt by using cross-currency fixed to fixed swaps;
• buys USD caps to fix its USD debt; and
• enters forward contracts, selling USD and buying GBP to swap its GBP floating rate debt into USD floating rate debt.
The derivatives in place to meet Group policy are as follows:
(i)  Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Group’s bonds; changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised in 
the Income Statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements in the hedged risk to the 
extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the Income Statement. The notional value of these interest rate swaps 
amounts to £93.1 million (2016 £73.9 million) with the Group paying floating rates of between 0.29% and 0.99% (2016 0.38% and 1.05%).
(ii)  Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedging instruments; changes in the fair value of the swaps are 
recognised in the Income Statement. The notional value of these interest rate swaps amounts to US$67.0 million (2016 US$67.0 million) 
with the Group receiving floating US dollar interest at rates of between 0.86% and 1.33% (2016 0.35% and 0.86%).

Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 34 Financial instruments and risk management continued
(iii)  Cross-currency fixed-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The notional value of these cross-currency swaps amounts to £96.3 million/
US$155.0 million (2016 £96.3 million/US$155.0 million) resulting in the Group paying fixed US dollar interest at rates of between 5.56% 
and 6.99% (2016 5.56% and 6.99%).
(iv)  The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps. These amounted to US$225. 0 million notional (2016 US$225.0 million) 
at rates of between 1.00% and 2.75% (2016 1.00% and 2.75%).
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the date the derivatives are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
fair value at each reporting date. The fair value is determined by using market rates of interest and exchange as at 3 0 September 2017 and the 
use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models. The fair value of long-term borrowings 
has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other than that 
of the parent company. The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings 
in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps, forward contracts and US dollar bank borrowings as net investment hedges, hedging the Group’s 
overseas investments.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to financial 
instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s customer base is diversified geographically and by segment with customers generally of a good financial standing. Before 
accepting any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customers’ credit quality and sets credit limits by customer. The average 
credit period is 32 days (2016 39 days). The Group considers the credit risk of trade receivables to be low, although the Group remains vigilant 
in the current economic climate. The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although the Group does not 
hold collateral over any trade receivable balances. The Group makes an allowance for bad and doubtful debts specific to individual debts. 
This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles and past default experience.
The Group’s receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
The maximum exposure to credit risk from trade and other receivables at the reporting date is the amount of each class disclosed in the table 
on page 155.
Institutional counterparty risk
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments. As a result, credit risk 
arises from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are unsecured. The amount of this 
credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged. The Group also has a credit 
exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. 
Credit risk is controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks 
with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are banks with high 
credit ratings. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any ‘AA’ counterparty or £10. 0 million for ‘A’ rated 
counterparties. The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk from derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents at the reporting date is the amount of each class 
disclosed in the table on page 155.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as:
(i)  hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (fair value hedges); or
(ii)  hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or
(iii)  hedges of net investment in foreign operations (net investment hedges).
To qualify for hedge accounting, each individual hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and documented  
at its inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.

The Group’s policy is to use interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest 
rate risk.

Cash flow hedges
The Group’s policy is to use certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from certain firm 
commitments or forecast highly probable transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entity.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 3 0 September 2017. 
Net investment hedges
The Group seeks to manage the foreign currency exposure arising on retranslation of the reporting entity’s share of net assets of foreign 
operations at each reporting date by designating certain derivative financial instruments and foreign currency borrowings as net investment 
hedging instruments.
All net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 3 0 September 2017.

(previously named Axiometrics LLC). The option does not represent an equity interest since dmg information is not entitled to any 
economic benefits associated with this option. 
  The option was recognised as a derivative asset and recorded at a fair value of £7.1 million. Changes in the fair value of this instrument 
were recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in Financing.

In managing the Group’s interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations. However, changes 
in foreign exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on the Group’s statutory results. 
At 30 September 2017 it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in interest rates would have decreased the Group’s finance costs by £3. 7 million 
(2016 £4.6 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. This sensitivity has been calculated by applying 
the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate swaps, at the year-end date.
At 30 September 2017 it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in interest rates would have increased the Group’s finance costs by £3. 0 million 
(2016 £3.8 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. This sensitivity has been calculated by applying 
the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate swaps, as at the year-end date.
At 30 September 2017 it is estimated that a 10.0% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have decreased the net loss taken 
to equity by £33.2 million (2016 £50.8 million) with no change to the net gain taken to income (2016 decreased the net loss by £2. 1 million). 
A 10.0% weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net loss taken to equity by £40.5 million (2016 £60.5 million) 
and increased the net gain taken to income by £0.1 million (2016 increased the net loss by £2. 6 million). This sensitivity has been calculated 
by applying the foreign exchange change to the Group’s financial instruments which are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 30 September 2017, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would lead 
to a decrease in the present value of acquisition put option commitments of £nil (2016 £1.0 million).
At 30 September 2017, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would lead

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

(i)  The fair value of derivative instruments is determined using market rates of interest and exchange, and established estimation techniques 
such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
(ii)  Available-for-sale financial assets are recorded at cost less provision for impairment, as since there is no active market upon which they 
are traded their fair values cannot be reliably measured. The recoverable amount is determined by discounting future cash flows to 
present value using market interest rates.
  Contingent consideration is valued based on the future profitability of the businesses to which the contingent consideration relates, 
discounted at market rates of interest.

The key inputs into the significant level 3 financial liabilities are the future profitability of the businesses to which the contingent consideration 
relate and the discount rate. The estimated range of possible outcomes for the fair value of these liabilities is £1.1 million to £233.0 million 
(2016 £2.2 million to £311.3 million).
The reduction in fair value of contingent consideration of £28.6 million (2016 £12.3 million increase) and finance charge on discounting 
of contingent consideration of £nil (2016 £0.1 million) were charged or credited to the Income statement within net finance costs (Note 10).
A one percentage point increase or decrease in the growth rate used in estimating the expected profits, results in the contingent consideration 
liability at 30 September 2017 increasing or decreasing by £1.7 million and £1.3 million respectively (2016 £0.5 million increase and £0.6 million 
decrease), with the corresponding change to the value at 30 September 2017 charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in 
future periods.
The rates used to discount contingent consideration range from 0.0% to 0.2% (2016 0.0% to 1.3%). A one percentage point increase or 
decrease in the discount rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments, results in the liability at 30 September 2017 decreasing 
or increasing by £0.3 million and £0.1 million respectively (2016 £1.1 million and £0.3 million), with the corresponding change to the value 
at 30 September 2017 charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in future periods.

The schemes include a number of defined contribution pension arrangements, in addition to funded defined benefit pension arrangements 
which are closed to future accrual. The defined benefit schemes in the UK, together with some defined contribution plans, are administered 
by Trustees or Trustee Companies.
Defined benefit schemes
Background
The Company operates two main defined benefit schemes, the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS) and the Senior Executive Pension Scheme 
(SEPF), both of which are closed to new entrants and to further accrual.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the scheme actuary. Prior to its closure to future 
accrual on 1 January 2016, the Group made annual contributions of 12.0% or 18.0% of members’ basic pay (depending on membership 
section) to HPS. Following the results of the latest triennial valuation as at 3 1 March 2016, the Company agreed a Recovery Plan involving 
a series of annual funding payments, of £13. 0 million on 5 October 2016 to 2018, £16.2 million on 5 October 2019 to 2025 and £76. 2 million 
on 5 October 2026. The Company considers that these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate any deficit over the agreed period. 
This Recovery Plan will be reviewed at the next triennial funding valuation of the main schemes which is due to be completed with an 
effective date of 31 March 2019.
In addition the Company has agreed with the Trustees that, should it make any permanent reductions in the Company’s capital, including 
share buy-backs, it will make additional contributions to the schemes amounting to 20.0% of the capital reduction. Contributions of £nil 
(2016 £3.5 million) relating to this agreement were made in the year to 3 0 September 2017.

Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Limited Partnership investment vehicle
HPS owns a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle (LP). The LP has been designed to facilitate annual payments of 
£10.8 million as part of the deficit funding payments described above over the period to 2026. In addition, the LP is required to make a final 
payment to the scheme of £149.9 million, or the funding deficit within the scheme on an ongoing actuarial valuation basis, at the end of 
the period to 2026 if this is less. The Recovery Plan above assumes £60.0 million of the £149.9 million final payment is required. For funding 
purposes, the interest of HPS in the LP is treated as an asset of the scheme and reduces the actuarial deficit within the scheme. However, 
under IAS 19, Employee benefits, the LP is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore is not included in the disclosures below.
The Trustee has developed a comprehensive approach to managing the Scheme’s investment strategy to ensure it is always aligned with 
the Strategic Plan of becoming fully funded on a gilts+0.5% funding basis by 2028. This approach is defined in the Trustee’s Strategic Plan 
whose overriding objective is to set out a framework for reducing investment risk as and when the improvement in the Scheme’s funding 
position allows.
This framework defines a series of triggers which present opportunities for the Trustee to reduce risk either by reducing the allocation to 
return seeking assets, such as equities and increasing the interest rate and inflation hedge or a combination of the two.
The figures in this note are based on calculations using membership data as at 30 September 2017 along with asset valuations and cash flow 
information from the schemes for the year to 30 September 2017.

Statement of Financial Position 73.4 (11.0) 62.4  40.1 (286.1) (246.0)
The IAS 19 accounting surplus/(deficit) data above differs to the triennial actuarial surplus/(deficit) calculation used in the assessment of 
future funding obligations. There are a number of reasons for this – the actuarial valuation is as at the Schemes’ year end date of 3 1 March 
and is calculated triennially based on more prudent assumptions including those covering discount rates and mortality. IAS 19 requires the 
Company to use best estimate assumptions.
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a company 
can recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position. 
In relation to HPS and the SEPF , having taken account of the rules of the Schemes, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any 
surplus under IFRIC 14 and considers that the recognition of surpluses in these Schemes on its Statement of Financial Position is in accordance 
with the interpretations of IFRIC 14. In relation to the AVC, having taken account of the rules of the Scheme, the Company does not have an 
unconditional right to a refund under IFRIC 14. However, at 30 September 2017 the AVC Plan showed a deficit and no contributions are payable 
into the AVC Plan. Therefore no asset ceiling needs to be applied to restrict surplus on the balance sheet and no additional minimum funding 
liability is needed under IFRIC 14.
IFRIC 14 is in the process of being revised which may lead to a reassessment of the Company’s recognition of any pension surplus on its 
Statement of Financial Position.
The surplus/(deficit) for the year, set out above, excludes a related deferred tax asset of £9. 9 million (2016 £42.8 million).

  Private equity and infrastructure funds are valued by investment managers using appropriate valuation techniques. These are derived 
from market based multiples and discount rates of comparable quoted businesses or market transactions which have been determined 
by the Trustees’ investment advisors to represent fair value.
(ii)  Bonds and credit assets include corporate bonds, distressed credit and loans. Corporate bonds are held in unitised pooled investment 
vehicles and are valued at the latest available bid price provided by the pooled investment manager. Distressed credit and loans are 
valued by the investment managers using relevant valuation techniques.
(iii)  Liability Driven Investment funds (LDI) are a collateralised portfolio of gilt repo and swap contracts designed to hedge circa 50.0%  
(by value of assets) of the scheme’s inflation and discount rate risks. These are independently valued using quoted prices and for OTC 
instruments by the investment manager using recognised discounting techniques. 
(iv)  The Schemes’ property portfolio represent a mixture of industrial, retail, office and leisure. These assets are independently valued at open 
market value at 31 March each year with subsequent changes in value based on changes in the Investment Property Databank Index (IPD) 
which tracks retail, office and industrial property transactions.
The value of employer-related assets held on behalf of the schemes at 30 September 2017 was £nil (0.0% of assets), (2016 £nil, 0.0% of assets).

Price inflation 3.20  2.95 
Pension increases 3.00  2.80 
Discount rate 2.60  2.15 
The discount rate for both scheme liabilities and the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year-end date on high-quality corporate 
bonds and are based on a cash flow-based yield curve, calculating a single equivalent discount rate reflecting the average duration of the 
schemes’ liabilities, rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a. This methodology incorporates bonds given an AA rating from at least two of the main 
four rating agencies (Standard and Poors, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS).
RPI inflation is derived in a similar way to the discount rate but with reference to the Bank of England spot curve at the duration of the schemes’ 
weighted averaged duration with an appropriate allowance for inflation risk premium (0.20% p.a.), rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a..
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on the 
Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) projections but with a long-term rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.25% p.a.. 
Allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.
The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year is approximately 20 years (2016 20 years).
The table below illustrates examples of the assumed average life expectancies from age 60 for the principal schemes:

There are significant risks in connection with running defined benefit schemes, and the key risks are highlighted below:
Inflation rate risk
A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore increased inflation will result in a higher pension 
obligations. The Trustees have sought to acquire certain assets with exposure to inflationary uplifts in order to negate a proportion of this risk, 
including the LDI investment funds which reduce this risk by 50.0%.
Life expectancy risk
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme members. 
An increase in assumed life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation. Regular reviews of mortality experience 
are performed to ensure life expectancy assumptions remain appropriate.
Investment risk
This is a measure of the uncertainty that the return on the schemes’ assets meet the return necessary to fund pension obligations. 
The schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, but during the period have been reallocating some of these investments into credit 
and property investments which exhibit lower volatility of return and the LDI investments.
Discount rate risk
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate bond yields. 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation, although this will be partially offset 
by the LDI investment funds which reduce the gilt rate risk by 50.0% and an increase in the value of corporate bonds held by the schemes.

The Group expects to contribute approximately £13.0 million to the schemes during the year to 3 0 September 2018 including the deficit 
funding payments described above.
UK defined contribution plans
The Group has introduced a number of PensionSaver group personal pension plans that have replaced the trust-based defined contribution 
pension plans previously offered to employees. These plans create a consistent pensions savings vehicle across all Group segments. The 
benefits for all members of the trust-based plans have been transferred to individual policies held in the member’s own name and the scheme 
is now wound up. Insured death benefits previously held under this trust have already been transferred to a new trust-based arrangement 
specifically for life assurance purposes.
The aggregate value of the Group personal pension plans was £130. 5 million (2016 £105.4 million) at the year end. The pension cost 
attributable to these plans during the year amounted to £13. 1 million (2016 £14.0 million).
Overseas pension plans
Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group segments operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America. 
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to £4.5 million (2016 £4.2 million).

  The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated using available data 
forecasts. The estimated range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent consideration relating to acquisitions in the year is £nil to 
£1.1 million. Certain contingent consideration arrangements are not capped since they are based on future business performance.

These losses have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient 
suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered probable that these 
assets will be recovered. Of these assets £18.9 million (2016 £21.1 million) have expiry dates between 2017 and 2036.
Included within other deferred tax are £nil (2016 £1.7 million) in respect of financial instruments. The £nil credit to equity (2016 £1.4 million) 
relates entirely to financial instruments.

Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £75.4 million (2016 £72.2 million) which relates to revenue losses and £131.4 million 
(2016 £34.3 million) which relates to deferred interest where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable 
future. There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of £127. 4 million (2016 £131.2 million). 
Of these assets £40.1 million (2016 £42.7 million) have expiry dates between 2022 and 2036.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £58.8 million (2016 £321.5 million) relating to the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 30 September 2017 represent only the unremitted earnings of those 
overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend 
withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

The Group’s most significant leasing arrangements relate to rented properties. The Group negotiates lease contracts according to the 
Group’s needs with a view to balancing stability, security of tenure and lease terms against the risk of entering into excessively long or 
onerous arrangements. 
Of the Group’s rented properties, the most significant operating lease commitments relate to the DMGT head office premises at 2 Derry Street, 
London W8 5TT, which expires in December 2022, and to the RMS head office at 7575 Gateway Blvd, Newark, California which expires in 
December 2020.

The Group has entered into agreements with various printers for periods up to December 2022 at competitive prices and to secure supply. 
At the year end, the commitment to purchase printing capacity over this period was £39. 4 million (2016 £49.2 million).
The Group has entered into a number of arrangements with Microsoft to provide cloud infrastructure to the RMS segment until June 2019. 
At the year end the commitment under this agreement was £12.1 million (2016 £11.6 million).
Contingent liabilities
The Group has issued standby letters of credit amounting to £3.5 million (2016 £3.8 million).
The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and vigorously defends against claims received. The Group makes 
provision for the estimated costs to defend such claims and provides for any settlement costs when such an outcome is judged probable.
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against Euromoney, the Group’s 49.9% associate, and three of Euromoney’s 
employees in respect of an article published in one of the Company’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995. 
The writs were served on Euromoney on 22 October 1996. Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount claimed 
on the two remaining writs is Malaysian Ringgit 83. 1 million (£14.7 million). No provision has been made for these claims by Euromoney 
as Euromoney does not believe it has any material liability in respect of these writs.
On 12 December 2016, CoStar Inc. (CoStar) filed a complaint in the Missouri Federal Court against Xceligent, Inc. (Xceligent) asserting, 
inter alia, misuse by Xceligent of CoStar’s intellectual property. The damages claimed have not been quantified. Xceligent consider CoStar’s 
actions to be in violation of the FTC consent order which was put in place when Xceligent was spun out of CoStar’s acquisition of LoopNet. 
The Group has therefore made no provision for any claim which may be payable.

The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration schemes to Directors and certain employees. The principal schemes comprise 
share options under the DMGT, RMS, and within dmg information, Genscape, Hobsons and Trepp Executive Share Option Schemes and the 
Company’s LTIP . Share options are exercisable after three years, subject in some cases to the satisfaction of performance conditions, and 
up to 10 years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant. Details of the 
performance conditions relating to the Company schemes are explained in the Remuneration Report.

The fair value of share options for each of these schemes was determined using a Black-Scholes model. Full details of inputs to the models, 
particular to each scheme, are set out below. With respect to all schemes, expected volatility has been estimated, based upon relevant 
historic data in respect of the DMGT A Ordinary Non-Voting Share price. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability.
The Group did not reprice any of its outstanding options during the year.
Further details of the Group’s significant schemes are set out below: 
DMGT 2006 Executive Share Option Scheme
Under the DMGT 2006 Executive Share Option Scheme, each award of options has a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum award limit 
is 100% of salary in any year in normal circumstances and 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances. Awards will not normally vest until 
three years after the award and the performance conditions have been met. No options were outstanding to Directors during the year.

RMS option plan
RMS options are granted at market value. The options become exercisable after a four-year vesting period and lapse ten years and five years 
from grant date under the 2001 and 2005 option plans respectively. The stock issued under the plan is subject to put or call options where 
DMGT has the right to settle in DMGT A Ordinary Non-Voting Shares or cash. The option plan classification changed from a cash-settled plan 
in June 2005 to an equity-settled plan following this change of settlement feature of stock issued under the plan. After 3 0 September 2011, 
options under the 2001 and 2005 plan were no longer awarded.
During the year ended 30 September 2011, RMS introduced the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Under 
the EIP , options and Restricted Stock Units (RSU) were awarded to senior management. Under the LTIP , RSUs were awarded to key employees. 
The options and RSUs were granted at market value under both plans. The options vest based on the conditions of time and company 
performance at three and five years from date of grant. The options lapse after seven years from grant date. The RSUs under both plans vest 
annually over three years.
A 2014 Equity Award Plan (the Plan) was introduced during the year ended 30 September 2014. Under the Plan options and RSUs, both 
time- and performance-based, are granted to employees who are deemed to be in a position to contribute to the long-term success of RMS.
The RSU expense is determined by the fair market value of RMS stock at the date of grant. The expense is amortised using an accelerated 
method. Under this method the RSUs are equally allocated to each of the three annual vesting components and the related expense is 
amortised over 12, 24, and 36 months respectively.
In November 2014, RMS approved an option exchange programme allowing RMS option holders to exchange their existing out-of-the-money 
options for new options with a strike price of US$40.0 or RSUs where eligible.
In 2015 RMS introduced the 2015 stock option plan which was adopted in January 2016. Options granted under this plan vest on satisfaction 
of two conditions: a four-year service period and the occurrence of an initial public offering of RMS or an event in which the Group ceases 
to hold at least 50% of the voting rights of RMS.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report 1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain 
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting 
policies. See Note 2 of the Group’s Annual Report for further detail.
Profit for the financial year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included in these 
accounts. The Company’s profit after tax for the year was £127.9 million (2016 £820.1 million). This includes dividends receivable from 
subsidiary undertakings amounting to £152.2 million (2016 £1,045.0 million).
Impact of amendments to accounting standards
The company has applied the exemption available under FRS 101 in relation to paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes 
in accounting estimates and errors (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been 
issued and is not yet effective).
2 Significant accounting policies
Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s reporting currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing 
on the date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in the profit and loss account for the year.
Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment, where appropriate. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that 
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation 
computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing 
differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of 
subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Financial instruments disclosures
Financial assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. The majority of other receivables relate to amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings. Further information concerning 
interest charged on these receivables is set out in Note 9.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities.

of Financial Performance

Financial Statements
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Strategic Report Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the Company’s bonds are subject to fair value hedge 
accounting and this portion of the carrying value is adjusted for the movement in the hedged risk to the extent hedge effectiveness is 
achieved. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over 
the term of the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to settle 
on a net basis, or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses various 
derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these risks.
The use of financial derivatives is set out in Note 34 of the Group’s Annual Report. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes.
The Company does not apply hedge accounting except for fair value hedges. Gains and losses arising on derivatives that form part of net 
investment hedge or cash flow hedge relationships in the consolidated financial statements are recorded in the profit and loss account  
in the Company.
Financial instruments – disclosures
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and included disclosures relating 
to financial instruments in Note 34 of the Group’s Annual Report.
Cash flow statement
The Company has utilised the exemptions provided under IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows and has not presented a cash flow statement. 
A consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the Group’s Annual Report on page 98.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions of IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures and included disclosures relating to related parties 
in Note 44 of the Group’s Annual Report.
Share-based payments
The Company operates the Group’s LTIP and other Group share-based payment schemes, details of which can be found in Note 42 of the 
Group’s Annual Report.
Retirement benefits
The defined benefit pension schemes’ surpluses/deficits have been allocated to Group companies on a buy-out basis – that is on an estimate 
of the liabilities and assets of the defined benefit schemes as at 30 September 2017. Accordingly the Company has not recorded an asset 
or liability in relation to the Group’s defined benefit scheme.
Further information can be found in Note 35 of the Group’s Annual Report.
3 Auditor’s remuneration        
Statutory audit fees relating to the Company amounted to £0. 3 million (2016 £0.2 million).

(i)  Details of the Company’s derivative financial liabilities are set out in Note 34 of the Group’s Annual Report.
The Company’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts and 
movements in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the 
effective interest method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £0.9 million (2016 £1.2 million) and the unamortised premia amounts 
to £4.1 million (2016 £6.8 million).
Details of the fair value of the Company’s bonds are set out in Note 33 of the Group’s Annual Report.
The bonds are subject to fair value hedging using derivatives as set out in Note 34 of the Group’s Annual Report. Consequently, their carrying 
value is also adjusted to take into account the effects of this hedging activity.
The book value of the Company’s other borrowings equates to fair value.
