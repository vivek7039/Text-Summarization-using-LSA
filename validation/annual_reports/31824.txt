A Year of Substantial Progress
I am very pleased to introduce the first annual 
report for the Group as a listed business. The 
year has been one of substantial progress and 
significant change, with a number of exciting 
developments taking place across the business, 
some of which are mentioned in the Chief 
Executive’s Review.
Performance & Strategy
The Group delivered a strong financial 
performance during the year. This was achieved 
despite a backdrop of continuing economic 
turbulence. The business, along with many 
others, faced a number of challenges including 
significant cost inflation, the devaluation of 
Sterling against major currencies and the 
well documented uncertainty around Brexit 
negotiations following the General Election. 
Ultimate Products' performance is attributable 
to a number of factors:  a superb range of 
great value core products, new and innovative 
products, an excellent supply chain, a strong 
and extensive customer base of leading 
retailers and, not least, the committed and 
talented colleagues that we employ who 
deliver our company values every day. We 
believe that we offer all of our customers the 
best possible products with an overall service 
level that is second to none. This powerful 
combination is important to customer focused 
businesses that require certainty in value, 
quality and critically, supply.
Over recent years, the Group’s strategy has 
been to develop a portfolio of brands focused 
on the growing market of value-led consumer 
goods for the home. The success of this strategy 
is demonstrated by the growth of the business 
since FY 14 and in particular the financial metrics 
for the last financial year.
Our strategy has four key pillars: 
1. growing our business with 
 discount retailers; 
2. increasing our penetration in 
 UK supermarkets; 
3. expansion via online channels; and 
4. international growth.
The Board is confident that our relentless focus 
on these objectives will drive long term growth 
for the business and its stakeholders.
Initial Public Offering
On 6 March 2017, the Group was admitted 
to the premium segment of the Official 
List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and to trading on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange plc. This was a 
significant step forward for the development 
of the business and a substantial achievement 
for the management team and staff. We believe  
that our listed company status provides the 
right platform for the future growth of the 
business and further enhances our reputation 
with customers and supplier partners. We 
www.upgs.com

TOMORROW’S

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
recognise that the future prospects of the 
business are reliant on both retaining our very 
best talent and recruiting new colleagues to 
the business that have the same potential and 
attitude as our very best. Accordingly, we are 
creating development programmes for rising 
stars and have already put in place various 
incentive schemes that reward outperformance. 
Dividend
The Board is committed to a progressive 
dividend policy, with an intention to distribute 
50 % of the Group’s adjusted profit after tax. 
A final dividend is recommended of 3.495 p 
per share to give a total dividend of 5.115 p per 
share for the full year.
The final dividend is payable on 30 January 2018 
to shareholders on the register on 5 January 2018.
Summary
The Board fully believes that our strategy of 
developing and building a portfolio of brands 
that are focused on mass-market and value-led 
consumer goods for the home will create further 
value for all our stakeholders, and we are excited 
by the Group’s long-term growth prospects.
Since the year end, trading conditions have 
become more challenging with retailers 
taking longer to commit to orders or delaying 
purchasing decisions for the current year. This 
reflects uncertainty in the market place and in 
particular the effect of wage deflation and 
food inflation on consumers. Whilst we 
believe that in time we will see a return to more 
traditional trading patterns our view is that, in 
the short term, many UK retailers will continue 
to be cautious on ordering non-food inventory.
On behalf of all of our stakeholders, I would 
like to thank all of our colleagues for their 
commitment and hard work over the past year.

An Excellent Performance in a 
Changing Market
Ultimate Products has delivered a strong 
financial performance this year, amid a period 
of significant change for the Group. Over the 
last five years, we have been building a market-
leading position in branded, value-focused 
and mass-market consumer goods for the UK 
consumer. 2017 has seen the results of this effort 
start to come to fruition. Following the IPO, we 
now have a strong platform from which to drive 
the next stage of Ultimate Products’ growth.
Performance
Group revenue rose 39.1 % to £110.0 m (FY 16: 
£79.0 m), and continued to be driven by three 
main factors:
1. growth in sales to discounters in the UK 
 and in Europe (up 64.6 % to £63.8 m);  
2. increased sales to the main UK 
 supermarkets (up 95.0 % to £10.3 m); and 
3. the emergence of online platforms as a new  
 revenue for the business (up 63.6 % to £4.6 m).
Underlying Profit Before Tax* was up 42.0 % 
to £10.7 m. Gross Margin was down by 1.6 % at 
22.3 % as a result of a higher mix of Free on 
Board (‘FOB’) business in the year and, for our 
Landed business, as a result of imported price 
inflation arising from a weakened Sterling.
Despite this, our Underlying EBITDA Margin*  
held firm at 10.5 % (up 0.1 %). This reflects:
1. the economies of scale from higher revenues; 
2. an increased proportion of FOB sales 
 (which is less overhead intensive), partially  
 
 offset by increased sales via online platforms 
 (which is more overhead intensive); and 
3. a more efficient operating model as the 
 focus on the Group’s brand portfolio, which  
 has led to an increase in repeat sales 
 and extended product life cycles.
Operational Overview
We have made solid operational progress 
across the business. The Group has continued 
to develop and expand the relationships with 
its core customer base of UK and European 
discounters. We have also made significant 
progress in Germany, with a number of major 
retail accounts opened and plans are well 
advanced to open a showroom there in CY 18. 
Other international developments include a 
new landed supply arrangement with a major 
European customer. This allows the Group 
to expand beyond its current limited product 
offering with the customer into other product 
categories, representing an exciting opportunity 
to continue to grow alongside one of the fastest 
expanding retailers in Europe, further cementing 
the Group's position as a key supplier to it. 
A particular highlight of the Group's branded 
product portfolio during the period has been 
the performance of Progress, the cookware and 
kitchen electrical brand, which is now listed with 
several retailers including, as of January 2018, a 
major UK supermarket.

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
grew in the year by 63.6 % to £4.6 m and, 
while still a relatively small proportion of overall 
revenue at the moment, it is increasing in 
importance. Online is an exciting and fast 
growing part of the business and we are 
optimistic about its future prospects.
We are seeing some cost pressures coming 
through from China, where the bulk of our 
product is sourced. This has been caused by 
the strengthening of the Chinese currency and 
local regulatory changes.  However, we are 
confident in our ability to effectively manage this 
because of our experience over many years 
in that territory and our strong local presence 
through our office in Guangzhou.
Finally, the refurbishment of Ultimate Products' 
new 240,000 sq ft warehouse at Heron Mill 
in Oldham has been completed to plan and 
is now the Group's main distribution facility. 
The Board anticipates that this will create 
improved operational efficiencies and significant 
additional capacity to manage the future growth 
of the business.
Board Appointments
The Group's Board has been substantially 
strengthened through the appointments 
of James McCarthy as Chairman, Alan Rigby as 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and 
Robbie Bell as Non-Executive Director.
James McCarthy has over 40 years' experience 
in the fast-moving retail industry, having 
previously held the position of Chief Executive 
Officer of Poundland. He stepped down in 
September 2016 after a decade-long tenure 
during which the company's sales grew from 
£300 m to £1.3 bn per annum, whilst the number 
of stores increased from 150 to over 900. Prior 
to joining Poundland, James was Managing 
Director of Convenience at J Sainsbury plc and 
was a member of the company's operating, retail 
and investment boards.

Alan Rigby has spent the majority of his 
working career at HSBC plc, joining in 1975 and 
gaining broad experience through a range of 
management positions, including credit and risk, 
retail, commercial, large corporate and global 
banking markets.
Robbie Bell is the Chief Financial Officer of 
Welcome Break. Prior to that, he was the Chief 
Financial Officer of Screwfix, a subsidiary of 
Kingfisher plc. He was previously the UK Finance 
Director of Travelodge between 2006 and 
2008, having started his career at Whitbread plc 
before moving to Tesco plc.
Outlook & Market Environment
The Group operates primarily in the branded, 
value-focused consumer goods sector in the 
UK. Due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty 
and tougher trading conditions, retailers are 
generally exercising caution with regard to their 
non-food buying as we head towards the end 
of the calendar year. As a result, we are seeing 
retailers' reluctance to order too far forward 
and many are placing orders later or buying 
from stock. The lower volumes available to non-
food suppliers and retailers’ desire to minimise 
increases in retail prices is creating an even more 
competitive environment than normal. The Board 
therefore anticipates that revenue growth for FY 
18 is unlikely. In addition, approximately £4–5 m 
of FY 18's revenue will now be recognised in FY 
19 as a result of the move from FOB to landed 
arrangements with a key European customer. 
However, Ultimate Products is used to managing 
such challenging dynamics. Current trading is in 
line with expectations and the Board remains 
confident that the business will continue to 
deliver sustainable, long term growth. 
Summary
As one of the founders of the business, I am 
very proud of what Ultimate Products and its 
staff have achieved over this reporting period. 
To deliver such strong growth whilst at the same 
time adding a new and larger distribution centre, 
executing an IPO and maintaining an excellent 
service to our retailers shows what a high-
quality, flexible and resilient business Ultimate 
Products is.
In the short-term, this flexibility and resilience 
will be needed as UK retailers and consumers 
alike adapt to a new and more challenging 
environment. However, it should also be noted 
that in a market where people have less money 
to spend on general merchandise, we provide 
a compelling proposition to consumers and 
retailers alike – and we therefore continue to see 
substantial opportunities for the ongoing success 
of Ultimate Products.

Business Strategy
The Four Pillars to Growth
1. International: We are a global business, already selling into 36 countries 
worldwide and with 28 % of our revenues coming from international customers. 
We believe that our product offer of branded general merchandise at 
mass-market prices is compelling for consumers in other territories, just as 
much as it is in the UK. We are targeting large international retailers, normally 
on an FOB basis, with a current focus on Europe and Germany in particular.
2. Discounters: Branded products at mass-market prices are attractive 
to discount shoppers and a compelling proposition to discount retailers, 
where own-label products may not be an option. Discount is a fast growing 
segment of the UK and European retail market for general merchandise, led 
by operators such as B&M and Action. Our strategy is to increase listings with 
existing discount customers, benefit from their store expansion plans and 
open new European accounts in this sector.
3. UK supermarkets: We have long-standing trade relationships with all of 
the major UK supermarkets but our penetration to date has been relatively 
low. However, we believe that our branded products, competitively priced 
compared to the own-label equivalents, are very appealing to supermarket 
customers. We provide supermarket retailers with the same retail margin as 
their own-label equivalent, in addition to a more attractive proposition for 
their customers and plan to increase our penetration of the UK supermarkets 
by demonstrating the effectiveness of our product offer in-store through 
increased LFL sales.
4. Online channels:  Online now accounts for over 20 % of non-food retail 
sales in the UK. In FY 17, online channels only accounted for 4.2 % of our 
sales. We believe that there is significant opportunity for further growth 
through platforms such as Amazon and our objective is to grow this business 
to 20 % of revenue over the medium to long term. In addition, we believe that 
there may be further scope for growth via a roll out across Amazon’s other 
international platforms.

Revenue
The Group experienced strong revenue growth in FY 17, increasing by 
39.1 % to £110.0 m with above double-digit growth in all key product 
groups and brands. The revenue performance was driven by three main factors: 
growth in sales to discounters in the UK and in Europe (up 64.6 % to £63.8 m); 
increased sales from the main UK supermarkets (up 95.0 % to £10.3 
m); and the emergence of online platforms as a new revenue for the 
business (up 63.6 % to £4.6 m).

Focus on international expansion commenced during the second half of FY 17 and has therefore not 
had a significant impact on the FY 17 results. However, international sales grew by 48.2 % to £30.4 m 
and now represent 27.7 % of total sales (FY 16: 26.0 %), with UK sales growing by 35.9 % to £79.5 m 
(FY 16: £58.5 m).
Brands
The Group introduced its strategy to concentrate on offering branded, mass-market and value–led 
consumer goods in late 2013. Since then, the Group has seen its brands take an increasingly 
significant share of sales and this pattern continued in FY 17. A summary of the Premier Brands, 
representing 60.0 % of total revenue (FY 16: 55.4 %) is set out below:
  FY17 FY16 Growth 
  £’m £’m %
Beldray 30.8 19.1 +61.1 
Salter 16.0 12.1 +32.8 
Intempo 10.0 5.9 +72.1 
Russell Hobbs 8.5 6.7 +26.2 
Progress 0.6 0.0 N/A
 
  65.9 43.8 +50.6 
Of particular note in the Premier Brands segment is the addition of Progress, a brand of Lancastrian 
heritage. Since its acquisition in 2015, the initial focus has been on developing the product range 
and packaging primarily across the housewares and small domestic appliance product categories. 
The Directors are excited about the potential for the brand, which now has listings in a number of 
retailers including a major supermarket from January 2018.
Margins
Gross margin was 160 bps lower than 2016, influenced by two key factors: firstly FOB sales, which 
typically generate lower gross margin but require lower overheads to serve, increased from 60.2 % 
of sales to 67.6 % and secondly, gross margin on landed sales, whilst partially protected by existing 
hedging contracts, were impacted by cost pressures from the fall in the US$ exchange rate with GBP 
after the Brexit referendum. However, continued operating efficiency benefits and lower overhead 
growth, supported by the aforementioned lower overhead requirement for FOB, resulted in the 
Group increasing its underlying EBITDA margin by 10 bps to 10.5 %.

Overheads
Administration expenses excluding 
exceptional items and share based 
payment charges, substantially 
comprising wages and salary costs, 
increased by £2.5 m (22.6 %) to £13.4 m 
in FY 17 compared to the 39.1 % increase 
in revenue. As experienced with the 
revenue growth in recent years, in FY 
17 the Group continued to leverage 
its overhead resource to absorb 
growth with less than proportionate 
cost growth. This was achieved whilst 
absorbing the incremental impact of 
a full year’s property cost of the new 
Heron Mill distribution facility (FY 16: 3.5 
months) and the addition of plc related 
costs since the Group’s IPO in March.
Over the course of FY 17, the average 
number of employees increased by 41 
(or 22.7 %) of which 17 related to structural 
changes both in the UK warehouse and 
in the Far East, where new positions 
were created to replace third-party 
costs. Other headcount increases 
were in the core UK operations and 
the Group is particularly proud of its 
Graduate Development Scheme. This is 
the first port of call for most incremental 
positions and we are delighted with the 
progress we have made in developing 
and promoting staff from within the 
business, many of whom are recruited 
from the local Oldham area.
Exceptional Items and Share Based 
Payment Charges
Such costs include the non-recurring costs relating to 
the IPO of £1.1 m (FY 16: £nil), the legacy shareholder 
bonuses that ceased to accrue after 31 July 2017, being 
£2.0 m (FY 16: £1.2m), and the non-cash, share based 
payment expense relating to the Management Incentive 
Plan introduced immediately prior to the IPO, being 
£0.1 m (FY 16: £nil). They have been shown separately in 
the Income Statement to better reflect the performance 
of the underlying business. 
Interest
At £0.5 m, finance costs were at similar levels to 
FY 16, although interest paid was significantly lower as 
FY 16 cash flows included the payment of £2.0 m of 
accrued interest relating to loan notes that were fully 
repaid in FY 16.
Taxation
The effective underlying tax rate has reduced from 21.5 % 
to 21.1 % for FY 17 and this is in line with expectations, 
given the reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 
19 % with effect from 1 April 2017.

As explained in note 25 to the Financial Statements, the 2014 EMI Scheme share options were 
exercised immediately prior to the IPO. A statutory corporation tax deduction is created by the 
exercise of the EMI options, reducing the current and prior year tax liability by a total of £2.1 m. 
In accordance with IFRS 2, Accounting for Share based Payments, the £2.1 m tax credit has been 
credited directly to the Statement of Changes in Equity, rather than through the Income Statement. 
The impact of the deduction has been to reduce the £1.6 m UK corporation tax liability for the year 
to nil, with a further £0.5 m recoverable against the FY 16 liability previously paid.
Balance Sheet & Cash Flow
The Group’s balance sheet strengthened significantly over the year with net assets increasing by 
£5.6 m to £6.8 m. The key points to note regarding the balance sheet can be summarised as:
 ● The increase in non-current assets of £0.7 m was driven by capital expenditure on the refurbishment  
 of Heron Mill (£0.8 m in FY 17), which has now become the Group’s main distribution facility.
 ● Having over-proportionately increased inventories by 36.4 % in FY 16, the increase in FY 17 was 
 substantially lower than revenue growth at 4.9 %. This also reflects the higher mix of FOB sales,  
 where revenue is recognised as the goods are handed over to the customer in the country of  
 origin without being held in inventories prior to sale.
 ● Trade and other receivables reduced by £4.5 m (27.6 %) compared to FY 16 (£4.2 m relating to 
 trade receivables, driven by an exceptionally low level of debtor days at 31 July 2017 
 of 36, with the comparative 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2015 levels being 52 days and 50 days 
 respectively. The reduction was driven by a favourable customer mix of invoicing at the 
 end of FY 17. This is an exceptional movement that would be expected to reverse in FY 18.
 ● Trade and other payables are £3.9 m lower than last year, which included £2.25 m for the 
 interim FY 16 dividend declared but not paid at the end of FY 16. Additionally, trade payables 
 are £1.6 m lower than FY 16, as last year saw a significantly higher increase in inventories just 
 prior to the year end, with a corresponding increase to trade payables.
 ● Current tax is a £0.5 m debtor in FY 17 due to the EMI scheme corporation tax credit referred to  
 in the ‘taxation’ comments above.
The £4.2 m lower trade receivables, commented on earlier, provides a flattering, although exceptional 
impact on the net cash from operations that would be expected to reverse in FY 18. This favourable 
reduction, along with lower UK corporation tax payments (due to the EMI Scheme tax credit, creating 
a cash flow benefit of £0.8m in FY 17) and a £1.3 m increase in EBITDA, are reflected in the net cash 
from operations of £9.4 m, which is £5.7 m higher than last year.

Financing & Going Concern
The Group is financed by a suite of trade and revolving credit facilities provided by HSBC Bank plc, 
further information on which is provided in note 22 to the Financial Statements. Over the course of the 
year, the Group has operated well within the covenants to the banking facilities and has maintained 
comfortable levels of funding headroom, with headroom at 31 July 2017 in excess of £6 m. The Group’s 
projections show that the Group will be able to operate within its existing banking facilities and covenants. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and, as such, has applied the going concern principle in 
preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

18 Principal Risks & Uncertainties
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and for 
reviewing their effectiveness, supported by the Audit and Risk Committee. We review our business 
regularly to identify and document key business risks. Once identified, risks are assessed according 
to the likelihood and impact of the risk occurring and an appropriate mitigating response is 
determined. This risk mitigation plan is then regularly monitored.
The principal risks as determined by the Board are listed in the table below, together with 
corresponding mitigating actions. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risk and 
uncertainties that may arise.
Area Risk Mitigation
Macroeconomic 
factors
Macroeconomic trends 
affecting consumer 
confidence and 
depressing consumer 
non-food spending, in 
particular uncertainty 
regarding Brexit, could 
affect retail demand.
The Group sees the opportunity to increase 
market share by developing new customer 
relationships, particularly internationally, and 
from growth in online channels, mitigating the 
risk from macroeconomic factors affecting the 
overall market.
The Group’s products, being mass-market and 
value-led, are well-placed in the event of an 
economic downturn.
Margin dilution A tough retail 
environment, the impact 
of weakened Sterling 
(discussed below), and 
customer mix (large 
concentration on 
discounters) could put 
pressure on gross margin.
The Group mitigates this risk by a 
combination of margin-enhancing initiatives 
including monitoring profitability of individual 
product lines, continued product innovation 
and refreshing product ranges, balanced 
against the need to ensure that our products 
remain competitive. 
The Group’s strategy of growing international 
and online sales is expected to provide greater 
diversity and a balanced-margin portfolio.

Area Risk Mitigation
Loss of 
continuity of 
supply of goods 
for resale
The Group is heavily 
reliant on China as a 
source of products. 
Any deterioration in, or 
disruption to political, 
economic or social 
conditions in China could 
impact the Group’s sales 
and operating profits. 
Potential changes in 
Chinese law could 
impact margins.
The Group closely monitors developments 
in China and continues to consider and use 
alternative sources when practicable and viable.
Customer 
concentration
A large proportion of the 
Group’s turnover is derived 
from a small number of 
customers. Loss of a key 
customer could have an 
adverse impact on the 
Group’s turnover and 
operating profit.
The Group continues to develop relationships 
with other existing customers and target new 
customers, with specific focus on international 
and online sales, in order to widen its portfolio 
and spread risk.
In addition, in-store penetration of the Group‘s 
brands and products offer some commercial 
protection against customer loss.
Retention of 
competitive 
advantage 
through 
innovation
Failure to develop and 
enhance our product 
range and ensure that 
products continue to 
have resonance with 
consumers, or lack of 
awareness of trends and 
changes in consumer 
behaviour, could result 
in loss of our competitive 
advantage, which could 
impact on the Group’s 
turnover and margins.
A high level of new product development 
focus is maintained and monitored by the 
Board. Buying teams and senior management 
regularly attend trade shows and carry out 
store and factory visits to ensure that they are 
in touch with the latest consumer demands 
and trends. Strategic Report

Area Risk Mitigation
Brands Failure to renew or delays 
in renewing licences 
for key brands could 
impact turnover. Failure 
to develop or acquire 
new brands could restrict 
growth, given the Group’s 
brand-led strategy.
The risk of non-renewal is mitigated by 
maintaining strong revenues to and good 
working relationships with licensors.
Licences are negotiated for as long as possible 
and as early as possible, in order to provide 
greater certainty around future revenues.
The Group continues to develop a ‘second tier’ 
of brands and to look for potential new brands 
to acquire.
Stock 
management
Inability to efficiently 
manage stocks could 
adversely affect the 
business. Understocking 
could hold back online 
growth or customer call-
off, whilst overstocking 
could adversely affect 
working capital.
Stock levels and purchasing are closely 
managed, with all purchase orders being 
reviewed by senior management before 
being placed.
Stock is categorised between ‘free’ and 
(pre)‘sold’ to ensure that management focus 
on higher risk items. ‘Free’ stock is reviewed 
at Director level and prompt actions are taken 
where necessary.
Legal and 
regulatory
The Group may fail to 
comply with additional 
regulations arising as 
a result of its public 
status. The Group 
may have inadequate 
resources to manage the 
additional workload.
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
in March 2017 has strengthened the Group’s 
knowledge of regulatory and compliance 
issues, along with training provided to the 
Directors in preparation for the Group’s listing.
Issues are raised and discussed by the Audit 
and Risk Committee and external consulting 
resources are employed when necessary.
Human 
resources
The success of the 
Group is dependent 
upon the retention of 
key individuals and the 
recruitment of high-quality 
staff to develop and 
implement its strategies. 
The Group takes a number of steps to 
encourage the retention of its senior 
management, as set out in the 
Remuneration Report.
The Group’s Graduate Development Scheme 
provides a steady inflow of high-quality staff to 
support the future development of the Group.

Cyber attacks Cyber attacks are 
becoming increasingly 
common and have 
potential to cause 
business interruption, loss 
of key systems, loss of 
online sales or theft 
of data.
The Group continues to review and invest 
where appropriate in the development and 
maintenance of our IT infrastructure, systems 
and security. We have in place disaster 
recovery and business continuity plans.
Financial risks
The Group's operations 
expose it to a variety of 
financial risks that include 
the following:
 ● price risk; The Group continually monitors the price and 
availability of materials and labour but the costs 
of managing the exposure to price risk exceed 
any potential benefits given the extensive 
range of products and suppliers.
 ● foreign currency risk; The Group's exposure to foreign currency 
risk is partially hedged by virtue of invoicing 
a proportion of its turnover in US Dollars. In 
addition, the Group maintains a hedging policy 
and uses foreign exchange forward contracts 
to reduce the risk of volatility in revenue and 
cost of goods.
 ● credit risk; The Group's sales are primarily made with credit 
terms, exposing it to the risk of non-payment 
from customers. The Group has implemented 
policies that require credit checks on potential 
customers and the maintenance of appropriate 
credit limits. Trade receivable balances are 
vigilantly managed and prompt action taken 
on overdue accounts. In addition, the Group 
maintains a suitable level of credit insurance 
against its trade receivables book.

Viability Statement

In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Company over a three 
year period to July 2020, taking account 
of the Group’s current position and the 
Group’s principal risks, as detailed in 
the Strategic Report. Based upon this 
assessment, and the assumption of the 
banking facilities continuing as referred 
to below, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three year period to July 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
Group in severe but plausible scenarios, 
taking account of its current position 
and prospects, the principal risks facing 
the business, how these are managed 
and the impact that they would have 
on the forecast financial position. In 
assessing whether the Group could 
withstand such negative impacts, the 
Board has considered cash flow, impact 
on debt covenants and headroom 
against its current borrowing facilities 
over the three year period. In such a 
scenario, any return to shareholders 
would be reduced.
The Group is financed by bank facilities 
with HSBC which comprise a £6.2 m 
revolving credit facility (due for renewal 
on 22 July 2020), a £17 m invoice discounting facility 
(due for renewal on 24 June 2020) and ancillary to the 
revolving credit facility is a £6.5 m import loan facility 
which is repayable on demand and subject to annual 
renewal.  The Directors believe that appropriate banking 
facilities will be renewed sufficiently in advance of 
the 2020 renewal dates and also that, in the ordinary 
course of business, the import loan facility will continue 
throughout the period of the revolving credit facility.  In 
assessing the position and prospects of the Group over 
the period to 31 July 2020, the Directors have assumed 
that the banking facilities will continue to be available 
and will be renewed in advance of their expiry.
The following three principal risks were selected for 
enhanced stress testing: macroeconomic factors, 
margin dilution and customer concentration, with the 
adverse impacts reflected as reductions in revenue and 
gross margin. In the situations reviewed, the business 
remained robust, with sufficient funding and headroom 
and compliance with key covenants to remain in 
operation over the period reviewed. The Board 
considers that the long-term relationships it has with 
many of its customers and suppliers, together with its 
value-led branded consumer goods strategy, helps to 
protect the Group and gives it the resilience to withstand 
such scenarios materialising.
The Board selected the period of three years to 
31 July 2020 as an appropriate period for the Company’s 
viability statement, as management currently use three-
year forecasts as part of the business planning process 
and the current banking facilities run substantially until 
the end of the review period. Ultimate Products is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate behaviour and we 
recognise the importance of operating in 
a socially, ethically and environmentally 
responsible manner across every aspect of 
our operations.
We are committed to progressing our policies, 
procedures and systems across the Group, 
ensuring that we monitor and maintain all 
aspects of CSR that are relevant to the business. 
These include concern for employee health 
and safety, caring for the environment, ethical 
behaviour and ongoing community involvement.
We endeavour to maintain a productive and 
open line of communication with those affected 
by our business and who have an interest in our 
ongoing activities. This includes our customers, 
suppliers, employees and other key partners 
within our supply chain. Furthermore, we monitor 
supplier performance, audit our customer 
service systems and processes (through the ISO 
9001/2008 accreditation) and encourage open 
feedback from all employees across the Group.
The Board of Directors takes ultimate 
responsibility for CSR and is committed to 
developing and implementing effective and 
measurable policies. The Board believes that, 
to date, the activities of the Group have not 
presented any significant environmental risks.
Employees
The Group aims to attract, develop, retain and 
motivate highly-talented employees who can 
contribute within a dynamic business culture 
that promotes contribution and provides its 
people with the opportunity to succeed.
We are committed to creating an environment 
that fosters innovation and supports a culture 
of teamwork and partnership, all of which are 
crucial to Ultimate Products’ success. A variety 
of career paths, development schemes and staff 
recognition programmes are being developed 
to improve staff retention and maintain the 
growing talent pool.
Graduate & Apprenticeship 
Schemes
The Group’s Graduate Development Scheme 
continues to be highly successful in recruiting 
and developing talented graduates, through 
entry-level positions, across all of our key 
departments within the UK head office. 
This year it recruited its 100th graduate and 
the scheme continues to be the main driver 
for our recruitment strategies. Over 50 % of 
the current UK office workers have now come 
through the scheme.
This year also saw the introduction of an 
apprenticeship scheme, which provides further 
opportunities for young, talented individuals to 
join our dynamic working environment whilst 
meeting compliance with the government’s 
apprenticeship levy. So far, we have piloted the 
scheme with two apprentices and links are being 
formed with local educational establishments in 
order to develop the scheme further.

Other Initiatives & Policies
Our initiative to recruit employees from the 
local Oldham area continues to see positive 
progression. Over thirty of the employees 
recruited in the past year are from an ‘OL’ 
postcode, which is within close proximity to our 
UK head office site. This initiative continues to 
assist in building our employer brand locally, 
integrating ourselves within the local community 
and improving staff retention.
The development of future leaders is a key 
element of our succession planning, and 
leadership development is crucial to the future 
success of the business. These plans are 
regularly monitored, discussed and updated 
to align with the evolving leadership needs of 
the business and allow the business to grow. 
This year saw the introduction of a ‘Women in 
Leadership’ initiative, whereby female members 
of our senior management team mentor our 
future female leaders. Formal performance 
reviews are conducted, aligned with the key 
pillars of the business strategy and linked to the 
values of the business. 
The Group is committed to providing equal 
opportunities to all existing and prospective 
employees, without unlawful or unfair 
discrimination. Our equality and recruitment 
policies ensure that we attract and recruit 
people from all backgrounds.

Strategic Report 
Corporate Social Responsibility continued The Group’s modern slavery, anti-bribery and 
whistle-blowing policies have been developed 
to ensure that the Group’s business adheres 
to high ethical and legal practices, as well as 
to maintain standards of professionalism and 
integrity for all employees worldwide. The 
introduction of a new whistle-blowing hotline, 
which is monitored by the HR team, provides 
further opportunity for employees, customers, 
suppliers or other stakeholders to confidentially 
raise any concerns so that they can be 
thoroughly investigated.
Community
The Group seeks to make a positive difference 
by being an active contributor to the local 
communities within which it operates. The 
Group’s HR department, alongside the Charity 
Committee, continue to drive new initiatives 
that support local charities, local educational 
establishments and community groups located 
within a few miles of the Group’s office in 
Oldham, Greater Manchester.
Employees are very active with participating in 
fundraising and seeking out local good causes 
that the Group can help, support and make a 
difference to those that require it.
Over the course of the year, the Group has been 
involved in a variety of important local events 
and initiatives with the aim to support the local 
community. These include:
 ● Being a lead sponsor for the Oldham 
 Education Awards, which recognises 
 students who have performed well  
 academically within local educational 
 establishments at GCSE, A level and 
 degree level.
 ● Holding a locally organised event at Manor 
 Mill that celebrated the heritage of the 
 Oldham area and the importance of the mills 
 within the locality.
 ● Holding seminars and lectures at local  
 colleges on careers advice and effective 
 recruitment methods to assist students with 
  their careers.
 ● Attending the local community zone,  
 ‘Mahdlo’, to provide support and advice 
 for local young people, including job 
 opportunities via our apprenticeship scheme.
This year the Group raised £8,640 for 
Dr Kershaw’s Hospice, a local Oldham charity 
that provides care for terminally ill cancer 
patients. The Group’s Charity Committee raised 
the funds through numerous and varied activities 
that involved participation from the employees 
and engaging with local community events. The 
Group also separately raised funds that were 
donated to the victims of the 2017 Manchester 
bombing. There were no donations made to 
political parties.

Health & Safety
The Managing Director is the Director appointed 
by the Board to have responsibility for the 
health, safety and environmental performance 
of the Group. The Group health and safety 
policy places responsibility for the management 
of health and safety on the Group Human 
Resources (‘HR’) Director and HR department, 
who are supported by local external advisers, 
where necessary.
The Group HR Director works with the respective 
Heads of Departments and business units to 
ensure compliance with local statutory health 
and safety regulations, as well as Group policy. 
The HR department provides all employees 
with a written health and safety policy and the 
policy is also widely communicated through staff 
communal areas.
Independent external reviews and audits of the 
Group’s health and safety performance and 
policies are conducted annually, with the findings 
presented to the Board. Any recommendations 
arising from these reviews are implemented 
by members of the Senior Management Team 
and followed through at each relevant location. 
Regular health and safety inspections are carried 
out and necessary training provided, with a 
particular focus on our warehousing operations. 
Ongoing health and safety concerns and risk 
exposures are documented within monthly 
board packs and escalated to the Audit and Risk 
Committee, where relevant. This year there have 
been no incidents that have required reporting 
under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1993 
(RIDDOR), which further proves the Group’s 
commitment to maintaining employee safety.
Environmental
The Group is committed to reducing 
energy consumption and waste to support 
environmental and financial performance. The 
following initiatives have been implemented to 
support this aim:
 ● The installation of sensored LED lighting 
 throughout the newly opened Heron Mill  
 240,000 sq ft warehousing facility.
 ● The installation of energy-efficient external 
 lighting to both Manor Mill and Heron 
 Mill sites.
 ● The installation of UPVC windows throughout 
 the Heron Mill site, improving heat loss and 
 reducing requirements for heat management.
 ● The recycling via two of our suppliers 
 of waste paper, cardboard, pallet wrap 
 from our warehousing operations and all  
 redundant electrical appliances via 
 WEEE regulations. 
 ● The ‘QA grading’ initiative that recycles 
 returned and unwanted products into spare 
 parts that are then reused both internally and 
 externally to save costs and speed up 
 service time.
The Group continues to improve procedures 
around the recycling of commercial waste and 
strives to further improve on this next year.

28 Carbon Emissions Reporting
The greenhouse gas (GHG) statement below provides a summary of Ultimate Products’ 
greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions each year from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2017. It gives 
a summary of emissions from fuel combustion and the operation of our facilities, which include 
our offices, Fleet & Grey Fleet (Scope 1) and from our purchased electricity used during the 
year (Scope 2).
We have adopted the operational control approach, as defined in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), 2004. Therefore, emissions 
associated with our rented sites are not included in this statement as they are considered to be 
outside of our operational control. As this will be the first year we have submitted a GHG statement, 
the carbon data for 2016 has been utilised to create a baseline year for submissions going forward.
 ● Scope 1 covers activities owned or controlled by Ultimate Products that release emissions straight 
 into the atmosphere – gas boilers, vehicle operation, air conditioning etc.
 ● Scope 2 covers activities that are not owned or controlled by Ultimate Products but that create 
 emissions as a result of our activities – electricity consumption.

Chairman’s Introduction
I am pleased to present the Company’s first 
Corporate Governance Report. Since the 
Company’s IPO as a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange on 6 March 2017, it 
has been required to comply with the 2014 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), 
the Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules and the Companies 
Act 2006. As the Company is below the FTSE 
350, some provisions of the Code do not 
apply. However, the Company intends to apply 
best practice to maintain strong governance 
wherever possible.
As the Company pursues its strategy, corporate 
governance provides the framework for the 
Board to maintain an effective, controlled 
environment whilst monitoring and mitigating 
the risks faced along the journey.
This report sets out how the Company has 
adhered to the principles of the Code and how 
the provisions have been applied since 6 March 
2017 to 31 July 2017.
James McCarthy  
Chairman  
6 November 2017
Compliance with the Code
Prior to the IPO in March 2017, the Company was 
not required to comply with the Code, however, 
the Company’s history included a significant 
period of private equity ownership during which 
time, and continuing thereafter, governance has 
always been considered important to the control 
and management of the business. 
Since the IPO, to the date of this report, 
the Board of Directors, (the ‘Board’) has 
complied with all provisions of the Code apart 
from the following:  
B.6.1 requires an annual performance evaluation 
to be completed of the Board, its committees 
and its individual Directors and B.6.3 requires 
an annual performance evaluation of the 
Chairman. The Company has not undertaken 
such evaluations in the period from the IPO on 
6 March 2017 to the date of this report, as it is 
considered that it will be more appropriate to 
do this closer to the anniversary of the IPO. The 
evaluation of the Chairman will be carried out by 
the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, taking into 
account the views of the Executive Directors.
A copy of the Code is available at 
www.frc.org.uk.

The Board
In preparation for the IPO, appointments were made to the Board to provide an appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and constructive challenge, to bring together a 
leadership team with the responsibility for delivering the long-term success of the Company. The 
Board currently has 7 members, comprising of three Executive Directors, a Non-Executive Chairman, 
two independent Non-Executive Directors and one non-independent Non-Executive Director. 
Biographical details of the Directors are provided on pages 32 to 35.
The Executive Directors work solely for the Company and the Board considers that any other 
directorships held do not interfere with their responsibilities to the Company. Simon Showman, 
Andrew Gossage and Barry Franks are directors of Heron Mill Limited, with whom on 14 April 2016, 
the Group entered into a seven-year lease of the Group’s principal distribution facility at Heron 
Mill. After an initial rent-free year, the current annual rent is £285,000 per annum. In addition, on 11 
November 2016, the Group entered into a lease of the Group’s offices, showroom and secondary 
distribution facility at Manor Mill with Ultimate Apartments Pension Scheme, of which Barry Franks is 
a Trustee. How the Board deals with conflicts of interests is commented on below. Other than the 
leases of Heron Mill and Manor Mill noted above, there are no conflicts of interest with the other 
directorships of the Executive Directors.
The Chairman’s other significant interests have been disclosed to the Board along with changes 
arising since his appointment, being his appointment as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
Elect of Crawshaw Group plc on 26 April 2017. The Board are satisfied that other commitments of 
the Chairman, including the most recent appointment referred to above, and the other commitments 
of the Non-Executive Directors do not prevent them from devoting sufficient time to the Company.
The Board consider Alan Rigby and Robbie Bell to be independent for the purposes of the Code 
and are free to exercise independent judgement. The Board considers that, at the time of his 
appointment, the Chairman was independent for the purposes of the Code.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and there is a clear division of 
responsibilities between those roles. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and governance 
of the Board and ensures the effective engagement and contribution of all Non-Executive and 
Executive Directors. The Chairman also ensures that Board meetings are conducted with openness  Corporate Governance

and challenge. The Chief Executive Officer has 
responsibility for all commercial activities of 
the Company including product development, 
sourcing and customer relationships, whilst the 
Managing Director has responsibility for the 
operational elements including supply chain, 
quality assurance, ethical and social compliance, 
human resources and IT.
The Chairman maintains regular contact with 
the independent Non-Executive Directors to 
discuss and address any issues or concerns 
outside of formal Board meetings. The Chairman 
also provides support to the Executive Directors 
where required.
The senior independent Non-Executive 
Director, Alan Rigby, is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns that have not been 
resolved via the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or the other Executive 
Directors, or where communication through 
such channels would be inappropriate.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the Group, determines 
the strategic direction of the Group and reviews 
operating, financial and risk performance. There 
is a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board, including approval of the Group’s 
annual business plan, the Group’s strategy, 
acquisitions, capital expenditure projects above 
certain thresholds, the Financial Statements, 
the Company’s dividend policy, changes to 
the capital and structure, borrowing powers, 
appointments to the Board, legal actions 
brought by or against the Group above certain 
thresholds, and the scope of delegations to 
Board committees, subsidiary boards and the 
management committee. Responsibility for 
the development of strategy and operational 
management is delegated to the Executive 
Directors with the support of the Group’s 
Operating Board, which as at the date of this 
report includes the Executive Directors and 
seven senior managers.
Evaluation of Board Performance
As noted above, the Board has not yet completed 
its first evaluation of Board Performance but 
this will be carried out in advance of the first 
anniversary of the IPO and the evaluation will 
include the Board, the individual Directors and 
its committees.
Training and Development 
Newly appointed Directors receive a tailored 
induction to introduce them to the Company’s 
business, operations and governance 
arrangements. This has included tours to the 
Group’s offices, showroom and distribution 
facilities, corporate governance training, 
provision of strategic, financial, product and 
market information and meetings with members 
of the senior management team. 
38 Strategic Report
Corporate Governance
Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
The Company will provide any further training 
deemed necessary at the direction of the Board 
member, along with participation in strategic 
and other reviews to ensure that the Directors 
continually update their skills, knowledge and 
familiarity with the Group’s businesses.
The Directors are also able to take independent 
professional advice as deemed necessary to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively. All 
Directors have access to the advice and the 
services of the Company Secretary. The Non-
Executive Directors have access to senior 
management of the business.
Conflicts of Interest
The Articles allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
from time to time, subject to certain conditions. 
The Company has appropriate conflict 
authorisation procedures, whereby actual 
or potential conflicts are considered and 
authorisations sought as appropriate. 
On 11 November 2016, UP Global Sourcing UK 
Limited entered into a new seven-year lease for 
its offices, showroom and distribution facilities 
at Manor Mill at a current rent of £180,000 per 
annum. Barry Franks had disclosed an interest in 
the transaction and, therefore, excluded himself 
from the discussions and decision thereon. 
Having considered a third-party surveyor’s 
report and internal benchmarking information 
carried out on unconnected comparable 
locations, the Directors approved that UP Global 
Sourcing UK Limited enter into the lease.
The Board has formally delegated specific 
responsibilities for audit, risk management 
and financial control, Board composition and 
remuneration to various committees, namely 
the Audit and Risk Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee. These 
Committees are all chaired by the Chairman or an 
independent Non Executive Director, enabling 
them to take an active role in influencing and 
challenging the work of the Executive Directors 
and senior management team. Details of the 
composition, responsibilities and activities of 
these Committees, are set out below. 
The Terms of Reference of the committees 
of the Board were approved by the Board in 
preparation for the IPO and are available on the 
Company’s website, www.upgs.com. The Terms 
of Reference of each of the committees will be 
reviewed at least annually.

reviewing and monitoring: the integrity of the 
financial information provided to shareholders, 
the Company’s system of internal controls and

process and auditors, and the processes for 
compliance with laws, regulations and ethical 
codes of practice. The Audit and Risk Committee 
is chaired by Robbie Bell and its other members 
are James McCarthy and Alan Rigby.

identifying potential candidates to be appointed 
as a Director or Committee member and makes 
appropriate recommendations to the Board. 
The Nomination Committee is chaired by James 
McCarthy and its other members are Alan Rigby, 
Robbie Bell and Barry Franks. 
As at the date of this report, there have been 
no changes to the Board in the period since the 
Company’s IPO.

is important when considering the composition 
of the Board. It is the Company’s aim to have 
the appropriate level of diversity on the Board 
to reflect the diverse nature of the Company’s 
operations and provide a wider perspective 
to decision making. We remain committed 
to ensuring recruitment and promotion of 
individuals throughout the Group, including 
those at Board and senior management level, 
always considering relevant skills, experience, 
knowledge, ability, gender and ethnicity. More 
information on the Company’s gender profile is 
included in Corporate and Social Responsibility 
on page 26.
The Nomination Committee is required, in 
accordance with its terms of reference, to 
meet at least once per year. The Nomination 
Committee did not meet in the period since 
the IPO to the year end, however, it held its first 
meeting after the year end and determined that 
the initial priority will be to assist the Chairman 
to conduct and review the results of the annual 
evaluation of Board performance.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee assists the 
Board in fulfilling its responsibility to ensure 
that the remuneration policy and practices of 
the Company are fair, responsible, linked to 
performance and have regard to statutory and

Committee is chaired by Alan Rigby and its other 
members are James McCarthy and Robbie Bell. Strategic Report

Committee Report
Introduction
The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board 
in discharging its responsibilities with regard 
to financial reporting, internal controls and risk 
management and the external and internal 
audits including reviewing and monitoring 
the integrity of the Group’s annual and 
half-yearly Financial Statements. The Company 
has maintained its positive approach to 
governance, which was established during its 
period of private equity ownership. 
In the period since the IPO, the Audit and 
Risk Committee has been assisting the 
Board with transitioning from a private 
company financial reporting and control 
environment to a premium listed company 
environment.
Governance
The Audit and Risk Committee and its Terms 
of Reference were established just prior to the 
IPO. The Audit and Risk Committee comprises 
the two Non-Executive Directors, Robbie Bell 
and Alan Rigby along with the Company’s 
chairman, James McCarthy, who was considered 
independent on his appointment. The Board 
is satisfied that Robbie Bell has recent and 
relevant financial experience as required by 
provision C.3.1 of the Code. The Board has 
determined that the current composition of 
the Audit and Risk Committee as a whole 
has competence relevant to the sector in which 
the Company operates. Biographical details 
relating to each of the Audit and Risk Committee  
members are shown on pages 32 to 35.
The Audit and Risk Committee has met three 
times in the period from the IPO to 31 July 2017 
and further meetings have been held since the 
year end. The meetings are attended by all of 
the Audit and Risk Committee members and, 
by invitation, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Managing Director and other senior employees 
of the Group, along with representatives from 
the external auditors. In addition, the Audit and 
Risk Committee  has also met with the external 
auditor without the Executive Directors present.

the IPO, the Audit and Risk Committee has been 
assisting the Board with transitioning from a private 
company financial reporting and control environment

 ● commenced a robust assessment of the 
 principal risks facing the Group, and the 
 formation of a process to review the  
 appropriate risk mitigation approach; 
 ● considered the Group’s procedures 
 regarding the Modern Slavery Act and

 had previously been reported as part of 
 both distribution costs and administrative  
 expenses; and
 ● commenced a review and assessment  
 of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
 control systems.
At the request of the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee also considered whether the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2017, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. Following enquiry into, and discussion of 
management’s processes in this regard along with consideration of the draft Annual Report and 
Accounts, the Audit and Risk Committee  recommended to the Board that it could make the required 
disclosure as set out in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement on pages 90 and 91.
Significant Issues
The significant matters and key accounting judgements considered by the Audit and Risk Committee  
during the year were:
Significant issues How the issue was addressed
Revenue recognition
As revenue recognition is a key 
accounting topic and given this was the 
first year as a listed business, the Audit 
and Risk Committee  required comfort that 
the Group’s revenue recognition policy 
was appropriate.
Management provided the Audit and Risk 
Committee  with the revenue recognition policy 
of the Group for each material revenue stream. 
The Audit and Risk Committee  were satisfied 
upon detailed discussion that the policy was 
both appropriate and contained the relevant 
internal controls.

Significant issues How the issue was addressed
Customer rebates and discounts  
(‘Rebates’)
Accounting for Rebates requires 
judgement to be applied in determining 
the level of provision at the year end to 
be deducted from revenue. Judgement 
is required as there are not always formal 
agreements in place and customer 
agreements are often not coterminous 
with the Group’s year end, such that 
estimation of the Rebate due is required.
 
The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed and 
challenged management on the approach taken 
to determining the level of provision required for 
Rebates. Having also liaised with the external 
auditors, the Audit and Risk Committee is satisfied 
with the approach taken and the level of provision 
included within the Financial Statements.
Inventory valuation
Inventory is a significant asset on the 
balance sheet and contains a significant 
element of ‘free stock’ (i.e. not held 
specifically against customer orders or 
call-off demand forecasts). The stock 
provision is complex and requires a 
substantial level of judgement.
Management have confirmed that the approach 
taken to the inventory provision is both 
consistently applied and based upon system data 
and management’s best estimates given their 
knowledge of the business. Management have 
agreed to document the inventory provisioning 
policy and to provide summary information to 
the Audit and Risk Committee at the end of each 
external reporting period.
Review of Risk Management & Internal Financial Controls
The Audit and Risk Committee has commenced a robust assessment of the principal risks faced 
by the business and the mitigating factors in force, along with an in-depth review of the internal 
financial controls.
At the time of writing the report, the assessment of the principal risks and mitigating factors had 
been substantially completed. The assessment process included meetings with Executive and Non-
Executive Directors alongside members of the senior management team to consider the risks faced 
by the business, along with the existing mitigating factors in place.

Corporate Governance
Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
The impact and likelihood of the 
risks were assessed by the Audit 
and Risk Committee to arrive at 
the principal risks. The Audit and Risk Committee 
are now in the process of finalising the next 
steps and recommendations for further actions 
to be taken by the Group. At the time of writing, 
a number of actions have been identified 
including carrying out a strategic review to 
consider how mitigation of the principal risks 
can be managed through development of the 
Group's strategy. As part of the risk management 
framework, the report on principal risks will 
be maintained and reviewed regularly. The 
principal risks and uncertainties of the Group 
and their mitigation are included on pages 
19 to 23 and the crystallisation of these risks has 
been considered in the Viability Statement on 
page 24 and the 
Going Concern assessment on page 87. As part 
of the overall review of internal financial controls, 
the Audit and Risk Committee  has identified 
nine key cycles and processes and has planned 
and prioritised their review and assessment. 
Additionally, the Audit and Risk Committee has 
reviewed the Board Memorandum on Financial 
Position and Prospects Procedures (the ‘FPPP 
Memorandum’). The FPPP Memorandum was 
prepared in preparation for the IPO to enable 
the Directors to confirm that procedures were 
established for them to make proper judgments 
on an ongoing basis as to the financial position 
and prospects of the Company and its Group 
(the ‘FPP’).

The Group’s financial reporting process is 
underpinned by the established system of internal 
financial controls and review procedures that form 
part of the monthly Group reporting process.

The FPPP Memorandum identified risks to 
the FPP, mitigating factors and ensured that 
processes for reporting matters to the Board were 
established and included specific consideration 
of the reporting process and environment.
The Group’s financial reporting process 
is underpinned by the established system 
of internal financial controls and review 
procedures that form part of the monthly 
Group reporting process. The procedures 
are well established and incorporate a 
thorough review of performance supported by 
appropriate segregation of duties and defined 
approval processes to minimise the risk 
of misappropriation.
The Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems have been in place throughout 
the financial year and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
The Audit and Risk Committee is satisfied that, at 
least since the Group’s IPO and the requirement 
to comply with the Code, the internal financial 
controls have operated effectively for the period 
under review and to the date of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements.
Internal Audit
The Group does not have an internal audit 
function. In the period to the date of this report, 
the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the 
first results of the internal control review and 
is comfortable that the control environment is 
sufficient for the size of the Company. In the 
coming year, the Audit and Risk Committee  
expects to complete the review on internal 
controls and will form a view as to whether 
the Group’s size and activities are such that an 
internal audit function should be established 
and, if so, determine its remit and make a 
recommendation to the Board.
External Audit
BDO LLP has been the Group’s auditor 
since 2016 and the senior statutory auditor 
is Gary Harding, who has been in place since 
November 2016. The Audit and Risk Committee  
considers that the auditor’s knowledge of the 
Group’s business and systems gained through 
experience has contributed to the effectiveness 
of the audit process. 
The Audit and Risk Committee  intends to comply 
fully with the FRC Audit and Risk Committee  
Guidance regarding the frequency of audit 
tender and there is currently no plan to tender 
the audit for the year ending 31 July 2018. 
The independence and objectivity of the auditor 
is regularly considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee taking into consideration relevant 
UK professional and regulatory requirements. 
The Audit and Risk Committee  reviews an 
annual statement from the auditor detailing 
their independence policies and safeguards 
and confirming their independence, taking into 
account relevant ethical guidance regarding the 
48 provision of non audit services by the external auditor. The Audit and Risk Committee  has considered 
and approved the terms of engagement and fees of the external auditor for the year ended 
31 July 2017. Audit fees payable by the Group to BDO LLP and it's international network in the year 
ended 31 July 2017 totalled £59,000 (2016: £29,000). The increase in fees is due to additional 
work involved in auditing a premium listed company. There were no contingent fee arrangements.
The Audit and Risk Committee  reviewed the level of non audit services and fees provided by BDO 
LLP. For the year ended 31 July 2017, these totalled £185,000 of which £175,000 was in respect of 
the work associated with the IPO and £10,000 for audit related assurance services in respect of 
the interim report. There have been no significant non audit services provided by BDO LLP since 
the IPO. The ratio of audit fees to non audit fees for the year ended 31 July 2017 is 1:3.1. If the fees 
associated with the IPO were excluded, this ratio becomes 5.9:1. The Audit and Risk Committee  is 
required to consider and review the effectiveness of the external audit on an annual basis and report 
its findings and recommendations to the Board. This review will be performed during the coming 
year. The Audit and Risk Committee recommends that a resolution for the re-appointment of BDO 
LLP as the Company’s auditor should be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

Introduction
As Chair of the Remuneration Committee and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am delighted to 
present our report on remuneration for FY 17. 
The first part of this report contains our proposed Remuneration Policy which, if approved by 
shareholders, will take effect from the date of the 2017 AGM. The second part describes 
the remuneration of Directors in 2017. The report complies with the relevant provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulation 2008 (as amended). The report has also been 
prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules, as well as with due consideration 
to guidance provided by investors including the Investment Association’s Principles 
 of Remuneration.
Following the Group’s listing on 6 March 2017, this represents 
our first report on remuneration. I would like to take the 
opportunity to thank our shareholders for the role that they 
have played in helping the Remuneration Committee  to 
design our Remuneration Policy, as their comments and 
feedback have proved invaluable in ensuring that the Policy is 
aligned with the interests of shareholders and the interests of 
the Group as a whole. I would also like to thank my colleagues 
on the Remuneration Committee, James McCarthy and Robbie 
Bell, who have each devoted a significant amount of time 
and shown dedication in their role.

Our Approach to Remuneration
As set out more in depth in the proposed 
Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration 
Committee’s approach to remuneration is based 
upon offering a competitive, but not excessive, 
reward package for Executive Directors that 
aligns their pay with the strategy of the Group.
We seek to encourage, incentivise and motivate 
those behaviours that we believe will deliver 
long-term success for the Group and strong 
returns for its shareholders. Our remuneration 
framework seeks to adopt best practice and 
comply with all laws and corporate governance 
regulations, putting the Group on a firm footing 
for long-term growth and progression.
Context & Key 
Remuneration Committee  
Decisions on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee  believes that the 
Executive Directors have shown considerable 
skill and sound judgement in the decisions 
that they have made whilst Ultimate Products 
has transitioned to life as a listed company. 
The Remuneration Committee notes the 
determination shown by the Executive Directors 
in running the Group in the best interests of all 
shareholders and other stakeholders, and in 
prioritising long-term, sustainable, profitable 
growth by execution of the Group’s strategy. 
The period since the IPO has seen robust 
progress from the Group, in a number of key 
areas, in what remains a challenging environment. 
In the context of the above, the Remuneration 
Committee has sought to implement a 
Remuneration Policy that equips the Group to 
retain and, where necessary, recruit the calibre 
of Executive Directors necessary to support its 
ambitious long-term strategy.
In particular, the Remuneration Committee  
proposes to implement:
 ● an annual bonus plan (‘ABP’) with stretching 
 targets based primarily upon EBITDA and  
 with additional targets based upon individual 
 and strategic goals (subject to an EBITDA 
 underpin which, if not achieved, permits no 
  payment under the ABP); and
 ● a performance share plan (‘PSP’) with 
 performance targets based upon EPS growth 
 (50 %), other financial targets (25 %) and 
 strategic or individual objectives (25 %).
In line with comparable companies, the 
Remuneration Committee  proposes that under 
the Remuneration Policy: 
 ● the maximum bonus payable in the ABP will  
 be 125 % of base salary in the case of the  
 Chief Executive Officer and Managing  
 Director and 100 % of base salary in the case 
 of any other Executive Director; and
 ● the maximum award opportunity under the 
 PSP will be over shares with a market value 
 at grant of 100 % of base salary.

As, in connection with the Initial Public Offering, awards were made to Executive Directors under 
the Management Incentive Plan in March 2017, no awards will be made under the PSP prior to 
1 August 2018.
The Remuneration Committee  recognises the considerable depth of talent within the Group beneath 
the Executive Directors and, working with the HR Director, intends to actively consider extending 
participation in the PSP to this wider group of senior leaders within the business, in time for the first 
round of awards in August 2018. 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries of all Executive Directors during the 
period following listing and determined that no increases were required.
The Remuneration Committee remains fully committed to an open and honest dialogue with our 
shareholders and we welcome your views on any aspects of remuneration at any time.

Remuneration Policy
1. Introduction
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc’s Remuneration Policy is intended to enable the Group to attract, 
retain and motivate the Executive Directors and other senior executives necessary to achieve 
the Group’s annual goals and long-term strategy and deliver sustainable shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that: 
 ● individuals should be properly rewarded where justified by the Group’s financial 
 performance and their personal contribution; 
 ● the Group should pay no more than is necessary on remuneration;
 ● remuneration packages should be constructed so as to include stretching performance 
 objectives linked to the long-term success and strategy of the Group; and 
 ● remuneration structures should discourage the taking of excessive risk that is not aligned  
 with the long-term interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Policy has been designed to comply with the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended) and the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules. Due consideration has also been given 
to the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and to guidance provided by 
investors including the Investment Association’s Principles of Remuneration.
Subject to shareholder approval, this Remuneration Policy will take effect from the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting and is intended to remain in place for three years. Once the Remuneration Policy 
is approved, the Group will only make remuneration payments to current or prospective Directors, or 
payments for loss of office if the payment is in line with the Remuneration Policy. If the Remuneration 
Committee  wishes to change the Policy within this period, or is required to do so, it will submit a 
revised Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval.

2. Summary of Components of 
 Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Fixed Remuneration: Salary
Element, purpose 
and link to strategy
To provide an appropriate amount of basic fixed income to enable 
the recruitment and retention of individuals who can facilitate the 
achievement of the Group’s strategy.
Operation The Remuneration Committee reviews base salaries on an annual 
basis, taking into account:
 ● absolute and relative Group profitability;
 ● any changes to the scope of each role and its responsibilities;
 ● any changes to the size and complexity of the Group;
 ● salaries in comparable organisations;
 ● pay increases elsewhere in the Group; and
 ● the impact of any increases to base salary on the total 
 remuneration package.
Maximum 
opportunity
The Remuneration Committee has set no overall maximum on salary 
increases, as it believes that this creates an anchoring effect for 
Executive Directors and other employees.
In most circumstances, salary increases for Executive Directors will 
not exceed the average increase awarded to other employees in the 
Group. Increases above this level will only be granted in exceptional 
circumstances including (without limitation):
 ● a material increase to the responsibilities attaching to a role;
 ● a material increase in the scope of a role;
 ● a promotion to a different role;
 ● where a salary has fallen out of step with market norms; or
 ● where an Executive Director has been recruited on a below-market  
 salary and the Remuneration Committee  is gradually transitioning  
 that person to a market rate.
Performance 
measures
None, although the Remuneration Committee takes into account 
individual performance, skills and experience when setting and 
reviewing salaries.

2. Summary of Components of 
 Executive Directors’ Remuneration continued
Fixed Remuneration: Benefits
Element, purpose 
and link to strategy
To provide market-competitive and cost-effective benefits to attract and 
retain suitable Executive Directors and where appropriate, assist an 
Executive Director in the performance of his or her duties.
Operation The Group provides a range of benefits to its Executive Directors in line 
with market norms. These currently include the provision of a company 
car (or a car allowance), sick pay and private medical insurance for 
the Executive Director and his or her spouse and dependent children. 
Other than in respect of the Chief Executive Officer, for whom a life 
assurance policy is provided, the Group does not currently provide 
life assurance or permanent health insurance to Executive Directors. 
However, the Remuneration Committee notes that the provision of such 
benefits is common at comparable companies and if the Remuneration 
Committee in future determines that such provision is necessary 
to attract or retain suitable Executive Directors, then it may elect to 
provide these to one or more of the Executive Directors.
The Group reimburses reasonable work-related expenses to Executive 
Directors, such as business travel and subsistence whilst on work trips.
Any additional benefits provided to Executive Directors are reviewed 
by the Remuneration Committee and approved only if reasonable, in 
line with good market practice and obtainable at a proportionate cost.
For Executive Directors based outside of the UK, the Remuneration 
Committee may consider providing additional allowances where this is 
in line with local market practice and expectations and is necessary in 
order to recruit or retain suitably skilled individuals.
Maximum 
opportunity
The maximum opportunity will depend upon the cost of providing the 
relevant benefits and individual’s personal circumstances. 
The Remuneration Committee has full regard to the cost of providing 
any benefits and is committed to only providing benefits that are in line 
with market practice, cost-effective for the Group and appropriate to the 
requirements of a specific role or individual.
Performance 
measures
None.

2. Summary of Components of 
 Executive Directors’ Remuneration continued
Fixed Remuneration: Retirement Provision
Element, purpose 
and link to 
strategy
To provide an income for Executive Directors in their retirement and enable 
the Group to recruit and retain suitable individuals by aligning their overall 
package with those offered by competitors for talent.
Operation The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan in which 
the Executive Directors are eligible to participate and may provide 
contributions to the Executive Directors’ personal pension arrangements 
or a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions.
Maximum 
opportunity
The Executive Directors currently receive 12 % of salary as a contribution 
to their pension arrangements (or as an equivalent cash allowance). 
The Remuneration Committee notes market practice in this area 
and recognises that this level of contribution may at some stage become 
insufficient to recruit or retain the individuals required to implement its 
strategy and, although it has no current plans to increase the levels of 
contributions, the Remuneration Committee  reserves the right to increase 
this to a level of no more than 20 % of salary under this Remuneration 
Policy should this be considered necessary and proportionate.
Performance 
measures
None.
Variable Remuneration: Annual Bonus Plan
Element, purpose 
and link to strategy
To incentivise Executive Directors to deliver the Group’s corporate 
strategy by focusing on annual goals that are consistent with 
longer-term strategic objectives and rewarding the delivery of 
exceptional performance.

UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
2. Summary of Components of 
 Executive Directors’ Remuneration continued
Operation Annual bonus targets are reviewed and set on an annual basis to ensure 
that they: 
 ● align with the Group’s long-term strategy; 
 ● are focused on the Group’s immediate strategic priorities;
 ● are appropriate given broader market conditions; and 
 ● remain stretching.
Pay-out levels are determined by the Remuneration Committee after the 
year-end, based upon a rigorous assessment of performance against 
the targets.
To further align the interests of Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders, bonuses will be paid 70 % in cash, with 30 % deferred into 
shares that vest in three equal tranches after one, two and three years. 
To hedge against share price increases and avoid dilution, the deferred 
element of the bonus is used to purchase shares in the market; these 
are then held by an employee benefit trust until vesting. The value of 
any dividends during the deferral period will be payable to the Executive 
Directors upon vesting.
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may 
determine that the deferred element of the bonus is to be held as cash 
rather than shares, where the Remuneration Committee considers that 
such alternative arrangements would be in the best interests of the 
Group and its shareholders, for example, if the acquisition of further 
shares by an Executive Director would trigger a mandatory offer under 
Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of the performance period 
and to shares or cash held under the deferral arrangements, allowing 
the Remuneration Committee to reduce to zero any unvested or 
deferred awards.
Clawback provisions apply to cash amounts paid and shares or cash 
released for three years following payment or release (as the case may 
be), allowing the Remuneration Committee to claim back all or part of any 
amount paid or released.

2. Summary of Components of

Maximum 
opportunity
The maximum annual bonus opportunity that can be earned for any 
year is capped at 125 % of base salary in the case of the Chief Executive 
Officer and Managing Director and 100 % of base salary in the case of 
any other Executive Director.
Performance 
measures
An annual bonus opportunity of up to: 
 ● 100 % of base salary in the case of the Chief Executive Officer 
      and Managing Director; and
 ● 75 % in the case of any other Executive Director,
may be granted by the Remuneration Committee, such bonus to be 
conditional upon the achievement of an EBITDA-based target 
and such other financial target (if any) as the Remuneration 
Committee considers appropriate (subject always to an EBITDA underpin). 
An annual bonus opportunity of up to a further 25 % of base salary may 
be granted by the Remuneration Committee, such bonus to be conditional 
upon the achievement of stretching, specific and measurable strategic 
and/or individual objectives.
Irrespective of the achievement of the strategic and/or personal targets, 
no part of the bonus shall be payable unless a threshold level of the 
EBITDA-based target is achieved.
Achievement of the maximum level of vesting will require significant 
financial out-performance above the budget set for the year, with full 
vesting requiring performance 30 % above target EBITDA levels.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that, given the 
commercial sensitivity of the detailed performance measures used for 
the annual bonus plan, disclosing precise targets in advance would not 
generally be in the interests of the Group or its shareholders. Actual 
targets, performance levels achieved and the resulting payments made 
will therefore be disclosed, in most circumstances, retrospectively at the 
end of the performance period.

     accounts of the Group being adjusted; or

Variable Remuneration: Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Element, purpose 
and link to strategy
To incentivise Executive Directors to focus on the long-term strategic 
objectives of the Group and to deliver sustainable shareholder value, 
aligning their interests with the interests of shareholders.
Operation Awards may be granted annually under the PSP and will consist of rights 
over shares, calculated as a percentage of base salary.
Vesting is subject to the Group’s performance, measured over three 
years and is followed by a holding period in respect of 40 % of the vested 
shares, of which one half are released after a one-year holding period 
and one half after a two-year holding period.
Any shares purchased to satisfy PSP awards will be held by an employee 
benefit trust until vesting.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the shares that vest.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of the performance period and 
shares held under the deferral arrangements, allowing the Remuneration 
Committee  to reduce to zero any unvested or deferred awards.
Clawback provisions apply until two years after the date upon which 
any entitlement becomes unconditional, allowing the Remuneration 
Committee  to claim back all or part of the value of any shares vested.

Variable Remuneration: Performance Share Plan (PSP) continued
Operation continued Awards may be structured as nil cost options, conditional awards of 
shares or may be delivered through a joint share ownership plan structure, 
as the Remuneration Committee considers being most appropriate in the 
circumstances.
The principal terms of the PSP will be submitted for shareholder approval 
at the 2017 AGM.
Senior employees who are not Executive Directors may be invited to 
participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Board.
Maximum 
opportunity
The maximum PSP award opportunity per Executive Director, in respect 
of any financial year, is limited to rights over shares with a market value 
at grant of 100 % of base salary.
No Executive Director granted an award under the MIP (see below) may 
be granted an award under the PSP prior to 1 August 2018.
Performance 
measures
The vesting of all awards made under the PSP is dependent upon 
performance conditions based upon:
 ● EPS growth (50 % weighting);
 ● gross profit margin (15 % weighting);
 ● leverage (net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio) (10 % weighting); and
 ● a maximum of two strategic or individual objectives (25 % weighting).
The Remuneration Committee  believes the chosen metrics are suitably 
aligned with the Group’s strategy and are focused on delivering long-
term growth and shareholder return.
25 % of an award vests for threshold performance. 100 % of an award 
vests for stretch performance. For performance between the threshold 
and maximum, an award vests on a straight-line basis.
The Remuneration Committee  is of the opinion that, given the commercial 
sensitivity of the detailed performance measures used for the PSP, 
disclosing precise targets for those conditions would often not be in the 
interests of the Group or its shareholders.

Actual targets, performance levels achieved and the resulting payments

the performance period, unless the Remuneration Committee considers 
that any particular targets are not commercially sensitive.

following scenarios:
 ● if the assessment of any performance condition was based upon 
     error or inaccurate or misleading information;

      fraud or gross misconduct.
Variable Remuneration: Management Incentive Plan (MIP) 
 – (Existing Awards)
Element, purpose 
and link to strategy
To reward and incentivise key employees through the IPO process and 
motivate them to deliver successful post-IPO performance for investors.
Operation Awards under the MIP were made to the Executive Directors and 
other senior executives immediately prior to the IPO, as disclosed in 
the IPO prospectus.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the MIP awards 
were an appropriate arrangement for the Group at the time of the IPO 
but the MIP is not an optimal arrangement for ongoing use and as 
such, no further awards will be made under the MIP.
The awards made under the MIP will vest in 2020, with the first round 
of awards made under the PSP then vesting in 2021 (with a proportion 
of the shares subject to a holding period until 2022 and 2023). 
The Remuneration Committee believes that this timetable of staged 
vesting ensures continued incentivisation of Executive Directors and 
will aid retention after the MIP awards vest.

remuneration of Executive Directors pursuant 
to the Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration 
Committee has and will continue to take into 
account the remuneration of employees across 
the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee and Executive 
Directors believe that the success of the Group 
in meeting its strategic objectives is highly 
dependent upon the talents and performance of 
the Group’s wider employee base. The Group 
regularly reviews the remuneration of Group 
employees in a process led by the HR Director. 
In line with the policy of the Remuneration 
Committee  towards the Executive Directors, 
the Group’s policy is to set competitive pay 
levels that allow the Group to attract and retain 
the talent necessary to thrive, without paying 
more than is necessary in the markets in which 
it operates.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee does not 
have a formal process for directly consulting 
employees on the remuneration of Executive 
Directors, it does take full account of the pay, 
benefits and employment conditions of the 
wider workforce when setting the remuneration 
of Executive Directors. In particular, the 
Remuneration Committee has determined 
that in most circumstances, salary increases 
for Executive Directors should not exceed the 
average increase awarded to other employees 
in the Group. Increases above this level will only 
be granted in exceptional circumstances as set 
out in the policy table under Fixed Remuneration: 
Salary above.
4. Statement of Consideration of 
Shareholders’ Views
The Remuneration Committee  actively welcomes 
the input of shareholders in respect of its 
remuneration policies and decisions and is 
committed to engaging in an open and 
transparent dialogue with shareholders in 
relation to executive remuneration.
In developing the proposed Remuneration 
Policy, the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee sought the views and input of 
the Group’s key shareholders and their 
representative bodies. The Remuneration 
Committee considered all views expressed 
by shareholders in refining and developing 
the Remuneration Policy and will continue to 
engage with shareholders in the year ahead.

During the consultation process, shareholders 
expressed a strong preference for the 
Remuneration Committee to demonstrate 
transparency in all aspects of the operation 
of the Remuneration Policy, including the 
determination and assessment of performance 
conditions. The Remuneration Committee 
agrees that such transparency is a legitimate 
interest of shareholders, and intends to provide 
maximum disclosure in all circumstances 
except where such disclosure would materially 
prejudice the interests of the Group.
As a recently listed company, Ultimate Products 
wishes to build a long-term, two-way relationship 
with its investors and will consider their views 
in all areas of its business, including on the 
remuneration of its key employees.
5. Recruitment Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee will determine the remuneration of new Executive Directors in 
accordance with this Remuneration Policy, taking into account the individual’s skills, experience and 
current remuneration package, together with the responsibilities attaching to the role concerned.
Where the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate to offer a below-market salary initially, 
for example where a recruit’s current remuneration package is considerably below the market norm 
for the role that they are being recruited to perform, a series of planned above-inflation, annual 
increases to reach a market salary may be used. Such increases may be made subject to Group and 
individual performance.
In some circumstances, to recruit individuals of an appropriate calibre, it may be necessary to buyout 
their variable remuneration arrangements, which would be forfeited due to leaving their previous 
employment. Where this is done, the Remuneration Committee  will take into account the form of any 
such award, any performance conditions attaching to it (including the likelihood of such performance 
conditions being achieved) and the period of vesting. 
Any buyout payments made will generally seek to reflect the structure and level of the award it 
replaces, as far as reasonably practicable. The Remuneration Committee will pay no more than is 
necessary to compensate such individuals for the awards they will be losing, taking into account 
anticipated vesting levels. The Remuneration Committee  would normally impose clawback provisions 
on such recruitment awards made to Executive Directors, activated should such individual resign or 
be summarily dismissed within two years of joining the Group. Shareholders will be informed of any 
such payments at the time of recruitment along with the reasons for making such payments.
annual report and accounts 2017
65 Corporate Governance 
Remuneration Committee Report continued
ULTIMATE 
PRODUCTS
www.upgs.com
The maximum level of annual variable pay, which may be awarded to a new Executive Director, will 
be in line with the maximum amounts specified in the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP, as set out in the 
above, being a total of 225 % of salary. For the avoidance of doubt, this excludes the value of any 
buyout payments associated with forfeited awards.
The Remuneration Committee  may approve the meeting of an Executive Director’s reasonable 
and proportionate relocation expenses where this is considered appropriate in all 
the circumstances.
Where an Executive Director is recruited partway through a financial year, the individual may be 
invited to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan on a pro-rated basis in that first year and may be 
offered ‘in-flight’ PSP awards pro-rated on a suitable basis.
For the recruitment of an Executive Director in a non-UK jurisdiction, the Remuneration Committee  
may approve the payment of alternative or additional benefits and pension arrangement in line with 
local market practice. In some circumstances, the Remuneration Committee  may agree to pay an 
expatriate allowance, reimbursement of advisers’ fees and/or offer tax equalisation arrangements.
6. Service Agreements and Termination Payments
It is the Group’s policy that Executive Directors’ service agreements may be terminated by no more 
than one year’s notice by the employer at any time and by payment of no more than one year’s basic 
salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer. 
Upon the termination of an Executive Director’s employment, in addition to considering the terms of 
the individual’s service agreement, the Remuneration Committee has the following policies:
 ● The Remuneration Committee  shall be 
 guided by the core principle of seeking an  
 outcome that is in the best interests of the 
 Group and its shareholders and shall take 
 into account all of the circumstances of 
 the termination.
 ● If the termination is as a result of death, 
 illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or 
 any other exceptional circumstance that  
 the Remuneration Committee  considers to 
 be analogous to the foregoing (a ‘Good  
 Leaver Reason’), the Remuneration 
 Committee  shall consider making a payment  
 to the Executive Director under the Annual  
 Bonus Plan. This would normally be pro-rated 
 for the period worked during the financial 
 year and any amount of bonus deferred 
 (whether held in shares or cash) will normally  
66 annual report and accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Corporate Governance
Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
 be released immediately.
 ● If the termination is as a result of anything 
 other than a Good Leaver Reason, no 
 payment will be made under the Annual 
 Bonus Plan on cessation of employment of  
 an Executive Director and any amount of  
 bonus deferred (whether held in shares or 
 cash) will normally not be released until the 
 end of the usual deferral periods.
 ● If the termination is as a result of a Good 
 Leaver Reason, PSP awards will normally 
 vest at the normal vesting date, pro-rated for  
 time served and remaining subject to the 
 original performance conditions. Any shares  
 held for the compulsory holding period 
 (i.e. after the end of the performance period)  
 will vest immediately.
 ● If the termination is as a result of anything 
 other than a Good Leaver Reason, any PSP  
 awards will lapse in full.
 ● In the event of a compromise or settlement 
 agreement, the Remuneration Committee 
 shall consider agreeing to reasonable 
 payments in respect of the settlement  
 of legal claims, including any compensation 
 relating to the breach of the Executive  
 Director’s statutory or contractual rights 
 and in respect of any reasonable professional  
 fees incurred by the individual in relation to 
  the agreement.
The service contracts of Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office during normal  
business hours and will be available at the Annual General Meeting.
7. Change in Control
On a change in control, awards under the Group’s incentive plans will generally vest but in most 
circumstances, such vesting will be subject to: 
i. the extent to which the Remuneration Committee  considers that the performance   
 conditions have been satisfied; and 
ii. time apportionment in accordance with the rules of each plan.
On a change in control, any shares held under compulsory deferral arrangements under the Annual 
Bonus Plan or PSP (i.e. after the end of any performance periods) shall normally vest in full.
67 8. Fees Retained for External 
Non-Executive Directorships
The Remuneration Committee  is of the view that 
Executive Directors can, in some circumstances, 
benefit by holding non-executive directorships 
in other companies. 
The Remuneration Committee  therefore permits 
such non-executive directorships and permits 
the Executive Directors to personally retain the 
fees from such non-executive directorships, 
providing that the Remuneration Committee’s 
advance permission is sought and that such 
appointment does not conflict with the Director’s 
duties and commitments to Ultimate Products. 
9. Discretion
The Remuneration Committee  has an element of 
discretion in several areas of the Remuneration 
Policy and has discretion in some areas under 
the rules of certain incentive plans. These 
discretions include:
 ● selecting participants for each plan 
 and arrangement;
 ● determining the quantum of awards 
 under each plan or arrangement, subject 
 to the maximums stated in the policy 
 table above;
 ● selecting the most suitable timing for 
 granting awards and making payments;
 ● assessing the extent to which performance 
 conditions have been satisfied and thereby 
 the extent to which awards shall vest;
 ● setting the targets applicable to the various 
 performance measures used in the Group’s 
 plan and arrangements;
 ● conducting an annual review of 
 performance measures and the relative  
 weightings thereof;
 ● determining whether a participant shall be 
 considered to be a Good Leaver in 
 exceptional circumstances, outside of the 
 prescribed circumstances; and
 ● making necessary adjustments to any plan or  
 arrangement in circumstances such as a  
 rights issue, restructuring, special dividend 
 or change of control (subject to the rules 
 of the relevant plan or arrangement).
If an event occurs which means, in the opinion 
of the Remuneration Committee, that the 
performance conditions or associated targets 
are no longer an appropriate measure of the 
performance of the Group’s business or its 
adherence to strategy then, in exceptional 
circumstances, the Remuneration Committee  
shall have the discretion to adjust, supplement 
or amend any performance condition or target, 
subject always that the adjusted, supplemental 
or amended performance condition must be not 
materially less difficult to satisfy. Other than in 
the case of minor or administrative changes, any 
such action would be taken only after consultation 
with the Group’s major shareholders and would 
be disclosed in the subsequent Annual Report 
on Remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee  has the discretion to amend the Remuneration Policy with regard to 
minor or administrative matters where, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, it would be 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval for such amendment.
10. Legacy Agreements
In addition to payments provided for under 
this Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration 
Committee  may authorise payments to honour 
commitments made prior to its adoption to any 
current or former Executive Directors. 
Where appropriate, in the case of an internal 
promotion to an Executive Director position, the 
Remuneration Committee  may make payments 
to such Executive Director in relation to terms 
agreed with them at a time when the relevant 
individual was not an Executive Director of the 
Group – providing that such payment was not 
in consideration for the individual becoming 
an Executive Director. Any such payments will 
only be made with a view to transitioning the 
Executive Director to terms compatible with this 
Remuneration Policy as soon as possible.
Details of any such payments will be included in each Annual Report on Remuneration.
11. Terms and Conditions of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years and will stand for 
re-election at each AGM of Ultimate Products. Thereafter, the Board may invite them to serve for an 
additional period of three years, again subject to re-election at each AGM.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board in light of independent 
surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies and with regard to the 
time commitment and responsibilities involved. The Chairman is paid a single fee covering all of 
his responsibilities and other Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee, with the Chairs of the 
Remuneration Committee and Audit and Risk Committees being paid additional fees to reflect their 
extra responsibilities.
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses, in relation to the 
performance of their duties and for any related tax liabilities that may arise.
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is terminable by either party on one months’ written 
notice. No compensation is payable upon termination of their appointment and they are not entitled

Individual Elements of Remuneration
Base Salary
Base salaries of the individual Executive Directors are reviewed annually, with effect from 
28 February 2017, by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to the scope of 
the role and the markets in which the group operates. The experience of the individual is also 
considered, along with the pay levels in similar organisations.
From 1 March 2017, the base salaries of the Executive Directors will be as follows, including 
comparison to the previously agreed rates: 
 Base Salary Base Salary

The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme, which the Directors are eligible to 
participate in. The Executive Directors currently receive 12 % of their salary as a contribution to their

the Executive Directors took the option to receive a cash allowance as follows; S Showman received 
£39,375, A Gossage received £17,284 and G Screawn received £5,500. The allowance was in place 
for the full year for both S Showman and A Gossage and from 1 March 2017 for G Screawn.
72 Strategic Report
Corporate Governance
Financial Statements Shareholder Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
The contracts of employment for the Executive Directors do not define a normal retirement age and given 
the arrangements in place, the Executive Directors have not accrued pension entitlements at 31 July 2017.
Non-Executive Director Fees
The Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
shareholder approval, appointed for an initial 
period of three years and will stand for re-election 
at each Annual General Meeting of the Company. 
The period of service can be extended for a 
further three years based upon Board approval.
The initial agreed fee for J McCarthy is £75,000 
per annum in respect of services as Independent  
Non-Executive Chairman and in respect of 
services as chair of the Nominations Committee. 
The annual fee for A Rigby is agreed initially at 
£40,000 per annum in respect of services as 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and 
£5,000 in respect of services as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. The initial agreed fee 
for R Bell is £40,000 per annum in respect of 
services as Non-Executive Director and £10,000 
in respect of services as Chair of the Audit and 
Risk Committee. The agreed fee for B Franks was 
agreed initially at £15,000 in respect of services 
as Non-Executive Director, including a one-day-
per-week time commitment. From 6 April 2017, 
this increased to £40,000, with a two-day-per-
week time commitment. Fees were also paid to 
his service company of £32,083.
In the year to 31 July 2017, the Remuneration 
Committee agreed on the payment of additional 
sums to three of the Non-Executive Directors 
for work carried out in the lead-up to the IPO. 
The agreed sums were £12,500 for J McCarthy, 
£7,500 for A Rigby and £8,333 for R Bell.
Annual Bonus Scheme
Year to 31 July 2017 
The Executive Directors participate in a bonus 
arrangement, which was approved by the Board 
on 11 June 2014 – the Shareholder Bonus Pool. 
The shareholder bonus pool is calculated based 
upon a metric of Group EBITDA before bonuses 
and other exceptional items being in excess 
of £2 m. If EBITDA is less than £2 m, the pool 
is £nil; if EBITDA is between £2–3 m, the pool 
is 10 % of the excess above £2 m; if EBITDA is 
between £3–4 m, the pool is £0.1 m plus 15 % of 
the excess above £3 m and if EBITDA is over 
£4 m, the pool is £0.25 m plus 20 % of the excess 
above £4 m.
For the year to 31 July 2017, the total Shareholder 
Bonus Pool was £1.75 m, based upon Group 
EBITDA of £11.5 m; compared to a pool of £1.2 m 
in 2016, based upon Group EBITDA of £8.2 m.

2018 Bonus Framework
In the following financial year, a new 
bonus scheme has been proposed for 
the benefit of the Executive Directors. 
The payment profile of the bonuses 
will be 70 % in cash, with the remaining 
30 % in deferred shares or in certain 
exceptional circumstances as a cash 
payment, vesting in three equal annual 
instalments over the following three 
years. The maximum bonus achievable 
will be capped at 125 % of base salary 
for both S Showman and A Gossage 
and 100 % for G Screawn.
Achievement of maximum bonus will be 
split into two elements; an EBITDA target 
and stretching specific and measurable 
strategic and/or individual objectives. 
S Showman and A Gossage can receive 
100 % of base salary in relation to 
the EBITDA target, with the remaining 
25 % being based upon the strategic 
and/or individual objectives. G Screawn 
can achieve 75 % of base salary in 
relation to the EBITDA target, with the 
remaining 25 % being based upon the 
strategic and/or individual objectives.
No part of the bonus will be payable 
unless a threshold level of the EBITDA 
target is met. In order for full payment 
to be made, EBITDA must exceed the 
prescribed target by 30 %.

Long-Term Incentive Plans (Audited)
Awards Granted in the Year Ended 31 July 2017
On 28 February 2017, immediately preceding the 
Company’s listing on the main market of the London Stock 
Exchange, a Management Incentive Plan was adopted, of 
which the Executive Directors were eligible to participate 
in. The plan is structured as an award of A ordinary shares 
in UP Global Sourcing UK Limited. The shares were 
awarded including put options with a three-year vesting 
period that can be exercised up to 7 years following the 
vesting date.
At exercise of the put options, the A ordinary shares can 
be converted to shares in UP Global Sourcing Holdings 
plc. The put options carry performance criteria, based 
upon the growth in share price following IPO, subject to 
a hurdle of 30 %. At the point of exercise, the recipient 
will receive the value of shares in either cash or shares to 
the same value, at the discretion of UP Global Sourcing 
Holdings plc, subject to a cap of 6.25 % of the issued 
share capital. Strategic Report

Statement on Implementation of 
Remuneration Policy in the Following 
Financial Year
The Remuneration Committee will consider the 
base salary of the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors from 1 March 2018, as part of the annual 
salary review process. There is expected to be 
no change in the arrangements concerning 
benefits and pension contributions.
As noted earlier in this report, the maximum 
potential bonus achievable for the Executive 
Directors is 125 % of base salary for both S 
Showman and A Gossage and 100 % of base 
salary for G Screawn. The bonus is based partly 
on meeting or exceeding a specified EBITDA 
target and partly on the individual exceeding 
specified strategic and/or individual objectives. 
No part of the bonus will be payable unless a 
threshold level of the EBITDA target is met. In 
order for the full payment to be made EBITDA 
must exceed the prescribed target by 30 %.
The targets for the year ended 31 July 2018 
have been determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. The Remuneration Committee has 
decided that, given the commercial sensitivity 
of the detailed performance measures used for 
the annual bonus plan, disclosing these targets 
prospectively is not in the interests of the Group 
or its shareholders.  The targets, performance 
levels achieved and the resulting payments will 
be disclosed retrospectively after the end of the 
performance period.

Consideration of Matters Relating to Directors’ Remuneration
The following Directors were members of the Remuneration Committee when matters relating to 
Directors’ remuneration were considered:
 ● A Rigby
 ● J McCarthy
 ● R Bell
External Advisers
The Remuneration Committee  was advised in relation to Directors’ remuneration by RSM UK Tax & 
Advisory Services LLP (‘RSM’). RSM were appointed by A Rigby, after a competitive tender process, 
to provide advice in relation to the formal setting of remuneration policies, including consideration of 
legislative matters and best practice, as well as assistance in drafting the annual remuneration report. 
The Audit and Risk Committee consider RSM to have been objective and independent during the 
year, as there are no conflicts of interest. The Remuneration Committee is comfortable that the RSM 
engagement partner and team that provides remuneration advice to the Remuneration Committee 
do not have connections with the Company that may impair their independence. The Remuneration 
Committee  is committed to regularly reviewing the external advisor relationship. RSM have charged 
fees of £12,000 for Remuneration Committee matters.
Statement of Shareholder Voting
The Company has not held an AGM since listing and therefore no voting outcomes are available.

website after the meeting. Subject to the 
relevant statutory provisions and the Articles, 
shareholders are entitled to a dividend where 
declared and paid out of profits available for 
such purposes.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company other than:
 ● those which may from time to time be 
applicable under existing laws and regulations 
(for example, insider trading laws); and
 ● pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, whereby certain Directors 
and employees of the Company require 
the approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s ordinary shares and are prohibited 
from dealing during closed periods.
At 31 July 2017, the Company had no authority to 
purchase any of its issued ordinary share capital 
or to allot further ordinary shares. It is proposed 
that an ordinary resolution is tabled at the 
Company’s AGM on 15 December 2017 to give 
the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares 
up to the value of two thirds of the Company’s 
current issued share capital (one-third of such 
authority being exercisable only in connection 
with a pre-emptive rights issue). It is further 
proposed that special resolutions are tabled at 
the Company’s AGM to allow the Company to (i) 
issue ordinary shares without first offering such 
shares to existing shareholders, up to a value 
of 5 % of the Company’s issued share capital; 
and (ii) purchase up to 10 % of its issued share 
capital. Such authorities, if passed, will expire on 
the earlier of 31 January 2019 and the conclusion 
of the AGM of the Company in respect of the 
year ending on 31 July 2018.
The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights.
Change of Control

Report, awards under the Company’s share 
incentive plans contain provisions relating 
to a change of control of the Company. The 
Company’s banking facilities with HSBC Bank 
plc may, at the discretion of the lender, become 
repayable upon a change of control.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles may only be amended 
by a special resolution at a general meeting of 
shareholders. No amendments are proposed to 
be made to the existing Articles at the 2017 AGM.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Disclosures regarding greenhouse gas emissions 
required by The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic

Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements and have elected 
to prepare the Company Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss for the Group for that period.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
 ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ● make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ● state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the European  
 Union subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; 
 ● prepare the Financial Statements on the going-concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume 
 that the company will continue in business; 
 ● prepare a director’s report, strategic report and director’s remuneration report, which comply 
 with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The 
Directors are responsible for ensuring that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable, providing the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the group’s performance, business model and strategy.

with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also 
extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein.
Directors’ Responsibilities Pursuant to DTR4
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
 ● The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
 Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
 and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of 
 the Group.
 ● The annual report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business 
 and the financial position of the Group and parent company, together with a description of the 
 principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc
Opinion
We have audited the Financial Statements of UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc (the ‘parent 
company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 July 2017 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated 
and company statement of financial position, consolidated and company statement of changes in 
equity, consolidated and company statement of cashflows, and the notes to the Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
In our opinion the Financial Statements:
 ● give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
 31 July 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 ● the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
 by the European Union;
 ● the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
 IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
 Companies Act 2006; and
 ● the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
 the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
 IAS Regulation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial 
Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We

believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Conclusions Relating to Principal Risks, Going Concern and 
Viability Statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to 
which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to:
 ● the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 19 to 23 that describe the principal risks and 
 explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 ● the Directors’ confirmation set out on pages 46 to 48 in the annual report that they have carried out 
 a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten 
 its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 ● the directors’ statement set out on page 116 in the Financial Statements about whether the 
 Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
 the Financial Statements and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the group 
 and the parent company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months 
 from the date of approval of the Financial Statements;
 ● whether the Directors’ statement relating to going concern required under the Listing Rules in 
 accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in 
 the audit; or
● the Directors’ explanation set out on page 24 in the annual report as to how they have assessed 
 the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that 
 period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
 that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
 the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
 necessary qualifications or assumptions.

our audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included 
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter How we addressed the matter in our audit
Revenue recognition
The Group dispatches products to 
customers in a number of different ways 
with revenue being recognised when 
the risks and rewards of ownership 
have transferred in line with the group’s 
revenue accounting policy as shown in 
note 3 to the Financial Statements. Our 
risk assessment identified a key area of 
risk of misstatement in respect of goods 
in transit at the year-end where the risks 
and rewards of ownership transfer at 
different times depending on specific 
terms of shipping.
We selected a sample of revenue invoices recognised 
in the month either side of the year end and agreed 
these sales to the bill of lading and other supporting 
shipping and dispatch documentation. In completing 
this review we paid specific attention to the terms 
and conditions of the individual sales to assess 
whether the sales had been included within the correct 
accounting period.

Key audit matter How we addressed the matter in our audit
Rebates
The Group has a number of rebate 
agreements in place with its customers.  
This was considered to be a risk area 
due to the nature of some of these 
agreements and the significance of 
the rebate charge to the Financial 
Statements. As described in note 4 the 
estimation of the rebate charge and 
year end accrual also requires a level of 
estimation and judgement.
As at 31 July 2017 the rebate accrual was 
£1,076 k (2016 – £1,262 k).
We obtained assurance over the rebate charge and 
accrual by:
 ● agreeing the calculation of the rebate charge for  
 key customers to the underlying rebate agreement 
 and revenue for the year. Where this involves 
 any estimation, we have reviewed the basis of 
 such estimates and the reasonableness of any  
 assumptions made; 
 ● comparison of the rebate charge and accrual for 
 each customer to our expectations to identify any  
 significant variances which were then substantiated 
 to supporting documentation; and
 ● reviewing the accuracy of the estimation of the prior  
 year rebate accrual by considering invoices received 
 during the year and the rebate history.
Inventory valuation
As described in note 4 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), the Group 
carries inventory at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. As at 31 July 2017, 
as shown in note 18, the Group held 
inventories of £11.1 m (2016: £10.5 m). 
Judgement is required to assess the 
appropriate level of provisioning for 
items which may be sold below cost 
as a result of a reduction in consumer 
demand particularly in light of changing 
consumer tastes and new products 
being developed. Such judgements 
include management’s expectations for 
future sales. This is a significant risk for 
the audit.
We obtained assurance over management’s 
assumptions applied in calculating the value of 
inventory provisions by:
 ● assessing the Group’s inventory provisioning 
 policy,  with specific consideration given to slow 
 moving or obsolete stock lines;
 ● verifying the value of a sample of inventory to 
 confirm it is held at the lower of cost and net 
 realisable value, through comparison to  invoices 
 and sales prices; and
 ● reviewing historical accuracy of inventory  
 provisioning with reference to stock movements 
 during the year and post year end.

Our Application of Materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect 
of identified misstatements on the audit in forming our audit opinion. Materiality is defined as the 
magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the Financial Statements and 
provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
The materiality for the group audit as a whole was set at £425,000 (2016 – £530,000) and was 
determined with reference to the benchmark of adjusted group profit before taxation of which it 
represents 5 % (2016 – 9 %). Profit has been adjusted by adding back the costs incurred by the 
group as part of its Initial Public Offering which occurred during the year ended 31 July 2017 which 
are exceptional in nature.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected and uncorrected misstatements exceeding 
£14,875 (2016 – £10,600) in addition to other audit adjustments that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An Overview of the Scope of Our Audit
Our assessment of audit risk and group materiality determines the audit scope for each entity 
within the Group, this then allows us to form an opinion on the Group Financial Statements. The 
Group engagement team completed statutory audits in line with the ISAs (UK) for UP Global Sourcing 
Holdings plc, and UP Global Sourcing UK Limited. These entities account for 99 % of the Group’s 
total assets, 100 % of the Group’s revenue and 99 % of the Group’s profit before tax.  The remainder 
of the Group was not therefore considered significant and our work was limited to high level 
analytical procedures.
Other Information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than 
the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information 
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in 
98 Strategic Report
Financial Statements
Corporate Governance Shareholder Information
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies 
or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address 
the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of 
the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
 ● Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 90– the statement given  by the directors 
 that they consider the annual report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
 and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
 group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
 obtained in the audit; or
 ● Audit committee reporting set out on pages 43 to 49– the section describing the work of the 
 audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the  
 audit committee; or
 ● Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out 
 on page 36– the parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the 
 Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified 
 for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
 departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on Other Matters Prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the 
strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements and those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on Which We are Required to Report by Exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its 
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in 
the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ● adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
 for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ● the parent company Financial Statements or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
 audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ● certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ● we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on pages 90 and 91, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
100 Strategic Report
Financial Statements
Corporate Governance Shareholder Information
no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditors responsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other Matters Which we are Required to Address
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors 
to audit the Financial Statements for the year ending 31 July 2016 and subsequent financial periods, 
subject to annual reappointment by the shareholders. The period of total uninterrupted engagement 
is 2 years, covering the years ending 31 July 2016 to 31 July 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or 
the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting 
our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

1. General Information
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc ('the Company') 
and its subsidiaries (together 'the Group') is a 
supplier of branded, value-for-money household 
products to global markets.
The Company is a public limited company, 
which is listed on the London Stock Exchange 
and incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The 
address of its registered office is UP Global 
Sourcing Holdings plc, Manor Mill, Victoria 
Street, Chadderton, Oldham OL9 0DD. UK.
2. Basis of Preparation
The consolidated Group Financial Statements 
and Company Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as 
endorsed by the European Union (EU) and those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. These are 
the first set of Financial Statements presented 
in accordance with IFRS, the accounts for 
the year ended 31 July 2016 were presented 
in accordance with FRS 102 – The Financial 
Reporting Standard in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland. The impact of the transition to IFRS is 
considered in note 32. The consolidated Group 
Financial Statements and Company Financial 
Statements are presented in Sterling, generally 
rounded to the nearest thousand. The Financial 
Statements are prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial instruments 
and share based payments that have been 
measured at fair value.
The Directors have taken advantage of the 
exemption available under Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and have not presented 
an income statement or a statement of 
comprehensive income for the Company alone.
Going Concern Basis
The Group meets its day-to-day working 
capital requirements through its bank facilities. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The 
Group's forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonable sensitivities, show 
that the Group should be able to operate 
within available facilities. The Group therefore 
continues to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing its consolidated and company 
Financial Statements.
3. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted are 
set out below.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements 
incorporate the assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to the 
Company’s accounting reference date. Control 
116 Strategic Report
Financial Statements
Corporate Governance Shareholder Information

is achieved when the Company has the power 
over the investee, is exposed or has rights to 
variable return from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to use its power 
to affect its returns. The Company reassesses 
whether or not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control 
listed above.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the 
Company obtains control over the subsidiary 
and ceases when the Company loses control 
of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results 
of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the period are included in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income from the date that the Company gains 
control until the date when the Company ceases 
to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring 
the accounting policies used into line with 
the Group’s accounting policies. All intra Group 
assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows, relating to transactions between 
the members of the Group, are eliminated 
on consolidation.
The results of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated at the monthly average rates of 
exchange during the period and their statements 
of financial position at the rates ruling at the 
reporting date. Exchange differences arising 
on translation of the opening net assets and 
on foreign currency borrowings or deferred 
consideration, to the extent that they hedge 
the Group's investment in such subsidiaries, are 
reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income. All Financial Statements are drawn up 
to 31 July 2017.
Currencies
Presentational Currency
Items included in the Financial Statements are 
measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group 
operates which is Sterling (£).
Transactions and Balances  
Foreign currency transactions are translated 
into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or at an average rate for a period if the rates 
do not fluctuate significantly. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses, resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation 
at year-end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies, are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated.
Foreign exchange gains and losses, resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation at year-end exchange rates

of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies, are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated.
Revenue Recognition & Rebates
Revenue is recognised once the risks and 
rewards of ownership have transferred. This can 
vary depending upon the method of dispatch. 
Revenue is recognised either on dispatch, 
receipt by customer or upon delivery to a 
transport company if appropriate insurance is 
in place. Revenue is measured as the fair value 
of the consideration received or receivable and 
represents the amount receivable for goods 
supplied and services rendered, net of returns 
and expected returns, discounts and rebates 
given by the Group to customers.
Rebates payable to customers are recognised 
in line with relevant contractual terms. Rebates 
payable to customers are charged directly to 
the income statement over the period to which 
they relate and are recognised as a deduction 
from revenue.
Property, Plant & Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment losses. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Such assets 
acquired in a business combination are initially 
recognised at their fair value at acquisition date. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the 
costs of assets over their estimated useful lives, 
on a straight-line basis starting from the month 
they are first used, as follows:
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 16–50 % 
Motor vehicles – 25 %
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an 
asset is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its property, plant and 
equipment assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any).
Inventories
Inventories are valued using a first in, first out 
method and are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost includes expenditure 
incurred in the normal course of business in 
bringing the products to their present location 
and condition.
At the end of each reporting period inventories

Financial Statements

119
are assessed for impairment. If an item of 
inventory is impaired, the identified inventory 
is reduced to its selling price less costs to 
complete and sell and an impairment charge 
is recognised in the income statement. Where 
a reversal of the impairment is recognised the 
impairment charge is reversed, up to the original 
impairment loss, and is recognised as a credit in 
the income statement.
Income tax
The tax expense or credit represents the sum of 
the tax currently payable or recoverable and the 
movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Current Income Tax
Current tax is based upon taxable income 
for the year and any adjustment to tax from 
previous years. Taxable income differs from 
net income in the statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years or that are never taxable or deductible. 
The calculation uses the latest tax rates for the 
year that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the dates of the Statement of 
Financial Position.
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is calculated at the latest tax rates 
that have been substantively enacted by the 
reporting date that are expected to apply when 
settled. It is charged or credited in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, except when it 
relates to items credited or charged directly to 
equity, in which case it is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable 
or recoverable on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
Financial Statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
income and is accounted for using the liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are 
not discounted.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable income will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Such assets are reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and when the deferred tax assets 
and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority, on either the same taxable 
entity or different taxable entities, where there is 
an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Operating Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks 
and rewards of ownership are retained by the 
lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals 
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc  Financial Statements 
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
ULTIMATE 
PRODUCTS
www.upgs.com
payable under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the relevant lease.
Payroll Expense & Related 
Contributions
The Group provides a range of benefits 
to employees, including annual bonus 
arrangements, paid holiday arrangements and 
defined contribution pension plans.
Short-term benefits, including holiday pay 
and other similar non-monetary benefits, are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which 
the service is received.
Pension Costs
The Group operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme for employees. The annual 
contributions payable are charged to profit 
or loss.
Share Based Compensation
The Group issues share based payments to 
certain employees and Directors. Equity-settled, 
share based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, along 
with a corresponding increase in equity.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-
market based vesting conditions. The impact of 
any revision is recognised in profit or loss, with 
a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The fair value of share options is determined 
using a Monte Carlo model, taking into 
consideration the best estimate of the expected 
life of the option and the estimated number of 
shares that will eventually vest.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and 
deducted from equity at the time they are 
declared. Otherwise dividends are disclosed 
if they have been proposed or declared after 
the year end and before the relevant Financial 
Statements are approved.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised in the Statement of Financial 
Position when the Group becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are de-recognised when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire or when the contractual rights 
to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities 
are de-recognised when the obligation specified 
in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Trade & Other Receivables
Trade and other receivables and amounts owed 
by group undertakings are classified as loans

Financial Statements

121
and receivables and recognised initially at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method 
less provision for impairment. Appropriate 
provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts 
are recognised in profit or loss when there is 
objective evidence that the assets are impaired. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short-term 
receivables when the recognition of interest 
would be immaterial.
Cash & Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
on hand, demand deposits and other short-
term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade & Other Payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured 
at their fair value and are subsequently 
measured at their amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. This method 
allocates interest expense over the relevant 
period by applying the ‘effective interest rate’ to 
the carrying amount of the liability.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing overdrafts and invoice 
discounting facilities are classified as other 
liabilities. They are initially recorded at fair 
value, which represents the fair value of the 
consideration received, net of any direct 
transaction costs associated with the relevant 
borrowings. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost and finance charges 
are charged to profit or loss over the term of 
the instrument using an effective rate of interest. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption, are accounted for on 
an accruals basis and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Company has an unconditional right 
to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the reporting date.
Classification as Debt or Equity
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group 
are classified as either financial liabilities or as 
equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangements and the definitions of 
a financial liability and an equity instrument.
Equity Instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments 
issued by the Group are recognised at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at the fair 
value on the date that the derivative contract is 
UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc  Financial Statements 
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
ULTIMATE 
PRODUCTS
www.upgs.com
entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recognised in the income 
statement within finance costs or income as 
appropriate, unless they are included in a 
hedging arrangement. Financial liabilities are 
derecognised when the liability is extinguished, 
that is when the contractual obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Hedging Arrangements
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect 
of forward foreign exchange contracts held to 
manage the cash flow exposures of forecast 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are held 
to manage exchange rate exposures and are 
designated as cash flow hedges of foreign 
currency exchange rates.
The Group also applies hedge accounting 
for transactions entered into to manage the 
cash flow exposures of borrowings. Interest 
rate swaps are held to manage interest rate 
exposures and are designated as cash flow 
hedges of floating rate borrowings.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives 
designated as cash flow hedges, which are 
deemed to be effective, are recognised directly 
in equity within a cash flow hedging reserve. 
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship 
(being the excess of the cumulative change of 
the fair value of the hedging instrument since 
inception of the hedge over the cumulative 
change in the fair value of the hedged item 
since inception of the hedge) is recognised in 
the income statement.
The gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified to the 
income statement when the hedge relationship 
ends. If a forecast transaction is no longer 
considered highly probable but the forecast 
transaction is still expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is frozen and recognised 
in profit or loss. Subsequent changes in the fair 
value of the derivative are recognised in profit 
or loss.  If, at any point, the hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss is reclassified from the cash flow 
hedge reserve to profit or loss immediately.
The effective portion of gains and losses 
on derivatives used to manage cash flow 
interest rate risk are also recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
cash flow hedge reserve. However, if the Group 
closes out its position early, the cumulative gains 
and losses recognised in other comprehensive 
income are frozen and reclassified from the cash 
flow hedge reserve to the profit or loss account. 
The ineffective portion of gains and losses on 
derivatives used to manage cash flow interest 
rate risk are recognised in profit or loss within 
finance expense or finance income.

Accounting Developments
New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the preparation 
of the Financial Statements
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations, which have been 
adopted by the Group. The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had a material 
impact on the Group.
Standard Key requirements
Classification and Measurement 
of Share-based Payment 
Transactions (Amendments 
to IFRS 2)
The amendments, which were developed through the 
IFRS Interpretations Committee, provide clarification on 
the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting 
conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based 
payments and share-based payment transactions with a net 
settlement feature for withholding tax obligations.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
(2014–2016 Cycle)
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards – IFRS 1 has been amended to 
remove short-term exemptions dealing with IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IFRS 
10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The reliefs provided 
are no longer applicable and had been available to entities 
for reporting periods that have now passed.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities – 
Amendments have been made to clarify the scope of IFRS 
12. Specifically it clarifies that entities are not exempt from 
all of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 when entities 
have been classified as held for sale or as discontinued 
operations. The standard as amended therefore makes it 
clear that it is only the disclosure requirements set out in 
paragraphs B10 – 16 that do not need to be provided for 
entities within the scope of IFRS 5.

Standard Key requirements
IFRIC22 Foreign Currency 
Transactions and Advance 
Consideration
IFRIC 22 addresses how to determine the date of the 
transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange 
rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, 
expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a 
non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from 
the payment or receipt of advance consideration in a foreign 
currency (e.g. a prepayment or deferred income).
Amendments to IAS 40: 
Transfers of Investment Property
IAS 40 requires a property to be transferred to, or from, 
investment property only when there is a change in use. 
The amendment clarifies that a change in management’s 
intentions for the use of a property does not in isolation 
provide evidence of a change in use. This is because 
management’s intentions, alone, do not provide evidence of 
a change in use.
An entity must, therefore, have taken observable actions to 
support such a change.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over 
Income Tax Treatments
It may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular 
transaction or circumstance, or whether a taxation authority 
will accept a company’s tax treatment. IAS 12 Income Taxes 
specifies how to account for current and deferred tax, 
but not how to reflect the effects of uncertainty. IFRIC 23 
provides requirements that add to the requirements in IAS 12 
by addressing a number of issues when there is uncertainty 
over income tax treatments.

New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year 
beginning 1 August 2016 and not early adopted
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with effective dates as 
noted below: 
Standard Key requirements Effective Date 
(for Annual Periods 
Beginning On or After)
IFRS 9, Financial 
Instruments
The standard is expected to impact the classification and 
measurement of financial assets.
It introduces an ‘expected credit loss’ model for the 
measurement of the impairment of financial assets, so 
it is no longer necessary for the credit event to have 
occurred before a credit loss is recognised.
It also introduces a new hedge accounting model that 
is designed to more closely align with how entities 
undertake risk management activities when hedging 
financial and non-financial risk exposures.
The standard also introduces additional 
disclosure requirements.
This is currently being considered by the Directors, 
although this will affect the classification of certain 
financial instruments in the Company’s Statement of 
Financial Position, the Directors do not currently believe 
that the standard will have a material impact on the 
group’s statement of financial position. 
The level of impairment of certain financial instruments 
such as trade receivables may increase under the 
expected loss model but this is yet to be assessed by 
the Directors.

IFRS 15, 
Revenue from 
Contracts with 
Customers 
The standard specifies how and when a Company will 
recognise revenue, as well as requiring such entities 
to provide users of Financial Statements with more 
informative, relevant disclosures. The standard provides 
a single, principles-based five-step model to apply to all 
contracts with customers.
This standard is currently being considered by the 
Directors. Although the standard will increase disclosure 
requirements in the Group Financial Statements, the 
Directors do not believe that the standard will have a 
material impact of the Group’s income statement. The main 
impact on the Group’s statement of financial position will 
be the consideration of sales with a right to return which 
could lead to an increase in the inventory and current 
liabilities in the Group Financial Statements. This will have 
no effect on the Group income statement and the quantum 
of any adjustment has yet to be assessed by the Directors.
1 January 2018
IFRS 16, Leases The new standard recognises a leased asset and 
a lease liability for almost all leases and requires 
them to be accounted for in a consistent manner. 
This introduces a single lessee accounting model 
and eliminates the previous distinction between an 
operating lease and a finance lease.
This is likely to have an impact on the income 
statement and statement of financial position due 
to the change in accounting policy on the Group’s 
leased assets, which is currently being considered 
by the Directors.

4. Critical Accounting 
Estimates & Judgements
The preparation of these Financial Statements 
requires management to make judgements 
and estimates that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at each Statement 
of Financial Position date and the reported 
results. Actual results could differ from these 
estimates. Information about such judgements 
and estimations is contained in individual 
accounting policies.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty, that 
could cause an adjustment to be required to the 
carrying amount of an asset or liability within the 
next accounting period, are outlined below:
Inventory Provisioning
The Group sources, imports and sells products 
across a range of categories including 
small domestic appliances, audio, laundry, 
housewares, heating and cooling and luggage, 
and is subject to changing consumer demands 
and trends. As a result, it is necessary to consider 
the recoverability of the cost of inventory 
and the associated provisioning required. 
When calculating the inventory provision, 
management considers the nature and condition 
of the inventory, as well as applying assumptions 
around anticipated saleability of finished goods. 
The carrying amounts of inventory provisions are 
disclosed in note 18.
Customer Rebates
The Group makes estimates of the amounts likely 
to be paid to customers in respect of rebate 
arrangements. When making these estimates, 
management takes account of contractual 
customer terms, as well as estimates of likely 
sales volumes, to determine the rates at which 
rebates should be accrued in the Financial 
Statements. The carrying amount of rebate 
provisions at the balance sheet date is £1,076,000 
(2016 - £1,262,000).
Valuation of Derivatives Held at Fair 
Value through Profit & Loss
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a 
liability, the Group uses market observable data 
to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs 
are not available, the Group engages third-party 
qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The 
Group works closely with the qualified external 
valuers to establish the appropriate valuation 
techniques and inputs to the model. The carrying 
amounts of derivatives are disclosed in note 23.

Share Based Payments
The Management Incentive Plan (‘MIP Option 
Scheme’) was adopted on 28 February 2017 
(see note 25). At exercise, the A ordinary 
shares in UP Global Sourcing UK Limited can 
be converted into shares in UP Global Sourcing 
Holdings plc. The options carry performance 
criteria based upon the growth in share price 
following the Group’s IPO, subject to a hurdle 
set at 30 % above the share price at IPO. At 
the point of exercise, the recipient will receive 
the value of shares in either cash or shares to 
the same value, at the discretion of UP Global 
Sourcing Holdings plc, subject to a cap of 6.25 % 
of the issued share capital. An assumption is 
required as to whether the recipient will receive 
either cash or shares and the assumption has 
been made that the recipient will receive shares. 
If the assumption was made that the recipient 
was to receive cash, then the fair value of the MIP 
shares would be continually remeasured and an 
accrual would be included on the Statement of 
Financial Position.
Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets
The extent to which deferred tax assets can 
be recognised is based upon an assessment 
of the probability that future taxable income 
will be available, against which the deductible 
temporary differences and tax loss carry 
forwards can be utilised. In addition, significant 
judgement is required in assessing the impact 
of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties.

5. Operating Segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
that is consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker 
has been identified as the Board. The Board 
is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of operating segments.
The Directors consider that there are no 
identifiable business segments that are subject 
to risks and returns that are different to those of 
the core business. The information reported to the 
Directors, for the purposes of resource allocation 
and assessment of performance, is based wholly 
upon the overall activities of the Group. The Group 
has therefore determined that it has only one 
reportable segment under IFRS 8.
The results and assets for this segment can 
be determined by reference to the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income and Statement of 
Financial Position.

Shareholder bonus costs consist of bonus payments based upon certain Group EBITDA performance 
targets and the cost ceased to accrue after the year ended 31 July 2017.
Initial public offering costs relate entirely to the Group’s IPO in the year and therefore are not 
considered to relate to the Group’s underlying performance. The costs incurred comprise principally 
legal and advisory fees and listing costs.

The share based payment expense relates to the non-cash charge arising on the Management 
Incentive Plan (‘MIP Option Scheme’) adopted immediately prior to the IPO, as referred to in note 25.
The above items have been shown separately in the Income Statement to better reflect the

In the year ended 31 July 2017, the Directors have taken the decision to reclassify to cost of sales, 
certain costs that had previously been reported as part of both distribution costs and administrative 
expenses. The Directors believe that the reclassification will better reflect the actual gross margin 
realised on items sold. The impact on the 2016 year end is the reclassification of £1,194,000 from 
distribution costs and the reclassification of £556,000 from administrative expenses. The result has 
been an increase in cost of sales of £1,750,000. This restatement has had no impact upon previously 
reported profit or equity.

13. Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income for the period attributable to ordinary 
equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, and 
uses the number of shares as if they had always been subdivided from £1 shares to 0.25 p shares.
Diluted earnings/(losses) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable 
to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the 
financial year, adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options. The dilutive effect is calculated 
on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive ordinary share options granted by the Group, including 
performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
The calculations of earnings per share are based upon the following:

The Directors believe that the carrying value of trade and other receivables represents their

Trade and other receivables at 31 July 2017 are stated after provisions for impairment of £82,000 
(2016 – £70,000, 2015 – £71,000).
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) that are past 
due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not recognised an allowance for 
doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. The average age of these receivables at 31 July 2017 is 
36 days, (2016 – 52 days, 2015 – 50 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the 
credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting 
date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. 
Credit insurance is also in place.
Details of the Group’s credit risk management policies are shown in note 23. The Group does not 
hold any collateral as security for its trade and other receivables.
Impairment losses recognised in relation to trade receivables were £12,000 at 31 July 2017 
(2016 – £1,000 reversal, 2015 – £6,000).
The Group holds invoice discounting facilities, which are secured against the Group’s trade 
receivables. Further information can be found in note 22.

The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other payables approximates their 
fair value. Trade and other payables are denominated in both Sterling and US Dollars. UP Global 
Sourcing Holdings plc has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are 
paid within the credit timeframe and no interest has been charged by any suppliers as a result of late 
payment of invoices during the period.

The Group is funded by external banking facilities provided by HSBC. On 22 July 2016, the Group 
refinanced and entered into new banking facilities with HSBC. The new facilities run to June 2020, 
providing the ongoing funding of the Group and comprise a revolving credit facility of £6.2 m, an 
invoice discounting facility, the limit of which was increased by £2 m on 27 January 2017 to £17 m and 
an import loan facility, which was increased by £1.75 m to £6.5 m on 22 June 2017. The import loan 
facility is ancillary to the revolving credit facility, is repayable on demand and subject to annual review.
Current bank borrowings include a gross amount of £1,016,000 at 31 July 2017 (2016 – £3,198,000, 
2015 – £313,000) due under invoice discounting facilities, which are secured by an assignment of, 
and fixed charge over the trade debtors of UP Global Sourcing UK Limited. Furthermore, current bank 
borrowings include an amount of £534,000 at 31 July 2017, (2016 – £3,976,000, 2015 – £928,000) due 
under an import loan facility, which are secured by a general letter of pledge providing security over 
the stock purchases financed under that facility.
At 31 July 2017 total bank borrowings are net of £100,000, (2016 – £117,000, 2015 – £105,000) of fees 
which are being amortised over the length of the relevant facilities.
The 2014 A, B and C loan notes were secured by a second fixed and floating charge over the assets 
of the Group. No interest was payable on the 2014 A loan notes and interest was charged at a fixed 
rate of 10 % per annum on the 2014 B and C loan notes. During the year to 31 July 2016, the 2014 A, B 
and C loan notes were repaid in full along with any interest accrued to the date of repayment thereon.

Derivative Financial Instruments – 
Forward Contracts
The Group mitigates the exchange rate risk 
for certain foreign currency trade debtors and 
creditors by entering into forward currency 
contracts. At 31 July 2017, the outstanding 
contracts all mature within 12 months of the 
period end (2016 – 10 months; 2015 – 11 months). 
At 31 July 2017, the Group was committed 
to buy $11,650,000, to sell $3,500,000, to 
sell €7,050,000 and to sell CA $nil, paying 
and receiving respectively a fixed Sterling 
amount (2016 – to buy $10,000,000, to sell 
$nil, to sell €850,000 and to sell CA$85,000; 
2015 – to buy $4,650,000, to sell $nil, to sell 
€2,950,000 and to sell CA $nil). The forward 
currency contracts are measured at fair value 
using the relevant exchange rates for GBP:USD, 
GBP:EUR and GBP:CA$. The fair value of the 
contracts at 31 July 2017 is a liability of £200,000 
(2016 – £417,000 asset; 2015 – £1,000 asset).
Forward currency contracts are valued using 
level 2 inputs. The valuations are calculated using 
the period end forward rates for the relevant 
currencies, which are observable quoted 
values at the period end dates. Valuations are 
determined using the hypothetical derivative 
method, which values the contracts based upon 
the changes in the future cash flows, based upon 
the change in value of the underlying derivative. 
All of the forward contracts to buy US Dollars 
and some of those to sell Euros meet the 
conditions for hedge accounting, as set out in 
the accounting policies in note 3.
The fair value of forward contracts that are 
effective in offsetting the exchange rate risk is a 
liability of £197,000, which has been recognised 
in other comprehensive income and will be 
released to profit or loss at the end of the term 
of the forward contracts that expire within 12 
months. The cash flows in respect of the forward 
contracts will occur over the course of the 12 
months to 31 July 2017.
Derivative Financial Instruments – 
Interest Rate Swaps
The Group has entered into an interest rate 
swap to hedge the exposure to interest rate 
movements on the Group’s revolving credit 
facility. The swap is based upon a principal 
amount of £2,000,000 until 31 July 2018 and 
exchanges the exposure to a LIBOR interest 
rate to a fixed rate of 0.39 %. The fair value of 
the swap at 31 July 2017 is £nil, (2016 – £7,000 
liability; 2015: £nil). 
In addition, the Group has entered into an 
interest rate swap to hedge the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate movements on the 
Group’s invoice discounting facility. The swap 
is based upon a principal amount of £1,000,000 
until 31 December 2019 and exchanges the 
exposure to Base Rate interest charges to a 
152
Financial Statements 
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Strategic Report
Financial Statements
Corporate Governance Shareholder Information
fixed rate of 0.31 %. The fair value of the swap at 
31 July 2017 is an asset of £4,000 (2016 – £6,000 
liability; 2015 – £nil).
Interest rate swaps are valued using level 
2 inputs. The valuations are based upon 
the notional value of the swaps, the current 
available market borrowing rate and the swapped 
interest rate. The valuation is based upon the 
current valuation of the present saving or cost 
of the future cash flow differences, based upon 
the difference between the swapped interest 
rate and the expected interest rate as per the 
lending agreement.
All interest rate swaps meet the conditions for 
hedge accounting, as set out in the accounting 
policies in note 3.
The fair value of variable to fixed interest rate 
swaps that are effective in offsetting the variable 
interest rate risk on variable rate debt is an asset 
of £4,000, which has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income and will be released 
to profit or loss over the term of the swap 
agreements. The agreements expire between 
31 July 2018 and 31 July 2019. The cash flows 
in respect of the swaps occur monthly over the 
effective lifetime of the swaps.
Derivative Financial Instruments – 
Interest Rate Caps
Along with the interest rate swaps referred to 
above, the Group has entered into interest rate 
cap agreements to protect the exposure to 
interest rate movements on the Group’s banking 
facilities. The interest rate caps are measured at 
fair value, being the market value of the cap at the 
balance sheet date. At 31 July 2017, the Company 
had entered into an agreement to cap LIBOR 
interest rates at 1 % until 31 December 2019 on a 
principal amount of £2,000,000. The fair value of 
the interest rate cap at 31 July 2017 was an asset 
of £3,000 (2016 – £6,000 asset; 2015 – £nil).
In addition, at 31 July 2017, the Group has entered 
into further agreements to cap LIBOR interest 
rates at 1 % until 31 December 2019 on a principal 
amount of £2,000,000 and to cap LIBOR interest 
rates at 2 % on a principal amount of £5,095,000, 
reducing to £3,080,000 by 31 December 
2019. The fair value of the interest rate caps at 
31 July 2017 was an asset of £10,000 (2016 – 
£13,000 asset, 2015 – £nil).
Interest rate caps are valued using level 2 inputs. 
The valuations are based upon the notional 
value of the caps, the current available market 
borrowing rate and the capped interest rate. The 
valuation is based upon the current valuation of 
the present saving or cost of the future cash flow 
differences, based upon the difference between 
the capped interest rate and the expected 
interest rate as per the lending agreement.

Financial Statements
Corporate Governance Shareholder Information
The Group’s activities expose it to certain 
financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The overall risk management programme 
focuses upon the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
Risk management is carried out by the Directors, 
who identify and evaluate financial risks in close 
cooperation with key members of staff.
a) Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from 
changes in market factors such as interest rates 
and foreign exchange rates.
b) Credit Risk
Credit risk is the financial loss to the Group 
if a customer or counterparty to financial 
instruments fails to meet its contractual 
obligation. Credit risk arises from the Group’s 
cash and cash equivalents and receivables 
balances. Accordingly, the possibility of material 
loss arising in the event of non-performance 
by counter parties is considered to be unlikely. 
Cash at bank is held with banks with high quality 
external credit rating.
c) Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not 
be able to meet its financial obligations as 
they fall due. This risk relates to the Group’s 
prudent liquidity risk management and implies 
maintaining sufficient cash. The Directors 
monitor rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
and cash and cash equivalents based upon 
expected cash flow.
Market Risk
The Group's interest bearing liabilities relate 
to its variable rate banking facilities. The 
Group has a policy of maintaining a portion 
of its banking facilities under the protection 
of interest rate swaps and caps to ensure 
the certainty of future interest cash flows and 
offering protection against market-driven 
interest rate movements.
The Group’s market risk relating to foreign 
currency exchange rates is commented on 
separately below.
Credit Risk
The Group's sales are primarily made with 
credit terms, exposing the Group to the risk 
of non-payment by customers. The Group has 
implemented policies that require appropriate 
credit checks on potential customers before 
sales are made. The amount of exposure to 
any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, 
which is reassessed regularly by the board. In 
addition, the Group maintains a suitable level of 
credit insurance against its debtor book.

Liquidity Risk Management
The Group is funded by external banking facilities provided by HSBC. Within these facilities, the 
Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance that is designed to 
ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Group's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Group's exposure to foreign currency risk is partially hedged by virtue of invoicing a proportion 
of its turnover in US Dollars. When necessary, the Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts 
to further mitigate this exposure.
The following is a note of the assets and liabilities denominated at each period end in US dollars:

Corporate Governance Shareholder Information
The effect of a 20 % strengthening of Sterling at 31 July 2017 on the foreign denominated financial 
instruments carried at that date would, all variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease to total 
comprehensive income for the period and a decrease to net assets of £244,000 (2016 – £160,000 
increase, 2015 – £98,000 decrease). A 20 % weakening of the exchange rate on the same basis, 
would have resulted in an increase to total comprehensive income and an increase to net assets of 
£367,000 (2016 – £241,000 decrease, 2015 – £147,000 increase).

The effect of a 20 % strengthening of Sterling at 31 July 2017 on the foreign denominated financial 
instruments carried at that date would, all variables held constant, have resulted in an increase to 
total comprehensive income for the period and an increase to net assets of £3,000 (2016 – £45,000 
increase, 2015 – £16,000 decrease). A 20 % weakening of the exchange rate on the same basis, 
would have resulted in a decrease to total comprehensive income and a decrease to net assets of 
£4,000 (2016 – £67,000 decrease, 2015 – £23,000 increase).
The Directors have shown a sensitivity movement of 20 % as, due to the current uncertainty given 
the current economic climate, this is deemed to be the largest potential movement in currency that 
could occur in the near future.

Capital Risk Management
The Group is funded by equity and loans. The 
components of shareholders’ equity are:
a) The share capital and share premium 
 account arising on the issue of shares.
b) The hedging reserve reflecting gains and 
 losses on derivative instruments that have 
 been designated as a hedge, for hedge 
 accounting purposes.
c) The retained reserve or deficit reflecting 
 comprehensive income to date.
The Group’s objective when managing capital 
is to maintain adequate financial flexibility to 
preserve its ability to meet financial obligations, 
both current and long-term. The capital structure 
of the Group is managed and adjusted to reflect 
changes in economic conditions. The Group 
funds its expenditures on commitments from 
existing cash and cash equivalent balances, 
primarily received from existing bank facilities 
and profits generated. There are no externally 
imposed capital requirements. Financing 
decisions are made based upon forecasts of 
the expected timing and level of capital and 
operating expenditure required to meet the 
Group’s commitments and development plans.
Fair Value Estimation
The carrying value less impairment provision of 
trade receivables and payables are assumed to 
approximate to their fair values because of the 
short-term nature of such assets and the effect 
of discounting liabilities is negligible.
The Group is exposed to the risks that arise 
from its financial instruments. The policies 
for managing those risks and the methods to 
measure them are described earlier in this note.
Maturity of Financial Assets & Liabilities
All of the Group’s non-derivative financial 
liabilities and its financial assets at the reporting 
date are either payable or receivable within 
one year, except for borrowings as disclosed in 
note 22.

25. Share Based Payments
The Group had 2 share option schemes in place during the year ended 31 July 2017 as follows: 
1. EMI Option Scheme – 2014
On 12 June 2014, the Company established an enterprise management incentive scheme, the 
UP Global Sourcing Holdings EMI Share Option Plan (‘Plan’), to grant certain employees options to 
acquire B ordinary shares of £1 each in the Company.
On and around 12 June 2014, the Company granted 21,157 options to certain senior managers 
within the business. The options had an exercise price of £1 each and could only be exercised 
in the event of a share sale or listing of the Company. Vesting of the options was subject to 
continued employment within the UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc Group. At the grant date, the 
fair value of the options was deemed to be £nil and as such, no charge has been recognised in 
the income statement.
Immediately preceding the Company’s listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, the 
options were exercised, resulting in the issue of 21,157 £1 ordinary shares, which were subsequently 
subdivided into 0.25 p ordinary shares; with each £1 share being redesignated into 400 0.25 p 
shares; increasing the total number of shares in issue by 8,462,800.
2. MIP Option Scheme – 2017
On 28 February 2017, immediately preceding the Company’s listing on the main market of the 
London Stock Exchange, a Management Incentive Plan was adopted. The plan is structured as 
an award of A ordinary shares in UP Global Sourcing UK Limited. The options are granted with a 
three-year vesting period and can be exercised up to seven years following the vesting date. 
At exercise, the A ordinary shares can be converted into shares in UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc. 
The options carry performance criteria, based upon the growth in share price following IPO, subject 
to a hurdle set at 30 % above the IPO share price. At the point of exercise, the recipient will receive 
the value of shares in either cash or shares to the same value, at the discretion of UP Global Sourcing 
Holdings plc, subject to a cap of 6.25 % of the issued share capital. The shares therefore have an 
exercise price of £nil for the recipient.

Outstanding at the end of the period 2,258,735 - 8,462,800 0.25 p
The options were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. This model was deemed the 
most appropriate as it is capable of capturing market-based performance conditions and simulating 
a number of possible outcomes, allowing the value of each outcome to be assessed.
The total expense recognised relating to share based payments was £80,000 (2016 – £nil).
The inputs to the Monte Carlo model were as follows:
Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the underlying share price is expected to fluctuate 
over the life of the option. The MIP Shares were awarded in connection with the Company’s IPO 
and as such, there is no historical share price for the Company at 28 February 2017 from which to 
observe historical volatility.
For newly-listed entities, IFRS 2 states that entities should consider the volatility of comparable listed 
companies following a comparable period in their lives (i.e. post-IPO).
The Directors identified four comparable companies and have adopted the annualised historical 
volatility for the comparable companies over the seven-year period prior to the grant date.

and for payment of £3,000,000, together with 
the issue of 1,000 new £1 C ordinary shares 
in consideration of the release of the entire 
£10,800,000 A loan notes and accrued interest 
thereon of £4,503,466. 
The 1,000 new £1 C ordinary shares were 
issued for a total deemed consideration of 
£12,303,466, of which £12,302,466 has been 
recognised in share premium. The Group has 
considered the accounting treatment of this 
transaction and, in particular, reviewed whether 
IFRIC 19 should be applied to this transaction. 
In the view of the Directors, the Company was 
acting in its capacity as a shareholder and so 
IFRIC 19 should not be applied. As such, the 
difference between the liquidated debt amount 
and the fair value of equity issued is recognised 
in full in the share premium account, rather than 
through the income statement. After a review of 
the shares issued, in the view of the Directors, 
the fair value of the shares equates to their 
book value. The transaction was funded by a 
combination of existing and extended banking 
facilities and by the issue of new loan notes to 
existing shareholders totalling £1,150,000, being 
the 2014 A, B and C loan notes referred to in 
note 22 above.
On completion of the transaction, the Group 
was controlled collectively by the holders of the 
Company's A ordinary shares.

32. Transition to IFRS
On 1 March 2017, the Group completed an IPO and listed on the main market of the London Stock 
Exchange. Following the listing, the Group adopted International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) and have followed the principles in IFRS 1 – first time adoption of IFRS.
The main items contributing to the change in financial information, compared with that reported 
under UK GAAP as at the transition date, are shown below:
IAS 12 – Income Taxes
In accordance with IAS 12 deferred tax assets are disclosed as non-current, which is contrary to FRS 102.
IAS 36 – Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36, the Directors have assessed the carrying value of goodwill and determined 
it was fully impaired at 1 August 2013. This goodwill had been fully written down under UK GAAP by 
31 July 2015, so there is no impact on previously reported equity from this date.
There was no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group.
There was no impact on either the income statement, the statement of financial position or the 
statement of cash flows for the Company.

ACHIEVING 
SUSTAINABLE 
SUCCESS
Set out below are the income statements showing the 
results for each of the 4 years to 31 July 2017. On 11 July 
2014, the Group changed its accounting reference 
date from 31 July to 30 April. On 5 April 2015, the 
Group changed its accounting reference date back 
to 31 July. The Directors believe that the historical 
information is more helpful when provided as the years 
ending 31 July 2014 and 2015 and this information 
was included as an additional disclosure in note 32 
of the Historical Financial Information 
in Section B of 
Part 10 to the 
Prospectus issued 
on 1 March 2017.
As explained in note 8 to the Financial Statements, 
the Directors have reclassified to cost of sales, 
certain costs that had previously been reported as 
part of both distribution costs and administrative 
expenses. Along with the restatement of the 2016 
results referred to in note 8, the impact on the 2014 
and 2015 results respectively is the reclassification 
of £1,129,000 and £1,140,000 from distribution 
costs and the reclassification of £357,000 and 
£454,000 from administrative expenses. The result 
has been an increase in cost of sales of £1,486,000 
and £1,594,000 for the years ended 31 July 2014 and 
2015 respectively. The restatements have had no 
impact on previously reported profit or equity.
