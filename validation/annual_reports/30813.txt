Chairman’s statement
RAPID AND ENCOURAGING
 PR O G RE S S
 • Continued strong growth despite a 
tougher environment for our customers
 • Resilient UK performance is a testament 
to the quality of our franchisees
 • International expansion provides growth 
potential on many fronts
 • Your Board’s approach to capital 
allocation balances immediate returns 
with investment in the longer term 
sustainability of growth
Overview
I am pleased to report that Domino’s has 
achieved another year of good growth, despite 
a more challenging market environment. 
The UK remains one of the leading franchises 
across the Domino’s network worldwide, 
and our franchisees are rightly considered 
to be among the very best anywhere in the 
world. Between them, they increased our 
UK network by a record 95 outlets and at the 
end of 2017 we traded from 1,045 stores 
in the UK. We also took the opportunity 
to acquire a majority stake in the largest 
franchisee in the London area. This will 
be a platform for more rapid growth in the 
currently under -developed London market, 
and for the development of innovation in 
technology, pricing and menus.
Outside our home market, progress has 
been encouraging. In the Republic of Ireland, 
we opened our first stores for six years 
in response to the strong economic 
recovery in that market. We are seeing 
an acceleration in growth in Switzerland, 
driven by changes to menu pricing and 
a very strong online performance.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 03
In our newer markets we took majority 
ownership in Iceland, Norway and Sweden 
during the year, and accelerated our growth 
plans in Norway by acquiring Dolly Dimple’s, 
the number three player. Just before the year 
end we announced plans to move to 95% 
ownership in Iceland. In Germany, where we 
are a 33% shareholder, Domino’s agreed 
terms to acquire the largest remaining 
independent pizza chain, Hallo Pizza. We 
are confident of the prospects for all of 
these markets, which offer a further exciting 
stage of growth for Domino's shareholders.
Group at a glance page 04
Capital allocation and 
returns to shareholders
One of the most distinctive aspects of the 
Domino’s business model is its strong cash 
generation. The Board has a rigorous approach 
to capital allocation – making sure that existing 
businesses are invested in to maintain and 
grow competitive advantage, appraising new 
growth opportunities, and returning cash 
to shareholders, all within an appropriate 
capital structure.
In this regard, 2017 has been a notable year. 
In respect of organic investment, we 
substantially completed our single biggest 
ever capital project, the new supply chain 
centre in Warrington, with a total budget of 
nearly £40m. In terms of expansionary growth 
opportunities, we made or announced £57.7m 
of acquisitions to strengthen and accelerate 
our ambition in several overseas markets, 
as described above. 
Cash returns to shareholders during the 
year totalled £77.0m, including £36.6m of 
share buybacks. We maintained our strong 
growth track record for the ordinary dividend, 
raising it by 12.5% to give a total dividend 
for the year of 9.00p. The proposed final 
dividend of 5.25p per share will, subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting on 19th April 2018, be paid on 24th 
April 2018 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 16th March 2018. 
Tveita, Oslo, 
Norway: “sell 
more pizza, have 
more fun.”
To support these uses of capital and to 
establish a more efficient funding structure, 
the Board also raised the Group’s leverage 
target to 1.75–2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. 
Given that the Group was in a net cash 
position only two years ago, this is clearly 
a significant development of policy, but we 
believe it gives us the necessary flexibility 
to pursue attractive growth opportunities, 
while maintaining a degree of conservatism 
should the environment deteriorate.
Our stakeholders
The enduring success of Domino’s owes 
much to the strength of its relationships 
with its key stakeholders. First and foremost, 
our franchisees continue to excel both against 
their competitors and their peers around 
the world. Their commitment to our 
customers, and to continuous business 
improvement, is as outstanding as ever.
I would also like to acknowledge the huge 
support of the global Domino’s network, 
and the benefits of knowledge sharing and 
brand visibility it brings; our suppliers, for 
the quality and reliability they bring to our 
partnership; and of course our customers, 
who remain as enthusiastic as ever about 
Domino’s pizza despite the increasing 
choices available to them.
Corporate social responsibility report page 28
Conclusion
2017 has been a year of significant evolution 
and progress, despite a weaker consumer 
environment in our core market. This reflects 
our belief in the strength of the business 
model and our determination to manage for 
the long term. Where we see opportunities 
to invest for growth, we will continue to 
take them, and I remain optimistic about 
our prospects.

“ Our franchisees continue

competitors and their peers 
around the world.” STRATEGIC REPORT
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 04
We are part of the global Domino’s system, 
the biggest pizza delivery operator in the 
world. We make, sell and deliver pizza and 
a range of other dishes under the Domino’s 
brand from 1,192 stores across six European 
markets. We also have a one-third interest 
in Domino’s Germany.
We hold the exclusive master franchise 
rights in these six markets under long -term 
agreements with Domino’s Pizza 
International Franchising Inc., the 
international arm of Domino’s Pizza Inc 
which is listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange and which owns the 
Domino’s brand across the globe.
In the UK and Republic of Ireland, we are 
the clear number one pizza delivery business. 
Our market share in the UK is 46%. Customers 
love Domino’s because it tastes great, and 
is fast and convenient. We operate stores 
almost entirely through franchisee partners. 
We manufacture dough and act as a scale 
and expert wholesaler of other food and 
non-food supplies to our franchisees. 
We invest in technology to develop the 
ordering platform, making it easy for 
customers and improving franchisees’ 
operations, and we market the brand and 
plan national promotions. 
Our franchisees open and run stores, and 
earn a return from the margin they make 
on making and selling pizza. They employ, 
train and develop their own teams, set prices 
locally and invest in local marketing.
In our other markets, we mainly run the 
stores ourselves. We will look to franchise 
out stores in most markets as we achieve 
greater scale and profitability through 
a larger network. Profitability and returns 
can be further enhanced over time through 
investment in dough manufacturing 
capacity and our supply chain.

Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 06
The market
The Group has a very strong position in 
the UK food delivery market, which is 
experiencing continued growth and in 
which pizza is the most popular cuisine. 
There are a number of ongoing secular 
drivers for the market which give us 
confidence in its sustained 
long-term growth.
On the other hand, we have seen a rise 
in competition from new business 
models which provide customers with 
increased choice and alternative ways 
to order delivered food. In the short 
term, our franchisees are also 
experiencing cost pressures from 
inflation in labour and food. Finally, the 
broader economic environment is also 
putting pressure on customers’ spending 
power. Each of these factors is analysed 
in more detail below. In summary, our 
scale, brand and operational excellence 
continue to confer a significant 
competitive advantage. 
The focus of the analysis is the UK market 
as that represents the vast majority of 
our revenue and profitability, but we 
see similar long-term trends for 
delivered food in our other markets.
UK delivered food market
The UK delivered food market is worth 
£6.2 billion and was estimated to grow at 
11% in 2016–2017, and grew at a compound 
rate of 14% between 2014 and 2016. The 
main drivers of this growth have been 
technology, convenience and choice. In 
our annual survey, among the nearly 40% 
of respondents who were ordering 
delivered food more often:
 •
40% cited ease of ordering
 •
33% said it was more convenient 
than going out
 •
24% liked the wider variety of 
options available
 •
24% admitted to having less time 
to cook at home
According to the survey, this growth is 
migrating in broadly equal measure from 
cooking in and ready meals on the one hand, 
and dining out and takeaways on the other. 
We anticipate all of these trends to continue, 
leading to further growth in the market.
One additional factor in the strength of the 
delivered food market is the rise in home 
entertainment: big screen televisions, 
catch-up TV, streaming services and 
interactive gaming have all increased the 
number of occasions when households 
“order in”.
Pizza delivery
Pizza is the single biggest cuisine within 
the delivered food market, accounting 
for £2.1bn of sales (including “pre-order 
carry-out”, or collection sales). Pizza has 
been a very successful delivered food for 
many years because it appeals to a wide 
range of tastes, it is quick to cook fresh, 
it travels easily while retaining its heat, 
and it has a relatively high margin 
because of its mix of ingredients.
Pizza continues to grow, albeit at a lower 
rate than the overall market for delivered 
food. This reflects the recent increased 
availability of a wider range of cuisines 
for delivery. However, Domino’s growth 
has kept pace with the wider market over 
the last three years, as we have continued 
to take share in the pizza segment.

Broader economic drivers
There has always been a strong 
correlation between the rate of 
economic growth and the level of 
spending in the restaurant and food 
delivery sectors. Food delivery tends 
to be more insulated than dining out 
because it can act as a “trading down” 
option when consumers are being 
more cost conscious. This year has 
witnessed not only slower economic 
growth, but also wage inflation lagging 
broader cost inflation, reducing 
consumers’ disposable income.
Our annual consumer survey clearly 
highlighted the increasing importance 
of value for money as a consideration 
for customers. Of those customers 
surveyed who ordered pizza less 
frequently this year, 44% said it was 
because pizza was less good value for 
money than other cuisines. 
While all our analysis shows that pizza 
continues to be the most cost-effective 
way of feeding a family with delivered 
food, the pizza market model of higher 
menu prices and big promotional 
discounts can make it harder to 
compare with other cuisines in value 
terms and may affect value perception 
as a result. This is something we began 
to address during 2017 through clearer 
pricing communication, and will 
continue to focus on in 2018. 
The collection market
While the traditional takeaway or collection 
market has seen a shift towards delivery 
over time, this remains a core segment. The 
attractions of collection for customers are 
that it is a source of quick, convenient hot 
food during the daytime, and in the evening 
it can be picked up on the way home. As a 
result, it often serves the impulse market as 
well. Given the lack of delivery costs for 
restaurants, the deals and promotions on 
offer for collection are particularly strong.
For Domino’s, collection is a core part of our 
growth strategy. Increasingly our stores are 
located in high visibility, easy access locations 
close to other shops and businesses. 
Furthermore, it is our belief that customers 
who live within a mile of a Domino’s have a 
higher propensity for collection, and that this 
business is incremental to delivery orders. 
The competitive landscape
Competition in delivered food splits broadly 
between the more traditional pizza delivery 
businesses, and online aggregators enabling 
newer entrants offering different cuisines 
via a single online or app-based portal. 
Within the UK pizza market, we estimate 
our 2017 market share to be around 46%. 
Our two main branded competitors, 
Papa John’s and Pizza Hut, have a combined 
market share of 20–25%. The rest of the 
market comprises small local chains and 
independent operators. Our growth in market 
share has been driven by our brand, our 
scale, our growing store network and the 
quality and consistency of our pizzas. We 
expect these drivers to continue to support 
further share growth for Domino’s.
In recent years a number of new businesses 
have launched which give customers easier 
access to a much wider range of options 
for ordering delivered food online. There 
are two distinct business models. A pure 
“aggregator”, such as Just Eat, enables 
customers to place online orders with a 
wide range of local restaurants, with a 
focus on smaller chains and independents; 
these restaurants then deliver the order 
themselves. Businesses such as Deliveroo 
focus more on branded restaurant chains 
and also take care of delivery.
These developments have increased choice 
for customers and offer the convenience 
of ordering a range of cuisines through a 
single app. This has also grown awareness 
of delivered food, and the combination of 
greater convenience and wider publicity 
has stimulated market growth. Our own 
investment in our digital platform has been 
a key response to this, driving significant 
online participation and increasing order 
sizes and repeat business.
Domino’s will continue to enjoy two very 
important competitive advantages: first, 
the inherent benefits of pizza as a delivered 
food discussed above; and second, the 
control of the end-to-end customer 
experience, from the ordering platform, 
through the food procurement and the 
cooking of the pizza, to the delivery itself.
Changing tastes and 
health considerations
Obesity and related health problems are 
quite rightly a major factor in public policy. 
The promotion of a balanced diet with fewer 
processed foods, as well as the introduction 
in 2018 of the “sugar tax”, serve to raise 
broader awareness and influence consumer 
behaviour. Takeaway and delivered food does 
from time to time come under the spotlight.
Our customers on average order from 
Domino’s five times a year, making pizza an 
occasional treat rather than a central part 
of their diet. Our pizzas are baked using fresh 
dough, 100% mozzarella cheese and other 
carefully sourced, high quality ingredients.
We introduced our Italiano pizza range in 
2016, with thinner crust and more exclusive 
toppings, which have fewer calories overall 
than the equivalent traditional Domino’s pizza. 
Our low fat mozzarella cheese has 33% less 
fat than our regular mozzarella. We also offer 
gluten-free bases and a range of chicken 
sides and salads, to appeal to those customers 
who want a higher protein or lower 
carbohydrate option.
Labour and food costs
The two biggest cost drivers in the 
broader restaurant market are labour 
and food. For our franchisees, these 
costs typically account for nearly 60% 
of revenue.
Labour costs have experienced significant 
inflation over the last two years with 
increases to the UK National Living Wage. 
In 2015 the hourly rate for someone aged 
25 was £6.70, since when it has 
increased by 12% to £7.50. We have also 
seen a tighter labour market, created by 
high levels of employment and increased 
demand for delivery drivers from the 
new entrants described above.
The Group and our franchisees are 
well positioned to absorb these rises 
relative to other operators in the market, 
given the very strong economics of 
our stores. Our franchisees also 
differentiate themselves from delivery 
service companies by offering full 
employment terms to drivers rather 
than flexible contracts. 
Food costs, particularly dairy, are volatile 
in nature. Supply capacity inevitably lags 
price moves both up and down, thus 
exaggerating any movements in the market. 
Foreign exchange movements also play a 
significant role as most foodstuffs are 
easily traded across the European Union.
After a prolonged period of price 
deflation in 2015–2016, prices rose 
strongly from mid-2016 as a result of the 
EU referendum result which saw sterling 
fall heavily against the euro. We expect 
food inflation to continue into 2018.

Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 08
Overview
It has been a year of excellent operational 
and strategic development for Domino’s 
Pizza Group, with continued organic growth 
in established markets enhanced by an 
increasing presence in a number of newer 
markets. We are seeking to build a portfolio 
of assets at different stages of maturity 
which together provide long-term, 
sustainable growth. 
Our strategy across all of our markets remains 
simple and clear. We aim to be the number 
one pizza company in each neighbourhood, 
through a commitment to offering the best 
product and service to our customers.
UK
The UK market moderated this year, after 
three years of very strong like-for-like 
growth. Consumers were more cautious 
and value conscious, and incomes were 
squeezed as wage inflation lagged broader 
cost inflation. The competitive environment 
continued to evolve, with delivery service 
companies continuing to invest heavily in 
growing scale.
Despite these dynamics, Domino’s achieved 
another good performance. On a 52 week 
basis system sales were up 8.6%, driven by 
growth from order volume of 6.5% and 
1.9% on average order value. Like for like 
sales growth (excluding effect of splitting 
territories) was 4.8%. We continued to take 
share in the pizza delivery market, thanks 
to our scale, our physical expansion, the 
strength of our brand and the quality of our 
product; and we held our share of the 
overall delivered food market, which 
continues to grow strongly.
New store growth was the key driver of our 
performance in the year. After 81 new openings 
in 2016, our franchise partners opened a 
further 95 in 2017. With 1,045 stores now 
across the UK, we are confident of 
reaching our target of 1,600.
Around two-thirds of new store openings 
are coming in existing territories, where 
franchisees are realising the significant 
customer service and financial benefits 
of splitting territories. 
The inherent profitability of the system and 
the strength of the brand are also enabling 
franchisees to make attractive returns in 
increasingly small standalone catchment 
areas. For example, in market towns of no 
more than 10,000 households, a Domino’s 
store is likely to be the only branded quick 
service restaurant or food delivery 
business, leading to a disproportionate 
market share.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 09
While the sales growth drivers of our business 
can be simplified down to new openings 
and like-for-like growth from existing 
stores, these factors and the overall 
profitability of the system are in turn 
underpinned by the operational areas of 
focus discussed below.
Customer value and experience
We operate in a highly competitive 
marketplace. Technology and new business 
models have given customers more choice 
than ever, both in terms of the range of 
cuisines available and the number of ways 
they can order. At the same time, they have 
become much more value conscious over 
the last year as incomes are squeezed by 
inflation. This became most evident to us 
early in 2017, when our Winter Survival deal 
performed poorly compared to previous years 
as a result of a less compelling value proposition.
We believe pizza to be the best value 
delivered food, but it is not always perceived 
that way by customers. This is partly a result 
of the promotional nature of pizza delivery 
pricing: published menu prices appear high 
relative to some alternatives, but in fact in 
2017, 87% of our orders in the UK were on 
some kind of promotion, and the average 
discount was 38%. As a result, many 
customers are still left with the false 
perception of high menu prices.
During the second half of the year, we 
worked with our franchisee partners to 
address customer value more directly. 
This included a decision to invest up to 
£4 million in absorbing food cost inflation 
on behalf of franchisees to ensure 
customers were getting the best value 
possible. In September we launched a 
national campaign focusing on the price of 
an individual pizza with our ‘Dine for £9.99’ 
offer, which was our most successful 
campaign of the year in terms of sales. 
Additionally, we have sought to push our 
value message harder in our collection 
business. In the Spring, we launched our 
‘Walk in Wins’ campaign, a ‘Buy One Get 
One Free’ offer on collected pizza which 
has been running permanently since then.
“ With 1,045 stores now across 
the UK, we are very confident 
of reaching our target of 1,600.”
Our 1,000th store 
was opened 
in Overton, 
Hampshire.
We have also made it even easier for 
customers to see that they are getting the 
best deal available to them. The app and 
website landing pages now show all the 
current promotions, and our Deal Wizard 
automatically updates a customer’s basket 
for the best deal for their selections. 
On the customer experience side, we 
continue to make the best use of our 
greatest competitive advantage: the 
Domino’s control of the end-to-end 
customer journey. This is a crucial 
differentiator from the delivery service 
companies or aggregators. Domino’s 
sources ingredients, runs the ordering 
platform, cooks your pizza fresh in a local 
store, and brings it to your door courtesy 
of Domino’s delivery drivers who are 
directly employed by franchisees. 
We made further significant enhancements 
to our digital platform during the year. 
We have added voice ordering through 
Amazon Alexa and integrated Apple Pay 
as a payment option. Our major web 
releases throughout the year focused on 
continuous improvement to the customer 
journey, reducing page load times and 
adding functionality such as saved card 
details and previous baskets. For the full 
year, 75.2% of sales by value were ordered 
online, up from 71.8% in 2016.
Throughout Domino’s, the customer 
service benefits of the “Golden Mile” are 
a strong driver for growth: the closer we 
are to customers, the quicker the pizza gets 
delivered and the higher volume of collection 
business we achieve. Quicker delivery 
significantly enhances the customer 
experience and leads to a higher level of 
repeat ordering. Our key ‘Delivered On 
Time’ metric measures what proportion of 
orders reach customers within 30 minutes. 
During the year, our % DOT fell very 
slightly, from 82.9% of orders to 81.8%, 
but still remains a key differentiator. 
Increased density of the store network 
also raises our brand visibility, with each 
store effectively acting as a billboard.
Our collection business performed strongly 
over the year, underpinned by new stores 
and territory splitting. Total collection sales 
were up 12.6% and represented 21.4% of 
system sales. For new and immature stores, 
collection represented 31% of sales. 
Finally on customer experience, we 
introduced new food options to keep the 
menu up to date and cater for changing 
tastes. These include our Chipotle Pulled 
Pork pizza and a Chilli Cheese stuffed crust, 
both of which have been very popular with 
customers. We also extended our desserts 
range to include the Lotta-Chocca pizza and 
Cinni Dippers.

UK continued
Brand
The Domino’s brand is a highly significant 
asset for the Group and our franchisees. 
For many of our customers, ‘Domino’s’ 
has become synonymous with ‘pizza’ in a 
way that has no equivalent across other 
types of delivered food. In our detailed 
annual consumer survey, our unprompted 
awareness was 54%, compared to 31% 
for our closest pizza delivery competitor 
and 19% for the closest aggregator 
(source: Parthenon Study, 2017).
The growth in the overall system creates a 
virtuous circle. Franchisees contribute 4% 
of sales to the National Advertising Fund, 
which we then invest in brand marketing on 
their behalf, to drive both brand values and 
specific promotions. These investments 
drive greater sales, underpinning returns 
on new store openings for franchisees. 
New stores increase the visibility of the 
brand, improve customer service (as 
discussed above) and grow the top line, 
swelling the brand budget further.
Business model page 14
In September 2017 we launched our new 
brand campaign, “The Official Food of 
Everything”, which clearly positions Domino’s 
as an established category leader – a timely 
evolution from our previous challenger brand 
positioning. The impact of the campaign in 
brand recall has been very strong, with 
recognition of the positioning running at 
three times the level of previous campaigns, 
and unprompted awareness at 84% – our 
highest ever. We continued to support our 
above the line presence with the sponsorship 
of TV shows such as The Voice and 
Hollyoaks, targeting key audiences and 
family home entertainment events.
While the annual survey demonstrated 
continued strength in key areas such as 
great tasting food and convenience, we 
witnessed an emerging weakness in value 
for money perception, with prices being 
cited as the single biggest barrier to 
increased repeat ordering. This, combined 
with the weaker trading witnessed in the 
early months of 2017, informed our value 
for money communications strategy 
outlined above.
Franchisee profitability and alignment
Our franchisees remain some of the best 
entrepreneurs and operators in the Domino’s 
system worldwide. Our interests are aligned: 
we all benefit from increased scale, through 
the growing value of the brand, greater 
supply chain efficiency and the shared 
investment in new innovations to improve 
the customer experience continuously.
The 2014–2016 period was an extraordinary 
one for the system and for franchisees, with 
very strong order growth (supported by 
rapid online adoption and the secular trend 
towards in-home entertainment) combined 
with sustained deflation in food costs. 
Between 2013 and 2016, average per 
store EBITDA for franchisees increased 
very strongly.
2017 saw a return to more normalised sales 
growth rates, combined with cost pressures 
on both labour and food. Nonetheless, the 
combination of like-for-like sales growth 
with the procurement benefits of our scale 
saw franchisee EBITDA per store (excluding 
the impact of splitting territories) maintained 
year-on-year at just over £150,000. This 
figure remains significantly ahead of the 
average from 2011-2013, and provides a 
typical payback on a new store opening 
of around three years.
We want to help our franchisees maintain 
this rate of payback. As a result, not only 
have we provided support on food cost 
inflation as described above – to ensure 
that customers continue to get great value 
for money – but we have also developed a 
number of innovations to improve operating 
efficiency and drive down costs. Most recently 
In September 
2017 we launched 
our “The Official 
Food of Everything” 
campaign.
we have started to introduce GPS across 
the store portfolio. This allows franchisees 
to track delivery drivers more effectively 
and leads to significant improvements in 
labour productivity. It is now operational in 
471 stores, and we expect to complete 
roll-out by Q3 of 2018.
A further development of alignment with 
franchisees in 2017 came with our acquisition 
of a 75% interest in the largest franchisee in 
the London area, with 25 stores. Domino’s 
is significantly under-represented in London, 
a market which we believe accounts for 25% 
of delivered food in the UK but only 14% of 
our sales. We aim to grow this business 
more aggressively under direct ownership.
This is the first time for many years that the 
Group has taken control of a portfolio of 
stores in the UK, but it is common practice 
across the Domino’s system worldwide to 
have a small proportion of stores directly 
operated. Store ownership aligns us more 
closely with franchisees by making us 
operators as well as master franchise 
holders, and gives our management valuable 
operational experience. It also allows us to 
test pricing, menus and technology in a live 
environment and use the results to support 
and influence the franchisee network further. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 11
Supply chain and infrastructure
Our supply chain in the UK is one of the 
most efficient in the Domino’s network. 
It is also a major source of differentiation 
versus our competitors, whether in the 
restaurant or aggregator space. The margin 
generated within the Domino’s system from 
being vertically integrated from dough 
manufacture, through value-added food 
and non-food distribution, to our own 
ordering platform and franchisees’ stores, 
allows both the Group and our franchisees 
to make excellent returns.
The rapid growth over the last few years 
and our future plans have led to our single 
biggest ever investment this year, with the 
development of a new supply chain centre 
in Warrington. The total cash investment 
in 2017 was £26.7m and on completion the 
programme will have cost £37m–£39m.
The facility is due to enter service in spring 
2018, and will combine with our existing 
supply chain centres to give us capacity 
to serve at least the 1,600 stores we are 
targeting, at projected levels of store sales. 
Its scale and level of automation will deliver 
efficiencies of up to 10% cost per tray of 
dough in real terms by 2021. As indicated at 
the time of our interim results, there will be 
a short term impact of an additional £3m in 
operating costs and depreciation in 2018 as 
the plant ramps production.
“  W e e x p e c t I n t e r na t i ona l 
to represent an increasing 
proportion of the Group’s 
profits and cash flow over 
the longer term.”
Online sales 
were up 28.8% 
year-on-year and 
now represent 57% 
of total sales.
ROI
Growth in the Republic of Ireland accelerated 
in 2017, buoyed by a recovering economy 
and by our own actions, particularly in digital. 
Local currency system sales on a 52 week 
basis were up 11.3%, with like-for-like 
growth of 10.8%. On a 52 week reported 
basis, system sales were up 19.9% to 
£60.1m, reflecting the weakness 
of sterling year-on-year.
Online sales were up 28.8% 
year-on-year in local 
currency, and now 
represent 56.9% of total 
sales. We opened our first 
new stores in ROI for six 
years, taking the total up 
by two to 49, with plans for 
further new stores in 2018. 
We also plan to invest in extending 
our supply chain capacity to allow us to 
serve 75 stores in ROI as well as our stores 
in Northern Ireland.
International
Our controlled operations now comprise 
four markets: Switzerland, Iceland, Norway 
and Sweden and our associate in Germany. 
In each of these markets we see a clear 
opportunity to build strongly profitable 
businesses with local scale, adapted to their 
markets but leveraging our proven 
expertise in supply chain, digital and 
franchisee management. 
Consolidated system sales for the 
year from our International operations 
were £78.1m, with an underlying EBIT 
contribution of £0.8m.
We expect International to represent an 
increasing proportion of the Group’s profits 
and cash flow over the longer term, both 
from the development of our existing 
markets and entry into selected new 
markets with similar dynamics.
In Switzerland, we made significant 
progress during the year. Total system 
sales on a 52 week basis were up 17.1% in 
local currency, and up 15.7% like-for-like. 
There were two significant drivers of 
this acceleration: revised menu pricing 
and increased online participation.

International continued
In H1, we lowered menu prices and 
introduced a delivery charge. As a result, 
we saw our average ticket price fall 13.2% 
but achieved order volume growth over 
the year of 34.9%. Online sales grew 56.6% 
and now account for 55.4% of total sales. 
We opened a new store in Q4 and have 
plans for several further openings in 2018, 
at a lower cost per store than our previous 
operating model in Switzerland.
Iceland
Since we took majority ownership of Iceland 
in May 2017 total system sales were £28.9m. 
Sales growth was 10.8% in local currency 
on a pro forma basis. Domino’s Iceland is 
the leading quick service restaurant in the 
market and achieves weekly unit sales of 
over £37,000, comfortably the highest of 
any Domino’s operation worldwide. During 
the year we opened a further two stores, 
taking the total to 23.
In December 2017 we announced our 
intention to acquire a further 44.3% stake 
in Domino’s Iceland, taking our ownership 
to 95.3%. The transaction was completed 
in January 2018. 
Norway
Our expansion in Norway accelerated 
significantly in 2017 with the acquisition 
of Dolly Dimple’s, the number three pizza 
operator in the market, with 39 stores. At 
the year end we had converted 9 stores to 
the Domino’s brand, giving a total portfolio 
of 27 Domino’s stores. Conversions are 
performing well, with weekly sales up 
around 50% on average compared to 
their previous runrate.
Pro forma system sales growth from the 
Domino’s branded chain was 94.6%, with 
like-for-like growth of 13.5%. We expect to 
complete another 10 conversions in 2018, 
as well as opening further greenfield sites. 
7 Domino’s stores in the South of Oslo and 
Southern regions are franchised, and we will 
seek to identify further franchisee partners.
Sweden
We opened our first stores in Sweden in 
late 2016 and by the 2017 year end, we had 
6 stores. Weekly sales of around £18,000 
are an encouraging sign of the popularity 
of our pizza and indicate that we can grow 
a profitable business in Sweden. Further 
store openings are in the pipeline for 2018.
Germany
In Germany, where we are a one-third 
associate partner in a joint venture 
with Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, the 
Australian-listed master franchisee, 
progress continues to be good. The 
integration of Joey’s, acquired in 2016, 
is complete, and in October 2017 we 
announced the acquisition of Hallo Pizza, 
another leading independent chain. 
Once the Hallo Pizza stores have been 
converted, we will operate a portfolio 
of over 300 stores in Germany, with 
significant opportunity for long-term 
growth in Europe’s largest economy.

and a shared vision underpins everything 
we do. I’d like to extend my thanks and 
appreciation to all of them for their 
continued commitment.
Outlook
I remain confident in the outlook for the 
Group, and the year has started in line with 
our expectations. It is not an accident that 
pizza is the most successful delivered food 
in the world. It is quick to make fresh, travels 
well while retaining its heat, enjoys a high 
margin thanks to its mix of ingredients, 
and has a sufficient ticket size to absorb 
the cost of delivery. 
We will continue to grow in the UK, getting 
closer to new communities through a target 
of 65-75 new store openings in 2018, and 
providing ongoing enhancements to service 
through our investments in technology and 
our supply chain. We expect capex for 2018 
to be around £30m. We will continue to face 
competitive threats from branded pizza 
delivery businesses and delivery service 
businesses, but our excellent unit economics 
and our control of the end-to-end 
customer experience are important 
and sustainable differentiators.
Internationally, we are still in the early stages 
of our development but all of our controlled 
markets benefit from strong sales per store 
already – a very encouraging sign for the 
future. We will focus on developing per 
store profitability, adding on supply chain 
margin when the scale justifies it, and 
building the brand to facilitate successful 
digital growth and regional roll-out. We will 
also review any opportunities to enter 
additional markets in Northern Europe. 
Finally, we will continue to balance the 
long-term needs of the business with 
returns of excess capital to shareholders, 
and plan to invest up to £50m in 2018 in 
our share buyback programme.

Business model
We are different from most UK-listed restaurant businesses in that we 
operate a franchise model. This means we can grow with relatively 
low capital intensity, generating high returns. The dynamics of the 
business are much more akin to a branded food manufacturer and 
distributor, and our areas of investment reflect this.

Domino’s Pizza International Franchising 
Inc. (‘DPI’) assigns an exclusive ten-year 
Master Franchise Agreement to the Group 
in each country. If we remain of good 
standing, we have a legal right to renew. 
We pay DPI a royalty fee of 2.7% of system 
sales, in return for which we have exclusive 
rights to the use of the Domino’s brand, 
and the benefit of the shared expertise

We have historically generated a return on 
invested capital comfortably above our 
cost of capital, growing the intrinsic value 
of the business. We pay a progressive 
dividend while maintaining cover of 1.5–2x 
relative to earnings, and have a policy of 
returning excess capital to shareholders 
too, typically through share buybacks.
3
We make money by selling dough and 
other food and non-food products to 
our franchisees. They operate under a 
Standard Franchise Agreement for each 
territory that they manage. Franchisees 
meet the cost of new store openings, 
which enables us to grow our reach with 
limited capital intensity. In the UK, they 
pay us a royalty fee of 5.5% of system 
sales, and contribute a further 4% to the 
National Advertising Fund, which we 
invest in the brand on their behalf.

Franchisees make money by making and 
selling pizza and other food items to end 
customers. They supplement the national 
advertising budget with local marketing, 
and invest in labour to provide strong 
customer service. Franchisee profitability 
is an important driver of growth for Domino’s 
as it is a key variable in new store openings. 
Average opening costs are £300k and 
average mature store EBITDA in the UK 
for 2017 was £151k.

BRAND
We are part of a global system covering 80 
countries, with a brand that has become 
synonymous with delivered pizza in recent 
years. We invest 4% of system sales on behalf 
of franchisees in national advertising, 
TV sponsorship and other brand-building 
activity. We also build and protect the brand 
through very high operating standards to which 
our franchisees need to adhere, a commitment 
to high quality, fresh ingredients and continuous 
innovation to enhance service for customers.
SUPPLY CHAIN
We make fresh dough and deliver it to our UK 
stores three times a week, along with all the other 
food and supplies that franchisees need to make 
and sell great pizza. This is how we make money, 
so this is where we make our biggest investments. 
In 2018 we will complete our new commissary and 
Supply Chain Centre in Warrington, at an expected 
budget of £40m. This will give us sufficient highly 
efficient capacity to produce dough for our target 
of 1,600 stores. Our franchisees benefit from the 
huge scale and logistics advantages we provide 
– giving cost economics that their competitors 
are not able to replicate.
TECHNOLOGY
Our investment in technology serves two main 
purposes – to make constant improvements to 
the customer ordering experience, and to help 
franchisees maximise their own operating 
efficiency. Customers have a widening range of 
ways to order delivered food, and we need to be 
at the forefront of technology innovation to earn 
and retain their loyalty. For franchisees, 
technology tools such as GPS help them to 
manage labour costs and provide an even better 
service for customers. The scale of the Domino’s 
system allows us to spread the investment cost 
effectively over a large franchisee base.
CORPORATE STORES
We have recently begun to invest in directly 
operated stores – a new use of capital for 
the Group. This makes sense in new countries 
where we need to build up store-level 
profitability before attracting franchisees to 
take on the next stage of growth. We are also 
investing in our own stores in London, where our 
market share is much lower than elsewhere in 
the UK. Other benefits include the operational 
experience it gives our management team, and 
the ability to test new menus, pricing and 
technology in a live environment before 
introducing them to the wider franchisee base.

INVESTMENT IN KEY ASSETS
Our business is built on our ongoing investment 
in key assets – our brand, technology and 
supply chain. These drive sales and profitability 
for our franchisees, increasing the scale of the 
system, generating cash for reinvestment and 
thus creating a virtuous circle. We now also 
invest selectively in our own stores. STRATEGIC REPORT
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 16
Introduction
In this section I cover all the financial 
aspects of the business – looking not only 
at performance but also at other significant 
value drivers such as capital allocation and 
structure, and return on capital employed. 
2017 has witnessed a material evolution in 
our capital strategy which I cover in some 
detail below.
In any analysis of our performance, it is 
important to understand the difference 
between system sales and statutory revenue, 
and why we as a business focus more on 
the former as a driver of performance 
rather than statutory revenue.
System sales are the total sales to 
end customers through our network 
of stores. For stores owned and operated 
by franchisees, these are not in our statutory 
revenue but do drive revenue through 
food sales to franchisees and royalty fees. 
For stores which we own and operate 
ourselves (which we call “corporate stores”), 
these do appear in our statutory revenue. 
The vast majority of our store network is 
franchisee operated.
Statutory revenue consists of food and 
non-food sales to franchisees, royalties 
paid by franchisees, rental income and 
end-customer sales in our corporate 
stores (see above).
Statutory revenue is a more volatile indicator 
of our performance for two reasons. First, 
food wholesale prices are much more 
volatile than menu prices; this means that 
the unit price of goods we sell to franchisees 
fluctuates more than the prices paid by 
customers. As a result, system sales give a 
useful alternative reading over time of the 
health and growth of the business. Second, 
revenue contains items such as rental 
income which are only accounted 
for because we hold the head leases for 
our franchisees’ stores and then sub-let 
to them; these are not a driver of value.
From a performance perspective, we 
are also much more focused on operating 
margin as measured against system sales 
than against statutory revenue. The volatility 
of dairy prices means that we target a cash 
gross profit per unit from cheese, rather than 
a percentage gross margin. When prices 
are falling, our statutory margin percentage 
rises, and vice versa. However, this has little 
bearing on the system sales operating margin, 
which tends to iron out food price volatility.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 17
Performance reporting
The 2017 year comprised 53 weeks whereas 
the 2016 year comprised 52 weeks. In this 
section, all figures are given on a 52 week 
versus 52 week basis unless otherwise 
stated. The statutory reporting section 
gives all growth rates on a reported basis. 
System sales and drivers
Group system sales were up 15.1% in the 
year to £1,155.7m. Excluding the impacts 
of foreign exchange movements and 
acquisitions, Group system sales were 
up 8.9%.
We saw strong growth in all of our markets. 
The UK, which represented 88% of system 
sales in 2017, saw system sales growth of 
8.6%. H1 system sales growth was slower at 
6.5%, where we faced tough comparative 
figures from the previous year and more 
aggressive competitor activity, growth 
accelerated to 10.6% in H2.
UK like-for-like growth, excluding the 
impact on stores in split territories, was 
4.8%. Again, the performance was weighted 
to the second half, with H1 like-for-like 
growth of 2.4% and H2 of 7.0%. Average 
weekly unit sales in mature stores were 
flat, despite more than 90 stores being 
temporarily affected by territory splits. 
Order volume growth was 6.5% and ticket 
growth was 1.9%, which we view as a 
healthy balance for the business.
We opened 95 stores in the UK, taking 
the base to 1,045. New and immature 
stores generated £90.1m of system sales 
(2016: £26.0m), mature stores generated 
£838.7m (2016: £800.6m), and stores 
affected by territory splits generated 
£90.1m (2016: £111.4m).
Total system sales outside the UK amounted 
to £136.4m. The Republic of Ireland and 
Switzerland grew system sales by 11.3% 
and 17.1% respectively, after adjusting for 
foreign currency effects. Almost all of the 
growth was driven by strong like-for-like 
performance from existing stores, supported 
by increased penetration of online ordering. 
We opened two new stores in the Republic 
of Ireland and one in Switzerland, all in H2.
System sales for our Nordic markets 
were £57.2m. These businesses were 
only consolidated when we took majority 
ownership in May 2017. Average weekly 
unit sales across all of our markets continue 
to be among the strongest in the whole of 
the Domino’s system worldwide.
Operating margin and drivers
Group underlying operating profit for 
the year was £94.0m, up 9.1% year-on-year. 
Our operating margin, measured as a 
percentage of system sales, was 8.1%, 
down 40 basis points over 2016, due to 
the change in business mix with the 
inclusion of earlier stage international 
operations within the group. 
UK & ROI operating profits were up 7.7% 
to £93.2m, driven by the strong top line 
performance with our gross profit drivers 
– royalty fees, food and non-food sales - 
driven by system sales. The margin over 
system sales fell 10 basis points to 8.6%.
Most of our costs are variable, so we do not 
typically experience significant operating 
leverage relative to system sales performance. 
Where we achieve financial benefits from 
increased scale, we typically seek to reinvest 
them in driving growth rather than achieving 
significant margin expansion.
In our International operations, we achieved 
an operating result of £0.8m, reflecting a 
profitable business in Iceland, a positive 
contribution from our German associate, 
and losses in Switzerland, Norway and 
Sweden. Store-level economics in these 
newer markets are encouraging, and 
we are confident of achieving overall 
profitability in each of these countries 
over time.
Underlying profit before tax was £94.4m, 
up 10.2% on a 52 week basis. The strong 
growth reflects the strong sales and profit 
growth in the UK & ROI, offset by the 
consolidation of losses in Sweden 
and Norway.
Statutory reporting
Revenue and operating profit
Revenue for the year rose 31.6% to £474.6m 
on a 53 week basis. The drivers of revenue 
growth were store openings, like-for-like 
growth from existing stores, food cost 
inflation, the acquisition of majority stakes 
in our Nordic businesses, and a positive 
translation effect from a weaker sterling 
exchange rate. On a 52 week basis, 
revenue growth was 29.3%.

Statutory reporting continued
Revenue and operating profit continued
Reported operating profit was £75.5m, 
down 9.0% year-on-year. This number 
includes our joint ventures in the UK and 
Germany, which are accounted for as 
associates and contributed £2.4m 
and £1.4m respectively.
Interest
Net finance costs for 2017 was £(0.1)m 
(2016: £(0.5)m). The higher total interest 
expense reflects the higher average net 
debt through the year as a result of acquisitions 
and share buybacks. The total interest 
expense was offset by £1.8m of finance 
income, of which £1.2m was a net foreign 
exchange gain.
Profit before tax
Statutory profit before tax was £81.2m, 
down 2.0% year-on-year. Non-underlying 
items presented at the half year were a net 
gain of £1.6m. During the second half of the 
year we recognised a further gain of £1.0m 
and expenses of £(17.6)m, resulting in a net 
non-underlying expense of £(15.0)m for the 
full year (2016: £(3.1)m). These related to 
provisions for potential employment tax 
liabilities on a historic share scheme, 
acquisition expenses, store conversion costs 
and an impairment, partly offset by a net 
gain on the step acquisitions in the Nordics.
Taxation
The underlying effective tax rate for 2017 
was 18.3% (2016: 20.3%), reflecting the 
inclusion of our share of post tax profits 
from JVs and associates in underlying 
profit before tax, lower overseas losses, 
and current and deferred tax rate 
differences. The statutory effective tax 
rate was 17.8% (2016: 21.9%), reflecting the 
gain on the step acquisitions in the Nordics 
not being taxable. 
Cash flows and capital allocation
The Group is highly cash generative and 
has many opportunities to invest for 
growth, while also returning excess cash 
to shareholders in a regular and structured 
way. During the year, we took the opportunity 
to revise our target capital structure, 
giving us a more efficient balance sheet 
through increased debt funding.
In 2017 we continued to generate very 
strong net cash flow from operating 
activities, rising 65.4% to £104.2m 
year-on-year. This was supported by 
a strong working capital performance, 
with a net inflow of £18.7m compared 
to an outflow of £10.7m in 2016. 
We deployed a record £168.1m of capital 
during 2017. We run a rigorous 
capital allocation programme with 
clear prioritisations.
1.  Ca p e x. Our number one priority is 
to invest in the infrastructure of the 
business, to improve the customer 
experience and the efficiency of the 
system, and ensure sufficient capacity 
for future growth. This year we invested 
a record £46.6m in the business. 
Of this, £26.7m related to our new 
supply chain centre in Warrington, 
which will give us dough production 
capacity for our target of 1,600 UK 
stores. We also invested £6.2m in IT, 
both to support franchisees in providing 
service to customers and to upgrade 
our own technology platforms. Typically 
we recover our franchisee-related IT 
spend through fees over the following 
three years. £7.2m was invested in 
new stores and conversions, supporting 
our international growth.
2.  Dividends. We returned £40.4m to 
shareholders through the ordinary 
dividend. From a cash perspective, 
this reflects the payments of the final 
dividend for 2016 and the interim 
dividend for 2017. On a declared 
basis, dividends per share for 2017 
amounted to 9.00p (interim 3.75p, 
final 5.25p), up 12.5% on 2016’s 8.00p 
dividend (interim 3.50p, final 4.50p). 
Our policy is for ordinary dividends to 
be 1.7-2x covered by earnings per share.
3.  Acquisitions. We invested £44.5m 
in M&A activity: £20.1m moving 
to majority ownership in Iceland, 
Norway and Sweden and acquiring 
Dolly Dimple’s, a Norwegian pizza 
chain, and £24.4m acquiring a 75% 
stake in our largest London franchisee. 
We will continue to look for opportunities 
to enter new, adjacent markets, build 
scale in existing markets, or add 
expertise to the Group.
4.  Returns of excess capital. When we 
have excess capital relative to our 
target leverage ratio, we will look to 
return it to shareholders to maintain 
capital discipline and an efficient 
balance sheet. During the year we 
invested £36.6m in buying our own 
shares, at an average price of 339.9p. 
We assess the value of share buybacks 
by reference to the Board’s own view 
of intrinsic value as well as an internal 
rate of return calculation.
We ended the year with net debt of 
£89.2m, up from £34.6m at the end of 
2016, giving us a leverage ratio of 0.83 x 
net debt/EBITDA. In December 2017, we 
raised our target leverage ratio to a range 
of 1.75 – 2.5 times net debt/EBITDA, 
giving the business scope to invest when 
opportunities arise while still retaining 
the ability to delever should market 
conditions deteriorate.

Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share for 
2017 was 16.0p on a 53 week basis, 
representing 15.9% growth over last year 
(2016: 13.8p). On a 52 week basis, underlying 
basic earnings per share was 15.7p, up 
13.9%. EPS growth was driven by strong 
sales growth, stable margins as a percentage 
of system sales, and a 1.4% reduction in the 
average share count as a result of share 
buybacks over the last two years.
On a statutory basis, basic earnings per 
share was 13.8p (2016: 13.1p) and diluted 
earnings per share was 13.6p (2016: 12.9p).
Capital employed and balance sheet
Non-current assets have increased by 
£112.9m in the year; the main drivers of this 
are the acquisitions of London corporate 
stores and the controlling stake in the Nordic 
associates. Intangibles assets excluding 
goodwill of £40.8m were recognised on 
the Nordic acquisitions, being the Master 
Franchise Agreements for Iceland, Norway 
and Sweden, and intangibles of £4.5m for 
the Standard Franchise Agreement for the 
UK corporate stores. Goodwill totalling 
£47.8m was recognised on these transactions; 
£21.3m for the Nordics and £26.5m for the 
UK corporate stores. Property, plant and 
equipment additions of £38.1m included 
£28.9m for the new supply chain centre 
at Warrington. 
Current assets have increased £11.6m 
with £5.5m reflecting the consolidation 
of the Nordic operations, £5.9m increase 
in cash and £3.9m NAF receivable balance 
as a result of a short term deficit offset by a 
£3.3m reduction in inventories within UK  
and Ireland. 
Current liabilities have increased £50.9m 
with £27.1m increase in trade and other 
payables of which £17.9m is a result of the 
consolidation of the Nordic acquisitions, 
£8.9m reflects improved working capital 
within the UK and Ireland, an £8.3m increase 
in share buyback obligations and £5.6m 
gross put option liability that is held by 
the non-controlling interest for London 
corporate stores.
The increase in non-current liabilities are 
due to an additional £56.4m drawn on the 
RCF, which was used to fund acquisitions 
in the period, and £34.7m of gross put option 
liabilities that are held by the non-controlling 
interests in the Nordic entities. Provisions 
have increased predominantly due to the 
recognition of £11.0m for the reversionary 
share plan. Deferred tax liabilities have 
increased as deferred tax has been recognised 
on the MFAs acquired during the year. 
The significant changes in equity are the 
corresponding entries for the £40.3m of 
gross put option liabilities held within 
other reserves, and non-controlling 
interests for the Nordic and London 
corporate store subsidiaries.
Treasury management 
In December 2017, the Group successfully 
re-negotiated and increased its unsecured 
revolving multi-currency facility to £350m. 
The facility is for five years with two further 
one-year extensions. The facility’s lower range 
remains at a margin of 75bps above LIBOR 
rising to 180bps with increased leverage, 
plus a utilisation fee of between 0-30% of 
the margin. The Group also completed a full 
bank tender for the UK and Ireland clearing 
bank and London corporate stores.
The Group monitors its overall level of 
financial gearing on a regular basis to 
ensure that it remains well within its 
targets and banking covenants. The 
Group monitors its cash resources 
centrally through short, medium and 
long-term cash forecasting. Surplus cash 
is swept into interest bearing accounts 
or placed on short-term money 
market deposits.
Under-pinning Treasury activity is a robust 
Treasury Policy and Strategy that aims to 
minimise financial risk. Foreign exchange 
movement arising from transactional 
activity is reduced by either agreeing 
fixed currency rates with suppliers or 
pre-purchasing the currency spend. 
Translation exposure is minimised 
by reducing overseas net assets.
Notes
1  New stores are stores which opened in the reported 
financial year. Stores are then classified as immature 
in the second reported financial year and mature in 
the third. For example, a store opened in November 2016 
would be classified as “new” in the period 
to December 2016, “immature” in the period 
to December 2017, and “mature” in the period 
to December 2018 and subsequently.

Risk management
The Board has continued to identify, evaluate and monitor risks facing the Group 
and, during the year under review, a particular focus has been placed on assessing 
the likely impact that each identified risk could have on the business.
OUR APPROACH
All businesses choose to take considered 
risks in the expectation of earning a 
return for their shareholders. The Board 
has determined its risk appetite, stating 
the risks it seeks to take (or is prepared 
to face) within the Company’s business 
model and the adopted strategy, and has 
also defined the risks it is not prepared 
to take. The latter are avoided or 
eliminated as far as possible, or 
transferred to insurers.
The Board is responsible for overseeing 
management’s activities in identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks facing 
the Group. Importantly, we treat 
identifying and managing risk as an 
integral part of managing the business, 
and not as an additional bureaucratic 
chore. Principal risks are recorded in the 
Group’s risk register and regularly 
reviewed and evaluated. Each risk has a 
business owner, responsible for 
managing that risk, implementing 
appropriate controls and mitigating 
actions and reporting on it to the 
leadership team. In turn, the principal 
risks are reported on to the Board.
As a sense-check on management’s 
actions, the Board undertakes its own 
assessment of principal risks in each 
year, which is then integrated into the 
risk register. These known risks are taken 
into account in developing the Group’s 
strategy and business plans.

THE BOARD
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The business faces a wide range of risks on 
a daily basis. The Board has undertaken a 
robust assessment of what it believes are 
the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The table overleaf 
summarises these principal risks and how 
they are being managed or mitigated.
The risks in this table have been assessed 
on a residual basis according to our current 
view of the potential severity (being the 
combination of impact and probability) and 
assume that existing controls are effective. 
We have linked the risks to the strategic 
pillars described on page 13. The environment 
in which we operate is constantly evolving: 
new risks may arise, the potential impact of 
known risks may increase or decrease and/
or our assessment of these risks may change. 
The risks therefore represent a snapshot of 
what the Board believes are the principal 
risks and are not an exhaustive list of all risks 
the Company faces. In prior years we had 
included the implementation of our new 
ERP system as a principal risk. Following 
the successful implementation of the 
system the Board no longer considers this 
to be a principal risk.
The Board has again considered the risk 
posed by Brexit and has noted that there 
are likely to be risks associated with increases 
in the cost of raw materials and potential 
labour cost increases for franchisees. 
At the present time, the Board does not 
consider Brexit to be a principal risk to 
the business model, but will continue to 
monitor and evaluate this risk and reassess 
the exposure as necessary. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

STRATEGIC RISKS
People-related risks
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
The business is overly dependent on key 
individuals (either at Executive level or in 
relation to specialist skills), possibly 
exacerbated by a failure to attract or retain 
the skilled and experienced people it needs.
Potential impact
Medium
Probability
Medium
Mitigation
The Board considers succession planning 
on a regular basis and has set the CEO a 
personal objective of developing multiple 
potential successors. Contingency plans 
are in place which could be implemented 
on a short-term basis should we suddenly 
lose a key Executive.
Nature of threat
These risks could have some impact on 
future performance, for a limited time.
Change from 2016

Commentary
There has been considerable work 
undertaken this year to improve the HR 
operating model and to establish more 
robust processes for talent management 
and succession planning.
Failure to respond to and 
overcome competitive pressures
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
The business faces strong competition from 
a range of players, including those exploiting 
emerging technologies or new food options 
and new entrants into the UK market.
Potential impact
High
Probability
Low
Mitigation
Management keeps the competitive 
landscape under continual review and the 
Board also monitors the markets in which it 
operates, as well as KPI data on the current 
business. Strategy is reviewed and developed 
by the Board on at least an annual basis.
Nature of threat
These risks have the potential to compromise 
our future performance or, in an extreme 
scenario, even the business model.
Change from 2016

Commentary
This risk has increased during the year due 
to increased market pressure and evidence 
of increased “value for money” awareness 
driving consumer choice. A number of 
initiatives have been undertaken during the 
year to maintain product competitiveness.

STRATEGIC RISKS CONTINUED
Failure to achieve UK growth 
through new store openings
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
Failure to meet store growth targets 
would be a breach of our Master Franchise 
Agreements (MFAs). Our ability to open new 
stores depends on our ability to lease or buy 
suitable premises, obtain the necessary 
planning approvals and identify a suitable 
franchisee to run the store.
Potential impact
High
Probability
Low
Mitigation
Board approval is needed for the targets 
contained within the MFAs, and the Board 
monitors the pipeline of proposed store 
openings on a continual basis. Franchisee 
development programmes are run and we 
employ surveyors to identify and secure 
appropriate premises.
Nature of threat
These risks could have an impact on future 
performance. In an extreme case an 
unremedied breach of the MFA could 
threaten the Company’s business model 
and liquidity.
Change from 2016

Commentary
The overall risk remains the same as last 
year. The MFA targets have been agreed 
for the next ten years and are set at 350 
new stores over the period (on a net basis).
Commercial leverage of 
large franchisees
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
The Group has a number of franchisees 
whose businesses run large numbers of 
stores and so enjoy some commercial 
leverage. The Group may be unable to 
persuade these franchisees to implement 
our preferred strategies, or to pass on 
cost increases in full or in part.
Potential impact
High
Probability
Medium
Mitigation
Open and transparent relationships with 
multi-site franchisees are managed at senior 
levels of the Group. We also explain the 
profit-sharing model to all franchisees, so 
that they understand that success is mutual. 
Numbers of stores managed by the large 
franchisees are monitored.
Nature of threat
These risks have the potential to compromise 
our future performance for a period of time.
Change from 2016

Commentary
The assessed level of risk has increased 
during the year, largely due to some pressure 
on franchisee profitability. There is regular 
and ongoing dialogue with the franchisee 
community to mitigate this risk.

Risk
As society’s expectations evolve, and 
governments act on public health concerns, 
we may need to change the products we 
offer and our approach to marketing.
Potential impact

Mitigation
Management keeps consumers’ purchasing 
preferences under continual review and 
adjusts menus in response to these. We also 
engage, appropriately, with the government 
on the public health debate to ensure that 
our views are understood by policy makers 
and influencers.

Interruption of raw 
material supplies
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
The business relies on a number of 
third-party suppliers for pizza toppings, 
some of whom provide the sole source of 
an ingredient. These suppliers must make a 
commercial return to stay in business and 
reinvest in their operations. The Group 
would be vulnerable if a supplier decided 
to cease trading, suffered a major 
interruption or food safety incident, or was 
responsible for an ethical breach of such 
severity that the Group would no longer 
trade with them.
Potential impact
High
Probability
Low
Mitigation
Suppliers who are selected through 
competitive tendering and appropriate due 
diligence processes supply the Group 
under long-term contracts. The economics 
of their businesses are kept under review 
and their performance against their obligations 
is monitored. We assess their compliance 
with acceptable business standards.
Nature of threat
These risks have the potential to compromise 
our future performance for a limited time.
Change from 2016

Commentary
A detailed review of suppliers has been 
undertaken and is ongoing and steps have 
been taken to reduce supplier dependency 
and improve security of supplies through 
dual sourcing.
Supply Chain Centres are unable 
to supply the stores
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
We distribute both the pre-proved dough 
we produce and third-party pizza toppings 
to our franchisees’ stores. In the event of 
physical damage to, or loss of, a Supply 
Chain Centre we would need to make urgent 
contingency arrangements wherever possible. 
However, the space required to hold dough 
whilst proving forms a critical constraint to 
our business.
Potential impact
High
Probability
Medium
Mitigation
In the event of the loss of a Supply Chain 
Centre, third-party ingredients could be 
delivered to stores direct, at an additional 
cost. The Group is considering developing 
additional dough proving facilities, which 
would mitigate this risk significantly. Loss of 
our dough production facilities would be 
more difficult to overcome, but contract 
production of dough would be possible, 
at an additional cost.
Nature of threat
These risks could have a significant impact 
on future performance and potentially 
liquidity, for a limited time.
Change from 2016

Commentary
The level of risk has reduced since 2016 
following the development of the Group’s 
new production facilities. Additionally, 
enhancements to the business continuity 
plan are expected to be implemented 
during 2018. 
Food safety 
Link to strategic pillars
Risk
There is the risk of contamination in either 
the pre-proved dough we produce at the 
Group’s Supply Chain Centres, or in the 
pizza topping ingredients we distribute to 
our franchisees’ stores. Where we operate 
corporate stores, and are responsible for 
finished products, this risk is exacerbated.
Potential impact
High
Probability
Medium
Mitigation
The business has implemented a rigorous 
regime of standards and food safety checks, 
working with the appropriate 
government regulator.
Nature of threat
If this risk materialised, it could have a 
significant impact on future performance and 
potentially liquidity, for a limited time. The 
reputational impact could have a longer-term 
effect on performance and, in an extreme 
case, threaten the business model.
Change from 2016

Commentary
This risk has not changed materially during 
the year. The risk is monitored on a regular 
basis by a qualified in-house resource. The 
Board routinely receives reports on “food 
safety” risk controls.

For ease of use, our online ordering 
systems hold some customer data, the loss

are trained in their obligations in respect of 
personal data and are required to train their 
staff appropriately. Appropriate IT security is 
in place and kept under continual review.
Nature of threat
These risks have the potential to compromise 
our future performance. In an extreme 
scenario, the reputational damage could 
possibly threaten the business model if we 
suffered a total loss of consumer confidence.
Change from 2016

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 27
Viability statement
The Company’s current position
The Group’s business model has been 
shown to be robust since the business 
was formed. We operate under what is 
effectively a perpetual Master Franchise 
Agreement in each key territory, so our 
business model is long-term and effectively 
open-ended. The Group’s strategy and 
business model which is explained on 
pages 13 to 15, is well established and we 
have a market-leading position in the UK 
and ROI business and have successfully 
exploited the emergence of e-commerce 
as a sales channel. We continue to open 
new pizza stores and drive increases in 
like-for-like sales, and can demonstrate 
strong growth in system sales, and Group 
turnover and profitability, over many years. 
Our business is profitable and we 
successfully convert almost all of this into 
cash generation. At 31 December 2017, 
the Group has net debt of £89.2m and a 
committed £350m five-year multi-currency 
bank facility, which expires in July 2022.
The Board has considered its appetite for 
risk and there is a clearly articulated 
statement of this which forms the basis for 
the Group’s risk management activities.
Our strategic planning process
The CEO, supported by the leadership 
team, is responsible for the Group’s 
strategic planning process. This is an 
annual review of the current strategy, 
informed by monitoring of market trends 
and developments and in-house analysis, 
supported where necessary by external 
market research. This results in a draft 
strategic plan, supported by detailed 
financial modelling, which is debated by 
the Board at its annual strategy away-day. 
The Board’s role includes considering 
whether the plan appropriately factors in 
the changing external environment and 
whether the Group has access to the 
financial, technical and human resources 
necessary to implement it successfully.
The resulting agreed strategic plan is 
generally prepared on a five-year basis, 
but both management and the Board are 
aware that we operate in a 
fast-moving environment. 
The process of assessing our 
viability and key assumptions 
The strategic plan reflects the Directors’ 
best estimate of the future prospects of 
the business, but we have also assessed 
the potential impact on the Group of a 
number of scenarios based on each of the 
principal risks and uncertainties described 
in this section of the Annual Report. Those 
risks are “principal” because they could 
prevent the Group from delivering on its 
strategy. Although our strategic plans 
have a five-year horizon, we chose to 
model the impact of these risks over 
a period of three years in view of the 
dynamic nature of our business and the 
environment in which we operate, and 
also the inherent unreliability of some 
data when forecast five years in advance.
We have also explored the impact of “severe 
but plausible” combinations of these risks, 
in circumstances that we believe the Group 
could experience, including:
 •
only managing to open half of the 
planned number of new pizza stores, 
while simultaneously suffering an 
assumed 10% increase in the costs of 
sourcing food ingredients; and
 •
the complete failure of our e-commerce 
ordering systems in the busiest week of 
our trading year, while simultaneously 
suffering a breach of data security leading 
to additional costs, regulatory penalties 
and a 1% reduction in sales due to lost 
customer confidence. 
The key assumption in this modelling of 
our strategy and the impact of the 
principal risks includes:
 •
while a number of industry commentators 
believe that there is a natural ceiling on 
the number of pizza stores we can open, 
the Group has consistently delivered 
growth ahead of these predictions. We 
continue to assume that the UK market, 
in particular, is capable of sustaining 
the growth in store numbers we anticipate.
This key assumption is linked to the 
Group’s principal risks regarding new store 
openings and explained further in the risk 
management section. 
The results of this modelling showed that, 
due to the inherent strength and stability 
of our business, the Group should be able 
to withstand the impact should any of 
these scenarios materialise over the 
three-year period.
We also investigated whether “reverse 
stress-testing” would offer an alternative 
view. Although we have net debt and a 
committed bank facility, we could find 
no plausible scenario which had such an 
impact on the Group’s future performance, 
solvency or liquidity that it would lead 
to the Group’s financial failure. The 
most obvious risk which could have such 
an effect would be a breach of the Master 
Franchise Agreement, which is 
highly improbable.
Longer-term viability statement
Based on their assessment of prospects 
and viability above, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period to the 
end of December 2020. STRATEGIC REPORT
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 28
In 2013, we began to develop a corporate 
social responsibility (‘CSR’) strategy by 
analysing our current business practices 
and devising a plan for the years to come. 
We have a successful business, built on a 
simple business model – deliver hot, 
freshly handcrafted pizza to our customers 
as quickly as is safely possible.
We have a responsibility to uphold the solid 
reputation our business has formed since 
we arrived in the UK in 1985. To ensure we 
build a sustainable business for the future, 
we have developed a responsible delivery 
plan, our CSR strategy.
FOOD
Achievements in 2017
 •
Removed nearly 1 tonne of salt as part of 
ongoing reduction programme.
 •
Validation of accuracy of nutritional data. 
 •
Implementation of first Animal 
Welfare Policy. 
We are proud of the food we serve. 
Every Domino’s pizza is bursting with 
great quality ingredients like hand-stretched 
fresh dough, Welsh mozzarella and 
vine-ripened tomatoes. This is why our 
pizzas can transform any occasion, from a 
relaxing evening at home to a big family party.
Healthy eating
As customers’ tastes change, choice is 
becoming increasingly important. At Domino’s , 
we are passionate about innovation, so we 
are constantly looking for ways to improve 
our food. We follow the ongoing public 
debate on healthy eating closely. We have 
a dedicated internal steering group focused 
on ensuring we are making progressive 
changes to our food ahead of evolving 
customer expectations.
We want our customers to be in charge. 
They are able to choose the toppings, 
the crust, the type of cheese and, most 
importantly, the number of slices they eat. 
We generally recommend about three 
slices per person and continue to offer 
Delight Cheese with a third less fat than 
standard mozzarella.
We are proud to be one of the few pizza 
brands to offer a reduced fat mozzarella 
option. Since the beginning of 2012, we 
have removed over 40 tonnes of salt from 
our pizzas and reduced fat content in 
ingredients such as pepperoni and beef.
In August 2016, the government published 
its Childhood Obesity Strategy, which 
outlined requirements to reduce sugar 
across a range of product categories in the 
UK. Throughout 2017, we have worked with 
our suppliers to start the reformulation 
process to reduce the level of sugar in our 
cookies, which is currently our only remaining 
dessert that does not meet the voluntary 
guideline recommendations. 
We continue to work with our suppliers to 
reduce the amount of salt in our products, 
and this year we launched a new sweetcorn 
with no added salt and sugar and also 
reformulated our tuna and tomato pizza 
sauce. Combined, these changes have 
helped us to remove nearly a tonne of 
salt from our products.
Nutrition
We know it is possible to include pizza in 
a balanced diet, and we are committed to 
providing transparent nutritional information 
to enable our customers to make 
informed decisions.
To ensure this transparency, we provide 
calorie information on our website and via 
our app. We publish detailed nutritional 
profiles for more than 1,500 combinations 
of regular pizzas and those made with our 
Delight Cheese.
We also have an ingredients bible listing 
any additives included in our products to help 
customers understand why they are present.
We are proud to state we continue not to 
use artificial colours or flavourings in any of 
our pizzas or side orders and removed trans 
fats several years ago. We also offer a 
gluten-free pizza base, which is becoming 
increasingly popular with our customers.
Product sourcing and animal welfare
The origin and quality of the food we offer 
our customers is paramount.
We have developed long-term relationships 
with our suppliers, many of whom have been 
in place for more than a decade. We also 
take great pride in ensuring the quality of 
our products and continually assess each 
of our suppliers.
Animal welfare is important to us and to 
our customers. In 2017, we published our 
first Annual Welfare Policy relating to our 
supply chain base in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland. This document sets out the 
standards we expect of our suppliers 
and the processes we have in place for 
ensuring compliance. 
Corporate social responsibility report
Since the 
beginning of 2012, 
we have removed

the impact we have on the environment and how we treat our employees. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 29
We demand suppliers comply with all EU, 
local and UK animal welfare legislation, 
irrespective of species or geographical 
location. We work closely with our suppliers 
to ensure animals are able to exhibit normal 
behaviour patterns, are properly supervised 
during transport, and are handled by trained 
stockman, slaughterhouse workers and 
hauliers. All animals are stunned prior to 
slaughter. We do not permit the use of 
antibiotics within our supply chain for 
anything other than treatment purposes. 
Medicines, including antibiotics should 
not be used for disease prevention or as 
a growth promoter. 
In 2017, we held training courses to ensure 
colleagues, including those responsible for 
developing and procuring products, and for 
communicating with our customers, fully 
understand our principles within this area. 
Our programme of annual audits for meat 
suppliers is ongoing to ensure compliance, 
including in the use of antibiotics. We 
continue to take steps to improve standards, 
agreeing specific targets and timelines for 
enhancements with suppliers. We remain 
committed to providing more information, 
so our stakeholders are aware of the measures 
we are taking in this important area.
Objectives for 2018
 •
Continue to reformulate products, 
helping to further improve our health 
and quality credentials.
 •
All new products must follow strict 
nutritional criteria to ensure that they 
meet government guidelines on salt, 
sugar, calories and portion sizing.
 •
Introduce key performance indicators 
relating to animal welfare to track and 
monitor supplier performance. 
ENVIRONMENT
Achievements in 2017
 •

 •
9% reduction in owned vehicle emissions, 
with UK & ROI delivery fleet mileage 
reduced by over 500,000 miles.
 •
91% recycling rate achieved across 
all operations.
Investment in energy efficiency 
In June 2017, work commenced on our new 
high specification supply chain facility in 
Warrington with production expected to go 
live in April 2018. Once operational, this 
facility will provide a very high level of 
control over energy management and 
resource consumption with all production 
activities supported by the latest 
innovations and technologies including: 
 •
automated energy management system 
for electricity, natural gas and water;
 •
complete air management system using 
“duty standby” air compressors;
 •
internal and external LED lighting systems; 
 •
occupancy control sensors; 
 •
all machinery meets high EU energy 
efficiency standards; and
 •
increased water filtering and recycling 
for tray washing systems.
Reduction in delivery mileage
Since opening our new depot in Highbridge 
in 2017 and the introduction of double-decker 
trailers, we continue to use these vehicles 
on trunking routes from West Ashland to 
Highbridge and from Penrith to Livingston. 
Despite an 8% increase in production volumes 
from UK operations, our improved fleet 
efficiency continues to deliver emissions 
savings and we are delighted to report a 
15% reduction in UK delivery emissions alone. 
The mileage saving 
in 2017 was 202,160

emissions for this reporting year are 0.28 
tCO
2
e/tonne of dough produced, compared 
to our baseline figure of 0.44 tCO
2
e/tonne 
of dough produced. Our intensity ratio has 
decreased by 37%, well ahead of our 
relative reduction target of 25% by 2018. 
These indicators have been adjusted to 
reflect the acquisition of our Nordic 
operations in the reporting period. 
Methodology 
We report on all emissions sources stipulated 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. 
The methodology used to compile this data 
is in accordance with the requirements of 
the following standards: the World Resources 
Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol; Defra’s 
Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including 
mandatory greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting guidance (June 2013); and ISO 
14064 – part 1. 
We continue to use a financial control 
approach to define our organisational 
boundary; as a result, we report GHG 
emissions from all six markets considered 
as part of the Group’s current financial 
consolidation: United Kingdom; Republic of 
Ireland; Switzerland; Iceland; Norway; and 
Sweden. Accountability for our overall 
environmental performance rests with our 
executive management. 
Our franchisees’ emissions are excluded 
from our reporting on the basis that we do 
not have sufficiently accurate information 
to report on their impacts. Where data was 
incomplete (i.e. less than 12 months of 
data were available) GHG emissions were 
extrapolated from the available information 
and references to the accounting and 
calculation methodologies for any assumptions, 
estimations and recalculations performed 
have been documented. 
For more insight into our overall 
environmental performance, please access 
the Environment page on our corporate 
website, https://corporate.dominos.co.uk/
Corporate-responsibility.
Objectives for 2018
 •
To roll out the automated energy 
management system at our 
West Ashland facility.
 •
To maintain accreditation to ISO 50001.
 •
To continue to invest in energy-efficient 
products and services where 
financially viable.

consumption relative to tonnage delivered.
 •
To continue to focus on electricity 
reduction associated with lighting, 
refrigeration and motor replacement.

A closer look at the numbers
Due to rising customer demand, we experienced a 16% increase in production volumes in 2016/17 and reinstated our Kingston Supply 
Chain Facility at the start of the year. Work also commenced on a new facility in Warrington, which will likely lead to an increase in UK 
energy consumption in 2018.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
31 Domino’s Pizza Group plc
Despite the addition of these sites to our 
reporting scope, total scope 1 and 2 
emissions have decreased by 6% on 
2015/16, with some variations at an 
individual emissions source level: 
 •
natural gas and kerosene consumption 
increased by 121 tCO
2
e, following additional 
UK and Switzerland sites reporting and 
the inclusion of our Nordic operations;
 •
emissions arising from Company-owned 
vehicles account for the majority of our 
scope 1 emissions and have decreased by 
9% this year. This is primarily a result of 
the continuation of efficiency measures 
introduced to our supply chain delivery 
fleet in 2015/16 which have seen fuel 
consumption drop by 11%; and
 •
electricity emissions have dropped by 
4% following a 15% decrease in the 
UK’s emissions factor and offset by 
the inclusion of additional UK and 
Switzerland sites. It is likely we will 
see a continued increase in electricity 
consumption when Warrington comes 
online in 2018.

engagement survey, titled 
“Make a Difference”, with a 96% 
response rate in our Head Office 
and 73% team satisfaction score 
across Head Office and Supply Chain. 
 •
Our 2017 People Plan made progress on 
supporting business growth, recruiting 
and retaining the best talent, developing 
our colleagues to be the best they can 
be, and ensuring we have the right avenues 
to listen and respond to colleagues on 
what matters to them. 
 •
We launched a new performance 
management and development toolkit, 
titled “My Journey to Greatness”, tools 
to help colleagues deliver objectives 
and develop their skills.

an excellent 
benefits package.
 •
Launched a new e-learning portal 
enabling colleagues to access learning 
and development content.
 •
Welcomed many new colleagues to 
the Group through acquisitions in 
International and corporate stores.
2017 has been an exciting year of change 
and growth, a year where we have continued 
to grow our Domino’s team and progressed 
our journey to be a great, safe and inclusive 
place to work. We celebrated success this 
year with our colleagues through regular 
all-colleague meetings, pizza lunches, 
recognition vouchers, a summer family day 
and our Christmas party. Colleagues took 
part in the UK Corporate Games, the 
largest multi-sport event with over 500 
businesses taking part. This year we reached 
the finals and gained awards for the 
bowling, football and dragon boat teams. 
“ Our 2017 People Plan 
continued to make progress 
on the things that matter 
to our colleagues.”
Engagement and wellbeing
We strive to provide a great, safe and 
inclusive environment for our colleagues 
and are always seeking to understand what 
improvements we can make in their 
experience at work. 
All colleagues who work with us receive an 
excellent benefits package which includes 
access to PruHealth “Vitality”. Over 86% of 
colleagues participate and track their steps 
to improve their health and wellbeing and 
in return get discounted gym rates and get 
rewarded for healthy shopping habits. 
In 2017, we launched a new colleague 
engagement survey, titled “Make a 
Difference”, to understand the level of our 
team satisfaction. We had an outstanding 
96% response rate across our Head Office 
and an overall 73% team satisfaction score 
across our Head Office and Supply Chain. 
Change on what matters happens through 
action planning so our line managers and 
function sponsors across Head Office and 
Supply Chain are actively taking ownership 
for their team action plans. Advocacy to 
the Domino’s brand and desire to go the 
“extra mile” is very strong, something we 
are very proud of.  STRATEGIC REPORT

own this part of the colleague lifecycle 
more closely to make sure we attract the 
right candidates with the right competencies 
and passion for the Domino’s culture.

and they know us best, so we launched a 
colleague “recommend-a-friend” programme 
so we can jointly welcome great new 
candidates to the Domino’s team.

COMMUNITY
Achievements in 2017
Raised over £1.4m for charity:
 •
over £1m for Teenage Cancer Trust;
 •
over €15,600 for Barretstown;
 •
over £16,500 for the Northern Ireland 
Children’s Hospice; and
 •
over £406,000 for Pennies.
Pennies
We have a long-running partnership with 
the charity Pennies. Its digital charity box 
has enabled customers using our website 
and apps to round up their orders to the 
nearest pound. 2017 was a fantastic year 
for fundraising and, on behalf of the 
charities, we would like to pass on a big 
“thank you” to our customers who have 
embraced Pennies in their millions.
 •
On average, 170,000 customers donate 
via Pennies each month.
 •
The average weekly donation total was 
£7,000 in 2017.
 •
Domino’s customers have raised over 
£3.25m since 2010. In 2017 alone, they 
raised over £406,000 through almost 
2 million micro-donations.
 •
Continued to boost fundraising by 
customers using Pennies in the 
Republic of Ireland for Barretstown.
We are proud to have been the landmark 
partner for Pennies and to have seen this 
trend of online donations grow considerably 
since it began in 2010.
Pennies receives 7.5% of all donations as a 
contribution to its charitable objectives and 
to drive the movement for the benefit of 
the charitable sector as a whole.
The full 92.5% of donations in Great Britain 
went to our 2017 beneficiary, Teenage Cancer 
Trust. In Northern Ireland, the Northern 
Ireland Children’s Hospice also received the 
full 92.5%, and in the Republic of Ireland, 
our newest charity partner Barretstown 
also began receiving 92.5% of customers’ 
donations from launch in September 2016.
Teenage Cancer Trust: We are almost 
at £2m!
Teenage Cancer Trust was appointed as 
our charity partner of choice in England, 
Scotland and Wales in the summer of 2015, 
with a goal of raising £1m over a two-year 
period. To date, we have raised almost 
£2m, which could fund 44 Teenage Cancer 
Trust specialist nurses for a year, who are 
responsible for leading nursing care of all 
the young people on a Teenage Cancer 
Trust unit and beyond.
Throughout 2017, Domino’s team members 
and franchisees took part in various 
fundraising challenges and customer-facing 
activities and provided pizza for “Unit 
Pizza Nights”.
Right now, for every young person Teenage 
Cancer Trust reaches, there is another they 
cannot. To reach every young person who 
needs them, Teenage Cancer Trust is 
expanding its team of expert Nurses to 
work in local hospitals and patients’ homes 
so that young people can receive the expert 
treatment they need, no matter where they 
live. They need to raise £20m a year by 
2020 to make this happen, and Domino’s is 
proud be part of helping them get there.
Our social impact
 •
To date, Domino’s has raised over £1.9m 
for Teenage Cancer Trust. In 2017 alone, 
the fundraising total equated to over 
16,000 hours of expert care from a 
specialist Nurse for a young person 
with cancer.
 •
Since our partnership began in 2009, 
Domino’s has raised over £120,000 for 
the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice. 
The 2017 fundraising total equates to 
4,000 nursing hours.
 •
Since our partnership began in 2004, 
Domino’s has raised over €265,000 for 
Barretstown. It costs €3,500 to bring a 
child to camp for eight days allowing 
them to take part in Barretstown’s unique 
Therapeutic Recreation programmes, 
designed to help them recover from the 
emotional trauma of serious illness.
Charity Objectives for 2018
 •
Evolve the charity programme in line 
with fresh business priorities.
 •
Increase overall giving, aided by the 
recent introduction of Pennies into the 
Republic of Ireland.
 •
Continue to galvanise fundraising with 
our customers, franchisees, store teams 
and office colleagues.

Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 36
The Board is supported in its work by three Committees:
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
Domino’s Pizza Group plc (‘the Company’) 
is incorporated and has a premium listing in 
the UK. As a result, it is required to report on 
its compliance with the Code or explain 
why it has chosen not to comply. For the 
year ended 31 December 2017, it was subject 
to the edition of the Code published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in April 2016, 
which is available from www.frc.org.uk. 
The Company complied with Code in full 
throughout the year. 
The Code contains 18 main principles, which 
are expanded on in supporting principles 
and detailed provisions. Together, these set 
out the key components of effective Board 
practice, and we explain in this report how 
we have applied these during the year. 
Where appropriate, some explanations are 
contained in the Nomination Committee 
report, the Audit Committee report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the 
Directors’ report.
Within the delegation framework described 
above, the Board retains certain key 
decision‑ making responsibilities:
 •
setting and approving overall 
Group strategy;
 •
setting a risk appetite, within which 
management is required to operate; 
 •
reviewing and approving business plans 
and budgets;
 •
reviewing and approving major 
business decisions;
 •
reviewing major risks and the 
implementation of mitigation strategies;
 •
reviewing the functioning of the internal 
control environment;
 •
monitoring operational and trading results 
against previously approved plans;
 •
reviewing and approving significant 
contractual and other commitments, 
including capital expenditure;
 •
reviewing corporate 
governance arrangements;
 •
reviewing succession plans for the 
Board and Executive Directors; and
 •
exercising its control by an annual 
review of “matters reserved” for the 
Board’s decision.
As noted above, the Board is responsible 
for determining the nature and extent of 
the principal risks it is willing to take 
in achieving its strategic objectives. 
It also retains oversight of the risk 
management and internal control systems 
with the aim that these are sound and 
protect shareholders’ interests.
Corporate governance
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
I am pleased to introduce the review 
of corporate governance for 2017. 
Effective corporate governance 
arrangements are critical in ensuring 
that the Board is able to:
 •
direct and control the Group;
 •
provide strategic leadership and 
effective oversight; and
 •
maintain a framework within which 
the Executive leadership team can 
conduct its day ‑ to‑ day operational 
management of the business. 
We are committed to maintaining 
a governance framework that is 
appropriate to the business and 
supports effective decision making 
coupled with robust oversight of 
risks and internal controls.
The Board works with Executive 
management to define and refine 
the Group’s values and to promote 
behaviours which contribute to a 
culture focused on the long ‑ term 
success of the business. 
Our aim is to maintain a sustainable 
business model which creates value 
for shareholders and benefits the 
Group’s wider stakeholders. 
The Board receives regular updates on 
emerging trends in corporate governance 
best practice and welcomes the FRC’s 
current review of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”). 
During 2018 we will be reviewing our 
existing governance framework in 
light of the revisions to the Code once 
it is published.
The following report sets out the how 
the Board has applied the principles 
of good governance during the year.

remuneration and rewards of the Executive 
Directors, the Chairman and the leadership 
teams. The Remuneration Committee aims 
to offer an appropriate balance of fixed and 
performance‑ related, immediate and deferred 
remuneration, but without overpaying or 
creating the risk of rewards for failure. 
Board composition
The Board’s preferred structure is to be 
led by a non ‑ executive Chairman, to have 
high calibre Executive Directors to drive 
the performance of the business under the 
leadership of a Chief Executive Officer, and 
to have a number of non ‑ executive Directors 
drawn from a range of backgrounds, whose 
role is to provide constructive challenge. 
Our aim is that the independent non ‑ executive 
Directors always constitute at least half of 
the Board. This structure and the integrity 
of the individual Directors should ensure 
that no single individual or group dominates 
the decision ‑ making process. There is a 
common purpose of promoting the overall 
success of the Group with a unified vision 
of the definition of success, the core strategic 
principles, and the understanding, alignment 
and mitigation of risk.
Non‑ executive Directors are appointed 
for three‑year terms (subject to annual 
re‑ election by shareholders) and the offer 
of any further term of appointment after 
year six would be weighed carefully by the 
Nomination Committee, which keeps the 
need for progressive refreshing of the Board 
(particularly to maintain an appropriate 
balance of skills and experience) and 
orderly succession to key appointments 
under continual review.
Independence
The Board reviews the independence of its 
non‑ executive Directors annually. In assessing 
the independence of each Director, the 
Board considers whether each is independent 
in character and judgement and whether 
there are relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect, or could appear 
to affect, the Director’s judgement.
Board roles and responsibilities
There is a clear separation between the roles 
of the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer, which is recorded in a document 
approved by the Board in September 2015 
and summarised below. In essence, the 
Chairman manages the Board and the 
Chief Executive Officer manages the 
business. Importantly, no one individual 
has unfettered powers of decision.
The Chairman meets with the Chief 
Executive Officer at least once a month, 
including visits to pizza stores, and they 
are in contact between these occasions as 
required. The Chairman also has separate 
discussions with the non ‑ executive Directors.
Chairman
The role of the Chairman is:
 •
providing leadership to and ensuring 
the effectiveness of the Board;
 •
ensuring that agendas emphasise 
strategic, rather than routine, issues 
and that the Directors receive accurate 
and clear information well ahead of the 
time when a decision is required;
 •
promoting a culture of openness and 
constructive debate, and facilitating 
an effective contribution by the 
non‑ executive Directors;
 •
arranging informal meetings of the 
Directors, including meetings of the 
non‑ executive Directors;
 •
ensuring effective communication 
by the Group with its shareholders;
 •
arranging for the Chairs of the Committees 
to be available to answer questions at the 
AGM and for all Directors to attend; and
 •
taking the lead in providing a properly 
constructed, full, formal and tailored 
induction programme and ongoing 
development for new Directors. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Board composition
The eight continuing members of the Board on 31 December 2017 were drawn from a 
range of backgrounds and gained their experience in a range of relevant industry sectors:
Leadership – our governance 
framework continued
Board roles and responsibilities continued
Chief Executive Officer
The role of the Chief Executive Officer is:
 •
leading the development of the Group’s 
strategic direction and objectives;
 •
identifying and executing acquisitions 
and disposals and leading geographic 
diversification initiatives;
 •
reviewing the Group’s organisational 
structure and recommending changes 
as appropriate;
 •
identifying and executing new 
business opportunities;
 •

and its Committees;
 •
building and maintaining an effective 
Group leadership team; and 
 •
ensuring the Chairman and the Board 
are alerted to forthcoming complex, 
contentious or sensitive issues 
affecting the Group.
Senior Independent Director (SID)
The SID focuses on:
 •
meeting regularly with the independent 
non‑ executive Directors;
 •
providing a sounding board for the 
Chairman and acting as an intermediary 
for other Directors;
 •
being available to shareholders if they 
have concerns which contact through 
the normal channels of Chairman or 
Chief Executive Officer has failed to 
address or would be inappropriate; and
 •
holding annual meetings with  
non‑ executive Directors without 
the Chairman present.
Non-executive Director
The role of a non ‑ executive Director is:
 •
providing creative contribution to the 
Board by way of constructive criticism;
 •
bringing independence, impartiality, 
experience, specialist knowledge and 
a different perspective to the Board;
 •
providing guidance on matters 
of concern and strategy;
 •
overseeing risk management 
and internal control;
 •
protecting shareholder 
and stakeholder interests;
 •
constructively challenging the 
Executive Directors and monitoring 
Executive performance;
 •
supporting the Executive team in 
shaping and delivering the strategic 
goals of the business;
 •
optimising shareholder return and 
protection of shareholder assets; and
 •
ensuring the Board is able to work 
together effectively and make 
maximum use of its time.
Diversity
The Board’s policy on diversity is explained 
in the Nomination Committee report on 
page 42.
Leadership in action
This section of the corporate governance 
report explains how the Board has fulfilled 
its duties and obligations during the year 
under review.
Board membership 
The Board currently comprises the 
non‑ executive Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, 
a non ‑ executive Vice ‑ Chairman and four 
independent non ‑ executive Directors, one of 
whom acts as the Senior Independent Director. 
The names and biographical details of the 
serving Directors, and the offices held by 
them, can be found on pages 34 and 35.
We believe that the Board is of sufficient 
size that the requirements of the business 
and good governance can be met and 
normal succession challenges managed, 
but is not so large as to be unwieldy.

Independence
The Board has considered the independence 
of the current non ‑ executive Directors, 
other than the Chairman. It does not believe 
that Colin Halpern is independent in view of 
his long service with the Company (including 
his former Executive responsibilities).
Board balance
The Board composition creates a majority 
of independent non ‑ executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman), with the current 
position being:
Senior Independent Director
Helen Keays was appointed the Senior 
Independent Director on 20 April 2016.
Board effectiveness
We believe that there are five key steps 
in creating an effective Board:
1. Recruit the right people
We have a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board, overseen by 
the Nomination Committee. For each 
appointment, we develop an objective 
brief summarising the role and the skills 
and experience required and use an 
appropriate head ‑hunting firm with proven 
expertise in the relevant field. As noted 
above, we take care to ensure that we 
recruit on merit, from the widest possible 
range of backgrounds, recognising the 
benefits of diversity, and the search firms 
we use are signatories to the Code of Conduct 
for executive search firms. Before confirming 
an appointment, we check whether the 
preferred individual can commit to the 
time expected including, in the case of an 
appointment to the chairmanship, the need 
to be available in the event of a crisis.

1  All Directors attended the scheduled Board meetings apart from Helen Keays who was unable 
to attend one scheduled meeting due to a prior commitment. There were three unscheduled 
Board meetings held during the year and some of the Directors were not available for all of 
these unscheduled meetings due to other diary commitments.
2  Helen Keays did not attend one Remuneration Committee meeting due to a prior commitment.
Each non ‑ executive Director has committed to the Company that they are able to allocate 
sufficient time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Any 
additional appointments they are contemplating taking on are discussed with the 
Chairman in advance, including the likely time commitment and whether these could 
in any way constitute a conflict of interest. These matters are formally reviewed by the 
Board on an annual basis.
Meetings of Non-Executive Directors
The non ‑ executive Directors, led by the Chairman, meet without the Executive Directors 
being present. In addition, the independent non ‑ executive Directors, led by the SID, 
meet during the year as needed, including to review the performance of the Chairman. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 40
Board effectiveness continued
2. Make sure Directors have the right tools
All Directors go through a tailored, formal 
induction process on joining the Board, 
including the opportunity to meet major 
shareholders. The aim of this is to ensure 
that they understand the Company and its 
business model, our strategy, the drivers 
of value in the business and the key risks 
we face, and that they understand the legal 
and regulatory environment in which we 
operate and their own personal obligations. 
Directors are expected to update and refresh 
their skills and knowledge on an ongoing 
basis, and to continue to build their familiarity 
with the Company and its business 
throughout their tenure. The Company 
will provide the necessary resources for 
developing and updating its Directors’ 
knowledge and capabilities, including access 
to our operations, staff and franchisees. 
All Directors have access to the services of 
the Company Secretary, and the opportunity 
to seek independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense where they judge 
it necessary to discharge their responsibilities 
as Directors or as members of Board 
Committees. If Directors have concerns 
which cannot be resolved about the running 
of the Company or a proposed action, they 
can require that their concerns are recorded 
in the Board minutes, or provide a written 
statement to the Chairman, for circulation 
to the Board.
The Board is supplied with information in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable 
it to discharge its duties effectively. This is 
provided in good time ahead of all meetings 
and decisions, and non ‑ executive Directors 
are encouraged to seek clarification from 
management whenever they feel appropriate.
3. Identify and manage any conflicts 
of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
However, the Company’s Articles of 
Association allow the Board to “authorise” 
conflicts, where felt appropriate. Any 
Director who becomes aware that he or 
she is in a situation which does or could 
create a conflict of interest, or has an 
interest in an existing or proposed transaction 
in which the Company also has an interest, 
is required to notify the Board in writing 
as soon as possible. The interests of 
new Directors are reviewed during the 
recruitment process and authorised (if 
appropriate) by the Board at the time of 
their appointment.
Executive Directors are permitted, and 
where felt appropriate even encouraged, 
to hold non ‑ executive directorships outside 
the Group. However, the Board would not 
agree to a full ‑ time Executive Director 
taking on more than one non ‑ executive 
directorship in, nor the chairmanship of, 
a FTSE 100 company.
4. Formally check on effectiveness
The Board undertakes a formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation of its own 
performance in each year. It also reviews 
the performance of the Board Committees 
and the Nomination Committee reviews 
the performance of individual Directors. 
Board and Committee evaluation considers 
the balance of skills, experience (including 
familiarity with the Company and its 
business) and independence of the Group 
taken as a whole, and also the diversity, 
including gender, of the Directors. The 
process also examines how the Directors 
work together as a unit, and explores other 
factors relevant to effectiveness. The 
Chairman acts on the results of the 
performance evaluations as necessary 
including, where appropriate, proposing 
new members be appointed to the Board or 
seeking the resignation of Directors.
Individual evaluation aims to determine 
whether each Director continues to 
contribute effectively and to demonstrate 
commitment to the role (including 
commitment of time for Board and 
Committee meetings and any other duties).
In 2017 the Board evaluation process was 
undertaken in ‑ house and facilitated by the 
Company Secretary in conjunction with the 
Chairman. Following discussions with the 
Board, a structured evaluation analysis of 
performance during the year was compiled 
and presented to the Board for formal 
discussion. The evaluation methodology 
is thematic focusing on:
 •
board composition, succession and 
talent management;
 •
board dynamics and development;
 •
meeting management and board agenda;
 •
strategic development; and
 •
internal control and risk.
The 2017 evaluation process focused on the 
progress made during the year against the 
findings of the previous year’s externally 
facilitated Board evaluation and identified 
areas of continued focus for the forthcoming 
year as part of the Board’s ongoing process 
of enhancing governance. 
Corporate governance continued
Progress against the areas of focus reported in the 2016 Corporate Governance report 
are shown below:

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 41
The Chairman reviewed the performance 
of the individual Directors, and the Senior 
Independent Director undertook a review 
of the Chairman’s performance, providing 
feedback to him.
The agreed principal areas of activity for 
2018 include:
 •
further progress on the Group’s 
succession planning systems for 
the Board and management;
 •
increased focus on the corporate 
culture; and
 •
ensuring that recent progress in improving 
risk management and internal controls 
is maintained. 
5. Ask shareholders to confirm appointments
Ultimately, the Directors’ main responsibility 
is to promote the long ‑ term success of the 
Company, acting in shareholders’ best 
interests. All of our Directors submit 
themselves for re ‑ election at each AGM 
and we provide shareholders with sufficient 
information in the meeting papers for them 
to decide whether their commitment and 
performance warrant a further year in office. 
At the 2017 AGM, each serving Director 
was re ‑ elected, with votes in favour 
exceeding 97% of those cast in all cases.
Accountability to shareholders
The Board has established formal and 
transparent arrangements for considering 
how they apply the principles of sound 
corporate reporting, risk management and 
internal control and how the Company and 
Board maintain an appropriate relationship 
with the Company’s auditor. These 
responsibilities are overseen by the Audit 
Committee and are explained in its report 
from page 43 onwards.
The Board considers that the 2017 Annual 
Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Details of how we do this are also explained 
in the Audit Committee’s report.
Remuneration
There are formal and transparent 
procedures for developing policy on 
Executive remuneration and for fixing 
the remuneration packages of individual 
Directors, which are overseen by the 
Remuneration Committee and are explained 
in its report from page 46 onwards. This 
report explains how Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is designed to promote the 
long‑ term success of the Company and 
shows how the performance ‑ related 
elements are transparent, stretching 
and rigorously applied.
Relations with shareholders
We maintain an active dialogue with our 
shareholders and potential investors, 
which we intend to be based on a mutual 
understanding of objectives. The CEO 
and CFO routinely engage with analysts, 
institutional and retail shareholders and 
potential investors, through results 
presentations, roadshows and one ‑ off 
meetings. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director are available for 
meetings with shareholders on request.
In years in which there is a significant 
change to the Executive remuneration policy 
or there is a binding vote on remuneration 
at the AGM, the Chairman, the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Company 
Secretary meet with major shareholders to 
discuss remuneration and any other 
governance issues.
Our aim is to ensure we build and 
maintain strong relationships, and that 
we communicate our strategy and 
performance against it in a clear and 
consistent way. In turn, we seek to 
understand the views of our investors 
through regular dialogue, and feedback 
is provided to the Board as a whole to 
give an additional context for strategic 
decision making and capital allocation.
The regular CFO report to the Board 
includes a detailed update on all investor 
relations matters, including movements 
in the share register, recent meetings with 
investors, summaries of analysts’ reports 
and key discussion topics. In addition, 
our brokers are invited to provide an 
independent view on matters of strategic 
importance such as potential acquisitions 
and share buybacks.
2017 IR activity
Over the last 18 months we have increased 
our commitment to our investor relations 
programme in a number of ways: 
 •
In November 2016 we hosted a Capital 
Markets Day. In addition to presentations 
from the CEO and CFO, investors and 
analysts had the opportunity to hear other 
members of the leadership team present 
in detail about growth opportunities, 
property, technology and other key topics.
 •
Early in 2017 we appointed a dedicated 
Head of IR for the first time, whose 
responsibility is to develop a broad 
shareholder communications strategy 
while ensuring a responsive, fair and 
transparent service to all investors 
and analysts.
 •
We spent more time on results roadshows 
and at investor conferences than in 
previous years, including over 20 days 
seeing investors in the UK, ten days in 
the US and four days at conferences.
 •
In addition to our results presentations 
for the full year and interim results, we 
also hosted conference calls for our Q3 
trading update in October 2017 and the 
acquisition of an increased stake in 
Domino’s Iceland in December 2017.
One of the outcomes of this increased 
activity is that we have seen a significant 
change in our shareholder base. At the end 
of 2017, around 56% of our shares were 
owned by investors based in North America 
– up from around 43% at the start of the year. 
Key discussion topics in 2017
The key topics discussed with shareholders 
during 2017 included:
 •
the competitive environment in the 
United Kingdom, particularly with respect 
to the rising popularity of online aggregators ;
 •
franchisee profitability and the outlook 
for new store openings;
 •
the broader UK consumer environment 
and the value perception of Domino’s pizza;
 •
our investments in our own stores 
and in supply chain capacity;
 •
international growth prospects; and
 •
our target leverage ratio and the 
potential for returns of excess capital 
to shareholders.
The AGM
The AGM is treated as an opportunity to 
communicate with all of our shareholders, 
and their participation is encouraged. 
The Chairs of all Board Committees attend 
the AGM and are available to answer 
questions. An explanatory circular containing 
the notice of meeting is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days beforehand, with 
separate votes being offered on each 
substantive issue. All proxy votes received 
are counted with the balance for and against 
and any votes withheld announced at the 
meeting and published on the Company’s 
investor relations website after the meeting. 
This website, http://investors.dominos.co.uk, 
also contains a host of up ‑ to‑ date 
information on the Group. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 42
Chairman’s overview
The principal purpose of the Nomination 
Committee is to ensure that the Company 
has the right leadership, both on the Board 
and in the ranks of senior management. 
This is a combination of continual review 
and monitoring of, and also responding to, 
specific situations as needed.
The Company Secretary attends 
meetings in his capacity as Secretary 
of the Nomination Committee and the 
Chief Executive Officer is expected to 
attend whenever necessary.
The majority of members of the 
Nomination Committee are independent 
non‑ executive Directors. While the Chairman 
of the Board chairs the Nomination Committee 
in normal circumstances, he would abstain 
in matters relating to the appointment of a 
successor to the chairmanship.
The number of meetings held in the year 
and attendance at those meetings is shown 
on page 39.
Activities in 2017
During the year the Committee met to 
consider the following key matters: 
 •
the review of the performance of all 
the non‑ executive Directors seeking 
re‑ election at the 2017 AGM; 
 •
to consider and make recommendations 
to the Board with regards to extending 
the appointments of Ebbe Jacobsen, 
Helen Keays and Kevin Higgins for 
further terms of three years each;
 •
to consider and make a recommendation 
to the Board on a diversity policy applicable 
to Board ‑ level appointments; and
 •
receiving reports from management 
on talent management and 
succession planning.
Purpose
The Nomination Committee has four 
principal duties:
 •
to ensure that plans are in place for 
orderly succession for appointments 
to the Board and to senior management, 
so as to maintain an appropriate balance 
of skills and experience within the Company 
and on the Board and to ensure progressive 
refreshing of the Board;
 •
to lead the process for Board and 
Committee appointments and make 
recommendations to the Board; 
 •
where external recruitment is 
required, to evaluate the balance 
of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge on the Board and, in light 
of this evaluation, prepare a description 
of the role and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment. The Nomination 
Committee would then oversee the 
selection process with the aim of ensuring 
that this results in an appointment made 
on merit, against objective criteria and 
with due regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the Board, including gender; and
 •
to undertake formal performance 
evaluation of non ‑ executive Directors 
who are standing for re ‑ election and 
to ascertain whether the individual’s 
performance continues to be effective 
and they demonstrate sufficient 
commitment to the role.
The terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee were updated in February 2017 
and reviewed by the Committee during the 
year. These terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s investor relations website.
Policy on diversity
The Board recognises the importance 
of having Directors with the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Company to enable 
them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively. They play 
a key governance role in protecting 
shareholders’ interests by ensuring that 
the Board and management are challenged, 
constructively and effectively, and it is 
important that they do so from a range 
of perspectives.
An important factor in achieving this 
effectiveness is drawing members from 
a range of backgrounds, which has been 
shown to help avoid “group think”. We are 
proud of the diversity in our business and 
we recruit and develop people regardless 
of their gender, race or any other 
characteristic. We are of the view that it is 
in the interests of the Company to recruit 
and develop the very best people, drawn 
from the widest pool of talent. The policy 
of the Board on recruitment is always to 
seek to appoint the best candidate to each 
role. 25% of our Board positions are held by 
women and we aim to maintain at least this 
level of female participation on the Board. 
Details of the Group ‑ wide diversity data 
are shown on page 32.

Audit Committee report
Steve Barber is a chartered accountant with 
considerable experience and the Board 
has determined he has recent and relevant 
financial experience which qualifies him 
to chair the Audit Committee. Both Kevin 
Higgins and Helen Keays have considerable 
business experience which enables them 
to make a positive contribution to the Audit 
Committee. The Board is satisfied that, as 
a whole, the Committee has competence 
relevant to the sector in which it operates.
Meetings of the Audit Committee have 
been attended by the Chairman of the 
Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer, the external auditor, 
the Company Secretary (as Secretary to 
the Audit Committee) and other Directors 
and members of management by invitation. 
The number of meetings held in the year 
and attendance at those meetings is shown 
on page 39.
The Audit Committee has direct access 
to members of management and the 
external auditor. It is able to seek further 
professional advice at the Company’s 
cost if deemed necessary.
Significant accounting issues
The Audit Committee’s reviews of the half 
and full year financial statements focused 
on the following areas of significance:
 •
the recognition and amount of a 
potential liability in respect of 
employee share schemes – as explained 
in last year’s report, no provision had 
previously been made in respect of any 
potential liability in respect of certain 
share based compensation arrangements. 
This was based upon advice received 
from the group’s tax advisors. As more 
fully explained in note 2 to the financial 
statements, the board received updated 
legal advice during the year which has 
guided the board to make a provision of 
£11.0m in respect of these share schemes. 
The committee and management met 
with the legal advisors and the external 
auditors and were satisfied that the 
provision represents the current best 
estimate and considered the related 
disclosures appropriate. No benefit has 
been assumed in respect of the indemnities 
from the beneficiaries of these schemes 
in view of the uncertainty of recovery and 
the potentially protracted period over 
which any claims may be settled.
 •
the accounting for and valuation of 
the put options granted to third party 
shareholders in the Group’s investments 
in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and London 
corporate stores – the Group has recognised 
liabilities of £40.3m in respect of these 
options, representing the estimated present 
value of the expected cash consideration 
to be paid upon exercise. The Committee 
reviewed the assumptions underlying the 
calculations and consider the provisions 
to be appropriate.
 •
the valuation of the Market Access Fee 
receivable from the majority owner of 
the group’s German associate together 
with the accounting treatment for 
conversion costs by the German 
associate – in 2016 the Committee 
received a third ‑ party valuation of the 
market access fee and management’s 
assessment of the quantum and treatment 
of the conversion costs; see note 29 for 
more details. The Committee received 
an updated assessment of the fair value 
of the Market Access Fee and the 
treatment of residual conversion costs 
from management as at the period end, 
The Committee continues to consider 
the underlying assumptions in both the 
valuation and the treatment of conversion 
costs to be reasonable, supported by the 
performance of the German business.
 •
the acquisition of controlling interests 
in Iceland, Norway and Sweden – 
the accounting for these business 
combinations achieved in stages was 
complex and required consideration of 
when control was secured by the Group 
and the valuation of the consideration 
paid and assets and liabilities acquired. 
The Committee received reports from 
management outlining the key 
accounting assumptions which were 
reviewed and approved.
 •
the carrying value of goodwill and 
other intangible assets – with a net 
book value of £114.2m, following the 
significant increase in the year arising 
from acquisitions, goodwill and intangible 
assets now make up the most significant 
proportion of the Group’s assets. The 
Committee reviewed projections for the 
relevant businesses and was satisfied that 
no impairments were considered necessary. 
 •
the classification of non-underlying 
items – totalling £15.0m net before tax, 
these represent significant non ‑ trading 
items and have been shown as 
non‑underlying. The Committee 
reviewed these costs and agreed the 
appropriateness of their classification 
in order to present a comparable and 
continuing basis of measurement of 
underlying earnings.

not expected to have a significant impact 
on the Group’s revenues. The majority of 
the Group’s statutory revenues are derived 
from sales to and fees from franchisees and 
the new standard is not expected to impact 
the recording of these. The Group has 
determined that the new standard does not 
impact the treatment of the National 
Advertising Fund.
IFRS 9, the new financial instruments 
standard will be effective for the year 
ending in December 2018. Initial 
estimates are that the overall impact 
is not expected to be material. 
Presentations from management 
and professional advisers
The Audit Committee received a number 
of presentations from management and 
professional advisers, including:
 •
IT and cyber security – the Group’s 
system sales are highly dependent on its 
e‑ commerce IT systems, particularly 
apps for mobile devices. There can be 
no guarantee as to the resilience of the 
Group’s systems to outside attack and 
the Committee commissioned a report 
on cyber security from Deloitte which 
identified a number of areas requiring 
attention. These are being addressed 
and the Committee receives regular 
updates from management on progress.
 •
risks and controls – in view of the 
Group’s rapid growth over the past few 
years, it does not have a formalised 
internal audit function. The Group’s 
internal control environment has until 
recently been informal and often 
undocumented. The implementation of 
the Group’s new Enterprise Resource 
Planning system (‘ERP’) during the past 
two years has required a wholesale 
change in processes and controls. 
The Group continues to develop and 
formalise its internal control environment 
which is expected to be consistent with 
the COSO Internal Controls Framework. 
The Committee received presentations 
regarding improvements to controls and 
whistleblowing as well as approving a 
revision of the Group’s treasury 
management policy. Documentation and 
processes to support the Board’s 
assessment of principal risks have been 
in place throughout the year and a 
project was initiated in the year to 
improve the Group’s operational risk 
management processes. Work continues 
to embed further controls and risk 
management processes into the Group’s 
operations and this will be a major focus 
during 2018;
 •
enterprise resource planning system 
– a new ERP system went live in 
September 2016 and has been built upon 
during 2017. The new system is designed 
to assist in delivering operational 
efficiency gains, improve controls and 
accommodate the continued growth of 
the business. Throughout the year, the 
Committee has received updates on 
progress with the implementation of 
the system. Management continue to 
evaluate the operation of the new system 
and modify the processes and controls 
based on experience gained from 
operating the systems. 
 •
taxation – the Committee received a 
report from FTI, the Group’s tax advisors, 
providing a summary of the Group’s tax 
strategy and tax attributes, and approved, 
the Group’s tax strategy statement. A copy 
of this can be found on the Group’s website. 
Brexit
As we reported last year, the impact of 
the UK’s vote to leave the European Union 
is difficult to quantify. Raw materials purchased 
by the Group are affected by changes in 
commodity prices and exchange rate 
fluctuations. We have experienced some 
increases in raw material prices as a result 
of the weakening in the value of sterling 
against the Euro since the UK’s Brexit vote 
but it is not possible to estimate the impact 
this may have on consumer demand.
Internal audit
As noted above, the Group does not have 
a formal internal audit department. The 
Committee has previously concluded that 
the most appropriate model for internal audit 
would be to engage a third ‑ party provider 
and it was agreed that such a review would 
be deferred until the conclusion of the tender 
of the external audit; our aim is to appoint 
an outsourced internal audit provider in 
2018. The Group’s operational auditors 
continue to regularly audit franchisees to 
support compliance with franchise 
agreements and brand standards. 
Significant accounting issues 
continued
 •
the impact of post year-end events on 
the group’s balance sheet – two 
significant transactions with a combined 
cash outflow of £37.6m were completed 
in January 2018 and an irrevocable share 
buyback of up to £20.0m was entered 
into prior to the year ‑ end but only completed 
in February 2018. The impact of these 
transactions, which have increased the 
group’s net debt to over £150m since 
the year end, are described in the 
Post Balance Sheet Events note to the 
financial statements and in the report 
of the Chief Financial Officer. The 
committee reviewed the Viability 
Statement in conjunction with these 
events and was satisfied that the 
Group’s conclusion as to its viability 
were appropriate.
These issues were discussed with the 
external auditor at both the planning and 
execution stages of the external audit and 
there were no significant differences 
between management’s and the external 
auditor’s conclusions.
New accounting standards
As mentioned last year, the impact on the 
financial statements of the new accounting 
standard for leasing (IFRS 16), which 
will be effective for the year ending in 
December 2020, will have no net cash 
flow impact but could significantly change 
the composition of the consolidated balance 
sheet and phasing of the relevant charges 
in the Income Statement. However, the 
full impact assessment has yet to be 
completed. In view of the intermediary 
nature of the majority of the Group’s store 
leases (from landlords and then sub ‑ lease 
to franchisees), the Audit Committee is 
advised that the impact may not be as 
great as initially anticipated. The Group 
has yet to determine whether to adopt 
the new standard on a full retrospective 
or modified retrospective basis and the 
Audit Committee will report next year 
on the expected method of adoption 
together with the anticipated impact of 
the standard on the financial statements.
The impact of the new accounting standard 
for revenue recognition (IFRS 15), effective 
for the year ending in December 2018, is

External auditor
The Audit Committee has reviewed 
the independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the external auditor, 
Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’), and considers 
that EY continues to possess the skills 
and experience required to fulfil its duties 
effectively and efficiently. The Audit 
Committee’s review of the effectiveness 
of EY as the external auditor is based on 
discussions with the senior finance team, 
the robustness of the audit, the quality of 
reporting to the Audit Committee and 
reports published by the FRC.
EY has confirmed that in its professional 
judgement it is independent within the 
meaning of regulatory and professional 
requirements and the objectivity of the 
audit engagement partner and audit staff 
is not impaired. 
The Audit Committee has held meetings with 
the external auditor without management 
and there is regular dialogue with the 
audit partner.
The Audit Committee agrees the fees for 
the external auditor and has strict policies 
regarding the provision of non ‑ audit 
services by the external auditor which 
can be found on the Company’s website. 
These include specific pre ‑ approvals for 
proposed work and fees, a prohibition on 
certain services and a restriction on total 
non‑ audit fees as a percentage of the total 
audit and audit ‑ related services, except in 
exceptional circumstances.
During the year, the level of non ‑ audit fees 
payable to EY for 2017 are as set out below:
£000
Total audit and audit ‑ related fees 520
Non‑audit fees:
Market survey 119
Other services 20
Total non ‑audit services 139
The market survey was performed by 
an affiliate of EY which was best placed 
to perform that work as it had provided 
similar services in prior years and was able 
to undertake the assignment cost effectively 
by building on work undertaken during the 
previous assignments.
The Audit Committee believes that the 
non‑ audit fees were appropriate in the 
circumstances, particularly as EY has 
considerable knowledge of the 
Group’s business.
Audit Tender
In the 2016 annual report, the Committee 
reported that it intended to conduct a 
competitive tender of the Group’s 
external audit. 
The tender process was undertaken in the 
second half of 2017. The Committee had 
overall oversight and control of the tender 
process, with day ‑ to‑ day management of 
the tender delegated to the Company 
Secretary. Five firms, including EY, were 
invited to submit tender proposals based 
on the Group’s audit requirements and 
assessment criteria, which were set out 
in a formal tender request proposal. 
Introductory meetings were held between 
the bid teams from each of the firms 
and the Group’s senior management and 
function heads as well as the chairman 
of the Audit Committee. Following the 
introductory meetings and submission of 
written tender documents, a decision was 
made to identify three firms that would be 
invited to make formal presentations to an 
Audit Tender Committee (comprising the 
Audit Committee, the Chief Financial 
Officer, Company Secretary and Group 
Financial Controller as well as the group 
Chairman and Chief Executive by invitation). 
The Audit Tender Committee undertook a 
formal and structured evaluation of the 
presentations and tender submissions of each 
of the candidate firms based on objective 
evaluation criteria. Based on this evaluation, 
the Audit Committee recommended two 
potential external audit firms to the Board 
with a preference for the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), 
with effect from the financial year ending 
on 29 December 2019 in order to facilitate 
an orderly handover from EY and to coincide 
with the rotation of the EY audit partner.
The Board considered the Audit Committee’s 
recommendation and subsequently 
announced its intention to appoint PwC 
as the Group’s auditor with effect from 
the 2019 financial year. 
At the 2018 AGM, shareholders will be 
requested to approve the reappointment of 
EY as the external auditor in respect of the 
2018 financial year. A resolution to appoint 
PwC as external auditor will be presented 
to shareholders at the 2019 AGM. 
Going concern and 
viability statement
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the Group’s projected cash flows, 
facilities and covenants as well as reviewing 
the assumptions underlying the viability 
statement and concluded that it could 
recommend to the Board that it should 
be able to make the relevant statements. 
Fair, balanced, understandable 
and comprehensive reporting
The Audit Committee has provided advice 
to the Board on whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s financial position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each Director was also asked to provide 
this confirmation. When doing so, both the 
Committee and the individual Directors 
were provided by management with a formal 
assessment of the key messages included 
in the annual report. The assessment was 
designed to test the quality of reporting 
and to enable the Directors to satisfy 
themselves that the levels of disclosure 
were appropriate.
Terms of reference
The terms of reference for the Audit 
Committee were revised in February 2017 
and further reviewed by the Committee 
during the year. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s 
investor relations website.

CHAIRMAN’S SUMMARY STATEMENT
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the 
Board, the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
In this report, we review the Group’s 
performance in the year and explain the 
pay which resulted for the Executive 
Directors, we explain the fees we paid to 
the non ‑ executive Directors and we also 
set out how we intend to implement our 
remuneration policy in 2018.
Performance and 
remuneration for 2017
2017 was a year of continued operational 
and strategic progress. Despite a more 
challenging consumer backdrop, we 
continued to achieve a good rate of growth 
in our core UK market, particularly in the 
second half of the year. UK like ‑ for‑ like 
growth was slower than in recent years, 
but we opened a record 95 new stores, 
supported by the attractive returns for 
franchisees. We also took significant 
steps to build the platform for future 
profitable growth: we completed the 
bulk of our investment in our new Supply 
Chain Centre in Warrington, providing 
capacity for our 1,600 UK store target; 
we took majority ownership in all of our 
Nordic markets; and we accelerated our 
plans for Norway with the acquisition of 
the number three pizza operator, 
Dolly Dimple’s. 
Reflecting 2017’s trading performance, 
the PBT element of the annual bonus 
(being 70% of the total for the CEO and 
80% of the total for the CFO) was met 
partially and the Remuneration Committee 
assessed that the personal performance 
objectives (being the balancing 30% of the 
total for the CEO and the balancing 20% 
of the total for the CFO) were partially 
achieved for the CEO and partially 
achieved for the CFO. This resulted in a 
payment of 50.91% of the maximum for 
the CEO and 41.3% of the maximum for 
the CFO. This will result in a bonus of 
£259,663 becoming payable in cash to 
David Wild, CEO and a bonus of £167,906 
becoming payable to Rachel Osborne, 
CFO, two ‑ thirds of which will be settled 
in cash and the remaining one ‑ third settled 
in shares and deferred for two years.
In 2015, LTIP awards were made to 
David Wild over 227,679 Ordinary shares 
(after adjustment for the three ‑ for‑ one 
sub‑ division of shares effective on 
27 June 2016). The LTIP awards were 
subject to stretching performance 
targets, with 50% of the award being 
subject to EPS growth and 50% subject 
to a TSR target. Over the performance 
period, underlying EPS grew by 
75.5% and the Company’s share price 
performance was above the median 
relative to the constituents of the FTSE 
250 Index (excluding investment trusts). 
Accordingly the performance conditions 
for the award were met partially and will 
result in 90.945% of the awards vesting, 
subject to continued employment to the 
vesting date.
As Rachel Osborne joined as Chief 
Financial Officer in October 2016, she 
received an LTIP award to compensate 
her for share ‑ based incentives forfeited 
from her previous employer as a 
consequence of joining Domino’s Pizza. 
The award comprised two tranches. 
The first tranche of this award vested 
in November 2017 and was not subject 
to any performance conditions. The 
second tranche was subject to the same 
performance criteria that applied to 
the 2015 LTIP awards that were made 
to David Wild. Therefore, 90.945% of 
the second tranche of the award will 
vest in June 2018, subject to 
continued employment. 
The Committee is satisfied that the 
remuneration outcomes for David and 
Rachel for the 2017 financial year are 
fully justified, in light of the business 
and individual performance during the 
year, and are in the best interests of 
the Company and shareholders.

INTRODUCTION
This report sets out the Company’s 
policy on Directors’ remuneration as 
well as information on remuneration paid 
to Directors in the financial year ended 
31 December 2017. The report complies 
with the requirements of the Large and 
Medium‑ sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (‘the Regulations’) 
and has been prepared in line with the 
recommendations of the Code and the 
UK Listing Authority Listing Rules 
(‘the Listing Rules’). 
The report has been divided into 
two sections:
 •
Directors’ remuneration policy  – the 
revised policy was approved at the 2016 
AGM and became effective on that date. 
The substantive terms of the approved 
remuneration policy have been included 
for ease of reference; and
 •
Annual report on remuneration – this, 
together with the Chairman’s annual 
statement, will be subject to a single 
advisory vote at the 2018 AGM. The 
report sets out the remuneration paid 
or payable in relation to the year ended 
31 December 2017 and how we intend to 
implement the policy for the year ahead. 
Those parts of the report which have 
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP 
are clearly identified.
Remuneration policy report
This part of our Directors’ remuneration 
report sets out the remuneration policy 
for the Company which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2016 AGM on 
20 April 2016. 
Policy overview
In setting the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee took into account the following: 
 •
the need to set appropriate remuneration 
policies and packages which will attract, 
retain and motivate Executive Directors 
and senior management acting in the 
long‑ term interests of the Company but 
avoid paying more than is necessary;
 •
setting base salary at or below comparable 
market rates but weighting a significant 
proportion of total remuneration towards 
variable pay with an above ‑ market incentive 
opportunity linked to the delivery of truly 
exceptional performance;
 •
having demanding short and long ‑ term 
performance targets that are specific, 
measurable and aligned fully with the 
Company’s business objectives to 
provide strong linkage between 
remuneration and performance;
 •
creating a strong alignment between the 
interests of senior Executives and the 
delivery of value to shareholders; 
 •
avoiding creating excessive risks in the 
achievement of performance targets; and
 •
conducting periodic external 
comparisons to examine current 
market trends and practices and 
equivalent roles in similar companies, 
taking into account their size, business 
complexity, international scope and 
relative performance.
Implementation of 
remuneration for 2018
The Company’s current remuneration 
policy was approved by shareholders at 
the 2016 AGM and will continue to apply 
for the 2018 financial year. The policy will 
be implemented as follows in 2018:
 •
the CEO’s base salary, which is frozen 
for the three ‑year policy period, 
remains at £510,000 p.a.; the Chief 
Financial Officer’s salary shall remain 
at £325,000, her salary at the date of 
appointment, until 2019;
 •
the annual bonus opportunity remains 
at 100% of salary for the CEO and 
125% of salary for the CFO; 
 •
the CEO will not receive an award due 
to the single up ‑ front grant of 
performance shares in 2016 under the 
2016 LTIP, which replaces three annual 
grants over the period 2016–2018. 
The first tranche capable of vesting 
shall be in 2019; and 
 •
the CFO will receive an award 
under the 2012 LTIP with a face value 
of 125% of salary in 2018. This award 
shall vest subject to stretching EPS 
and TSR performance targets and 
continued employment.
Shareholders’ views
The Committee continues to take an 
active interest in shareholders’ views 
and looks forward to maintaining an open 
and transparent dialogue in the future. 
We look forward to your support at the 
2018 AGM and welcome any feedback 
from the Company’s shareholders.

Operation of the annual bonus 
plan and LTIP policy
The Committee will operate the annual bonus 
plan, the 2012 LTIP and the 2016 LTIP scheme 
in accordance with their respective rules 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules 
and HMRC requirements where relevant.
Within these rules, the Remuneration 
Committee is required to retain a number 
of discretions to ensure an effective operation 
and administration of these plans. These 
discretions are consistent with standard 
market practice and include (but are not 
limited to):
 •
who participates in the plans;
 •
when awards are granted and/or paid;
 •
the size of an award and/or a payment 
(subject to the limits stated in the policy 
table above);
 •
how to determine the level of vesting;
 •
how to deal with a change of control 
or restructuring of the Group;
 •
how to determine a good/bad leaver 
for incentive plan purposes;
 •
how to determine any adjustments 
required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, 
events and special dividends); and
 •
reviewing the performance conditions 
(range of targets, measures and weightings) 
for the annual bonus plan and LTIP from 
year to year.
If certain events occur, such as a material 
acquisition or the divestment of a Group 
business, the original performance conditions 
may no longer be appropriate. Therefore, 
the Remuneration Committee retains the 
discretion to make adjustments to the 
targets and/or set different measures and 
alter weightings as they deem necessary to 
ensure the conditions achieve their original 
purpose, are appropriate in the revised 
circumstances and, in any event, are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, 
where relevant, be explained in the Directors’ 
remuneration report and may, where 
appropriate, be the subject of prior consultation 
with the Company’s major shareholders.
Share‑settled incentive awards and any 
arrangements agreed prior to the effective 
date of this policy will remain eligible to vest or 
pay out based on their original award terms. 
This includes any awards granted under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) or the 2012 
LTIP scheme. In addition, all arrangements 
previously disclosed in prior years’ Directors’ 
remuneration reports will remain eligible to 
vest or become payable on their original terms.
Balance between fixed and variable pay
The performance ‑ related elements of remuneration are dependent upon the 
achievement of outcomes that are important drivers of sustainable growth for the 
business and therefore the creation of value for shareholders. The remuneration package 
offered to Executive Directors by the Company is therefore more heavily performance 
related than that operated in comparatively sized leisure companies and companies in 
the upper half of the FTSE 250 more generally, particularly at higher levels of performance.
Illustration of remuneration scenarios
The chart below illustrates the total remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer based on the current policy under three different scenarios 
– minimum, target and maximum. Given that the 2016 LTIP covers three grants, we 
have applied a value to each tranche to arrive at an annualised value.
Assumptions
Minimum – comprises fixed pay being the value of 2018 base salary, 2017 benefits and a 
pension contribution in line with the approved policy.
Target – for David Wild, minimum plus a bonus payout of 50% of the maximum (50% 
of salary) plus threshold vesting of one tranche of the 2016 LTIP under the relative TSR 
and stretch EPS parts of the award. It assumes no vesting under the super ‑ stretch EPS 
targets. The absolute TSR underpin mechanism assumes 75% vesting is achieved. For 
Rachel Osborne, minimum plus a bonus payout of 50% of the maximum (62.5% of salary) 
and threshold vesting under the LTIP.
Maximum – minimum plus maximum bonus. For David Wild, it assumes full vesting of one 
tranche of the 2016 LTIP and achievement of the absolute TSR underpin. For Rachel 
Osborne, it assumes full vesting of an LTIP with a face value of 125% of salary.
This has been modelled at a share price of 345.7p, being that in force on the last day of the 
2017 financial year. No account has been taken of any prospective share price changes.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Choice of performance metrics
The Company is a growth business, and our 
investments in supply chain, digital innovation 
and the customer experience are all designed 
to improve the profitability of the overall system, 
reach new customers and drive repeat business 
from existing customers. However, neither 
system sales nor statutory revenue are appropriate 
performance measures, because the former is 
significantly influenced by franchisees, and 
the latter is affected by the volatility of food 
costs. As a result, underlying profit before tax 
is used as the main performance metric in the 
annual bonus plan, as this captures both the 
growth and the efficiency of the business. A 
combination of relative TSR and growth in EPS 
are used for the 2012 LTIP, as we believe these 
are the longer term performance metrics that 
are most relevant to shareholders.
Underlying EPS measures the Company’s 
success in delivering long ‑ term profit growth, 
a key contributor to the Company’s valuation, 
and is considered by the Committee to be the 
most appropriate measure of long ‑ term 
financial performance. It is also used by the 
Board to determine success in executing 
our strategy.
Relative TSR helps align management’s and 
shareholders’ interests, since the Executives 
will only be rewarded to the extent that the 
Company delivers a return to shareholders 
above the median company of comparable 
size, with full vesting on this measure 
requiring top quartile performance.
Absolute TSR helps address the issue 
of being the best performer in a falling 
market, by requiring that there has been 
a positive growth in TSR over the 
measurement period. 
All incentives are capped in order 
that inappropriate risk taking is neither 
encouraged nor rewarded. For financial 
targets, a sliding scale is applied, with a 
very modest amount being payable for 
threshold levels of performance.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 53
A number of the Company’s non ‑ financial 
strategic objectives have been incorporated 
into the annual bonus for Executive Directors 
and will be applied on an individual basis 
for a minority of the overall bonus opportunity. 
These objectives will also be measured on a 
sliding scale of performance. 
The Committee will review the continued 
appropriateness of the annual bonus 
(and, if applicable, 2012 LTIP) performance 
conditions on an annual basis to ensure 
that they remain aligned to the Company’s 
strategy. The Committee will make necessary 
changes to the weightings of measures 
and/or introduce new measures which they 
believe would provide a closer link to the 
business strategy within the confines of the 
policy detailed above. Shareholder dialogue 
would take place, as appropriate, should 
there be any material change of emphasis 
in relation to current practices.
How employees’ pay is taken 
into account
Pay and conditions elsewhere in the 
Group were considered when finalising the 
current policy for the Executive Directors. 
In particular, the Committee is updated on 
salary increases for the general employee 
population, Company ‑wide benefit provision, 
level of annual bonuses and staff participation 
in long ‑ term incentive schemes, so it is 
aware of how the total remuneration of the 
Executive Directors compares with the average 
total remuneration of employees generally.
The Committee does not formally 
or directly consult with employees on 
Executive pay but does receive periodic 
updates from the Group HR Director. The 
Committee is also informed of the results 
of employee engagement surveys, which 
do not contain any specific questions 
related to Executive Director remuneration, 
but the most recent of which indicated that 
most employees show high levels of 
engagement and feel that reward is an 
important attribute of their job.
How the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration policy relates 
to the Group
The remuneration policy described above 
provides an overview of the structure that 
operates for the most senior Executives 
in the Group, with a significant element 
of remuneration dependent on Company 
and individual performance.
A lower aggregate level of incentive payment 
applies below Executive Director level, 
driven by market comparatives, internal 
relativities and the potential impact of the 
role. The vast majority of the Group’s 
employees participate in an annual bonus 
plan, with the limits and performance 
conditions varying according to job grade.
The Committee believes that broad ‑ based 
employee share ownership provides a key 
element in retention and motivation in the 
wider workforce. Long ‑ term incentives are 
provided through the Group’s discretionary 
share schemes to selected Executives and 
managers. The Company also offers an 
HMRC‑ registered savings ‑ related share 
option scheme for all UK ‑ based employees 
with more than six months’ service, 
including Executive Directors.
In the UK and Ireland, all newly appointed 
employees, including Executive Directors, 
are eligible to join a defined contribution 
pension plan, whereby they make a 
contribution to the nominated plan, with the 
Company typically contributing double the 
amount paid by the employee. In other 
territories, pension provision varies and 
can be contributions to state schemes, 
occupational plans or personal pension 
arrangements in which the employing 
company makes contributions.
How is risk managed in relation to 
short and long-term incentives?
The Committee believes that the 
consideration and management of risk 
is important when formulating and then 
operating appropriate remuneration 
structures (notably the performance 
criteria) for senior management. All of the 
members of the Committee are also 
members of the Audit Committee, whose 
Chairman is also a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration 
Committee has a good understanding of 
the key risks facing the business and the 
relevance of these to the remuneration 
strategy, most particularly when setting 
targets for performance ‑ related pay.
In line with the Investment Association’s 
Guidelines on Responsible Investment 
Disclosure, the Remuneration Committee 
ensures that the incentive structure for 
Executive Directors and senior management 
will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (‘ESG’) risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour and 
remuneration design can be flexed to address 
ESG issues when appropriate. The Committee 
has due regard to issues of general operational 
risk when structuring incentives.
The clawback provisions in respect 
of annual bonuses and long ‑ term share 
plans also provide the Committee 
with a mechanism to recover monies in 
certain circumstances, for example, if a 
misstatement of results is identified. Share 
ownership guidelines and the design of the 
2012 LTIP and 2016 LTIP help to ensure that 
the Executive Directors have a strong personal 
focus on long ‑ term sustainable performance, 
heavily driven by the relative and absolute 
returns delivered to shareholders. 
How shareholders’ views are 
taken into account
The Committee considers shareholder 
feedback received around the AGM and 
analyses the votes cast on the relevant 
items of business. This feedback, plus 
views received during meetings with 
institutional shareholders and their 
representative bodies, is considered as 
part of the Company’s annual review of 
remuneration policy. The Remuneration 
Committee also consults with its key 
shareholders whenever appropriate. 
A comprehensive consultation exercise 
was undertaken during early 2016 with 
shareholders’ views being reflected in the 
revised policy, which has been in effect 
since the 2016 AGM. The Committee values 
feedback from its shareholders and seeks 
to maintain a continued open dialogue. 
Investors who wish to discuss remuneration 
issues should contact the Company Secretary.
Service contracts 
and policy on exit
The Committee reviews the contractual 
terms for new Executive Directors to 
ensure that these reflect best practice. 
Service contracts are normally entered 
into on a rolling basis, with notice periods 
given by the employing company limited to 
12 months or less. Should notice be served 
by either party, the Executive can continue 
to receive basic salary, benefits and pension 
for the duration of their notice period, during 
which time the relevant Group company 
may require the individual to continue to 
fulfil their current duties or may assign a 
period of garden leave. An Executive 
Director’s service contract may be terminated 
without notice and without any further 
payment or compensation, save for sums 
accrued up to the date of termination, on 
the occurrence of certain events of gross 
misconduct. If the Company terminates the 
employment of an Executive Director in 
breach of contract, compensation is limited 
to salary due for any unexpired notice period 
and any amount assessed by the Committee 
as representing the value of other contractual 
benefits which would have been received 
during the unexpired notice period.
The policy for any new Executive Director 
would be based on terms that are consistent 
with these provisions but will also include 
the ability for the Company to make a payment 
in lieu of notice (limited to a maximum value 
of 12 months’ base salary, pension and benefits) . 
Payments in lieu of notice may be made in 
monthly instalments and would reduce 
proportionately to the extent that alternative 
employment income was received (i.e. 
phased payments, subject to mitigation). CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Remuneration policy report continued
Service contracts and policy on exit continued
David Wild, the Chief Executive Officer, has a rolling contract dated 30 April 2014. Rachel Osborne, the Chief Financial Officer, has a rolling 
contract dated 10 October 2016. Both Executives’ contracts are terminable on six months’ notice from either party and include payment in 
lieu of notice provisions as per the policy detailed on page 53.
Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable. In the event of a change of control of the Group, there is no enhancement to contractual terms.
In summary, the contractual provisions for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months or less
Maximum termination payment Base salary plus benefits and pension, subject to mitigation for new Directors
Remuneration entitlements A pro rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting 
for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below)

Recruitment and promotion policy
When facilitating an external recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will apply the following principles: 
Remuneration element Policy
Base salary Salary levels will be set based on the experience, knowledge and skills of the individual and in the context 
of market rates for equivalent roles in companies of a similar size and complexity. The Committee will also 
consider Group relativities when setting base salary levels
The Committee may set initial base salaries below the perceived market rate with the aim to make multi ‑year 
staged increases to achieve the desired market position over time. Where necessary these increases may 
be above those of the wider workforce, but will be subject to continued development in the role
Benefits Benefits will be as provided to current Executive Directors
The Committee will consider meeting the cost of certain reasonable relocation expenses and legal fees 
as necessary
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement at a level no more (as a percentage of salary) than current 
Executive Directors
Annual bonus The annual bonus would be operated in line with that set out in the policy table for current Executive Directors
For a new joiner, the bonus would be pro ‑ rated for the period of service
Due to the timing or nature of the appointment, the Committee may determine it necessary to set different 
modified performance conditions for the first year of appointment
Long-term incentives Participation will be in accordance with the information set out in the policy table
Awards may be made shortly after an appointment, subject to prohibited periods
Any new appointment would be eligible to participate in the all ‑ employee share option arrangements 
on the same terms as all other employees
For internal promotions, existing awards will continue over their original vesting period and remain subject 
to their terms as at the date of grant
Additional incentives 
on appointment
The Committee will assess whether it is necessary to buy out remuneration which would be forfeited 
from a previous employer
The Committee will, where possible, seek to offer a direct replacement award taking into account the 
structure, quantum, time horizons and relevant performance conditions which would impact on the 
expected value of the remuneration to be forfeited
The Committee will use the existing remuneration plans where possible, although it may be necessary 
to grant outside of these schemes using exemptions permitted under the Listing Rules 
External appointments
The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become non ‑ executive Directors in other companies and that these 
appointments can enhance their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Company. Subject to pre ‑ agreed conditions, and with 
prior approval of the Board, each Executive Director is permitted to accept one appointment as a non ‑ executive director in another listed 
company. The Executive Director is permitted to retain any fees paid for such service.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 56
Annual report on remuneration
Role and membership
The Committee is responsible for the Chairman’s and the Executive Directors’ remuneration and also oversees the remuneration packages 
of other senior Executives. The remuneration and terms of appointment of the non ‑ executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole. 
The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration of relevant senior Executives 
and, when appropriate, are invited by the Remuneration Committee to attend meetings but are not present when their own remuneration 
is considered.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
The role of the Remuneration Committee is set out in its terms of reference, which are reviewed annually and can be found on the 
Group’s website, http://investors.dominos.co.uk. The Remuneration Committee normally meets up to four times in each year and 
additionally as circumstances dictate.
During the year, the members of the Remuneration Committee and their attendance at the meetings were:
Name Member since Attendance
Kevin Higgins (Chairman) 22 September 2014 3
Helen Keays 22 September 2014 2
Steve Barber 16 September 2015 3
External advisers
Throughout the year, New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a trading name of Aon plc, was retained by the Remuneration Committee to provide 
it with relevant consultancy services. NBS was selected on an arm’s length basis and appointed by the Remuneration Committee. NBS is 
a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and did not provide any other services to the Company except in relation 
to senior management remuneration matters. The total fees for NBS services in the year were £42,368 excluding VAT. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews its relationship with external advisers on a regular basis and, noting that NBS does not provide any other services to the 
Group, continues to believe that there are no conflicts of interest.
What has the Remuneration Committee done during the year?
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the year to consider and, where appropriate, approve key remuneration items 
including the following: 
A) Management of individual remuneration
 •
reviewed and approved Executive Directors’ and senior management base salaries and benefits;
 •
reviewed year ‑ end business performance and performance ‑ linked rewards in order to determine annual bonus payouts and vesting of 
long‑ term incentives;
 •
approved long ‑ term incentive awards made in 2017 under the 2012 LTIP; and
 •
reviewed the Chairman’s fees.
B) Governance of the remuneration programme
 •
reviewed and approved the Directors’ remuneration report;
 •
amendments to 2012 LTIP to implement a two ‑year holding period post vesting and more stringent recovery and withholding provisions;
 •
monitored guidance and directional themes from institutional shareholder bodies in relation to new reporting requirements;
 •
reviewed 2017 AGM results and feedback from institutional shareholders; and
 •
confirmed that the remuneration arrangements are not anticipated to inadvertently encourage any undue risk taking. 
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2018
Base salary
As disclosed in last year’s remuneration report and agreed as part of the 2016 remuneration policy approval, the salary for the 
Chief Executive Officer will be frozen at £510,000 until 2019. The Chief Financial Officer’s salary shall remain at £325,000, her 
salary at the date of appointment in October 2016, until 2019.
Annual performance bonus (‘APB’)
As the CEO participates in the 2016 LTIP, his maximum bonus opportunity for 2018 will be 100% of salary. The CFO’s maximum bonus will 
be 125% of salary.
The APB provides a focus on the delivery of the stretching targets that are set by the Committee following consideration of the Company’s 
annual operating plan by the Board each year and there is a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid. 
Directors’ remuneration report continued CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Domino’s Pizza Group plc 57
The performance conditions for the APB for the 2018 financial year will be based both on achieving and exceeding the Group’s underlying 
PBT growth targets set by the Board (70% of bonus for the CEO and 80% of bonus for the CFO) and on achieving individual business 
objectives (30% of bonus for the CEO and 20% of bonus for the CFO) which support the business plan.
The underlying PBT measure is based on internally set targets and pays out 20% at threshold (95% of target) rising on a pro rata basis to 
50% payout at target with full payment only due if we achieve 110% of target.
For 2018, strategic objectives will be set by the Committee linked to the Company’s strategic goals. None of the strategic element of the 
bonus may be earned unless a threshold level of Group underlying PBT has been achieved. Where appropriate, individual objectives are 
also set on a sliding scale based around a target.
The Committee considers that the performance targets in relation to the APB are commercially sensitive and therefore will not be 
disclosed on a prospective basis, but intends that the targets and outcomes are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report once 
they are no longer considered sensitive, as has been its practice in recent years.
The CEO’s bonus will be payable in cash as he participates in the 2016 LTIP. For the CFO, two ‑ thirds of any bonus payments will be made 
in cash, with the remaining third deferred into Company shares, which will vest after two years during which time they remain subject to 
forfeiture. Dividend equivalents may be payable on vested shares. 
Long-term incentives
The CEO’s participation in the 2016 LTIP (which replaces three annual grants over the period 2016–2018) means that he is not eligible for 
an LTIP grant in 2018. 
It is intended that the CFO will receive an award of performance shares under the 2012 LTIP with a face value of 125% of salary. Awards will vest 
after three years subject to two independent performance metrics.

The above underlying EPS targets are considered to be appropriately demanding given the quantum of the awards proposed, current market 
expectations of the Company and internal long ‑ term planning.
50%: relative TSR performance
The remaining half of the award will vest in accordance with the following vesting schedule based on the Company’s TSR performance against 
the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, over three financial years.

In choosing underlying EPS and TSR as the metrics, the Committee has sought to provide a balance between incentivising delivery against 
our key measure of success in delivering profitable growth (underlying EPS) and aligning the CFO and senior management with shareholders 
through a TSR measure.
Benefits and supplements
Benefits in kind provided for Executive Directors are principally Company car provision or an allowance in lieu of Company car, mobile 
telephone, life insurance cover and private health cover for Executive Directors and their family. Benefits in kind are not pensionable 
and are not taken into account when determining base salary for performance ‑ related remuneration. 
Pension
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for Executive Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with those 
provided by other similar companies and take account of changes in relevant legislation.
The Company does not offer a defined benefit pension scheme. Instead, the Company contributes to the Executive Directors’ personal 
pensions or provides a cash supplement at a rate of up to 15% of base salary.
The Committee approves the pension arrangements and contributions made by the Group on behalf of the Executive Directors. The Company 
does not contribute to any pension arrangements for the non ‑ executive Directors. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Non-executive Directors’ fees 
Non‑ executive Directors’ fees are reviewed biennially and the last review was carried out in March 2018.
The fee structure for the Chairman and other non ‑ executive Directors for 2018 and 2019 is as follows:
 •
Chairman – £230,000;
 •
Non‑ executive Director base fee – £50,000;
 •
Audit Committee Chairman fee – £10,000;
 •
Remuneration Committee Chairman fee – £10,000;
 •
Nomination Committee Chairman fee – £5,000; and
 •
Senior Independent Director fee – £10,000.
The fee levels have been updated following a benchmarking exercise which reviewed companies of comparable size and complexity and took 
account of the time commitment of the roles.

legislation, these awards have been valued using the three month average share price to 31 December 2017 (328.26p). In addition a dividend equivalent 
award equal to £32,994 has been included in the value of the vested award. The 2014 LTIP award for David Wild vested during the year but has not yet 
been exercised. Under the terms of the 2012 LTIP dividend equivalent awards continue to accrue until the award is exercised. Accordingly, a further 
dividend award equal to £38,161 has been included.
7  The Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”) award to David Wild made on 11 March 2016, over 67,239 ordinary shares, vested on 11 March 2018. Mr Wild is, on

8  David Wild received awards under the 2012 LTIP on 30 May 2014. The performance conditions applying to these awards were met in full. In accordance 
with the legislation, these awards have been valued using the three ‑ month average share price to 25 December 2016 (346.77p). In addition a dividend 
equivalent award equal to £203,397 has been included in the value of the vested award.
9  The Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”) award to David Wild made on 21 December 2015, over 40,098 ordinary shares, vested on 27 February 2017. Mr Wild is, 
on exercise of the award, entitled to receive a dividend equivalent award of £5,523. This sum was omitted from the single total remuneration figure for 2016.
10  As discussed more fully in Note 2 (on page 82): Judgements, a provision of £11m has been recorded in relation to potential employment tax liabilities of the 
group arising from historic share ‑ based compensation arrangements, the beneficiaries of which include the Chairman and certain former Directors. The estimated 
components of this provision that relate to the Chairman and to certain former directors are some £3m and £3.5m respectively.
Defined contribution pensions (audited)
Executive Directors receive up to 15% of salary from the Company, either as contributions to a personal pension fund or in cash. In the year 
ended 31 December 2017 this totalled £51,000 for David Wild and £48,750 for Rachel Osborne.
Details of variable pay earned in the year 
Annual bonus plan
The incentive for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 was in the form of a bonus based on performance against a combination of 
financial targets, specifically a significant increase in the Group’s underlying PBT, and non ‑ financial targets, incentivising a number of the 
Company’s strategic priorities.
The CEO and CFO had bonus opportunities of up to 100% and 125% of salary, respectively, for the 2017 financial year. Of this opportunity, 
70% in respect of the CEO and 80% in respect of the CFO was linked to Group underlying PBT and operated on a banded basis, 
commencing at 20% for threshold levels of profit performance, 50% of bonus at target, with the full 100% only payable at stretch 
performance levels, being materially in excess of budget. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The non ‑ financial targets set for the CEO, which accounted for 30% of his maximum bonus opportunity, related to a number of key strategic 
objectives for 2017 which included:
 •
international expansion in the Nordics region;
 •
development of the new Supply Chain Centre in Warrington for opening in 2018; and
 •
acceleration of store openings in London.
The Remuneration Committee’s assessment of performance against the above objectives concluded that there was strong progress with 
these strategically linked personal objectives and 23.5 percentage points of the 30% forming this part of the bonus should be paid, 
equating to £119,850.
The non ‑ financial targets set for the CFO, which accounted for 20% of her maximum bonus opportunity, related to a number of key strategic 
objectives for 2017 which included:
 •
utilise the new ERP system to improve the timeliness and quality of management information; 
 •
support for the Audit Committee during the Audit tender process in 2017; and
 •
increase the operational strength of the finance team through external recruitment. 
The Remuneration Committee’s assessment of performance against the above objectives concluded that there was progress with these 
strategically linked personal objectives and 10 percentage points of the 20% forming this part of the bonus should be paid, equating to 
£40,625.
Payment of the bonus is subject to reaching a threshold level of profitability, and this underpin was met.
Accordingly, David Wild is entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 2017 performance amounting to £259,663, equating to 50.91% of the 
maximum opportunity and c.51.6% of salary. The bonus is payable in cash. 
Rachel Osborne is entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 2017 performance amounting to £167,906 equating to 41.3% of the maximum 
opportunity and c.57.6% of salary. In line with the policy, two ‑ thirds of the bonus will be payable in cash and one ‑ third will be deferred into 
shares that vest after two years and are subject to forfeiture.
LTIPs 
An LTIP award of nil ‑ cost options granted to David Wild on 21 December 2015 will vest on 21 December 2018 and two ‑ thirds of tranche two 
of an LTIP award granted to Rachel Osborne on 13 October 2016 to compensate for share ‑ based incentives awarded at her previous employer 
will vest on 1 June 2018. The awards were based on performance over the three ‑year period ending on 31 December 2017. The awards will

1  The 2012 LTIP rules were amended on 21 July 2017. The amendments provide that awards made under this scheme on or after 21 July 2017 are subject to 
a two‑ year holding period and are subject to more stringent recovery and withholding provisions. The amendments enable the Committee to scale back 
(including to nil) the extent to which an award will vest prior to vesting (malus) and (i) extend the clawback period to three years after vesting, (ii) enable 
clawback in the event of gross misconduct that could have warranted summary dismissal from employment, and (iii) provide the ability to reduce the 
number of vested awards that remain subject to a holding period requirement.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to the achievement of performance conditions and continued employment. DSBP and Sharesave awards 
vest subject to continued employment only.
Dilution limits
The Company operates within best practice guidelines published by the Investment Association. These broadly provide that where new issue 
shares are used to satisfy awards made under employee share schemes, the aggregate number of shares placed under award (disregarding 
any awards which have lapsed) across all such schemes operated by the Company should not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital in any ten ‑year rolling period.
Termination payments (audited)
No payments were made to former Directors and there were no payments for loss of office during the year.
Directors’ shareholdings (audited)
To reinforce the linkage between senior Executives and shareholders, the Company has adopted a shareholding policy that applies to 
Executive Directors under its long ‑ term incentive arrangements. The Executive Directors are required to retain sufficient shares from the 
vesting of awards to build up and retain a personal shareholding worth an equivalent of a minimum of 150% of base salary for Rachel Osborne 
and 200% of base salary for David Wild. It is expected that the required shareholding will be built up over a maximum of five years. The 
Committee has discretion to waive the shareholding requirement in exceptional circumstances. Once attained, a subsequent fall below 
the required level may be taken into account by the Committee when determining the grant of future awards.

Total shareholder return
The graph below illustrates the Company’s TSR performance over the nine financial years to 31 December 2017, plotted against the TSR 
performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over the same period. 
TSR reflects movements in the share price, adjusted for capital events and assuming all dividends are reinvested on the ex ‑ dividend date. 
The FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) has been selected for this comparison because (i) this is the index in which the Company’s 
shares have been quoted since admission to the Official List and (ii) it forms the comparator group for the TSR performance condition 
used in the Group’s 2012 LTIP and 2016 LTIP. 
The graph shows the value, at 31 December 2017, of £100 invested in the Company on 28 December 2008 compared with the value of £100 
invested in the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). The other points plotted are the values at the relevant financial year ends.

The table above shows the percentage change in salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive Officer between the current

on a per capita basis. Pay for Group employees includes material proportions paid in Group functional currencies, and the translation into 
pounds for the purposes of this year ‑ on‑year comparison includes exchange effects.
During the year the Group acquired a majority interest in companies in Norway, Iceland and Sweden. This change increased the number of 
people employed in our corporate stores, which generally receive lower salaries and benefits than those in Group franchising operations.

comparator as used in prior years’ remuneration reports.

Directors’ report
Group results
The Group profit for the period from 
continuing operations after taxation was 
£66.8m (2016: £65.2m). This is after a 
taxation charge of £14.4m (2016: £17.3m) 
representing an underlying effective tax 
rate of 18.3% (2016: 20.3%). The financial 
statements setting out the results of 
the Group for the 53 weeks ended 
31 December 2017 are shown on 
pages 77 to 132.
Dividends 
The Directors recommend the payment of 
a final dividend of 5.25p per Ordinary 
share, to be paid on 24 April 2018 to 
members on the register at the close of 
business on 16 March 2018 (ex ‑ dividend date 15 
March 2018), subject to shareholder approval. 
Together with the interim dividend of 3.75p 
per Ordinary share paid on 1 September 
2017, the total dividend in respect of the 
period will be 9.0p compared with 8.0p for 
the previous year, an increase of 12.5%. 
Dividends are recognised in the accounts 
in the year in which they are paid or, in the 
case of the final dividend, when approved 
by shareholders. Therefore, the amount 
recognised in the 2017 accounts, as described 
in note 14 on page 101, comprises the 2016 
final dividend and the 2017 interim dividend.
Share capital
As at 31 December 2017, the Company’s 
authorised share capital was £4,000,000 
divided into a single class of 768,000,000 
Ordinary shares of 25/48p each and there 
were 486,834,530 Ordinary shares in issue. 
All issued Ordinary shares are fully paid up. 
The Ordinary shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and can be held in 
certificated or uncertificated form.
Holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to 
attend and speak at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint one or more proxies 
and, if they are corporations, corporate 
representatives who are entitled to attend 
general meetings and to exercise voting rights. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting 
of the Company every holder of Ordinary 
shares present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote shall have one vote, unless 
the proxy is appointed by more than one 
shareholder and has been instructed by one 
or more shareholders to vote for the resolution 
and by one or more shareholders to vote 
against the resolution, in which case the 
proxy has one vote for and one vote against. 
This reflects the position in the Shareholders’ 
Rights Regulations 2009 which amended 
the Companies Act 2006. On a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote shall have one vote for every 
Ordinary share held. None of the Ordinary 
shares carry any special voting rights with 
regard to control of the Company. The 
Articles specify deadlines for exercising 
voting rights and appointing a proxy or 
proxies to vote in relation to resolutions 
to be passed at the AGM. The relevant 
proxy votes are counted and the number 
for, against or withheld in relation to each 
resolution are announced at the AGM and 
published on the Company’s website after 
the meeting.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 66
Share capital continued
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of Ordinary shares in the Company other 
than certain restrictions that may be 
imposed from time to time by the Articles, 
law or regulation and pursuant to the 
Listing Rules whereby certain Directors, 
officers and employees require approval 
to deal in Ordinary shares of the Company. 
The Group is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer 
of Ordinary shares.
Shares held by employee share trusts 
The Group has had an employee 
benefit trust (‘EBT’) for a number of 
years, the trustee of which is Intertrust 
Fiduciary Services (Jersey) Limited. As at 
31 December 2017, the EBT held 2,114,550 
shares, which are used to satisfy awards 
under employee share schemes. The 
voting rights in relation to these shares 
are exercisable by the trustee; however, in 
accordance with best practice guidance, 
the trustee abstains from voting.
Dividend waivers 
A dividend waiver is in force in relation 
to shares in the Company held by the EBT 
(see previous paragraph), which relates 
to a total of 2,114,550 shares. 
Purchase of own shares
At the 2017 AGM, a special resolution 
was passed to authorise the Company 
to make purchases on the London Stock 
Exchange of up to 10% of its Ordinary 
shares for the year under review. The 
Company engages in share buybacks to 
create value for shareholders when cash 
flows permit and there is no immediate 
alternative investment use for the funds. 
Shareholders will be requested to renew 
this authority at the forthcoming AGM, 
to be held on 19 April 2018.
During the year the Company made 
purchases of 7,849,454 Ordinary shares 
with a nominal value of £40,882. Since the 
year end the Company has made purchases 
over 5,310,000 Ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of £27,656, under the terms of the 
Share Purchase Programme announced 
on 15 December 2017.
Directors and their interests
The Directors in service at 31 December 2017 
were Stephen Hemsley, Colin Halpern, 
David Wild, Rachel Osborne, Helen Keays, 
Ebbe Jacobsen, Kevin Higgins and Steve Barber.
The biographical details of the present 
Directors are set out on pages 34 and 35 of 
this Annual Report.
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the Articles of the 
Company, the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. Subject to the Articles of 
Association, the Companies Act 2006 and 
any directions given by special resolution, the 
business of the Company is managed by 
the Board, which may exercise all the 
powers of the Company.
The interests of Directors and their 
immediate families in the shares of the 
Company, along with details of options and 
awards held by Executive Directors, are 
contained in the Directors’ remuneration 
report set out on pages 46 to 64. Should 
any Ordinary shares be required to satisfy 
awards over shares, these may be provided 
by the EBT.
There have not been any changes in the 
interests of the Directors, including share 
options and awards, in the share capital of 
the Company between the year end and 
8 March 2018. None of the Directors have 
a beneficial interest in the shares of 
any subsidiary.
In line with the Companies Act 2006, the 
Board has clear procedures for Directors to 
formally disclose any actual or potential 
conflicts to the whole Board for authorisation 
as necessary. All new conflicts are required 
to be disclosed as and when they arise. 
There is an annual review of conflicts disclosed 
and authorisations given. The register of 
Directors’ conflicts is maintained by the 
Company Secretary.
Directors’ indemnities 
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity 
provision contained in the Articles of 
Association. The provision, which is a 
qualifying third ‑ party indemnity provision 
(as defined by section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006), was in force during the year 
ended 31 December 2017 and remains in 
force and relates to certain losses and 
liabilities which the Directors may incur 
to third parties in the course of acting as 
Directors or employees of the Company.
The Group maintained a directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the financial year, although no cover exists 
in the event that Directors or officers are 
found to have acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly. No indemnity is provided 
for the Group’s auditor.
Employees
The Group employed 3,490 people as at 
31 December 2017 (2016: 999 – including 
discontinued operations).
Employment policies
The Group is committed to the principle of 
equal opportunity in employment. The 
Group recruits and selects applicants for 
employment based solely on a person’s 
qualifications and suitability for the position, 
whilst bearing in mind equality and diversity. 
It is the Group’s policy to recruit the most 
capable person available for each position. 
The Group recognises the need to treat all 
employees honestly and fairly. The Group 
is committed to ensuring that its employees 
feel respected and valued and are able to

General information
Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the AGM to be 
held at 12.00 noon on 19 April 2018 at 
the Company’s Supply Chain Centre, 
1 Thornbury, West Ashland, Milton Keynes 
MK6 4BB, is contained in a separate 
shareholder circular. Full details of all 
resolutions to be proposed are provided in 
that document. The Directors consider that 
all of the resolutions set out in the Notice 
of AGM are in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole. 
The Directors will be voting in favour of 
them and unanimously recommend that 
shareholders vote in favour of each of them.
Significant agreements and change 
of control provisions
The Group judges that the only significant 
agreements in relation to its business are 
the UK and ROI Master Franchise Agreement, 
the Know How Licence Agreement and the 
Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein 
Master Franchise Agreement pursuant to 
which certain of the Group’s companies are 
granted the right to franchise stores and 
operate commissaries in the territories by 
Domino’s Pizza International Franchising Inc.
The Group’s significant agreements listed 
above do not terminate on a change of 
control. The Group does not have agreements 
with any Director or employee that would 
provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover 
except that provisions of the Group’s employee 
share schemes may cause options and 
awards granted to employees, including 
Directors, to vest on a change of control. 
The Group’s banking arrangements do 
contain change of control provisions which, 
if triggered, could limit future utilisations, 
require the repayment of existing utilisations 
or lead to a renegotiation of terms.
As discussed more fully on page 82 in Note 2: 
Accounting policies in the section on key 
judgements and estimates, the Chairman 
and certain former directors entered into 
indemnity contracts with the Group in 
connection with their participation in some 
historic share based remuneration schemes. 
A provision for employment taxes amounting 
to £11.0m has been recorded in these 
financial statements, of which the Company 
has estimated that £9 million could be 
recoverable under the indemnities. The 
amount that the company has estimated it 
would recover from the Chairman under the 
indemnity with him, and based on the amount 
provided, equates to approximately £3m.
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association remained 
unchanged during the 2017 financial 
year and can only be amended by special 
resolution at a general meeting of the 
shareholders. A resolution to adopt new 
Articles of Association will be put to 
shareholders at the AGM in 2018.

Directors’ statement of disclosure 
of information to auditor
Having made the requisite enquiries, 
the Directors in office at the date of this 
Annual Report and Accounts have each 
confirmed that, so far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Group’s auditor is unaware and 
each Director has taken all the steps he/she 
ought to have taken as a Director to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and 
position, are set out in the strategic report 
on pages 2 to 33. The financial position of 
the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 16 to 19.
In addition, notes 28 and 29 to the 
Group financial statements include the 
Company’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and have therefore 
continued to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Cautionary statement
This Annual Report and Accounts 
contains forward‑ looking statements. 
These forward ‑ looking statements are not 
guarantees of future performance; rather, 
they are based on current views and 
assumptions as at the date of this Annual 
Report and Accounts and are made by 
the Directors in good faith based on the 
information available to them at the time of 
their approval of this report. These statements 
should be treated with caution due to the 
inherent risks and uncertainties underlying 
any such forward ‑ looking information. The 
Group undertakes no obligation to update 
these forward ‑ looking statements.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report & Accounts, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the 
financial statements (Group and Company) 
in accordance with applicable UK laws and 
regulations. UK company law requires the 
Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, 
the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) 
and applicable UK law. Further, they have 
elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK 
accounting standards (UK GAAP) 
and applicable UK law.
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they are a true and fair 
view of the Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 •
select suitable accounting policies 
in accordance with IAS 8 (Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors) and then apply 
them consistently;
 •
present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner which presents 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 •
provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 •
state that the Group has complied 
with IFRS, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements.
In preparing the Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 •
select suitable accounting policies 
and apply them consistently;
 •
make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 •
state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 •
prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Annual Report & Accounts and financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, with regard to the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
the system of internal control for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
A copy of the financial statements of the 
Company is posted on the Company’s 
website. The Directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included 
on the website. Information published on the 
Company’s website is accessible in many 
countries with different legal requirements. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
DTR 4.1 statement
Each of the Directors, the names and functions 
of whom are set out on pages 34 and 35, 
confirms that, to the best of their knowledge, 
they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards and that the financial 
statements give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group and the Company and 
of the Group’s income statement for that 
period. In addition, each of the Directors 
confirms that the strategic report represented 
by the Directors’ report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and Group, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Having taken 
advice from the Audit Committee, the 
Board considers the Annual Report & 
Accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and that it 
provides the information necessary for the 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
and Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters
 •
Reversionary interest share-based compensation scheme taxation
 •
Susceptibility to management override in recharging expenditure incurred by the group to the National 
Advertising Fund
 •
Susceptibility to management override in the recognition of revenue through manual journals
 •
Appropriate classification and disclosure of non-underlying items
 •
Impairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets
Audit scope
 •
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components and audit procedures on specific 
balances for a further 6 components. 
 •
The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% of Profit before 
non-underlying items and taxation from continuing operations, 98% of Revenue and 97% of Total assets.
Materiality
 •
Overall group materiality of £4.8m which represents 5% of profit before non-underlying items and taxation from 
continuing operations.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Reversionary interest share-based 
compensation scheme taxation
Refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(page 59), Directors’ Report (page 67), Audit 
Committee Report (page 43); Accounting 
policies (page 82); and Note 27 and 37 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements (page 113 
and 124, respectively).
Certain of the Group’s historic share-based 
compensation arrangements dating from 2003 
to 2010 involved the use of employee benefit 
trusts which provided award recipients with 
reversionary interests in the form of share 
appreciation rights. Significant judgement 
is required to determine the treatment of such 
compensation from an employment 
tax perspective. 
There is a risk that if HMRC were to reach a 
different judgement on the employment tax 
treatment of the compensation arrangements, 
this may give rise to material adverse income 
statement and/or cash flow variances.
During 2017, the Group updated its legal advice 
following recent decisions by the Supreme 
Court concerning the taxation of historic 
remuneration structures. This advice was 
received in January 2018. 
A provision of £11m has been recorded in the 
year based upon management’s estimate of the 
gross tax that may become payable to HMRC. 
The Chairman and certain other former 
directors and employees were award 
recipients. They have provided indemnities to 
the group in respect of future employment tax 
payable by the group on their awards. No asset 
has been recognised in respect of amounts 
recoverable under these indemnities as the 
recoverability of such amounts is not yet 
virtually certain.
We have inspected a sample of the compensation contracts 
to gain an understanding of the commercial purpose of 
the awards.
We examined historic correspondence between HMRC and 
the Group to understand the latest views of HMRC on 
management’s tax treatment of the awards.
We have involved our remuneration tax specialists to 
support us in corroborating the advice provided to the 
Group by the Group’s legal and tax advisers with regard to 
the effectiveness of the design and implementation of the 
schemes. We corroborated our understanding of the advice 
given to the Group by reading the report they issued to 
Group management, requesting a legal letter and inspecting 
the source documentation provided to the advisers to 
corroborate that it was an appropriate basis upon which 
to provide their legal advice.
We re-performed the calculation of the estimated 
employment tax payable, corroborated the source data used in 
the calculation to the protective assessments issued by HMRC 
and performed an independent assessment of the interest 
payable. We compared the basis upon which the tax provision 
has been calculated to equivalent case law to assess the 
appropriateness of management’s judgement.
We have inspected professional advice in respect of the 
effectiveness of indemnity arrangements provided to the 
Group from award recipients to understand whether the 
asset recognition criteria had been met. 
We have compared the disclosures made by management in 
the financial statements, with the requirements of IFRS and 
Company Law, specifically including IAS 24 – Related Party 
Disclosures, IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets, Companies Act 2006 and the Listing 
Rule requirements.
We concur with management’s 
conclusion that the recent 
legal advice provides a basis 
upon which a reasonable 
estimate of the probable 
liability to HMRC can 
be made.
We consider the disclosures 
in respect of key judgements, 
directors’ remuneration, related 
party transactions and 
provisions proposed by 
management to be 
in accordance with 
the relevant accounting 
standards and company law.

National Advertising Fund expenditure
Refer to the Accounting policies (page 87); and 
Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 104)
Franchisees pay contributions which are 
collected by the Group for specific use within 
the National Advertising Fund (‘NAF’). The fund 
is operated by the Group on behalf of franchisees 
with the objective of driving revenues for their 
stores. Total contributions made to the NAF for 
the 53 week period amounted to £46.8m (2016: 
£41.5m) and the NAF balance at 31 December 2017 
was a receivable of £3.9m (2016: £1.9m creditor). 
The NAF is governed by a framework. 
The description of activities to be expensed 
against the fund is such that judgement is 
required to determine the appropriateness of 
the nature and extent of costs to be recharged 
from the Group to the fund. The recharging of 
expenditure incurred by the Group on behalf of 
the NAF is susceptible to management override 
through inappropriate expenditure being charged 
to the National Advertising Fund (NAF). 
We performed testing to confirm that costs charged to the fund 
are permitted costs under the fund rules by selecting a sample 
of expenses and corroborating to supporting documentation.
We identified manual journals posted to the NAF fund and, 
where significant, understood the rationale for the journal entry 
and agreed the journals to relevant supporting documentation.
We performed a proof in total of credits to the NAF based 
upon a fixed percentage of system sales. System sales were 
substantively tested by selecting a sample of items to test to 
supporting documentation.
We identified no material 
expenses which had been 
inappropriately charged 
against the NAF.

Revenue recognition
Refer to the Accounting policies (page 89); and 
Note 3 Revenue of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (page 91).
Total Group revenue is £474.6m (2016: £360.6m). 
The Group’s significant revenue streams 
include royalties, corporate store sales, 
sales to franchisees and rental income.
We continue to assess revenue recognition 
as an area of audit risk which has a significant 
effect on our audit strategy and our allocation 
of resources. 
There is a risk of misstatement of revenue 
arising from the susceptibility to management 
override through recording of inappropriate 
manual journals. 
We performed detailed testing over revenue recognition 
as follows:
For 3 of the full scope components (representing 85% of 
applicable group revenues), we used data analysis tools 
to analyse all of the revenue transactions for the royalties, 
franchise fees and sales to franchisees (excluding rebates) 
for the year. We tested the correlation of revenue to cash 
receipts to verify the occurrence of revenue. For those full 
or specific-scope components where we did not use data 
analysis tools, we performed alternative substantive 
procedures over revenue recognition, including tracing 
from origination of revenue through to the general ledger 
to ensure that the revenue was appropriately recorded in 
the correct period and at the correct value.
In addition, we performed analytical procedures using the 
inter-relationship of system sales, royalty income and sales 
to franchisees to analyse movements in revenue year on year. 
In the execution of our journal entry testing, we performed 
testing over manual journal entries recorded for each 
revenue stream. We checked these journals to supporting 
documentation and validated that the revenue recognition 
criteria were fulfilled to gain assurance over the occurrence 
assertion and that the values assigned were correct to 
provide assurance over the measurement assertion. 
Revenue was recognised in 
accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policies and we 
identified no evidence of 
management override in 
respect of inappropriate manual 
journals recorded in revenue.

Non-underlying items
Refer to the Accounting policies (page 90); and 
Note 7 Non-underlying items of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 96).
At the half year, £1.6m of non-underlying 
gains were recorded. Further gains of £1m 
and expenses of £17.6m were recorded in the 
second half of the year.
The Group’s accounting policy is to present 
separately, as non-underlying items, income 
and expenses where such disclosure is 
considered useful to the users of the financial 
statements in helping them understand the 
underlying business performance.
Non-underlying items are not defined by IFRS 
and therefore judgement is required in 
determining the appropriateness of such 
classification. Such judgement may be 
susceptible to management bias. 
We have examined the items classified as non-underlying 
to understand management’s rationale for the separate 
presentation and assessed the appropriateness of the 
presentation by reference to the Group’s accounting policies 
and the FRC guidance in this area.
We traced the amounts presented as non-underlying items 
to supporting evidence to assess the occurrence and 
measurement of the items was appropriate. We assessed 
whether items classified within underlying operations, 
met the definition of “non-underlying”.
We reviewed the disclosures regarding items classified as 
non-underlying, with a focus on whether they provide an 
understanding of why they are excluded from underlying 
performance and can be linked to a statutory measure.
The income and expenses 
presented as non-underlying 
items are consistent with the 
group’s accounting policy.

Impairment of acquired Goodwill and 
Intangible Assets
Refer to the Accounting policies (page 85); and 
Note 15 Intangible Assets of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 102).
Following the acquisition of controlling stakes 
within Iceland, Norway and Sweden and the 
acquisition of a 75% stake in a London franchisee, 
goodwill of £50.7m and intangible assets of 
£45.5m have been recognised during the year. 
As the Nordic businesses and Iceland represent 
new, less established markets for the group, 
judgement is required to establish the cashflow 
forecasts and impairment model. The 
acquisition of an existing franchisee increases 
the exposure to corporate store performance 
forecasting. These judgements are susceptible 
to management bias and execution risk. 
We obtained the impairment analyses produced by 
management and tested the logical and arithmetic accuracy 
and to ensure that they had been prepared in line with the 
guidance provided in IAS 36. 
We compared the performance of each acquired business 
in 2017 to management’s due diligence and investment 
appraisal models produced ahead of the acquisition dates, 
in order to identify bias within management’s impairment 
model assumptions.
We performed procedures to obtain an understanding of 
the underlying assumptions made in the forecasts and 
corroborated the appropriateness of these assumptions 
to supporting documentation. 
The key assumptions included:
 •
Discount rates
 •
Medium-term growth rates
In respect of the discount rates, an independent assessment 
was made based on general market indicators.
We tested the reasonableness of medium-term growth rates 
by examining for consistency against the strategic and 
operational plans designed and implemented by management. 
We performed sensitivity analysis over the key assumptions 
within the impairment models.
The cash flow projections 
prepared by management 
support the carrying value of 
the acquired goodwill and 
intangible assets.
A reasonable possible change 
in a key assumption would not 
give rise to a material 
impairment adjustment in 
the financial statements.

In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to distributions made other that in compliance with the 
Companies Act. As a result of the EGM in January 2017 and steps taken by the directors to ensure that sufficient distributable reserves are 
available prior to a distribution, we do not consider this to be a key audit matter in the current year. 
In the prior year, our auditor’s report also included a key audit matter in relation to the risk of impairment of the intangible and PPE related 
to the business in Switzerland. We have reassessed this risk and based on operational and strategic actions taken by management, recent 
trading performance, headroom (please see note 15) and our current audit work, we no longer consider it an area of significant risk. 
No additional Key Audit Matters have been identified for the Parent Company audit.

An overview of the scope of 
our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation 
of materiality and our allocation of 
performance materiality determine our 
audit scope for each entity within the 
Group. Taken together, this enables us to 
form an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the 
group and effectiveness of group-wide 
controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors such as 
when assessing the level of work to be 
performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements, and to 
ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the 
financial statements, of the sixteen 
reporting components of the Group, we 
selected eleven components covering 
entities within UK, Ireland, Switzerland, 
Iceland and Norway, which represent the 
principal business units within the Group.
Of the eleven components selected, the 
primary audit team performed an audit of 
the complete financial information of five 
components (“full scope components”) 
which were selected based on their size or 
risk characteristics. For the remaining six 
components (“specific scope components”), 
we performed audit procedures on specific 
accounts within that component that we 
considered had the potential for the greatest 
impact on the significant accounts in the 
financial statements either because of the 
size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
Of the six specific scope components, five 
were performed by the primary team and 
one by a non-EY component auditor. 
The audit scope of the specific scope 
components did not include the testing of 
all significant accounts of the component 
but will have contributed to the coverage 
of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
For an investment in associate, we instructed 
non-EY component auditors to perform 
specified procedures and determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable 
us to confirm that sufficient audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group as a whole. In the 
current year, one of the six specific scope 
components was an overseas non-EY 
component team that we instructed to 
perform specific scope audit procedures.
The charts below illustrate the 
coverage obtained from the work 
performed by the primary audit team 
and component audit teams.
  FULL SCOPE COMPONENTS 99%
  SPECIFIC SCOPE COMPONENTS 1%

Of the remaining five components that 
together represent 0% of the Group’s Profit 
before non-underlying items and taxation 
from continuing operations, none are 
individually greater than 5% of the Group’s 
Profit before non-underlying items and 
taxation from continuing operations. For 
these components, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, 
testing of consolidation journals, intercompany 
eliminations and foreign currency translation 
recalculations to respond to potential risks 
of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements.
Changes from the prior year 
As a result of the acquisitions made during 
the period, we have designated two of 
these locations as specific scope and two 
of these locations as review scope. The 
procedures in relation to the acquisition 
accounting were performed by our primary 
audit team.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the 
Group audit, we determined the type of 
work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components audited by us, as the 
primary audit team, or by non-EY component 
auditors operating under our instruction. 
Of the five full scope components, audit 
procedures were performed on five of 
these directly by the primary audit team. 
For the six specific scope components, 
where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable 
us to determine that sufficient audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The primary team interacted regularly with 
the component teams where appropriate 
during various stages of the audit, reviewed 
key working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and direction of the audit 
process. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave 
us appropriate evidence for our opinion on 
the Group financial statements. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 74
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in 
planning and performing the audit, in 
evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in forming 
our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement 
that, individually or in the aggregate, could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the 
financial statements. Materiality provides a 
basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to 
be £4.8 million (2016: £4 million), which is 
5% (2016: 5%) of profit before non-underlying 
items and taxation from continuing operations. 
We believe that profit before non-underlying 
items and taxation from continuing operations 
is the most relevant measure of the underlying 
financial performance of the group.
We determined materiality for the Parent 
Company to be £4.8 million (2016: £4 million), 
which is consistent with our Group materiality.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual 
account or balance level. It is set at an 
amount to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of 
uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together 
with our assessment of the Group’s overall 
control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality was 50% 
(2016: 50%) of our planning materiality, 
namely £2.4m (2016: £2m). We have 
maintained performance materiality at 
this percentage reflecting the results of 
our testing of the Group’s systems and 
processes and historical audit findings.
Audit work at component locations for the 
purpose of obtaining audit coverage over 
significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total 
performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component 
to the Group as a whole and our assessment 
of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current year, the range of performance 
materiality allocated to components was 
£0.4m to £2.4m (2016: £0.4m to £2m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all uncorrected audit 
differences in excess of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, 
as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in 
forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report 
set out on pages 1 to 68, other than the 
financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for 
the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies 
or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of 
the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to 
report in regard to our responsibility to 
specifically address the following items in 
the other information and to report as 
uncorrected material misstatements of the 
other information where we conclude that 
those items meet the following conditions:
 •
Fair, balanced and understandable (set 
out on page 68) – the statement given by 
the directors that they consider the 
annual report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the group’s performance, 
business model and strategy, is 
materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
 •
Audit committee reporting (set out on 
pages 43 to 45) – the section describing 
the work of the audit committee does 
not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit 
committee; or
 •
Directors’ statement of compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (set 
out on page 36) – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the 
Listing Rules relating to the company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) 
do not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
 •
the information given in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
 •
the strategic report and the directors’ 
report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and the parent 
company and its environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 •
adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 •
the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 •
certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 •
we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 
68, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors are responsible for assessing the 
group and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the group or the parent 
company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit 
was considered capable of detecting 
irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to 
fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks 
of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and 
implementing appropriate responses; and 
to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, 
the primary responsibility for the prevention 
and detection of fraud rests with both 
those charged with governance of the 
entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
 •
We obtained an understanding of the 
legal and regulatory frameworks that are 
applicable to the group and determined 
that the most significant frameworks 
which are directly relevant to specific 
assertions in the financial statements are 
those that relate to the reporting framework 
(IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 
and the UK Corporate Governance Code) 
and the relevant tax compliance regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which the group 
operates. In addition, we concluded that 
there are certain significant laws and 
regulations which may have an effect 
on the determination of the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements 
being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, and those regulations relating 
to health and safety and employee matters. 
 •
We understood how the Group is 
complying with those frameworks by 
making enquiries of management, the 
company secretary, the head of legal and 
those responsible for legal and compliance 
procedures. We corroborated our enquiries 
through our review of board minutes, 
papers provided to the Audit Committee, 
discussion with the Audit Committee and 
any correspondence received from 
regulatory bodies.
 •
We assessed the susceptibility of the 
group’s financial statements to material 
misstatement, including how fraud might 
occur by reviewing the Group’s risk register, 
enquiry with management and the Audit 
Committee during the planning and 
execution phases of our audit. We also 
considered performance targets and 
their influence on efforts made by 
management to manage earnings or 
influence the perceptions of analysts. 
We considered the programs and 
controls that the group has established 
to address risks identified, or that 
otherwise prevent, deter and detect 
fraud and how senior management 
monitors those programs and controls. 
Where the risk was considered to be 
higher, we performed audit procedures 
to address each identified fraud risk. 
These procedures included testing 
manual journals and were designed to 
provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements were free from 
fraud or error.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 76
Responsibilities of directors 
continued
Explanation as to what extent the audit 
was considered capable of detecting 
irregularities, including fraud continued
 •
Based on this understanding we designed 
our audit procedures to identify 
non-compliance with such laws and 
regulations. Our procedures involved 
journal entry testing, with a focus on 
manual consolidation journals and 
journals indicating large or unusual 
transactions based on our understanding 
of the business; enquiries of the 
company secretary, head of legal, 
management; and focused testing, as 
referred to in the key audit matters 
section above. In addition, we completed 
procedures to conclude on the compliance 
of the disclosures in the Annual Report 
and Accounts with the requirements of 
the relevant accounting standards, UK 
legislation and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016.
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements is 
located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
 •
We were appointed by the company on 
20 April 2017 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending 
31 December 2017 and subsequent 
financial periods.
 •
The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement including previous renewals 
and reappointments is 19 years, covering 
the years ending 26 December 1999 to 
31 December 2017.
 •
The non-audit services prohibited by the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the group or the parent 
company and we remain independent of 
the group and the parent company in 
conducting the audit. 
 •
The audit opinion is consistent with the 
additional report to the audit committee.

The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Please refer to the Directors’ report for 
further details.
Judgements
The following judgements have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:
 •
Stores within the Domino’s Pizza system contribute into a national advertising fund (‘the Fund’) designed to build store sales through 
increased public recognition of the Domino’s Pizza brand. The Fund is managed with the objective of driving revenues for the stores and 
is planned to operate at break-even with any short-term timing surplus or deficit carried in the Group balance sheet (for details please 
see note 18):
 •
as all Fund income is designated for specific purposes and does not result in a profit or loss for the Group, the revenue recognition 
criteria as outlined in our accounting policy are not met and therefore the income and expenses of the Fund are not included in the 
Group income statement. Management consider any short-term deficits to be recoverable from future fund income;
 •
the assets and liabilities relating to the Fund are included in the appropriate headings in the Group balance sheet as the related legal, 
but not beneficial, rights and obligations rest with the Group; and
 •
the cash flows relating to the Fund are included within “Cash generated from operations” in the Group statement of cash flows due to 
the close interrelationship between the Fund and the trading operations of the Group.
 •
Domino’s Pizza Group plc (‘DPG’) has made a number of acquisitions during the period, with acquisition costs, conversion costs and 
other associated income and expense items incurred. Significant impairments and one-off provisions have also been incurred. These items 
have been considered by management to meet the definition of non-underlying items as defined by our accounting policy and are therefore 
shown separately within the financial statements. Judgement is required to determine that items are suitably classified as non-underlying 
and the values assigned are appropriate (as included in our non-GAAP performance measures policy). For details see note 31.
 •
Investments in Nordic associates undertaken during the prior year were treated as associate investments as operational control remained 
with the original operating management team in the Nordics due to their majority shareholding and voting rights. During the current year 
following an increase in the shareholding and voting rights, the judgement has been taken that control has been obtained. This has been 
accounted for as a step acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. For details please see note 31.
 •
Master Franchise Agreements are held by the Group for the UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Management have 
treated these intangible assets as having indefinite lives due to the likelihood of renewal with DPI beyond the current terms without 
significant cost.
 •
On acquisition of a controlling interest in the London corporate stores, a put option was granted over the remaining shareholding. A key 
judgement is the portion that is subject to the put option has been recorded as non-controlling interest as there is uncertainty whether the 
put option will be exercised. See note 30 and 31.
Certain of the Group’s historical share-based compensation arrangements dating from 2003–2010 involve a degree of estimation and 
judgement in respect of their employment tax treatment. HMRC issued protective assessments in respect of potential employment tax 
relating to these historical schemes but the Group received advice from its tax advisors reconfirming the support for the non-taxable 
accounting treatment. During 2017 the Group updated its legal advice following recent decisions by the Supreme Court concerning the 
taxation of historical remuneration structures. This was received in January 2018. As a result of this advice, which includes estimates of 
the Group’s potential employment tax liabilities, a provision has been recorded in these financial statements amounting to £11.0m, comprising 
£2.6m employer’s NIC, and £8.4m employee’s NIC and PAYE, including interest.

Judgements continued
There are numerous uncertainties involved in the calculation of the provision and until the matter has been agreed with HMRC and the 
beneficiaries, the net impact to the group may differ materially from the current estimate. In calculating the quantum of the provision a 
number of significant assumptions were made as follows:
 •
While the Company has not been approached by HMRC with a demand to pay any potential tax liabilities in respect of these historical 
schemes, HMRC have served protective assessments for £36.5m covering employer’s national insurance contributions, employees 
national insurance contributions and PAYE. Our latest legal advice suggests that the full amount covered by the protective assessments 
is unlikely to be payable as the amounts protected appear to have been determined by calculating tax both on the grant and vesting of 
the awards received by beneficiaries of the schemes; 
 •
no further employment tax is due in respect of awards granted to beneficiaries in periods that have not been protected by HMRC and 
for which the period in which HMRC is entitled to raise an enquiry has expired; and
 •
the beneficiaries of the arrangements, which among others include the Chairman and certain former directors and employees, have 
provided the Group with indemnities to repay to the Group an amount equivalent to their share of future tax liabilities should they 
crystallise and become payable by the Group to HMRC together with related interest. Based on the amount of employment tax 
currently provided, the amount estimated to be demanded from the beneficiaries under the terms of their indemnities equates to the 
£8.4m employees NIC and PAYE, calculated at the prevailing tax rates at the time, and related interest. Details in respect of the 
Chairman’s interest in this matter are disclosed within the Directors’ Report on page 67. Details in respect of amounts relating to the 
Chairman, certain former Directors and Key Management Personnel are included within note 37. As the tax liability has not crystallised, 
the Group is not yet entitled to seek recovery of the amounts due under the indemnities. In view of the probable time scale and 
potential uncertainty of recovery of the amounts under indemnities from the beneficiaries, no contingent asset has been recognised 
in the financial statements. 
We are working with advisors to determine an agreed course of action. In due course the Company will engage with the beneficiaries with 
a view to recovering monies under the indemnities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and assumptions
It is necessary for management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the 
balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the period. The nature of estimation means that actual 
outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The following estimates are dependent upon assumptions which could change in the next financial year and have a material effect on the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognised at the balance sheet date:
 •
Determining the fair value of consideration, including disposal of associate investments as part of step acquisitions, acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill acquired in business combinations, requires the use of estimates regarding the value of the associate investments, 
intangible assets and deferred consideration payable. Key inputs are managements expectation of business performance and discount 
rates applied. For details see notes 7, 29 and 31. 
 •
Estimation is required in determining the fair value of any gross liabilities of put options held by non-controlling interests over 
shareholdings in subsidiary companies. The put option liability is based on a forecast EBITDA multiple of the respective business during 
the exercise period, which is the key source of estimation uncertainty. For details see note 24.
 •
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model, consideration as to the inputs 
necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, inputs which arise from 
judgements relating to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees, as 
detailed in note 32.
 •
Determining the fair value of the Market Access Fee (‘MAF’), which relates to the amounts payable by DPE to Domino’s Pizza Group plc 
in future years, requires judgement in the selection of an appropriate valuation input and the profitability assumptions underlying the 
business case on which the payment of the MAF instalments is based. The business case valuation applies a discount rate to future cash 
flows as detailed in note 29.
Basis of consolidation
The full year consolidated financial statements incorporate the results and net assets of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
drawn up on a 52 or 53-week basis to the Sunday on or before 31 December 2017. 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
 •
power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); 
 •
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 •
the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has 
less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing 
whether it has power over an investee, including:
 •
the contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders the investee;
 •
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
 •
the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the 
Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and 
other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.
Discontinued operations
In the Group’s financial statements, the results and cash flows of discontinued operations are presented separately from those of continuing 
operations. An operation is classified as discontinued if it is a component of the Group that (i) has been disposed of, or meets the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale, and (ii) represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or will be disposed 
of as part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations. The discontinued 
operations results and cash flows relate to the sale or closure of the Group’s directly managed German stores.
Interests in associates and joint ventures
The Group’s interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor 
joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Group has also entered into a number of contractual 
arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures. These take the form of agreements to share control over other entities 
and share of rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, 
which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations 
made in determining significant influence on joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. Where the 
joint venture is established through an interest in a company, the Group recognises its interest in the entities’ assets and liabilities using 
the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual 
investments. The Group’s income statement reflects the Group’s share of the associate or joint venture’s results after tax. The Group statement 
of comprehensive income reflects the Group’s share of any income and expense recognised by the associate or joint venture outside profit 
and loss.
The foreign exchange gains or losses on the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture are reflected in the statement of 
other comprehensive income.
Financial statements of associates and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to bring the accounting policies used in line with those of the Group, to take into account fair values assigned at the date of acquisition 
and to reflect impairment losses where appropriate. Adjustments are also made in the Group’s financial statements to eliminate the Group’s 
share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of each company in the Group is that of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
Transactions in other currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying spot exchange rates prevailing on the dates 
of the transactions. At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing on the same date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historic cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 
value was determined. Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising 
on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are taken directly to equity 
until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

2. Accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies continued
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on 
the statement of financial position date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and are taken directly to a translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised 
as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, measured at the acquisition-date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. 
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses. The measurement of non-controlling interest is at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration 
classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as 
an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is 
measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39. Other contingent 
consideration that is not within the scope of IAS 39 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in 
profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest (and, where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships 
or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their 
nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criteria are recognised 
separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be 
measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling 
interest (and where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree) is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing 
interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (or groups 
of cash generating units) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity 
at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
When goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with 
the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation, when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the 
cash generating unit retained.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not 
capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
Master franchise fees
Master franchise fees are fees paid towards or recognised at fair value on acquisition of the master franchise for the markets in which the 
Group operates. These are carried at cost less impairment, and are treated as having indefinite useful lives.
Standard franchise fees
Standard franchise fees are recognised at fair value on acquisition of the standard franchise for the area in which corporate stores operate. 
As reacquired rights the fees are amortised over the remaining contractual term and are carried at amortised costs. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other intangible assets continued
Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Externally acquired computer software and 
software licences are capitalised at the cost incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Internally developed computer 
software programs are capitalised to the extent that costs can be separately identified and attributed to particular software programs, 
measured reliably, and that the asset developed can be shown to generate future economic benefits. These assets are considered to have 
finite useful lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of each of the assets, considered to 
be between three and ten years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Capitalised loan discounts
The Group provides interest-free loans to assist franchisees in the opening of new stores. The difference between the present value of 
loans recognised and the cash advanced has been capitalised as an intangible asset in recognition of the future value that will be generated 
via the royalty income and Supply Chain Centre sales that will be generated. These assets are amortised over the life of a new franchise 
agreement of ten years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the 
indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. Plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and 
equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, 
when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 
recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line method on the following bases:
 •
Freehold land Not depreciated
 •
Freehold buildings 50 years
 •
Assets under construction Not depreciated
 •
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
 •
Fixtures and fittings Over 5 to 10 years
 •
Supply Chain Centre equipment Over 3 to 30 years
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, on an annual basis. The 
majority of assets within Supply Chain Centre equipment are being depreciated over ten years or more. An item of property, plant and 
equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.
All items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets when there are 
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prepaid operating lease charges
Prepaid short leasehold property costs are classified as current and non-current prepayments. On initial recognition these assets are held 
at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost over the length of the head lease.
Available-for-sale financial assets
The Market Access Fee is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset, initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, 
with changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income except for foreign exchange gains and losses, and impairment, 
which are recognised in profit or loss. On disposal of the asset, any changes in value recorded in other comprehensive will be recognised 
in the profit or loss. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
2. Accounting policies continued
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in 
profit or loss.
Leases
Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held as finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease 
liability and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest in the remaining balance of the liability. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are 
capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term. Payments made to acquire operating leases are treated as prepaid lease 
expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Group as lessor
Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, and rent free periods, are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Plant and equipment leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives. 
Where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset, the arrangement is classified as a finance 
lease and a receivable is recognised for the initial direct costs of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Finance 
income is recognised in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or 
when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing 
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no 
longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment 
loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount 
cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future 
periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is 
based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to disposal.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have seven to 28-day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and 
recoverable amount. Provision is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. Balances are written off when the 
probability of recovery is considered remote.
The Group provides interest-free loans to assist franchisees in the opening of new stores. These are initially recorded at fair value, with the 
difference to the cash advanced capitalised as an intangible asset.
National advertising fund
In addition to franchise fees, franchisees pay contributions which are collected by the Group for specific use within the national advertising 
fund. The Group operates the funds on behalf of the franchisees with the objective of driving revenues for their stores. The fund is specifically 
used to pay for marketing and advertising. The fund is planned to operate at break-even with any short-term timing surplus or deficit carried 
in the Group balance sheet within working capital. As all fund contributions are designated for specific purposes and do not result in a profit 
or loss for the Group, revenue recognition criteria are not met and therefore the income and expenses of the fund are not included in the 
Group income statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with 
a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, 
as defined above, net of any outstanding bank overdrafts.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates 
and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases and the accounting bases 
of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, with the following exceptions:
 •
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 •
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or losses can be utilised, with the following exceptions:
 •
when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss; and
 •
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive 
income or to equity, in which case the income tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
and liabilities and the deferred tax relates to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction on either the same taxable entity, or on different 
taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously 
in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events for which it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably measured. The 
amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet 
date, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle 
the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows if the impact of discounting at a pre-tax rate is material.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, 
which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Present obligations arising under onerous lease contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered 
to exist when the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially 
at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

Pensions
The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of certain staff with defined contribution schemes. The contributions are charged as 
an expense as they fall due. Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual at that date. The Group has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Capital reserve – own shares
Domino’s Pizza Group plc shares held by the Company and its Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) are classified in shareholders’ equity as 
“Capital reserve – own shares” and are recognised at cost. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase or sale 
of such shares.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration net of returns, rebates and value-added taxes. Franchisee rebates are recognised 
as an expense within revenue on an accruals basis on the expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance sheet date.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Royalties, franchise fees and sales to franchisees
Royalties are based on Domino’s Pizza system sales to customers and are recognised as the income is earned. 
The franchise fee is effectively a joining fee; it is non-refundable and no element of the franchise fee relates to subsequent services. 
Revenue from franchisee fees is recognised when a franchisee opens a store for trading.
Revenue from sales to franchisees is recognised on delivery to stores.
Corporate store sales
Revenue from pizza delivery is recognised on delivery to customers.
Rental income on leasehold and freehold property
Rental income arising from leasehold properties is recognised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the lease terms. Deferred income 
compromises lease premiums and rental payments. Lease premiums are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Rental payments are deferred and recognised over the period which it relates.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are generally expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of 
an asset are capitalised while the asset is being constructed as part of the cost of that asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and 
other finance costs that the Group incurs. The policy is adopted for all assets that meet the definition of qualifying assets under IAS 23.
Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Executive Directors) in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). The cost of the equity-settled transactions 
is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, 
which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. Fair values of employee share option plans 
are calculated using a Stochastic model for awards with TSR-related performance conditions and a Black-Scholes model for SAYE awards 
and other awards with EPS-related performance conditions. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and 
performance (vesting conditions), other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting 
conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance conditions and/or service conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest on achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vested as described above.
The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with the corresponding 
increase in equity.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of the unmodified 
award, provided the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognised 
for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the Group financial statements continued

2. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in 
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. This includes anywhere non-vesting conditions within the control of either 
the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement 
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as 
described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over 
fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (further 
details are given in note 13).
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those 
equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 3 January 2005.
Non-GAAP performance measures
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS. The Group believes that these 
additional measures, which are used internally, are useful to the users of the financial statements in helping them understand the underlying 
business performance, as defined in the key performance indicators section of the strategic report. 
The principal non-GAAP measures the Group uses are underlying operating profit, underlying profit before tax, underlying profit for the 
period from continuing operations underlying earnings per share and system sales. Underlying measures remove the impact of non-underlying 
items from earnings and are reconciled to operating profits; system sales measure the performance of the overall business, as defined in 
the key performance indicators section of the strategic report.
While the disclosure of non-underlying items and system sales is not required by IFRS, these items are separately disclosed either as 
memorandum information on the face of the income statement and in the segmental analysis, or in the notes to the accounts as appropriate. 
Non-underlying items include significant non-recurring items such as acquisition costs, conversion costs of stores acquired, gains and losses 
on step acquisitions, the recognition of historical share-based payments taxes provision, gains and losses on fair values of financial 
instruments, impairments and amortisation of acquired intangibles. These items are not considered to be underlying by management due 
to quantum and nature. Factors considered include items that are non-recurring, not part of the ordinary course of business or reduce 
understandability of business performance. For a detailed description of items see note 7.
System sales represent the sum of all sales made by both franchisee and corporate stores in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Iceland, 
Sweden and Switzerland to consumers.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
2. Accounting policies continued
New standards and interpretations not applied continued
IFRS 15 introduces a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on performance obligations in customer contracts. 
The Group recognises revenue from the following principal activities:
 •
royalties, franchise fees and sales to franchisees;
 •
corporate store sales; and
 •
rental income on leasehold and freehold property. 
Rental income on leasehold and freehold property fall outside of the scope of IFRS 15. An assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 has been 
completed on revenues and recognition under IFRS 15 is expected to be materially consistent with current practice for the Group’s 
revenue. Had the principles of IFRS 15 been applied in the current reporting period, it would not have had a significant impact on the 
financial statements.
IFRS 16, replacing IAS 17, provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities 
for all applicable leases.
IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. On adoption 
of IFRS 16 the Group will recognise within the balance sheet a right of use asset and lease liability for all applicable leases. Within the income 
statement, rent expense will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense. This will result in a decrease in cost of sales and an increase in 
finance costs. Where the Group operates as lessor the rental income will continue to be recognised on the same basis.
The Group operates as intermediate lessor for a significant proportion of its leases. Where the sublease is substantially all of the right of 
use head lease, the right of use asset will be derecognised and recorded as a lease receivable, with interest income recognised in the income 
statement. Where the sublease is not substantially all of the right of use head lease, but management judges that it is likely the sublease 
will be renewed to become substantially all of the right of use asset then the same treatment will be applied. This will result in lease receivables 
and lease liabilities being recorded on the balance sheet with interest income expense recognised separately in the income statement, 
replacing revenue and cost of sales.
The standard will also impact a number of statutory measures such as operating profit and cash generated from operations, and alternative 
performance measures used by the Group. The full impact of IFRS 16 is currently under review, including understanding the practical 
application of the principles of the standard. It is therefore not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this 
review is complete.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39, covering the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model and the new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment.
An initial assessment indicates that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated results and financial position. 
The Market Access Fee, relating to the underlying performance of the associate Daytona JV Limited is currently classified as an available-
for-sale-asset. On adoption of IFRS 9 this has been assessed as a derivative instrument with subsequent changes in fair value recognised 
through profit or loss. 
The following standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group:
 •
 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
 •
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative 
 •
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 
 •

4. Segmental information
For management purposes, the Group changed how it viewed its segments due to acquisitions made in the period. The Group is now organised 
into two geographical business units based on the operating models of the regions: the United Kingdom and Ireland operating more mature 
markets with a sub-franchise model and limited corporate stores, and International whose markets are at an earlier stage of development 
and which operate predominantly as corporate stores. The International segment includes Switzerland, Germany, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. 
These are considered to be the Group’s operating segments as the information provided to the chief operating decision makers, who are 
considered to be the Executive Directors of the Board, is based on these territories. Revenue included in each includes all sales (royalties, 
sales to franchisees and rental income) made to franchise stores and by corporate stores located in that segment.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss. Group financing (including finance 
costs and finance revenue) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. The comparative 
segment disclosures have been updated to reflect these changes.
Unallocated assets include cash and cash equivalents and taxation assets. Unallocated liabilities include the share buyback obligation, 
bank revolving facility and taxation liabilities.

A provision for employment taxes has been recorded in the year (see note 2). The related expense of £11.0m has been included in the 
compensation to current and former members of the senior management team. The amounts are presented gross and do not reflect future 
recoveries of the expense from certain members of the senior management team. 
Items relating to acquisitions – £0.5m
Acquisition and associated costs of £2.2m have been incurred relating to legal and professional fees on acquisition of controlling 
shareholdings in Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish associated undertakings, Dolly Dimple’s in Norway and London corporate stores. 
Refer to note 31 for details. Also included are fees incurred for the acquisition of a further shareholding in the Iceland Domino’s operation. 
See note 36.
On the step acquisition of the Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish associated undertakings the deemed disposal of the equity investments 
at fair value resulted in a charge of £0.8m. Amounts recycled from the translation reserve amounted to a gain of £6.6m.
Store conversion costs of £2.7m have been recognised in relation to the Dolly Dimple’s stores, which are being converted to Domino’s as 
required under the Master Franchise Agreement ‘MFA’ held with DPI.
On acquisition and consolidation of Pizza Pizza EHF and DP Norway AS (‘DPN’, formerly Pizza Pizza Norway AS) and the subsequent hive 
out of PPS Foods AB the put options held by the non-controlling shareholders over their shares were recognised at the present value of the 
gross obligation. The underlying assets are denominated in foreign currencies, and the foreign exchange movement in the period has 
given rise to a reduction in liability of £0.2m. Non-underlying foreign exchange losses of £0.6m relating to the acquisition of Pizza Pizza 
EHF were incurred during the period. These two items are recognised under finance expense.
Impairment and non-underlying amortisation and depreciation – £(3.8)m
Impairment of property, plant and equipment of £2.0m relates to impairment to recoverable value for assets no longer used for operating 
purposes. Accelerated depreciation of £1.2m and amortisation of £0.4m have been recognised against Dolly Dimple’s fixtures and fitting 
and the brand as the store conversion programme to Domino’s branded stores progresses. An additional £0.2m relates to the amortisation 
of the SFA recognised on acquisition of the London corporate stores.
Joint venture store conversion – £(0.7)m 
Acquisition and store network conversion costs of £0.7m relate to the rebranding and associated costs to execute the conversion of the 
Joey’s Pizza stores to comply with Domino’s international brand standards in relation to support for franchisee store fit-outs and other 
costs. These costs are considered non-underlying as they are one-off charges that would not give an accurate reflection of the Group’s 
profit were they to be included in underlying profit.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At Budget 2016, the government announced a further reduction to the Corporation Tax main rate, which will have an effect on the Group’s 
current and future tax position. For the year starting 1 April 2020, the Corporation Tax main rate will be set at 17%. As a result, the relevant 
deferred tax balances have been remeasured as appropriate.
(c) Temporary differences associated with Group investments
At 31 December 2017, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2016: £nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings 
of the Group’s subsidiaries, or its associates, as there are no corporation tax consequences of the Group’s UK, Irish or overseas 
subsidiaries or associates paying dividends to their parent companies.
There are also no income tax consequences for the Group attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.

A deferred tax asset of £6.2m (2016: £5.4m) has been recognised on continuing operations to the extent that future taxable profits are 
expected to be in excess of the profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.
The Group has tax losses of £6.3m (2016: £9.3m) which arose in relation to the Swiss business and are available to offset against future 
taxable profits in Switzerland. A deferred tax asset of £1.1m (2016: £0.7m) has been recognised in relation to these taxable losses in 
Switzerland on the basis they are expected to be recovered in the foreseeable future.
The Group has tax losses of £9.5m (2016: £nil) which arose in relation to the Nordic businesses and are available to offset against future 
taxable profits in Norway and Sweden. A deferred tax asset of £2.2m (2016: £nil) has been recognised in relation to these taxable losses in 
Norway and Sweden on the basis they are expected to be recovered in the foreseeable future.
Taxable losses that have arisen in the period in the German branch of Domino’s Pizza Germany Limited are available to surrender as Group 
relief to the UK Group and have been fully utilised. 
12. Discontinued operations
In December 2015, the Group agreed terms to dispose of the German operations and to enter a strategic associate arrangement with 
Domino’s Pizza Enterprises (‘DPE’), by setting up a new entity, Daytona JV Limited (‘Daytona’), to be owned one-third by Domino’s and 
two-thirds by DPE. Daytona owns the master franchise rights for the Domino’s brand in Germany and also acquired an existing German 
pizza chain, Joey’s Pizza. 
Consideration for the disposal included a Market Access Fee (‘MAF’) of up to €25.0m (£21.2m). MAF payable by DPE to Domino’s Pizza 
Group plc is deferred consideration for the Company divesting its interest in operating Domino’s Pizza stores in Germany and its exclusive 
access to the German market. The MAF is payable in instalments, which become due annually up to six years from the date of the transaction. 
The payment of each instalment is determined by reference to Daytona achieving defined performance levels each calendar year. The amount 
included as consideration for the MAF is its estimated fair value, based on management’s evaluation of future underlying profitability. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(2016: £1.3m) in respect of investing activities.
Within the tax charge of £0.4m (2016: £2.7m) is a tax charge of £nil (2016: £1.6m) relating to the gain on disposal of £nil (2016: £8.1m). 
Non-underlying income in 2016 relates to the release of provision. The gain on disposal in 2016 relates to the recognition of the fair value 
of the MAF.
13. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary shares that would have been issued 
on the conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares into Ordinary shares.

The Group is obliged to test goodwill and indefinite life intangibles annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles might be impaired, due to the goodwill deemed to have an indefinite useful life.
In order to perform this test, management is required to compare the carrying value of the relevant cash generating unit (‘CGU’) including 
the goodwill with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from a value in use calculation. The key 
assumptions for the valuation are those regarding discount rates and expected changes to the level of sales in stores. Management estimates 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

Growth rates are based on market growth forecasts. Changes in levels of AWUS (average weekly unit sales) are based on past practices 
and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and 
extrapolates terminal value cash flows based on the average long-term growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rate 
for the relevant market. The long-term growth rate and the rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from the CGUs are in the table below:

UK corporate stores 1.5% — 9.0% —
The Group has also conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU carrying value including reducing sales growth and 
changing discount rates. In respect of the international market CGUs, no reasonably expected change would give rise to an impairment charge.
Master franchise fees
Master franchise fees consist of costs relating to the MFA for the UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Each MFA is treated as 
having an indefinite life. They are tested annually for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. The Swiss, Norwegian, Swedish and Icelandic 
MFAs have been tested as described in the goodwill section. The UK and Ireland assumptions are not disclosed as the value is not material.
Standard franchise agreement
The SFA has been recognised at fair value on acquisition of London corporate stores. As a reacquired asset, this has been calculated over 
the remaining contractual term, and will be amortised over that period. The net book value at 31 December 2017 is £4.3m.
The amortisation of intangible assets is included within administration expenses in the income statement.

(a) Investment in associates
On 5 August 2016 the Group increased its stake to a 49% interest in Full House Restaurants Holdings Limited, a private company that 
manages pizza delivery stores in the UK, with a cost of investment of £3.1m.
On 1 February 2016 the Group made a 33.3% investment in Daytona JV Limited, a UK incorporated Company which owns the Master 
Franchise Agreement for Domino’s Germany, with a cost of investment of £13.8m. The Group has a put option over its interest in Daytona 
which can be exercised at any time after the financial year ending 31 December 2020 and Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, the majority shareholder 
in Daytona JV Limited, has a call option over the Group’s interest which can be exercised at any time after the financial year ending 
31 December 2021. The consideration payable upon exercise of either the put option or the call option will be based on an enterprise value 
determined from the capitalisation of future adjusted underlying EBITDA at an agreed multiple of between ten and 12 times.
On 19 April 2017 the Group acquired a controlling interest in the Nordic associates. From this date results have been consolidated in full 
with a deemed disposal of £33.9m resulting in a net gain of £5.8m.
The interests are accounted for as associates, using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements, as the Group has significant 
influence over each of its investments, but does not control the entity or have joint control.

Nordic associates
On 8 June 2016 the Group made a 49% investment in Pizza Pizza EHF, an Icelandic incorporated entity which owns the master franchise 
rights for Iceland, Norway and Sweden with a cost of investment of £23.1m, and a further payment of £1.1m was made as contingent 
consideration during the period.
On 8 June 2016 the Group made a 20% investment in PPS Foods AB, a Swedish incorporated entity which operates the Domino’s brand in 
Sweden, and a 20% investment in DP Norway AS (formerly Pizza Pizza Norway AS), a Norway incorporated entity which operates the 
Domino’s brand in Norway, with a cost of investment of £3.9m.
On 19 April 2017 the Group completed a step acquisition to acquire a controlling share in Pizza Pizza EHF, DP Norway AS (formerly Pizza 
Pizza Norway AS) and PPS Foods AB, and therefore the consolidated balance sheet includes the assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017. 
See note 31.
As part of the share purchase agreement for the Nordic Investments there is a put option contingent on underlying EBITDA, and a call 
option granted to Domino’s which can be exercised from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020.

Both West Country and DP Shayban are accounted for as joint ventures using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements

venture partners.

Banking facilities
At 31 December 2017 the Group had a total of £359.5m (2016: £180.0m) of banking facilities, of which £241.3m (2016: £118.3m) was undrawn.
Bank revolving facility
On 8 July 2017, the Group extended the existing multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility by one year to 8 July 2022. 
Subsequently, on 13 December 2017 the revolving credit facility was amended and extended to £350.0m with a term of five years. 
Interest charged on the revolving credit facility ranges from 0.75% per annum above LIBOR (or equivalent) when the Group’s leverage is 
less than 1:1 up to 1.80% per annum above LIBOR for leverage above 2.5:1. A further utilisation fee is charged if over one-third utilised at 
0.15% which rises to 0.30% of the margin rate if over two-thirds is drawn. In addition, a commitment fee is calculated on undrawn amounts 
based on 35% of the current applicable margin. 
Arrangement fees of £3.2m (2016: £1.4m) directly incurred in relation to the facility are included in the carrying values of the facility and 
are being amortised over the term of the facility. Arrangement fees of £0.2m previously capitalised have been written off in the year.
An ancillary overdraft and pooling arrangement is in place with Barclays Bank Plc for £10.0m covering the Company, Domino’s Pizza UK 
and Ireland Limited, DPG Holdings Limited, and DP Pizza Limited. An ancillary overdraft is in place with Barclays Bank Plc for €5.0m for Domino’s 
Pizza UK and Ireland Limited. Interest is charged at the same margin as applicable to the revolving credit facility above bank base rate.
The facility is secured by an unlimited cross guarantee between the Company, Domino’s Pizza UK and Ireland Limited, DPG Holdings Limited, 
DP Realty Limited, DP Pizza Limited and DP Group Developments Limited, DP Cyco Switzerland Limited and Domino’s Pizza GmbH.
Other loans
Other loans include loans entered into to acquire assets which are then leased on to franchisees under finance lease agreements. The Group 
has an asset finance facility of £5.0m (2016: £5.0m) with a term of five years. The balance drawn down on this facility and held within 
“other loans” as at 31 December 2017 is £0.2m (2016: £0.9m). The loans are repayable in equal instalments over a period of up to five years. 
The loans are secured by a limited guarantee and indemnity by the Company and Domino’s Pizza UK & Ireland Limited (limited to an annual 
sum of £0.3m) and a mortgage charge over the assets financed. The interest rate on these loans is fixed at an average of 5.9% (2016: 5.9%).
DP Norway AS has access to a NOK 4.0m (£0.4m) overdraft and NOK 50.0m (£4.5m) five year term loan facility provided by Nordea Bank 
AB. Interest is charged 0.6% above NIBOR for each overdraft utilisation plus a yearly commission of 0.9%. At 31 December 2017 NOK 
40.0m (£3.6m) was drawn on the term loan facility. Interest is charged at 1.35% above NIBOR with a yearly commission of 0.6%. Both the 
overdraft and loan facility are guaranteed by the Company.
Share buyback obligation
On 14 December 2017 the Group entered into an irrevocable non-discretionary programme with Numis Securities Limited to purchase up 
to a maximum of £20.0m of shares from 18 December 2017. The remaining share buybacks outstanding at the balance sheet date have 
been recognised as a financial liability of £18.3m (2016: 10.0m). The full obligation had been utilised by 5 February 2018.
Gross put options liabilities
On acquisition of Pizza Pizza EHF and DPN, and the subsequent hive out of PPS Foods AB, a liability at the present value of the gross 
amount of the put options held by the non-controlling interests over the remaining shareholding has been recognised on consolidation 
amounting to £34.8m and by 31 December 2017 has been revalued to £34.7m.
The value of the financial liabilities is the discounted value of the gross liabilities for the put options based on the expected value of the 
consideration on exercise of the options. The put option liability is based on a forecast EBITDA multiple of the respective businesses 
during the exercise period. The options are exercisable from 1 July 2019 until 30 June 2020. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On acquisition of London corporate stores on 5 October 2017, a liability at the present value of the gross amount of the put options was

option is exercisable at this value from six months of the acquisition date for a period of six months. If the option is not exercised, the 
option reverts to fair value based on EBITDA multiple from three years after acquisition date.

During the period the Group has utilised £4.8m (2016: £5.7m) of the capital allowances which were acquired with Domino’s Leasing 
Limited. The utilisation of these capital allowances reduces the value of the deferred tax asset which was recognised on acquisition; 
however, it results in no overall impact on the tax charge for the period as there is an equal and opposite reduction in the Group’s 
corporation tax liability.
On 5 October 2017 the Group acquired a controlling interest in Sheermans SS Limited, Sheermans Harrow Limited and WAP Partners Limited 
on which deferred consideration was payable of £3.6m.
26. Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts
For the stores in the franchisee system, the Group has entered into commercial leases, taking the head lease and then subletting the 
properties to the franchisees. These head leases have an average duration of between ten and 25 years. Under the terms of the franchise 
agreement the franchisee is granted an initial period of ten years to operate a Domino’s Pizza delivery store under the Domino’s system. 
Under the agreement, the franchisee also has the option to renew for a further ten years at the end of the initial period provided at the time 
of the renewal the franchisee is not in default of any material provision of the franchise agreement. The property lease agreements contain 
an option for renewal, with such options being exercisable three months before the expiry of the lease term at rentals based on market 
prices at the time of exercise. In addition the Group has entered into commercial leases on motor vehicles and items of plant, machinery 
and equipment. These leases have an average duration of between three and five years.

Reversionary share plan provisions
As discussed more fully in note 2: the employment tax provision relates to certain of the Group’s historical share-based compensation 
arrangements dating from 2003–2010. As a result of the updated legal advice received a provision has been recorded in these financial 
statements amounting to £11.0m, comprising £2.6m employer’s NIC, and £8.4m employee’s NIC and PAYE. Within this an estimate of 
interest on overdue tax of £3.3m has been provided for.
No contingent asset has been recognised in the financial statements in relation to the indemnities provided by the beneficiaries of the 
arrangements. As the tax liability has not crystallised, the Group is not yet entitled to seek recovery of the amounts due under the indemnities. 
The timing of the utilisation of the provision is uncertain, as discussed more fully in note 2.
Dilapidations provisions
On acquisition of the Nordic entities and the London corporate stores, the Group acquired dilapidations provisions which were recognised 
at fair value.
Onerous lease provision
The onerous lease provision relates to the outstanding rent obligation for properties in the UK, Ireland, Germany and Norway. These 
properties include sublets to commercial tenants, properties for which a lease has been signed but no franchisee has been identified to 
operate the store such that the lease obligation has become onerous, along with stores for which the tenant is paying reduced rent and the 
Group expects to make a loss in relation to the lease. The provision will be utilised over the remaining lease term on the properties identified 
which range between one and 24 years. Provisions recognised on acquisition of Dolly Dimple’s have been recorded at fair value.
28. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s financial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring risks which might have an adverse impact on the 
value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, reported profitability or cash flows. 
The main risks are foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing 
each of these risks, which are summarised below.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations. The Group’s principal 
financial liabilities comprise share buyback obligations, bank revolving facilities, other loans and finance leases. 
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or financial foreign currency contracts. The Group’s 
Treasury Policy allows it to trade in derivatives to manage interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange risk.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has invested in operations in the Iceland, Norway, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland and also buys and sells goods and services in 
currencies other than sterling. The Group has also invested in an associate in Germany. As a result, the value of the Group’s non-functional 
currency revenues, purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates. The Group 
seeks to mitigate the effect of its currency exposures by agreeing fixed currency contracts with franchisees and suppliers wherever possible.
The group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures arising on the consolidation of 
overseas subsidiaries.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in sterling against the Euro, Icelandic Krona, Norwegian Krone 
and Swedish Krona exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in 
the carrying value of currency-denominated assets in subsidiaries with a sterling functional currency and sterling-denominated assets in 
subsidiaries with a non-sterling functional currency. The impact on the Group’s pre-tax equity is due to changes in carrying value of 
investments in joint ventures and associates. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is immaterial. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Credit risk
Customers who trade on credit terms and obtain finance leasing and loans from the Group are predominantly franchisees and it is 
considered that the franchisee selection process is sufficiently robust to ensure an appropriate credit verification procedure.
In addition, trade receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not 
significant. Since the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to the franchisee selection process and provide 
guarantees as required under the franchisee agreements, there is no requirement for collateral.
It is Group policy that cash deposits are only made with banks that have been approved by the Board and have a high credit rating (in 
accordance with the Group’s treasury policy) to ensure that the Group is not exposed to unnecessary risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meets its obligations as they fall due. 
To manage liquidity risk, each operating area prepares short-term, medium-term and long-term cash flow forecasts which are regularly 
reviewed and challenged. These forecasts are consolidated centrally to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet it liabilities when 
due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the Group’s reputation. All major investment decisions are 
considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal and approval process. 
The Group has access to a £350.0m syndicated revolving credit facility which matures in December 2022 with an option of two further 
one-year extensions. The Group also has access to Sterling, Euro and Norwegian Krone overdrafts which were undrawn at 31 December 2017. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises predominately from its revolving credit facility.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date. For floating rate 
liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The Group undertakes sensitivity analysis prepared on a basis of constant net debt.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the 53 week period ended 
31 December 2017 would increase/decrease by £0.5m (2016: increase/decrease by £0.2m). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure 
to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings. There would be no impact on other comprehensive income.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it retains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to 
support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns 
and also complies with lending covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and adjusts it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, 
the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in 
the objectives, policies or processes during the periods ended 31 December 2017 and 25 December 2016. At the AGM in 2014, a special 
resolution was passed to authorise the Company to make purchases on the London Stock Exchange of up to 10% of its Ordinary shares.
The Group’s financing is subject to financial covenants. These covenants relate to measurement of adjusted EBITDAR against consolidated 
net finance charges (interest cover) and adjusted EBITDA (leverage ratio). The Group has complied with all these covenants. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of the net investment in finance leases has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at the market interest 
rate. The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at a market rate of interest.
Management has determined that the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and 
share buyback obligations approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair values of bank revolving facilities, fixed rate borrowings and finance lease liabilities are determined using a rate that reflects the entity’s 
borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The inputs used in these discounted cash flow calculations are at level 2 in the hierarchy.
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 –  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 –  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
IFRS 13 requires the classification of financial instruments measured at fair value to be determined by reference to the source of inputs 
used to derive fair value.
The contingent consideration of €25.0m (£22.2m) payable by Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Limited (referred to as the “Market Access Fee”) 
in respect of Domino’s Pizza Group plc divesting its interests in operating Domino’s Pizza stores in Germany and its exclusive access to the 
German market, held through its shareholding in DP Cyco Limited and which became payable from 2017, is carried at a fair value of €10.1m 
(£9.0m) within available-for-sale financial assets. The contingent consideration is payable by instalments from 2017, the payment of each 
instalment being determined by reference to the German business achieving defined levels of EBITDA. As at 31 December 2017, no 
payments are due.
The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the Market Access Fee fall within Level 3 of the IFRS 13 hierarchy. Level 3 fair value 
measurements use unobservable inputs for the asset (or liability).
The fair value of the financial asset recognised is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the appropriate discount rate for the German 
associated Company. The payments are calculated applying an income approach valuation methodology, considering different scenarios 
of projected EBITDA, weighted by the probability of each scenario. The fair value is based on a mid-point in the range of probable fair value 
outcomes of €5.8m to €14.7m based on a range of EBITDA forecasts. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

Description of significant unobservable inputs to valuation:
Significant unobservable inputs Range Sensitivity of the input to the fair value
WACC 8.5% to 9.5% 0.5% increase (or decrease) in the WACC would result in a decrease 
(or increase) in fair value of €0.2m.
The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration fall within Level 3 of the IFRS 13 hierarchy.
The fair value of the deferred consideration of £3.6m recognised is calculated based upon expected working capital adjustments due on 
the London corporate stores acquisition. 
Gross put options liabilities
On acquisition of Pizza Pizza EHF and DPN, and the subsequent hive out of PPS Foods AB, a liability at the present value of the gross 
amount of the put options held by the non-controlling interests over the remaining shareholding has been recognised on consolidation 
amounting to £34.8m and by 31 December 2017 has been revalued to £34.7m.
The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the put options fall within level 3 of the IFRS 13 hierarchy. Level 3 fair value measurements use 
unobservable inputs for the asset (or liability). These inputs include the expected performance of the business during the exercise period.
The value of the financial liabilities is the discounted value of the gross liabilities for the put options based on the expected value of the 
consideration on exercise of the options. The put option liability is based on a forecast EBITDA multiple of the respective businesses 
during the exercise period. The options are exercisable from 1 July 2019 until 30 June 2020.
On acquisition of London corporate stores on 5 October 2017, a liability at the present value of the gross amount of the put options was 
held by the non-controlling interests over the remaining shareholding has been recognised on consolidation amounting to £5.6m. The 
option is exercisable at this value from six months of the acquisition date for a period of six months. If the option is not exercised, the 
option reverts to fair value based on EBITDA multiple from three years after acquisition date.

Nature and purpose of reserves continued
Capital reserve – own shares
This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed EBT and shares held by the Company as “treasury shares”. 
The shares held by the EBT were purchased in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential awards under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and other incentive schemes. During the period the Company acquired 2,940,000 of its own shares (2016: nil). 
At 31 December 2017 the Company held 2,114,550 (2016: 168,756) of its own shares in the EBT which had a historic cost of £6.5m (2016: 
£nil). These shares had a market value at 31 December 2017 of £6.7m (2016: £0.6m). The EBT has waived its entitlement to dividends.
During the period the Company acquired nil of its own shares (2016: 2,932,590). At 31 December 2017 the Company held nil (2016: 4,072,590) 
of its own shares. The shares are held as treasury shares. The Company has the right to reissue these shares at a later date.
During the year the Group impaired treasury shares by £2.8m (2016: £nil) on issue of shares at a price lower than historic cost.
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
the Group’s foreign subsidiaries and the equity valuation of investments in associates and joint ventures carried in non-sterling currencies.
Other reserves
The other reserve relates to the gross liability for put options held by non-controlling interests that the Group is contractually obliged to 
meet when exercised.

Acquisition of Domino’s Iceland
On 19 April 2017 the Group acquired 2% of the share capital of its associated undertaking Pizza Pizza EHF, taking the Group’s shareholding 
to 51% and in doing so gaining control of the Icelandic-based Domino’s master franchise holder.
The acquisition balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect provisional fair value adjustments. Adjustments to the completion balance 
sheet primarily relate to intangible assets of the MFA acquired with Pizza Pizza EHF and recognition of necessary provisions. The MFA has 
been valued using the multi-period excess earnings method income approach taking into account forecast revenue and EBITDA margin 
and a discount rate applied. Adjustments to taxes relate to additional tax provisions and deferred tax on the fair value adjustments. 
Non-controlling interests have been valued as a proportion of identifiable net assets. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

Acquisition of Domino’s Iceland continued
The goodwill recognised above includes certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature. 
This includes control over the acquired business, the skills and experience of the assembled workforce and the future growth opportunities 
the business provides to the Group’s operations. The goodwill recognised is not deductible for tax purposes.
Since the acquisition date, Pizza Pizza EHF contributed £2.7m to operating profit. If the acquisition of Pizza Pizza EHF had taken place on 
26 December 2016, the Group underlying operating profit would have been £96.5m and revenue for continuing operations would have been £487.3m.
Acquisition of Domino’s Norway and Sweden
On 19 April 2017 the Group acquired an additional 51% of the share capital of its associated undertaking DP Norway AS (‘DPN’, formerly 
Pizza Pizza Norway AS), taking the Group’s shareholding to 71% and in doing so gaining control of the Norway and Sweden-based Domino’s 
master franchise holder. This allowed access to two fast growing markets and facilitated the subsequent acquisition of Dolly Dimple’s Norges AS.
The acquisition balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect provisional fair value adjustments.
Adjustments to the completion balance sheet primarily relate to intangible assets of the MFA acquired with DPN for Norway and Sweden 
and recognition of necessary provisions. The MFA has been valued using a cost approach taking into account forecast revenue and a discount 
rate applied. Adjustments to taxes relate to additional tax provisions and deferred tax on the fair value adjustments. Non-controlling interests 
have been valued as a proportion of identifiable net assets.
The goodwill recognised above includes certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature. 
This includes control over the acquired business, the skills and experience of the assembled workforce and the future growth opportunities 
the business provides to the Group’s operations. The goodwill recognised is not deductible for tax purposes.
Since the acquisition date, DPN contributed an operating loss of £6.2m. If the acquisition of DPN had taken place on 26 December 2016, 
the Group adjusted operating profit would have been £95.2m and revenue for continuing operations would have been £478.8m.
Acquisition of Dolly Dimple’s
On 2 May 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Dolly Dimple’s, a leading Norway -based pizza chain operator with 42 stores. 
The stores will be converted to Domino’s stores and provide scale to the operations in Norway.
The acquisition balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect provisional fair value adjustments.
Adjustments to the completion balance sheet primarily relate to intangible assets of the store franchise network and brand acquired with 
Dolly Dimple’s, revaluation of property, plant and equipment in accordance with IFRS 13 and recognition of provisions relating to out of 
market leases and other necessary provisions. The store franchise network has been valued using the multi-period excess earnings method 
income approach taking into account forecast revenue and EBITDA margin and a discount rate applied. The brand has been valued using 
the cost approach. Adjustments to taxes relate to additional tax provisions and deferred tax on the fair value adjustments. Non-controlling 
interests have been valued as a proportion of identifiable net assets.
The goodwill recognised above includes certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature. 
This includes control over the acquired business, the skills and experience of the assembled workforce and the future growth opportunities 
the business provides to the Group’s operations. The goodwill recognised is not deductible for tax purposes.
Since the acquisition date, Dolly Dimple’s contributed an operating loss of £1.4m to operating profit. If the acquisition of Dolly Dimple’s 
had taken place on 26 December 2016, the Group adjusted operating profit would have been £95.1m and revenue for continuing 
operations would have been £480.8m.
Transfer of Domino’s Sweden
On 27 April 2017 the shares of the Group subsidiary PPS Foods AB, the Sweden-based Domino’s master franchise holder, were transferred 
at market value from DPN to the shareholders of DPN in proportion of existing shareholding. This resulted in an additional payment of £1.7m 
from the non-controlling interests, which has been accounted for in equity. The Group therefore retains control and the same ownership 
interest in the Company after the transfer in proportion to existing shareholdings.
Acquisition of London corporate stores
On 5 October 2017 the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Sheermans SS Limited, Sheermans Harrow Limited and WAP Partners 
Limited, a franchisee group that operates 25 Domino’s stores in London. The acquiring Company, Sell More Pizza Limited, is 25% owned 
by the former majority shareholder in each of the subsidiaries acquired with a non-cash contribution of £5.6m for the shares. The acquisition 
provides access to the West London area through the Standard Franchise Agreement (‘SFA’), and the growth opportunities available in this market.
Deferred consideration is a working capital adjustment payable in January 2018. The acquisition balance sheet has been adjusted to 
reflect the provisional fair value adjustments.
Adjustments to the completion balance sheet primarily relate to recognition of intangible assets for the SFA and of necessary provisions. 
The SFA was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method income approach taking into account forecast revenue and EBITDA 
margin and a discount rate applied. As a reacquired asset, this has been calculated over the remaining contractual term, and will be amortised 
over that period. Adjustments to taxes relate to deferred tax on the fair value adjustments. The goodwill recognised above includes certain 
intangible assets that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature. This includes control over the acquired business, 
the skills and experience of the assembled workforce and the future growth opportunities the business provides to the Group’s operations. 
The goodwill recognised is not deductible for tax purposes. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31. Business combinations continued
Acquisition of London corporate stores continued
Since the acquisition date, the London corporate stores have contributed £0.4m to operating profit. If the acquisition of the London 
corporate stores had taken place on 26 December 2016, the Group adjusted operating profit would have been £98.2m and revenue for 
continuing operations would have been £488.2m.
32. Share-based payments
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2017 
was £1.7m (2016: £2.2m). This all arises on equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The comparative figures in this note have 
been restated to reflect the share split in the period, as outlined in note 30.
2012 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘2012 LTIP’)
At the 2012 AGM shareholders approved the adoption of new LTIP rules which allow for either the grant of market value options or 
performance shares. Awards are approved and granted at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee to Senior Executives and other 
employees. Awards are capable of vesting within a three-year period should certain performance targets be achieved by the Group and all 
awards will be equity settled. During the period 1,303,954 awards were granted (2016: 1,085,796). At 31 December 2017, there were 2012 
LTIP awards over 4,072,373 (2016: 3,740,492) shares in Domino’s Pizza Group plc.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at 31 December 2017 was 1.4 years (2016: 4.3 years). The weighted 
average share price for options exercised during 2017 was 281.9p (2016: 341.3p).
2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘2016 LTIP’)
At the 2016 AGM shareholders approved the adoption of new LTIP rules which allow for either the grant of market value options or 
performance shares. Awards are approved and granted at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee to Senior Executives and other 
employees. Awards are capable of vesting within a three to five-year period should certain performance targets be achieved by the Group 
and all awards will be equity settled. During the period nil awards were granted (2016: 1,602,000). At 31 December 2017, there were 2016 
LTIP awards over 1,602,000 (2016: 1,602,000) shares in Domino’s Pizza Group plc.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at 31 December 2017 was 2.3 years (2016: 2.8 years).
There were no options exercised during 2017 (2016: nil).
The fair value of options granted is estimated at the date of grant using Stochastic and Black-Scholes models, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which they were granted. Total shareholder return (‘TSR’) is generated for the Company and the comparator 
group at the end of the three-year performance period. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a 
period similar to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The following table 
lists the inputs to the model used for the period ended 31 December 2017:
53 weeks ended

Weighted average fair value 159.0p

Expected volatility 29.89%
Further information on the Company’s 2012 and 2016 LTIP awards is given in the Executive Director policy table on pages 48 to 51 of the Directors’ 
remuneration report.
Employee share options
On 23 March 2004, the Company established the Domino’s Pizza Group plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘EMI Scheme’).
All employees are eligible for grants of options under this scheme, which is approved by the Board. Prior to 2011, the options vested over a 
three-year period and are exercisable subject to the condition that the growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share during each of the 
three years following the date of grant exceeds growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 3%. For 2011 and 2012 the options vest over a 
three-year period and are exercisable subject to the condition that real growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, during each of the 
three years following the date of grant, exceeds 3%.
The options lapse after ten years or in certain other circumstances connected with leaving the Company. There are no cash settlement 
alternatives and all awards are equity settled. 
No options were granted during the period ended 31 December 2017 (2016: nil).
Sharesave scheme
During 2009 the Group introduced a Sharesave scheme giving employees the option to acquire shares in the Company at a 20% discount. 
Employees have the option to save an amount per month up to a maximum of £500 and at the end of three years they have the option to 
purchase shares in the Company or to take their savings in cash. The contractual life of the scheme is three years. The weighted average 
fair value of each option granted in 2017 was 240.3p (2016: 190.7p). CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT

34. Capital commitments
At 31 December 2017, amounts contracted for but not provided for in the financial statements for the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment amounted to £2.0m (2016: £5.9m) for the Group.
35. Contingent liabilities
Pursuant to the relevant regulation of the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992 the Company has 
guaranteed the liabilities of the Irish subsidiary, DP Pizza Limited, and as a result the Irish Company has been exempted from the filing 
provisions in section 7, Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 of the ROI.
36. Post balance sheet events
On 15 January 2018, the Group acquired a further 44.3% of Pizza Pizza EHF for consideration of ISK3,721.2m (£26.8m) increasing the 
proportion of voting rights and share capital to 95.3%. This increase in shareholding is a transaction with non-controlling interest and will 
be accounted for within equity. 
The Group financed the acquisition through its existing debt facilities. On completion of the Transaction the financial effects on the Group included:
 •
debt increased by the value of consideration;
 •
an additional 44.3% of the share capital of is owned by the Group and it will receive an additional 44.3% of earnings from the date of 
completion of the transaction; and
 •
net assets will change by the difference between the reduction in value of the put option liability as at the date of completion of the 
acquisition and the consideration payable for the acquisition.
On 8 January 2018, the Group increased its investment by €6.0m (£5.4m) and loaned an additional €6.0m (£5.4m) to Daytona JV Limited 
in order to maintain its 33.3% ownership in order to acquire an existing pizza chain in Germany, Hallo Pizza GmbH. The impact of this 
transaction on the Market Access Fee has not been reflected in the financial statements for the period.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
53 weeks ended 31 December 2017
1. Accounting policies
General information
Domino’s Pizza Group plc ‘the Company’ is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its 
registered office and principal place of business is disclosed in the Directors’ report.
The Company’s financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (£), which is also the Company’s functional currency. The Company’s 
financial statements are individual entity financial statements.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income of the parent 
Company have not been separately presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and the Companies Act 2006. The 
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017 and have been applied consistently to all years presented.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101 in respect of:
(a) the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments;
(b) the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
(c) the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;
(d)  the requirement IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present certain comparative information and objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital;
(e) the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows; 
(f)  the requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to disclose IFRSs issued but not effective; 
(g)  the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to present key management personnel compensation and intragroup 
transactions including wholly owned subsidiaries; 
(h)  the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; and 
(i)  the requirements of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards to present an opening statement of 
financial position at transition.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the 
group in which the entity is consolidated.
Investments
Investments held in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
The Company assesses these investments for impairment wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of 
an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable 
amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Interests in associates and joint ventures
Investments in associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Capital reserve – own shares
Treasury shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust are classified in capital and reserves as ‘Capital reserve – own shares’ and recognised 
at cost. No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase or sale of such shares.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Domino’s Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 128
1. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions
Directors of the Company receive an element of remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services as consideration for equity instruments.
 •
The awards vest when certain performance and/or service conditions are met; see the Directors’ remuneration report for the individual 
vesting conditions for the various schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award. Fair value is determined by an external value using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account 
is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired, management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The 
movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding 
entry into equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost 
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over 
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value 
of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised 
if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in 
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.
The Company recharges the cost of equity-settled transactions to the respective employing entity, with a corresponding increase in equity 
and investment in subsidiary undertakings booked with Domino’s Pizza Group plc.
Available-for-sale financial assets 
The Market Access Fee is classified as a non-current asset available for sale and is measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised 
in other comprehensive income except for foreign exchange gains and losses, and impairment, which are recognised in profit or loss.
Provisions for liabilities
A provision is recognised where the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Reversionary share plan
Certain of the Group’s historical share-based compensation arrangements dating from 2003-2010 involve a degree of estimation and 
judgement in respect of their employment tax treatment. HMRC issued protective assessments in respect of potential employment tax 
relating to these historical schemes and as a result of further advice received in January 2018 a provision has been recorded. For details 
see note 2 of the Group accounts.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially 
at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in 
finance revenue and finance cost.
2. Profit attributable to members of the parent Company
The profit within the financial statements of the parent Company is £95.8m (2016: £91.5m).
For details of audit fees see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.
3. Available-for-sale financial assets
The contingent consideration of €25.0m (£22.2m) payable by Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Limited (referred to as the “Market Access Fee”) 
in respect of Domino’s Pizza Group plc divesting its interests in operating Domino’s Pizza stores in Germany and its exclusive access to the 
German market, held through its shareholding in DP Cyco Limited and which became payable in 2017, is carried at a fair value of €10.1m 
(£9.0m) within available-for-sale financial assets. The contingent consideration is payable by instalments from 2017, the payment of each 
instalment being determined by reference to the German business achieving defined levels of EBITDA. As at 31 December 2017, no 
payments are due. For details of the fair value considerations see note 29.

Bank revolving facility
On 8 July 2017, the Group extended the existing multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility by one year to 8 July 2022. 
Subsequently, on 13 December 2017 the revolving credit facility was amended and extended to £350.0m with a term of five years. 
Interest charged on the revolving credit facility ranges from 0.75% per annum above LIBOR (or equivalent) when the Group’s leverage is 
less than 1:1 up to 1.80% per annum above LIBOR for leverage above 2.5:1. A further utilisation fee is charged if over one-third utilised at 
0.15% which rises to 0.30% of the margin rate if over two-thirds is drawn. In addition, a commitment fee is calculated on undrawn amounts 
based on 35% of the current applicable margin. 
Arrangement fees of £3.2m (2016: £1.4m) directly incurred in relation to the facility are included in the carrying values of the facility and 
are being amortised over the term of the facility. Arrangement fees of £0.2m previously capitalised have been written off in the year.
An ancillary overdraft and pooling arrangement is in place with Barclays Bank Plc for £10.0m covering the Company, Domino’s Pizza UK 
and Ireland Limited, DPG Holdings Limited, and DP Pizza Limited. An ancillary overdraft is in place with Barclays Bank Plc for €5.0m for 
Domino’s Pizza UK and Ireland Limited. Interest is charged at the same margin as applicable to the revolving credit facility above bank 
base rate.
The facility is secured by an unlimited cross guarantee between the Company, Domino’s Pizza UK and Ireland Limited, DPG Holdings Limited, 
DP Realty Limited, DP Pizza Limited and DP Group Developments Limited, DP Cyco Switzerland Limited and Domino’s Pizza GmbH.
Share buyback obligation
On 15 December 2017 the Group entered into an irrevocable non-discretionary programme with Numis Securities Limited to purchase up 
to a maximum of £20.0m of shares from 15 December 2017 to 8 March 2018. The outstanding commitment to purchase share buybacks has 
been recognised as a financial liability of £18.3m. The full obligation had been utilised by 5 February 2018.

Reversionary share plan provisions
As discussed more fully in note 2 of the Group accounts: the employment tax provision relates to certain of the Group’s historical 
share-based compensation arrangements dating from 2003-2010. As a result of the updated legal advice received a provision has been 
recorded in these financial statements amounting to £11.0m, comprising £2.6m employer’s NIC, and £8.4m employee’s NIC and PAYE. 
Within this an estimate of interest on overdue tax of £3.3m has been provided for.
No contingent asset has been recognised in the financial statements in relation to the indemnities provided by the beneficiaries of the 
arrangements. As the tax liability has not crystallised, the Group is not yet entitled to seek recovery of the amounts due under the indemnities. 
The timing of the utilisation of the provision is uncertain, as discussed more fully in note 2 of the Group accounts.

Shareholder information
Be a ScamSmart investor and spot the warning signs
Investment and pension scams are often sophisticated and 
difficult to spot.
Fraudsters will often:
 •
contact you out of the blue;
 •
apply pressure to invest quickly;
 •
downplay the risks to your money;
 •
promise tempting returns that sound too good to be true; and
 •
say that they are only making the offer available to you or even 
ask you to not tell anyone else about it.
How to avoid investment and pension scams
Reject unexpected offers
 •
Scammers usually cold call, but contact can also come by 
email, post, word of mouth or at a seminar. If you have been 
offered an investment out of the blue, chances are it is a 
high risk investment or a scam.
Check the FCA Warning List
 •
Use the FCA Warning List to check the risks of a potential 
investment – you can also search to see if the firm is known to 
be operating without our authorisation.
Get impartial advice
 •
Get impartial advice before investing – do not use an adviser 
from the firm that contacted you.
