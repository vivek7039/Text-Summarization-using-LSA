• Exceeded market expectations
 Delivered higher than predicted revenue and profit 
despite difficult market conditions.
• Delivered growth
 Despite the uncertain economic environment and a 
sluggish housing market, the business continued its  
track record of increasing year-on-year profits. 
• Acquisition of Conveyancing Alliance (“CAL”)
 The successful acquisition of CAL delivers significant 
new growth opportunities for the business, specifically 
targeting estate agents and mortgage brokers, 
supporting its strategy to become the leading handler  
of conveyancing in the UK.
• Further widening of distribution 
 The business has won a number of new introducer 
contracts, which, combined with the acquisition of CAL, 
has reduced the run-rate percentage of business from 
the largest introducer down to below 40%. 
• Lender solutions
 There has been a focus on widening the Group’s offering 
to lenders to build on its excellent reputation in the 
market. This has resulted in the winning of a number  
of new contracts.

To help customers who are making 
important lifetime decisions to have the 
best possible experience, and feel they 
have received excellent value.
Our strategy
We will achieve our vision through  
a clear and deliberate strategy.
Always improving
We will consistently strive to understand 
exactly what our customers and business 
partners want, and deliver this to them.
Innovation
We will develop new products and 
services that enable us to hold a 
competitive advantage over other  
firms in our market.
Growth
Through constantly improving and  
trying to perfect the products and services 
we offer, we will attract increased new 
business from our existing customers and 
business partners. Additionally, we will 
forge new relationships that will increase 
new business, including acquiring other 
businesses where appropriate to do so.
What we do
We bring together customers and 
solicitors utilising technology backed-
up by excellent customer service. We 
provide customers with choice, price 
competition and quality ratings. We 
provide solicitors and conveyancers 
with the opportunity to win work with 
no upfront cost.
Our distribution 
channels
We primarily provide our services 
through white-labels to mortgage 
brokers, banks, building societies and 
price comparison websites amongst 
others. Our service allows them to 
provide their customers choice and 
enables them to complete mortgage 
applications efficiently.
Revenue
£22.3m
Revenue is generated principally 
from the completion of conveyancing 
cases and also the associated sales 
of searches and ID checks.
EBITDA (underlying)
£5.1m
EBITDA (underlying) excludes 
exceptional items (see reconciliation 
on page 16).
Conveyancing 
instructions
89,208
A conveyancing instruction is the 
point where a customer chooses 
a conveyancer through the ULS 
platform. This provides a strong 
indication of future revenues. 
Instructions typically take three or 
four months to complete with around 
70% reaching completion.
Conveyancing 
completions
56,789
A conveyancing completion is when 
the conveyancing transaction has 
been marked as completed on the 
ULS platform by the conveyancer. 
This is the point where revenue is 
recognised on a conveyancing case.
ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 02 Investment case
Profitable 
Growth 
The Group has a long track 
record of profitable growth. It 
has increased its market share 
and has plenty of scope to 
maintain this momentum via 
organic and acquisitive growth.
Cash 
Generative 
The Group is highly cash 
generative, turning a high 
percentage of profit into cash.  
This allows it to invest in future 
growth, product development  
and acquisitions whilst still paying 
a dividend.
Progressive 
Dividend 
The growth and cash generation of 
the business has allowed it to pay 
a progressive dividend. The 
directors intend to continue to 
pursue this policy of increasing the 
dividend payment each year.
Independent 
Unlike many of the Group’s 
competitors, the business does not 
undertake any conveyancing itself. 
This allows it to give customers an 
independent choice, and engenders 
a feeling of trust in the quality ratings 
that the Group publishes, on each 
solicitor or conveyancer on its panel.
Proprietary IT 
The websites and the sophisticated 
background technology that the 
Group operates are all built in-house.  
The Group has a strategy of continual 
innovation and improvement.

I am delighted with the progress the Group has shown this year in 
terms of profit growth, with our first large acquisition trading well. 
There are good prospects for the coming year as we increase our 
market share.
Review of the year
Over the last few years the Group has 
been developing a growing pipeline of 
prospective business. Bringing a number 
of these prospects on stream during the 
year, as well as a keen focus on 
maintaining high-levels of service for 
existing introducers, allowed the business 
to grow over the period. I was particularly 
pleased to see us organically grow our 
transactional volumes by 4% while the 
market shrank in volume terms by 13%.
 
There were challenging times with the 
changes in the buy-to-let regulations, 
followed by the slow down post EU 
referendum. However, this was less 
prolonged than initially feared and the 
housing market returned to more normal 
levels in the autumn, although the longer-
term issue of a lack of housing stock for 
sale is still a factor. 
The business has developed and 
launched a new panel management 
solution for lenders which has been well 
received and has resulted in a number of 
new contracts being won. Some of these 
contracts have only recently gone live and 
I am excited by the opportunities for the 
business in this area.
Final dividend
Subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 
28 July 2017 , the board proposes a final 
dividend of 1.10p per share, payable on 
4 August 2017 to those shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
7 July 2017 . This, together with interim 
dividend of 1.10p per share already paid, 
takes total proposed distributions relating 
to the year ending 31 March 2017 to 2.20p 
per share.
Acquisition of Conveyancing Alliance 
Holdings Limited (CAL)
The Group was delighted CAL joined us  
in December 2016. Harpal Singh and 
John Phillips have done an excellent job  
in building a profitable business with an 
excellent reputation; their openness to 
improving both our businesses’ 
profitability is welcome.
 
CAL provides similar conveyancing 
services to United Legal Services in the 
mortgage broker and estate agency 
channels, but with some service and 
brand differences which will be 
maintained. Since acquisition CAL has 
continued to grow and has contributed  
to the overall Group’s profitability in the 
year under review.
Board changes
As trailed in the last Annual Report, 
Nigel Hoath, founder of the Group, 
stepped down from his position as 
Non-executive Director in August. 
Again, our thanks go to Nigel for his 
contribution to building the business. 
Outlook
The prospects for the housing market and 
the wider economy remain uncertain but 
with Brexit two years away there appears 
to be a general feeling of just getting on 
with things. While there was a fall in 
housing transactions last year, the OBR 
is predicting a modest increase this year. 
Whatever the backdrop, the business 
has a good pipeline of prospects and will 
continue to help its existing introducers 
to grow their business. The Group is 
focused on providing the customer with 
an excellent experience and will continue 
to develop products and services which 
further enhance this.
The Group has had another busy year 
bringing on new clients while coping with 
changing market conditions. We are very 
much a people business and everyone 
has been asked to row just a little harder 
during the year and I am delighted that 
they have risen to the challenge. I would 
like to thank all our staff for their 
adaptability and enthusiasm. We have 
been able to increase the number of 
employees who hold options during the 
year meaning that two-thirds of our staff 
now hold options enabling them to share 
in our success.
 
The team at ULS looks forward to the 
coming year.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
09 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 Our market
Over the period, housing 
transactions have declined 
significantly compared to 
the previous year, and are 
markedly below long term 
average levels. The year 
saw two unique events. 
Firstly, there was a 
hangover from the rush for 
Buy-to-Let Landlords to 
complete purchases before 
a key Stamp Duty deadline 
and, secondly, in the 
summer of 2016 the market 
slowed down for a month 
or two following the EU 
Referendum outcome. 
Despite this, ULS has 
continued its momentum 
and grown its share of 
conveyancing completions.

ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 10 Our market
The first half of the financial year started 
more quietly than is usually the case. 
Although ULS held no disproportionate 
exposure to Buy-to-Let, the overall activity 
levels in the market were somewhat muted 
following the rush that led up to Stamp Duty 
changes for landlords. 
Activity recovered through Spring into the 
EU Referendum vote, at which point things 
became markedly quieter, before some 
sort of recovery got underway in 
September. It then held steady to the end 
of the financial year, resulting overall in a 
year where transactions were down by 
13% but where the fall had looked likely to 
be bigger at one point.
In terms of housing transactions, the year 
saw a rise in activity from first time buyers 
and a reduction in activity for subsequent 
movers and landlords buying property to let.
ULS has a fairly typical exposure to all three 
segments and therefore has not unduly 
been affected by these movements.
In terms of other market developments, the 
Government produced its white paper to 
tackle the so-called housing crisis. This 
paper is tenure neutral effectively, with policy 
assisting tenants as well as homeowners. 
General consensus is that there will be little if 
any market impact from this, certainly in the 
short term and quite possibly in the medium 
and longer term too.
One of the major challenges for the 
housing market is the lack of subsequent 
home movers. Many homeowners find it 
unnecessary or too expensive to move up 
a rung on the ladder. Changes to Stamp 
Duty haven’t helped certainly in London 
and have hindered other areas. The result 
of few people moving from one home to 
another is reduced housing stock for sale. 
This remains at record lows and is probably 
the greatest factor in the fall in housing 
transactions. 
On the plus side, this trend should reverse 
at some point, however for the foreseeable 
future, housing transactions look to remain 
at current levels although the OBR is 
forecasting a modest increase.
Remortgaging increased noticeably in 
2016. Although conveyancing opportunities 
are fewer and further between for 
remortgages, and the commercial benefits 
are much reduced compared to those 
linked to home moves, this market is likely 
to continue to operate at higher levels than 
during much of the last decade. ULS is 
exploring ways to become more active in 
this market, which offers upside potential 
for the Group.
Finally, there is the result of the EU 
Referendum and the likely Brexit process, 
which looks to be uncertain and lengthy in 
its nature. Currently, it looks as though any 
initial Referendum shock has largely worn 
off and business is returning to normal. 
However, much remains unknown and 
therefore uncertain. 
From a positive point of view, firstly the 
housing market is already trading at low 
levels compared to historical norms. 
Secondly, the UK housing market is a 
domestic market in the main, and 
therefore ought to remain somewhat 
immune, and insulated from any 
possible Brexit fallout.
In terms of the specific conveyancing 
market that ULS operates in, we 
continue to see improvements and 
modernisation in technology. 
Mortgage and conveyancing 
processes remain slow compared to 
more technologically advanced 
markets and this gives scope for 
potential further disruption, and 
opportunity for ULS. 
Conveyancing firms continue to 
consolidate, and ULS holds strong 
trading relationships with most of 
the major specialist firms. These 
firms are growing through 
becoming highly efficient and 
technological in their processes, 
thereby completing customers’ 
home moves more quickly and 
giving them a better experience.
ULS is investing in its own technology 
to improve customer experience to 
ensure that along with its 
conveyancing partners, customers 
continue to receive the best possible 
value for money, service experience 
and means of interacting with their 
chosen solicitor or conveyancing firm.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
11 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017  Our strategy
Group strategy is to focus on continual improvement, 
innovation and quality, and acquire businesses  
in sectors we understand.
The conveyancing market 
continues to consolidate into a 
smaller number of larger firms. 
These firms specialise in 
processing volume conveyancing, 
and have become more efficient 
through investment in technology 
and economies of scale.
Against this market backdrop, 
these large firms have ever-
growing operations to feed. ULS 
continues to successfully grow its 
strong relationships with many of 
these large specialist firms, 
through procuring many more new 
customers for them, and by 
building integrated technology 
links designed to make all parties’ 
involvement in the conveyancing 
process as straightforward and 
painless as possible.
Customer journey
In addition to working closely with 
its partner firms, ULS is 
committing resource into seeking 
its own new ways to revolutionise 
conveyancing. This is particularly 
through improved communication 
with all stakeholders involved in 
the home moving process, as well 
as providing a more automated 
and involved interaction with 
customers themselves. 
Technology and communication in 
other sectors has improved 
significantly over recent years and 
conveyancing in some areas has a 
long way to go to catch up.
ULS intends to be at the forefront 
of change, helping its business 
partners to fend off any threat from 
fresh competition and disruptive 
market newcomers. In addition, 
ULS will dedicate resource to 
helping home movers at an earlier
stage in the home moving process 
with conveyancing, as well as 
more broadly in the future with 
other services.
Organic growth
ULS has very strong, successful 
and loyal business partners that 
make up its conveyancing 
distribution. By helping these 
business partners to increase their 
conveyancing, ULS continues  
to grow.
Over the last year, the Group has 
successfully continued its 
momentum by earning the right to 
work with more new business 
partners, adding to growth from 
existing partners.
ULS has deliberately expanded 
into markets where it has not 
historically been strong and where 
clear upside exists. For example, 
the Group is now much more 
involved in procuring and servicing 
conveyancing needs for customers 
requiring and using an Estate 
Agent - both traditional Estate 
Agents, as well as those that trade 
online only. Also, through a major 
new house builder relationship, the 
Group is forging inroads into 
providing conveyancing for the 
highly competitive and service-
centric new homes market.
Over the last year, ULS has  
won at least two new lender  
conveyancing contracts, having 
used its subsidiary company Legal 
Eye to boost its all-round 
conveyancing service to mortgage 
lenders. This is another new area 
into which ULS intends to continue 
its growth.
New products
Last year the Group invested in 
HomeOwners Alliance (HOA), the 
online property portal that has 
experienced good growth in web 
traffic since it was founded four 
years ago. ULS has now 
successfully integrated or 
embedded its conveyancing 
platform and Estate Agency 
comparison technology into HOA’s 
portal, and is now receiving new 
business directly from customers 
digitally as well. This is an 
important channel for ULS to be 
invested in, as it provides 
scalability and a degree of control 
over longer term future new 
business volumes.
It also serves as a direct-to-
customer channel through which 
ULS can tailor and launch new 
technology and housing related 
products and services in the 
future, beyond simply 
conveyancing itself.
Acquisitions
Over the last year ULS has been 
actively looking at potentially 
complementary acquisition 
opportunities. In December 2016 
the Group successfully acquired 
Conveyancing Alliance Holdings 
Limited, instantly enabling the 
Group’s entry into Estate Agency 
related conveyancing and also 
opening up the small mortgage 
adviser market for conveyancing.
This acquisition was highly 
earnings enhancing for the Group, 
and a great strategic fit. 
Management remains active in 
seeking new and fitting 
opportunities that may exist, to 
grow the Group from where it has 
progressed to today.
ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 12 The acquisition of CAL enables us to directly progress  
a clear strategy of increasing our market share of new 
conveyancing. CAL is complementary to ULS as its 
success has come from providing technology based 
conveyancing solutions to mortgage intermediaries, 
specifically smaller firms. In addition, CAL has been 
successful in forging a good proportion of its growth 
from providing Estate Agents with conveyancing 
related technology and services, a path that we have 
deliberately wanted to explore and grow into. Our new 
relationship with CAL is going from strength to strength 
and we are excited about how well we can all work 
together to accelerate our combined success.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Chief Executive’s 
statement
ULS has continued  
to make good 
progress, building  
on its clear strategy 
of growing market 
share, revenue and 
profit, through a 
combination of 
organic growth 
and tactical 
acquisition activity.
Ben Thompson
Chief Executive 
Officer
Overview of operational performance 
ULS agreed that it would focus on the 
following as part of its growth strategy:
• Build new technology to attract more 
lender-related conveyancing;
• Forge inroads into providing 
conveyancing to customers who 
traditionally would have bought 
conveyancing through Estate  
Agents; and
• Acquire businesses that directly or 
indirectly assist ULS in growing its  
overall conveyancing market share.
 
All of the above have progressed well 
throughout the year, contributing to a 
revenue increase of 8% and underlying 
profit growth of 15%. 
Strategic progress
The Group has made strong progress over 
the last year, with healthy organic growth 
achieved against a market where housing 
transactions have continued to fall 
markedly below long term historical 
averages. In addition, the last year has 
been a tough market, with tax changes 
impacting landlords and the Buy-to-Let 
market, and the slowdown in activity 
following the EU Referendum.
In 2016, ULS took a 35% stake in 
HomeOwners Alliance (HOA), with an 
option to acquire the business between 
three and five years following completion 
of the investment. 
ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 14 The Group is pleased to report that it  
has successfully tailored and embedded 
its technology within HOA’s website and 
that this has delivered new conveyancing 
growth over the last year.
The Group has won new conveyancing 
contracts with two mortgage lenders, 
having invested efforts into building a 
complete suite of technology and services 
to help lenders provide their customers 
with the best possible moving experience. 
This new proposition to lenders includes 
services offered by Legal Eye, which ULS 
acquired in 2015. ULS intends to continue 
its growth into lender related conveyancing 
through the coming year and beyond.
One of the other new markets into which 
ULS can grow is the Estate Agency 
conveyancing market. ULS has historically 
not been involved in this market, but has 
now built two routes through which it can 
offer its technology and services to 
customers selling and buying homes 
through this sector:
1. Via its own Estate Agency comparison 
technology accessed through 
HomeOwners Alliance 
(www.estateagent4me.co.uk);
2. Through Conveyancing Alliance Limited. 
ULS has spent the last year or so honing 
and piloting new technology to enable 
home sellers to compare the performance 
of traditional and online Estate Agents free 
of charge on one technology platform. The 
Group has now successfully embedded 
this technology into HomeOwners Alliance, 
which promotes this online via its own 
portal. Through this promotion, ULS 
attracts customers who wish to move 
house and need help selecting a suitable 
conveyancing service, thereby enabling 
the Group to make inroads directly to 
customers in this market.
ULS has been pursuing complementary 
acquisition opportunities, and at the end  
of 2016, acquired Conveyancing Alliance 
Holdings Limited. CAL constitutes a 
perfect fit for ULS, in that they have 
experienced strong growth with small 
mortgage broker firms, whereas ULS has 
successfully grown with larger firms. Also 
CAL has enjoyed comparable success 
partnering independent Estate Agents  
to provide conveyancing services.
CAL is therefore the second channel  
that ULS has acquired and will use to  
grow conveyancing market share in the 
Estate Agency sector, helping customers 
to access a breadth of choice at 
comparatively low cost, and move  
home as seamlessly as possible.
This tactical acquisition of CAL was 
highly earnings enhancing for ULS  
and enables the Group to continue  
its deliberate strategy of growing its 
conveyancing market share, through 
adding to its existing channels as  
well as accessing new ones. 
Outlook
We approach the new financial  
year in the knowledge that we  
are successfully increasing our 
conveyancing market share in a 
smaller housing transactions market. 
We intend to continue outperforming 
the market through further enhancing 
our technology and services that  
we provide to our business partners 
and their customers. We see that 
technology and processes will 
continually need to be further  
honed and improved, as technology 
progresses and advances at pace.  
We are committed to doing things 
better than our competitors, with 
customers central in influencing our 
thinking and technology design.
Our expectations are for a slightly 
smaller housing market in terms of 
transactions. We will strive to further 
increase our market share organically 
through expansion into more lender 
related conveyancing and through 
becoming more involved in 
conveyancing in the Estate Agency 
sector. There is a lot of upside  
potential from this organic growth.
In addition, we will continue to look 
actively at acquiring businesses that 
help us to progress our strategy more 
quickly and will acquire where 
appropriate and possible to do so.
We are pleased with how ULS has 
grown over the last year and look 
forward to what we expect to be 
an exciting and rewarding new 
financial year.

15 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group delivered significant profit growth and made  
a sizeable acquisition. 
Summary
• Revenue £22.3 million 
(2016: £20.7 million).
• Gross margin £9.5 million 
(2016: £8.7 million).
• Underlying PBT £4.4 million 
(2016: £3.8 million).
• Net debt £3.5 million 
(2016: net cash £2.9 million).
• Group continues to pay  
a progressive dividend.
• Increase in underlying EBITDA of 14%.
Results
The Group delivered significant profit growth 
in 2017 with underlying profit before tax 
up by 15% and, excluding the acquisition 
of CAL, it was up by 8%. This was against 
a backdrop of a 13% fall in housing 
transactions. There were exceptional costs in 
the year of £704,000. These primarily relate 
to movements in the deferred consideration 
provision relating to the acquisitions of Legal 
Eye and CAL, as well as costs related to 
acquisition activity. 
Capitalisation of internal IT resource
In accordance with accounting rules, we 
capitalise internal and external IT resource 
where there is a clear definable project 
and we can identify a profitable revenue 
stream. The capitalisation is shown under 
intangible assets and amortised over the 
expected useful life of the asset. However, 
it is useful to look at the impact on profit 
if we had purely expensed all of this type 
of expenditure and we do this in the table 
opposite. This gives a closer indication as  
to the cash generative ability of the business 
rather than looking at reported profit.

During the year more development projects 
were undertaken and more resource taken 
on as we continue to invest in the future 
of the company. Additionally, a limited 
amount of external resource was used 
and the acquisition of CAL increased the 
spend in this area (as they also capitalise 
development, which they outsource entirely).

ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 16 Shares and dividends
In December 2016, the Group paid an interim 
dividend of 1.10 pence per share. It has 
proposed a final dividend of 1.10 pence per 
share in line with its aim of paying the total 
dividend in two equal amounts.
No new shares have been issued in the year.
Acquisition of Conveyancing Alliance 
Holdings Limited
On the 19 December 2016, the Group 
acquired the entire share capital of 
Conveyancing Alliance Holdings Limited and 
its wholly owned subsidiary, Conveyancing 
Alliance Limited. This was for an initial cash 
consideration of £7.2m plus an amount for 
free cash, together with an earn-out until  
31 March 2019 to be wholly satisfied  
in cash. 
Cash and debt
The Group continued to generate positive 
operating cash flow: 
• Payments of £890,000 made to repay  
the term loan with Clydesdale Bank in  
full ahead of schedule;
• Arrangement of £7million HSBC 
facility (term loan and RCF) and 
acquisition of CAL;
• Dividends paid of £0.9 million; and
• Leverage down to 0.69 as at  
31 March 2017 despite acquisition 
of CAL only a few months earlier.
The underlying position of the Group is that 
it continues to turn a significant proportion of 
its profit into cash, which it expects to allow 
payment of a progressive dividend, while still 
investing in the growth of the business. Where 
opportunities exist, the business will also take 
on debt facilities to fund acquisition growth 
and currently uses a guideline of having a 
maximum leverage of one times EBITDA 
which it is currently well below. Its bank 
covenants allow for much higher leverage.

OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
17 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 Group strategy  
is to focus on  
continual improvement, 
innovation and quality , 
and acquire businesses  
in sectors we  
understand.
ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 18 Risk Areas Potential Impact Mitigation
Loss of key introducer
The contract with Lloyds 
Banking Group delivers 
significant gross margin.
The loss of this contract would 
clearly have a significant impact 
on the scale and performance of 
the Group although there are a 
number of parts to the contract.
The Group is widening its routes to market and 
has now reduced the share of gross margin 
attributable to this contract to below 40% on a 
run-rate basis. Additionally, it works closely with 
Lloyds Banking Group to ensure it is delivering 
a high level of service and constantly enhancing 
the service being offered. This includes recently 
being part of Lloyds Digital World project.
Loss of key panel firms
The Group operates a  
panel of over 100 solicitors  
and licensed conveyancer 
firms, but the largest firms  
receive significant 
percentages of the work.
The loss of a major panel firm 
could impact on the Group’s ability 
to fulfil all the orders it receives and 
could reduce price competition.
The Group constantly monitors its panel of 
firms and their capacity and looks to bring on 
new firms across a range of sizes to maintain 
sufficient capacity within the model and keep 
prices at a competitive level, while keeping 
quality of service high.
Macro-economic  
conditions
The revenue of the 
business is closely linked 
with the number of 
transactions in the UK 
housing market.
Changes in interest rates, 
house prices, government 
policy, GDP growth and 
wider economic factors 
can positively or negatively 
impact the number of housing 
transactions.
The Group is widening its distribution channels 
by increasing the number of introducers as well 
as the markets they operate in. This means that 
the Group is not solely reliant on growth in the 
general market for its own growth. Additionally, 
by increasing its spread it has reduced its risk 
from changes in specific areas such as the 
recent tax changes in the buy-to-let market. 
It has demonstrated this by growing in a 
falling market.
New products
The Group continually 
looks to innovate and 
develop new products.
When developing products 
there is a risk that products 
developed are not commercially 
successful or cost more to 
develop than planned.
The Group plans to continually gather and 
obtain market research prior to the launch 
of any new initiative.
Competition
There are a number of 
competitors of varying  
sizes across the market.
Where there is competition there 
is always a risk that others will 
gain a competitive edge and 
either make it more difficult to 
win new customers and/or to 
retain existing customers.
The Group is focused on continual improvement, 
innovation and quality in order to maintain its 
competitive advantage and values existing 
introducers as much as potential new ones. 
Additionally, while the Group is increasing its 
market share it still holds a relatively small 
percentage and there is plenty of scope for 
growth. There are also opportunities within 
competitors as illustrated by the recent 
acquisition of CAL.
IT systems 
The Group is dependent 
on its IT systems to be able 
to provide its services.
Computer systems are 
inherently open to failure or 
security breaches. These could 
impact the ability of the Group 
to be able to provide its service 
and serious failures could result 
in the loss of customers.
The Group ensures that anti-virus software is 
kept up-to-date and regular penetration tests are 
performed. The main servers are located off-site 
at dual locations, enabling immediate failover in 
the event of a server becoming unavailable at 
one of the locations.
Acquisitions
The Group has made 
acquisitions and plans to 
continue to be acquisitive.
Making acquisitions is inherently 
risky. Risks include over paying, 
not achieving expected synergies 
and impact on the existing 
business due to distraction  
of management.
The general strategy of the Group is to 
acquire businesses in sectors it understands, 
to undertake proper due diligence and 
to resource sufficiently and effectively. 
Acquisitions made to date have maintained  
or exceeded value paid for them.

50 to 52 of the financial statements.
Corporate governance
ULS Technology plc and its subsidiaries are committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. The Directors recognise

that they aim to comply with best practice appropriate for a 
company of its nature and scale.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Peter Opperman and 
includes Geoff Wicks. It meets at least twice a year and may 
invite other Directors to attend its meetings. The committee is 
responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters, including half-
year and annual results before their submission to the Board, 
and for monitoring the controls that are in force to ensure the 
integrity of information reported to the shareholders.
23 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Geoff Wicks and 
includes Peter Opperman. It meets at least twice a year and no 
Director is permitted to participate in discussion or decisions 
concerning his own remuneration. The Remuneration Committee 
reviews the performance of the Executive Directors. It sets and 
reviews the scale and structure of their remuneration, the basis 
of their remuneration and the terms of their service agreements 
with due regard to the interests of shareholders. In determining 
the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee will seek to enable the Group to attract and retain 
staff of the highest calibre. The Remuneration Committee will also 
make recommendations to the Board concerning the allocation of 
share options to employees. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Peter Opperman 
and includes Geoff Wicks. It meets at least twice a year and is 
responsible for reviewing the size, structure and composition 
of the board, succession planning, the appointment and/or 
replacement of additional directors and for making appropriate 
recommendations to the board.
Share dealing code
The Group has adopted a share dealing code for Directors and 
applicable employees of the Group for the purpose of ensuring 
compliance by such persons with the provisions of the AIM 
rules relating to dealings in the Group’s securities (including, in 
particular, Rule 21 of the AIM rules). The Directors consider that 
this share dealing code is appropriate for a company whose 
shares are admitted to trading on AIM. The Group takes proper 
steps to ensure compliance by the Directors and applicable 
employees with the terms of the share dealing code and the 
relevant provisions of the AIM rules (including Rule 21).
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report 
and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the 
Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors confirm that, in so far as each Director  
is aware:
• There is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s 
auditor is unaware; and
• The Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware  
of that information.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the strategic report, 
Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK 
Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs and profit and loss of the Company and Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• State whether applicable IFRSs and UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group, and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
Grant Thornton UK LLP are the appointed auditor of ULS 
Technology plc. A resolution to reappoint them as auditors and to 
authorise the Directors to agree their remuneration will be placed 
before the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 24, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of ULS Technology plc and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) have been prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
IFRS is subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee, and there is an on-going process of review and endorsement by the European Commission.  
These accounting policies comply with each IFRS that is mandatory for accounting periods ending on 31 March 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies set out  
below have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the results of ULS Technology plc (“the company”) and entities controlled by  
the company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies  
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the returns 
from the investee.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. When necessary, adjustments are  
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Business combinations
The group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries as of 31 March 2017. 
All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 March except Conveyancing Alliance Holdings Limited and its subsidiary Conveyancing 
Alliance Limited, although their results for the period since acquisition to 31 March 2017 have been included in the consolidated 
numbers. The reporting date for these companies has now been changed to 31 March which will come in to effect for the period 
ending 31 March 2018.
The group applies the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for  
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by  
the group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
All transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses  
on transactions between group companies. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted  
where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the 
effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Interest in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
The post-tax results of associates are incorporated in the Group’s results using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity 
method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in 
the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of investment. Losses of associates in excess 
of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the 
extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 32
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Principal accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognised represents the value of all services provided during the period at selling price exclusive of Value Added Tax.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which the Group has fulfilled its contractual obligation to the customer, which is considered to 
be on completion of legal services. Typically, for a conveyancing transaction, this will be on completion of the property transaction 
and if the transaction falls through prior to completion, the customer does not have to pay.
The proportion of the fee that ULS receives on completion of a conveyancing transaction that is remitted to a third party, such as a 
mortgage broker or intermediary, is recognised as a cost of sale. This is because the group bears most of the credit risk, delivers the 
service and sets the pricing.
Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses (including revenues and expenses related to transactions with other components of the same entity), whose operating 
results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief Operating Decision Maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated 
to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Chief Operating Decision 
Maker has been identified as the Board of Executive Directors, at which level strategic decisions are made.
Details of the Group’s reporting segments are provided in note 1.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses are recognised in profit or loss upon utilisation of the service or as incurred.
Exceptional operating expenses are non-recurring in nature and of a material size. Items are classified as exceptional to aid the 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
Finance income and costs
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and 
allocates the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial asset or liability to the net carrying amount of the financial 
asset or liability.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and 
separately recognised. Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition  
of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Other intangible assets
Capitalised development expenditure
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development expenditure is recognised if, and only if, all of the following criteria 
have been demonstrated:
• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use of sale;
• The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• The ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible 
asset; and
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when 
the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, 
development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
33 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, net of any residual value, over the estimated useful life of that asset  
as follows:
Capital development expenditure – Straight line over 4–7 years
Brand names and customers lists
Brand names and customer lists acquired in a business combination that qualify for separate recognition are recognised as intangible 
assets at their fair values.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset on a straight line basis, net of any residual value, over the estimated 
useful life of that asset as follows:
Customer and supplier relationships – 10 to 20 years 
Brand names – 10 years
Acquired technology platform – 9 years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and less any recognised impairment 
losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
group and the costs can be measured reliably. All other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs, are charged to the Income 
Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows:
Leasehold improvements – Over the life of the lease 
Computer equipment – 25% on cost 
Fixtures and fittings – 25% on cost
Depreciation is provided on cost less residual value over the asset’s useful life. The residual value, depreciation methods and useful 
lives are annually reassessed.
Each asset’s estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to its own physical life limitations and to possible future variations in 
those assessments. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all equipment, with annual reassessments for 
major items. Changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.
The gain or loss arising on disposal or scrapping of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, net of 
selling costs, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment of non-current assets including goodwill
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-
generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit to which goodwill is allocated represents 
the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the 
operating segment level.
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is 
indication that the unit may be impaired.
At each balance sheet reporting date the Directors review the carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets, 
other than goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 34
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Principal accounting policies continued
Impairment of non-current assets including goodwill continued
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less 
than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and 
then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior periods. A 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement immediately. 
Inventories
Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct costs attributable to jobs under completion at the reporting date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the  
financial instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus transactions costs. Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are measured subsequently as described below.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as ‘loans and receivables’ and available for sale (AFS) financial assets. The Group assesses at 
each balance sheet reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are 
classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the Balance Sheet.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulty, high probability of bankruptcy 
or a financial reorganisation and default are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision 
is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at original 
effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in the Income Statement. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off  
against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the 
Income Statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 
asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred.
AFS financial assets
AFS financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for inclusion in any 
of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s AFS financial assets includes the Group’s 15% share in Financial Eye Limited. 
The equity investment in Financial Eye Limited is measured at cost less any impairment charges, as its fair value cannot currently be 
estimated reliably. Impairment charges are recognised in profit or loss. OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
35 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings and contingent consideration.
Trade payables and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  
effective interest method.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at each reporting date with movements recognised as a profit or loss.
A financial liability is de-recognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
Current taxation
Current taxation for each taxable entity in the Group is based on the taxable income at the UK statutory tax rate enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet reporting date and includes adjustments to tax payable or recoverable in respect of 
previous periods.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred taxation is calculated using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial information. However, if the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Income Statement, except where 
they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income in which case the related deferred 
tax is also charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Employment benefits
Provision is made in the financial information for all employee benefits. Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary 
benefit and annual leave obliged to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet reporting date, are recognised in accruals.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the Income Statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate.
Leasing
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 36
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Principal accounting policies continued
Equity and reserves
Equity and reserves comprises the following:
• “Share capital” represents amounts subscribed for shares at nominal value
• “Share premium” represents amounts subscribed for share capital, net of issue costs, in excess of nominal value
• “Capital redemption reserve” represents the nominal value of re-purchased share capital
• “Share based payment reserve” represents the accumulated value of share-based payments expensed in the profit and loss
• “Retained earnings” represents the accumulated profits and losses attributable to equity shareholders.
Share-based employee remuneration
The Group operates share option based remuneration plan for its employees. None of the Group’s plans are cash settled. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair value of employees’ services is determined indirectly 
by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date using a Black-
Scholes model.
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit and loss with a corresponding credit to retained 
earnings. The expense is allocated over the vesting period. Other than the requirement to be an employee at the point of exercise 
there are no other vesting requirements and all share options are expected to become exercisable. Subsequent revisions to this give 
rise to an adjustment to cumulative share-based compensation which is recognised in the current period. The number of vested 
options ultimately exercised by holders does not impact the expense recorded in any period. 
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are allocated to share capital 
up to the nominal (par) value of the shares issued with any excess being recorded as share premium.
Contingent liabilities
No liability is recognised if an outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is not probable. Such situations are 
disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the outflow of resources is remote. 
New and amended International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the group
There were no new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations which are effective for the first time this year applicable to 
or which had a material effect on the Group.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make 
estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the balance sheet reporting date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Estimates
The following are the significant estimates used in applying the accounting policies of the group that have the most significant effect 
on the financial statements:
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations
In determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, estimates have been used by a specialist 
valuation company on behalf of management, using information supplied by management, in order to determine the fair values using 
appropriate modelling techniques.
Impairment review
The Group assesses the useful life of intangible assets to determine if there is a definite or indefinite period of useful economic life; 
this requires the exercise of judgement and directly affects the amortisation charge on the asset. The Group tests whether there are 
any indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Discounted cash flows are used to assess the recoverable amount of each cash 
generating unit, and this requires estimates to be made.  If there is no appropriate method of valuation of an intangible asset, or no 
clear market value, management will use valuation techniques to determine the value.  This will require assumptions and estimates to 
be made.
Useful lives of depreciable assets
Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date, based on the expected utility of  
the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates relate to technological obsolescence that may change the utility of certain software and

Contingent consideration arising on business combinations
Contingent consideration is payable based on the future performance of an acquisition to the former shareholders. The likelihood of 
payment and ultimate value payable are a matter of judgement.
Contingent Consideration occurs in the circumstances where an element of the consideration for an acquired business is determined 
based upon one or more criteria that are achievable in future periods. The most commonly applied is the achievement of forecast 
profitability. A defined value of consideration will be payable based on such achievement, and any underperformance against those 
targets will be credited back to the Income Statement.
Judgements
The following are the significant judgements used in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most significant 
effect on the financial information:
Capitalisation of development expenditure
The Group applies judgement in determining whether internal research and development projects meet the qualifying criteria set out 
in IAS 38 for the capitalisation of development expenditure as internally generated intangible assets. The particular uncertainty and 
judgment centres around whether a project will be commercially successful, particularly in the pre-revenue phase. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 38

1. Segmental reporting
Operating segments
Management identifies its operating segments based on the Group’s service lines, which represent the main product and services 
provided by the Group. The Group’s three main operating segments, which are all in the UK, are:
• Comparison services
• Compliance consultancy for the legal sector
• All other segments which includes head office functions.
Any inter-segment indebtedness is excluded when arriving at the assets and liabilities for each segment. Consolidation items such as 
goodwill and intangibles sit within ‘Other’.

All of the carrying amount of goodwill acquired prior to 31 March 2014 is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU) of the ULS 
Technology group of companies.
The recoverable amount of the ULS Technology CGU has been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow 
projections from a formally approved 12 month forecast which has been extrapolated out over a five-year period.

Ordinary share options:
The Group operates an EMI share option scheme to which the Executive Directors and employees of the Group may be invited to 
participate by the remuneration committee. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the closing price of the Company’s share on 
the day prior to the date of grant. The options vest in three equal tranches, three, four and five years after date of grant. The options 
are settled in equity once exercised. Where the individual limits for an EMI scheme the options will be treated as unapproved but 
within the same scheme rules.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following table shows options issued which were

Summary of borrowing arrangements:
• The Group fully repaid a term loan with Clydesdale ahead of schedule in September 2016. In December 2016, it took out a 5-year 
term loan for £5 million and a £2 million revolving cash flow facility. Both have an initial interest rate of 1.90% above LIBOR although 
there is the possibility for the amount above LIBOR to reduce when certain financial criteria are met. The term loan Is subject to 
repayments of £250,000 plus accrued interest quarterly. 
• Loans are secured by way of fixed and floating charges over all assets of the Group.
• Amounts shown represent the loan principals; accrued interest is recognised within accruals – any amounts due at the reporting 
date are paid within a few days. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 50

Classification of financial instruments
The Group has AFS financial assets (see note 11) which are measured at cost less impairment cost.

The investment in HomeOwners Alliance Limited represents a 35% equity interested in an unlisted company acquired in 2016. 
The investment in Financial Eye Limited represents a 15% equity interest in an unlisted company acquired in 2015. All of the above 
financial assets’ carrying values are approximate to their fair values, as at 31 March 2017 and 2016.

Borrowings (note 20) 5,750 890
8,304 3,630
Current loan instruments are linked to LIBOR with a margin of 1.90% per annum, which is a fairly standard market rate. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet are grouped into three Levels of a fair value 
hierarchy. The three Levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly.
• Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The Group carries none of its assets at fair value. The only financial liability carried at fair value is the contingent consideration (carried 
at fair value through profit or loss). 
The fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Legal Eye Limited and Conveyancing Alliance Holdings Limited 
(see note 28) is estimated using a present value technique. 
For Legal Eye Limited, the £989,000 fair value is using the known amount of consideration due adjusting for risk and discounting at 
16.2%. The known consideration before discounting is £1,080,000. The discount rate used is 16.2%, based on the Group’s estimated 
weighted average cost of capital at the reporting date, and therefore reflects the Group’s credit position. Sensitivity analysis using a  
+/– 1% change in the discount rate gives a fair value range of £985,000 to £994,000. OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For Conveyancing Alliance Holdings Limited, the £2,613,000 fair value is using as estimated amount of consideration due adjusting 
for risk and discounting at 16.2%. The estimated consideration before discounting is £3,473,000. The discount rate used is 16.2%, 
based on the Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital at the reporting date, and therefore reflects the Group’s credit 
position. Sensitivity analysis using a +/-1% change in the discount rate gives a fair value range of £2,571,000 to £2,655,000.

Financial instrument risk exposure and management
The Group’s operations expose it to degrees of financial risk that include liquidity risk, credit risk and interest rate risk.
This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and process for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. 
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented in notes 15, 16, 17 , 19, and 20.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is dealt with in note 22 of this financial information.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash balances and trade receivables. The Group does not have a significant 
concentration of risk, with exposure spread over a number of third parties. 
All of the Group’s trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indicators of impairment. The Group suffers a very small 
incidence of credit losses. However, where management views that there is a significant risk of non-payment, a specific provision for 
impairment is made and recognised as a deduction from trade receivables.

Total 161 444
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the third parties are large international banks with a credit rating of at least A. 
The Group’s total credit risk amounts to the total of the sum of the receivables and cash and cash equivalents, as described in note 16. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 52

21. Financial instruments continued
Interest rate risk
The Group has secured debt as disclosed in note 20. The interest on this debt is linked to LIBOR and therefore there is an interest 
rate risk. However, the relative amount of debt outstanding is low which limits the risk.
The balances disclosed above represent the principal debt. Interest is paid quarterly, and all interest due has either been paid at  
each reporting date, or is paid within a few days of that date – in the latter case, interest accrued is included within accruals.
The Group’s only other exposure to interest rate risk is the interest received on the cash held on deposit, which is immaterial. 
22. Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash balances to ensure the group can meet liabilities as they  
fall due. 
In managing liquidity risk, the main objective of the Group is therefore to ensure that it has the ability to pay all of its liabilities as they 
fall due. The Group monitors its levels of working capital to ensure that it can meet its debt repayments as they fall due. The table 
below shows the undiscounted cash flows on the group’s financial liabilities as at 31 March 2017 and 2016, on the basis of their 
earliest possible contractual maturity.

23. Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• To ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
• To provide long-term returns to shareholders.
The Group defines and monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity plus its outstanding loan notes, less cash  
and cash equivalents as presented on the face of the Balance Sheet and further disclosed in notes 17 and 20.
The Board of Directors monitors the level of capital as compared to the Group’s commitments and adjusts the level of capital as  
is determined to be necessary by issuing new shares. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
These policies have not changed in the year. The Directors believe that they have been able to meet their objectives in managing  
the capital of the Group.
The amounts managed as capital by the Group for the reporting period under review are summarised as follows:
 
2017

The contingent consideration is based on a range of between 0.5 and 1.75 times annualised PBT of Conveyancing Alliance for the 
period between completion to 31 March 2018 and also for the 12 months ending 31 March 2019. The undiscounted value of this 
element of the consideration has been estimated at £3,473,000. The total undiscounted consideration including that already paid is 
capped at £13,329,000.

Notes to the Parent Company financial statements
1. Parent Company accounting policies
Basis of Preparation
The annual ﬁnancial statements of ULS Technology plc (the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements) have been prepared in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements (“FRS 100”) and Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”).
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101. 
Therefore, these financial statements do not include:
• Certain comparative information as otherwise required by EU endorsed IFRS;
• Certain disclosures regarding the company’s capital;
• A statement of cash flows;
• The effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
• The disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel; and
• Disclosure of related party transactions with the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 101 further disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures  
are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial statements do not include certain disclosures  
in respect of:
• Financial instruments (other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value); and
• Fair value measurement other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value).
As permitted by section 408 of Companies Act 2006, a separate Income Statement for the Company has not been included in  
these ﬁnancial statements. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements as set out below have been consistently 
applied to all periods presented.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the  
financial instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus transactions costs. Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are measured subsequently as described below.
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets as ‘loans and receivables’. The Company assesses at each balance sheet reporting date 
whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are 
classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the Balance Sheet.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulty, high probability of bankruptcy or 
a financial reorganisation and default are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at original effective 
interest rate. The loss is recognised in the Income Statement. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the Income Statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 
asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 60
Notes to the Parent Company financial statements
continued
Financial liabilities
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings and contingent consideration.
Trade payables and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at each reporting date with movements recognised as a profit or loss.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are shown within the parent undertaking’s financial statements at cost, less any provision for impairment  
in value. 
Current taxation
Current taxation for each taxable entity in the Company is based on the taxable income at the UK statutory tax rate enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet reporting date and includes adjustments to tax payable or recoverable in respect of 
previous periods.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred taxation is calculated using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial information. However, if the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised 
or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Income Statement, except where  
they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income in which case the related deferred  
tax is also charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Employment benefits
Provision is made in the financial information for all employee benefits. Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary 
benefit and annual leave obliged to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet reporting date, are recognised in accruals.
The Company’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the Income Statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate.
Leasing
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Equity and reserves
Equity and reserves comprises the following:
• “Share capital” represents amounts subscribed for shares at nominal value
• “Share premium” represents amounts subscribed for share capital, net of issue costs, in excess of nominal value
• “Capital redemption reserve” represents the nominal value of re-purchased share capital
• “Share based payment reserve” represents the accumulated value of share-based payments expensed in the profit and loss
• “Retained earnings” represents the accumulated profits and losses attributable to equity shareholders
1. Parent Company accounting policies continued OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
61 ULS Technology Annual Report 2017
Share-based employee remuneration
The Company operates share option based remuneration plan for its employees. None of the Company’s plans are cash settled. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair value of employees’ services is determined indirectly by reference 
to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date using a Black-Scholes model.
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit and loss with a corresponding credit to retained 
earnings. The expense is allocated over the vesting period. Other than the requirement to be an employee at the point of exercise 
there are no other vesting requirements and all share options are expected to become exercisable. Subsequent revisions to this give 
rise to an adjustment to cumulative share-based compensation which is recognised in the current period. The number of vested 
options ultimately exercised by holders does not impact the expense recorded in any period. 
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are allocated to share capital 
up to the nominal (par) value of the shares issued with any excess being recorded as share premium.
Contingent liabilities
No liability is recognised if an outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is not probable. Such situations are 
disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the outflow of resources is remote.
