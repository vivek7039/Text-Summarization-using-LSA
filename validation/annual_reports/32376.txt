STRATEGIC REPORT
2 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 3 2 STRATEGIC REPORT “ I AM IMPRESSED 
WITH THE VISION AND 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT  
STILL REMAIN TO FULLY 
ACHIEVE SCAPA’S 
POTENTIAL IN BOTH 
HEALTHCARE AND 
INDUSTRIAL.”
DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
I am pleased to join Scapa at an important 
juncture in its journey that began with James 
Wallace, my predecessor. The evolution from 
an industrial tape company to a global 
adhesive technology-based company with 
two distinct businesses, each with an exciting 
strategy and outlook, has been impressive. 
During the past eight years, Scapa’s share 
price has risen from £0.095 in March 2009 to 
£4.00 in May 2017 , generating over £600m of 
shareholder value. As I review the results and 
accomplishments of the Group, I am very 
impressed with the volume and pace of the 
activities. However, I am equally impressed 
with the vision and opportunities that still 
remain to fully achieve Scapa’s potential 
in both Healthcare and Industrial. 
GREAT PROGRESS AND POTENTIAL
The Healthcare business has been 
transformed from a roll stock material 
supplier to market leader in turn-key solutions 
of adhesive based products. At an early 
stage we recognised the increasing trend 
towards outsourcing in our customers and 
positioned ourselves as the partner of choice 
to the leading global healthcare companies. 
Driven by pricing pressure and the need to 
accelerate time to market, our customers are 
looking for partners who not only provide 
materials and manufacturing but can provide 
turn-key solutions across their entire value 
chain, from product development to delivery 
of a finished product. Through continuous 
investment, including three successful 
acquisitions, the latest of which was 
EuroMed in May 2016, Scapa has built a 
comprehensive set of capabilities across the 
entire value chain. We have leveraged our 
unique proposition and developed strategic 
partnerships with global leaders such as 
Convatec and Johnson & Johnson. Today, 
we have long-term commercial agreements 
with our major healthcare customers that 
underpin £200m in revenue. We believe 
that the potential, driven by the fundamentals 
and dynamics of the healthcare market, 
is significant. The opportunities are 
demonstrated by the increasing pipeline 
of projects that we continue to build. Our 
challenge is to convert the projects into 
revenue through flawless execution. Equally, 
we must continue to develop additional 
capabilities, organically as well as through 
acquisitions, to further penetrate beyond the 
L C Pentz
Chairman
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
4 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 4 STRATEGIC REPORT adhesive based value chain at our strategic 
customers. Our goal is to continue to 
accelerate the shift to higher value added 
business with Scapa’s innovation and IP 
that will deliver higher margin and stronger 
partnerships with our customers who 
are growing and significant.
The Industrial business continues to 
deliver impressive results through focus on 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and 
operational efficiency. This year it achieved 
the long-term objective of double-digit trading 
profit margins. The pressure sensitive market 
is large, diverse and mature. Estimated at 
over US$30 billion, its growth reflects the 
GDP of the markets. We recognised that 
to deliver the double-digit profit growth we 
could not rely solely on revenue growth, 
particularly given the uncertain and endemic 
macro environment. As such we outlined 
a self-help agenda focused on operational 
efficiency and asset optimisation. Our 
methodical and exceptional operational 
execution enabled us to deliver on our goal. 
We have, along the way, accumulated 
capabilities and competencies that are 
yielding significant results. Moreover, they 
are allowing us to expand our potential. 
We have reset our profit margin target to 
mid-teens which compares to the market 
leaders. We believe we can achieve our new 
goal by continuing to execute our self-help 
agenda. Furthermore, we believe that we can 
achieve above-market growth through focus 
on specific markets where we have 
competitive advantage.
PERFORMANCE AND DIVIDEND
The continued focus on execution against 
a consistent strategy outlined above 
produced another record year for the 
Group. Group revenue increased 13.3% to 
£279.6m (2016: £246.7m) and trading profit 
increased 37.1% to £29.2m (2016: £21.3m), 
with strong trading helped by a currency 
translation tailwind. On a constant currency 
basis, revenue and trading profit grew 1.7% 
and 18.2% respectively. Group margins 
increased to 10.4% from 8.6%. Adjusted 
earnings per share increased 39.6% to 
14.8p (2016: 10.6p) and basic earnings per 
share was 11.6p (2016: 4.1p). 
This year has seen a further strengthening 
of the Balance Sheet, including continued 
actions to manage the legacy pension 
scheme deficit. The UK deficit increased 
slightly to £23.8m as a result of the reduction 
in the discount rate, and the total deficit 
of £31.4m, including a number of small 
overseas schemes, is now less than 1x the 
EBITDA of the business. EBITDA comprises 
trading profit before depreciation.
The Group ended the year with net 
debt of £16.1m (2016: £2.6m), after the 
acquisition of EuroMed for US$35m 
(£28.3m) in May 2016. The business 
continues to focus on cash flow and 
working capital management.
Given the continuing progress and improved 
performance, the Board is proposing to 
increase the final and full year dividend by 
14.3% to 2.0p (2016: 1.75p). Subject to 
approval of shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting the dividend will be 
paid on 18 August 2017 to shareholders on 
the register on 21 July 2017. The ex-dividend 
date is 20 July 2017.
GOVERNANCE
As the Group continues to grow both 
organically and through acquisition, the 
Board recognises that a strong governance 
framework and good internal controls, 
supported by common values and culture, 
are critically important. The Board remains 
focused on ensuring its own effectiveness and 
that of the governance processes throughout 
the Group. An internal review of Board 
effectiveness was conducted in 2017 . The 
corporate governance section on pages 38 
to 69 outlines our full compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
BOARD CHANGE
I succeeded James Wallace as Chairman 
in March 2017 at the end of the fiscal year. 
James has been the Chairman of Scapa 
since October 2007 and during that time 
he oversaw much of the change, as a result 
of which Scapa is well positioned for a 
bright future. On behalf of the Board and 
all the employees at Scapa, I would like 
to thank James for his strong leadership 
during his ten years as Chairman, a period 
during which Scapa was transformed from 
a business with significant challenges into 
the strong, successful business it is today. 
PEOPLE
Since becoming Chairman, I have visited 
many of our sites and had the opportunity 
to meet our people. It is evident that Scapa’s 
recent success is a result of the skill and 
dedication of our employees who have 
embraced the business unit strategy and 
the cultural changes demanded in the Group. 
The Scapa Way and our Ten Guiding 
Principles are now well embedded in the 
Company culture, which gives a common 
value system to people from a range of 
diverse backgrounds and cultures. The 
Group continues to invest in its people 
through a variety of programmes and has 
been able to make a number of senior 
appointments this year from internal talent. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all the employees for their contribution to 
an excellent year.
OUTLOOK
It has been a year of significant progress 
and I am very positive about the further 
opportunities for the Group in both 
Healthcare and Industrial. Healthcare is 
well positioned in a growth market and 
has a window to take advantage of the 
outsourcing trend. Industrial will continue 
to drive increased ROCE, with further 
opportunities identified. I am confident 
in Scapa’s ability to continue to make 
progress and deliver further value to 
our shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT
4 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 5 4 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW
“ T H E F IN A N CI A L 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
ARE THE RESULT OF 
OUR RELENTLESS AND 
UNCOMPROMISING 
EXECUTION OF 
THE STRATEGY.”
OVERVIEW
During the year, the Group delivered 
on a number of the strategic milestones 
we have set for ourselves; we achieved 
double-digit profit margins in Industrial, 
and our Healthcare revenue has surpassed 
£100m. In addition we accomplished the 
audacious goal we set for ourselves four 
years ago; an internal goal of reaching 
£500m market capitalisation when it stood 
at less than £100m at the time. While we 
pause to reflect on the accomplishments, 
we are keenly aware that the real challenge 
is to maintain and surpass the past 
trajectory. We are confident that we can 
deliver the next set of milestones and goals 
as the opportunities and potential for both 
Healthcare and Industrial are still significant.
In Healthcare our strategy is to be the 
strategic turn-key partner of choice to our 
global Healthcare customers. We believe 
that by broadening our offerings and 
capabilities we can continue to build 
our market leading position in a growing 
and expanding market. In addition to the 
underlying growth in healthcare due to 
favourable demographics, we are also at 
the forefront of an accelerating outsourcing 
trend. As we review the growing pipeline of 
projects and potential acquisitions, we are 
confident that we can maintain double-digit 
growth in Healthcare, organically and 
through acquisition. 
Industrial serves diverse markets and 
geographies and its revenue performance 
reflects the composite macro dynamics. 
We focus on key defensible markets where 
we have opportunity to gain market share 
in the US$30 billion pressure sensitive 
material market. Our strategy is to continue 
to deliver profit growth by focusing on 
the optimisation of our assets through 
relentless operational execution and 
achieve mid-teens profit margins, 
comparable to market leaders.
OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2016/17
The Group focus on execution against 
the consistent strategic objectives outlined 
above has helped Scapa to deliver record 
results once again in 2016/17. Group 
revenue increased 13.3% to £279.6m 
or 1.7% on a constant currency basis. 
H R Chae
Group Chief Executive
6 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 6 STRATEGIC REPORT Healthcare revenue increased 16.5% to 
£108.7m or 5.0% at constant currency. 
We acquired EuroMed, a US-based 
hydrocolloid wound care solution company, 
in May 2016. Excluding ten months of 
EuroMed, the organic revenue increased 
5.8% or (4.6)% at constant currency. 
Healthcare growth was against a very 
strong comparator, 26.4% growth in 2016, 
driven by product launches of two of our 
customers and new pricing on a contract 
extension which we signed last year. We 
expect that, as we move further toward 
turn-key solutions, our revenue will be 
more volatile on a short-term basis driven 
by product launches and campaigns of 
our customers. However, we remain very 
confident of the outlook for the business 
and have seen a significant growth in the 
sales pipeline that is transitioning to higher 
value, higher margin turn-key products 
or components based on Scapa IP 
and innovation. 
Healthcare profits increased 18.6% to 
£16.6m, or 4.4% at constant currency, 
improving margins to 15.3% as we improve 
efficiency and shift further to turn-key 
solutions. We expect that the higher margin 
achieved during the second half of the year 
can be maintained and, as we continue to 
focus on operational efficiencies and the 
revenue profile shifts more toward turn-key 
solutions, the margins should continue to 
improve further.
In May 2016, we completed the acquisition 
of EuroMed, the hydrocolloid wound care 
company based in Orangeburg, New York. 
With its intellectual properties and innovation 
portfolio, the acquisition significantly 
enhances our design and development 
capabilities, which further strengthens our 
value chain and deepens our strategic 
engagement with our Healthcare customers. 
EuroMed has integrated well, particularly after 
the backlog and cost base normalised post 
transaction. The second-half performed well 
both in revenue and profit, with second-half 
profits ahead of our initial expectations. 
Industrial revenue increased 11.4% to 
£170.9m, or (0.3)% at constant currency. 
Cable performed well, driven by general 
improvement in the clean energy 
sector and a contract win in the US. 
The Construction segment also delivered 
above-market growth, including in France. 
The positives were offset by a decline in 
Auto and Specialty Products. Our strategy 
to focus on operating efficiencies and 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), 
enables us to deliver double-digit profit 
growth despite flat revenue. Industrial 
profits increased by 66.4% to £17.8m, 
45.9% growth at constant currency, and 
margins were increased to 10.4% from 
7.0%. The improvement in profit was driven 
by (i) operational efficiencies; (ii) lower input 
costs; and (iii) initial benefit from the closure 
of Rorschach. We expect that we will see 
an additional £1.0m profit improvement 
next year from the closure. Despite 
reaching the double-digit profit margin 
target we set for ourselves, we believe 
that there are still significant opportunities 
to further improve our Industrial margin 
by continuing to execute our strategy. 
We believe that we can deliver mid-teens 
profit margin through additional operational 
efficiencies and asset rationalisation.

STRATEGIC REPORT
6 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 7 6 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Group trading profit increased to £29.2m, a growth of 37.1% or 18.2% at constant exchange rates, and margins increased to 10.4%. The 
Group benefited from a post-Brexit currency tailwind and the trading profit constant currency result was also well ahead of expectations 
for the year. Cash generation was strong, and we ended the year leveraged at 0.45 times EBITDA after paying US$35m for the acquisition 
of EuroMed.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR
At the start of the last financial year we identified a series of key goals and priorities for the year:
STRATEGIC PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR
HEALTHCARE What we said we would do
Continue delivering profitable growth 
organically and through acquisitions.  
We will continue to strengthen our  
value chain and deepen our strategic 
engagement with our global customers.
What we have achieved
The commercial project pipeline has been improved in terms 
of the number, quality and range of projects under development. 
Scapa is well positioned to help our customers improve cost, 
supply chain efficiency and speed to market. With the successful 
acquisition and integration of EuroMed, Scapa has added to its 
IP portfolio and has further moved the business towards higher 
value-add turn-key products. First Water, acquired in 2015, 
performed strongly again this year. We have long-term 
commercial agreements with our major Healthcare customers 
that underpin £200m in revenue over the life of the contracts.
INDUSTRIAL What we said we would do
Further drive ROCE through optimisation 
of the asset base. Continue to focus on 
efficiency improvement and cost control. 
Focus on key markets where we can gain 
market share.
What we have achieved
Driving increased ROCE through optimisation of the asset base 
has been a key feature of the Scapa Industrial strategy. During 
the year the facility in Rorschach, Switzerland was closed and 
the majority of the production transferred to the existing facility 
in Valence, France. The project was completed on time and 
on budget, with minimal service interruption to customers, 
and has delivered on the commitment to generate £1.0m of profit 
improvement in the second half. We expect a further £1.0m of 
incremental savings in the first half of FY18. Our supply chain 
team and strong cost controls also contributed to the increase 
in margins, up from 7.0% last year to 10.4% in 2017.
ACQUISITIONS 
 
What we said we would do
Make further acquisitions to complement 
the current business or deliver a new 
strategic platform.
What we have achieved
EuroMed, a specialist producer of hydrocolloid products for 
advanced wound care and consumer healthcare products  
based in Orangeburg, New York, was acquired in May 2016 for 
US$35m and improves the range of technologies available to 
our customers. It has fitted seamlessly into the Scapa Healthcare 
Group and made a strong contribution to performance in the year.
8 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 8 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR CONTINUED
FINANCIAL What we said we would do
Continue to improve the Group’s pension 
and tax positions.
What we have achieved
The gross pension deficit at year end was £31.4m (2016: £27.5m) 
– well controlled despite the adverse movement in the discount 
rate during the period. The Group continues to explore ways 
to manage the deficit and has conducted a number of projects 
during the year, including offering flexible retirement options and 
pension increase exchange plans. The effective tax rate for 2017 
was 20.0% (2016: 23.8%), reduced through a combination of 
strong UK trading and careful tax planning.
CULTURE What we said we would do
Promote The Scapa Way by embedding 
our core values and continuing to pursue 
entrepreneurialism across all aspects 
of our business.
What we have achieved
After the efforts to promote The Scapa Way and the Ten Guiding 
Principles over recent years this is now very visible in the Group 
and continually reinforced. The Scapa Academy allows for efficient 
online training on a variety of subjects, including the Code of 
Conduct which reflects both Scapa values and legal compliance. 
The annual CEO Awards produced another excellent list of projects 
that have delivered significant value across the business.
2017/18 STRATEGIC GOALS 
AND PRIORITIES 
Looking into the 2017/18 financial year, we 
believe that the strategies we have in place 
for our business units continue to give the 
right focus and will continue to deliver 
further value for our shareholders, and the 
continued emphasis and challenge within the 
business will be on execution against that 
strategy as the pace of projects accelerates:
• Healthcare: Continue delivering  
profitable growth organically and  
through acquisitions. We will continue  
to strengthen our value chain and 
deepen our strategic engagement  
with our global customers, and convert 
the increased project pipeline to revenue. 
Continue to shift further into turn-key 
solutions with Scapa’s IP and innovation
• Industrial: Further drive ROCE through 
optimisation of the asset base.  
We will continue to focus on efficiency 
improvement and cost control, and focus  
on key markets where we can gain 
market share. We will continue the path 
to industry average margins
• Make further acquisitions to complement 
the current business or deliver a new 
strategic platform
• Continue to improve the Group’s  
pension and tax positions, and review 
the Company’s banking facilities
• Continue to focus on talent development 
and succession planning to ensure that 
we have the right people embedded  
with our core values to further drive 
the growth of the business
OUTLOOK
We achieved some significant milestones 
during the year as a result of our relentless 
and uncompromising execution of the 
strategy. Whilst much has been achieved, 
we believe that much more potential remains 
to be fulfilled in both Healthcare and Industrial 
and we have set the goals for the next phase 
of our growth, which we are confident we 
can deliver.
We continue to execute the strategy that 
we have outlined for both Healthcare and 
Industrial. We have a team with a strong 
track record of delivery. The Group is 
well positioned to leverage the recent 
accomplishments and continue to make 
further progress in the year ahead.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Embedded risk management systems have 
supported the Group in pursuing its strategy for growth.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of doing business. 
A successful risk management process 
balances risk and reward and is underpinned 
by sound judgement of their impact and 
likelihood. The Group Board has overall 
responsibility for ensuring that Scapa has 
an effective risk management framework, 
which is aligned to our objectives. 
The Executive Team, Audit and Risk 
Committee and Board review risks which 
could affect the Group throughout the 
year. Risk and issue tracking systems are 
reviewed by our Group Risk & Assurance 
team on a regular basis to ensure that the 
framework is in line with good practice in 
risk management and that agreed 
mitigation plans are being adhered to.
We take the view that the policies, 
procedures and monitoring systems that 
are in place are sufficient to effectively 
manage the risks faced by our business.
SCAPA’S APPROACH TO 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Scapa adopts both a Top down and Bottom 
up approach to risk to manage risk exposure 
across the Group to enable the effective 
pursuit of strategic objectives. The approach 
is summarised in the diagram below.
Risk identification
Risks exist within all areas of our business 
and it is important for us to identify and 
understand the degree to which their 
impact and likelihood of occurrence will 
affect the delivery of our key objectives.
The recording of risks at Scapa is achieved 
through our risk management model. 
Their identification is achieved through 
day-to-day working practices including 
horizon scanning for legislative changes, 
professional body alerts, strategic planning, 
operational reviews, accident and incident 
reporting, project governance procedures 
and independent systems audits.
In addition to ongoing risk identification, 
the Group’s risk universe is reviewed on 
an annual basis. This exercise relies on 
risk intelligence being gathered from:
• Top down – through participation from 
the Executive Team, senior management 
and departmental experts (including 
Quality, Health & Safety, Supply Chain 
and Research & Development) and 
giving consideration to the Group’s 
strategy, related objectives and any 
barriers and enablers to the achievement 
of these objectives

• Bottom up – by engaging with our 
people, listening to their views and 
recognising their contribution. In 
addition, we have a robust and effective 
whistleblowing procedure to highlight 
issues such as potential wrongdoing 
or risks that are not being managed
In determining the relative importance of 
risks in our business, we use a scoring 
mechanism to identify the likelihood of a 
risk crystallising and the impact this would 
have on the achievement of our strategic 
objectives, assuming that no controls are 
in place (inherent risk score).
Assessment
After identifying Scapa’s inherent risk 
exposure, we assess the suitability and 
effectiveness of existing controls and 
mitigating factors to ascertain the Group’s net 
exposure (mitigated risk score).This process 
includes mapping the sources and reliability 
of assurances over the effectiveness of 
controls provided to the Executive Team, 
Audit and Risk Committee and Board. 
In addition to assessing the mitigated risk 
the Board, with the assistance of a third 
party, undertook a focused exercise 
in the year to identify its risk tolerance 
and appetite.
Addressing risks
An assessment of whether additional 
actions are required to reduce our 
exposure to risk:
• Treat – develop an action plan to 
implement additional controls, or provide 
additional assurance over the adequacy 
and effectiveness of existing controls
• Transfer – use third party expertise to 
mitigate against risk
• Tolerate – determine that the risk is 
within appetite, when compared with 
the cost and resources required 
to reduce the risk
• Terminate – exit the activity
Monitoring and reporting
The process used by the Audit and Risk 
Committee to review the effectiveness 
of risk management includes:
• review of the Group’s risk profile to 
assess potential risk areas and progress 
against action plans
• review of internal and external audit 
plans to minimise duplication of 
assurance provision
• review of the implementation of internal 
audit recommendations
• review of the status of management 
actions associated with the issues

INTERNAL CONTROL
The Group’s approach to internal control is 
based on the 2013 COSO Internal Control 
– Integrated Framework.
Internal control is an ongoing process 
which is engrained in Scapa’s activities 
and operations. The aim of our internal 
control framework is to provide  
reasonable assurance to the Board 
over the following areas:
• The effectiveness and efficiency 
of operations
• The reliability of financial reporting
• Compliance with relevant laws 
and regulations
Scapa’s internal control framework consists 
of the following key components:
Control environment – The ‘tone from 
the top’ of Scapa and the foundation 
upon which all other components of the 
framework rest. We have tried to capture 
the attributes, integrity, values and 
competencies that Scapa employees 
display within our Code of Conduct.
Risk assessment – Our awareness of the 
risks we face and the actions we take to 
address and mitigate the risks identified. 
Control activities – The policies and 
procedures that help ensure that actions 
and directives required by management 
are carried out. 
Information and communication – The 
ability for Scapa employees to capture and 
exchange the information needed to conduct, 
manage and control our operations; 
employees’ understanding of their own 
role in the internal control framework. 
Monitoring activities – Continuous review 
and improvement where necessary to  
allow the system to react dynamically and 
change as needed.
Site-based teams operate against 
mandated minimum control standards 
which are issued by the Group Finance 
Director. Annual assessments of 
compliance are completed by site teams  
as part of a controls self-assessment 
process introduced during 2012/13.  
Each site team is subject to regular internal 
audit, with the objective of assessing the 
extent of compliance with these standards 
and to assess the accuracy of the controls 
self-assessment.
Financial reporting follows generally 
accepted accounting practice in all areas. 
Central review and approval procedures 
are in place in respect of major areas of 
risk such as acquisitions and disposals, 
major contracts, capital expenditure, 
litigation, treasury management, taxation 
and environmental issues. Compliance 
with legislation is closely monitored and 
reviewed regularly to ensure that any new 
legislation is taken into account, including 
compliance with environmental legislation. 
High standards and defined targets 
are set for environmental, health and 
safety performance.
RISK AND CONTROL 
REPORTING STRUCTURE
Our internal control structures are 
designed to provide assurance that the 
Group is on track in delivering against 
its strategic objectives.
Scapa has a clear structure for ensuring 
that accurate and reliable information on 
the adequacy and effectiveness of internal 
controls is presented to the Executive 
Team, Audit and Risk Committee 
and Board.
Internally, we operate ‘three lines 
of defence’:
• First line – established and embedded 
policies and procedures
• Second line – direction and policy set 
at Group level to enforce consistency. 
Oversight functions sit at Group level
• Third line – independent challenge 
and assurance

18 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 18 STRATEGIC REPORT VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (commonly referred to 
as the longer-term viability statement), the 
Directors have assessed the prospect of 
the Group over a longer period than the 
12 months required by the ‘Going Concern’ 
provision. The Board has conducted this 
review for a period of three years, which 
was selected for the following reasons:
• The Group’s strategy of long-term 
profitable growth is set over a rolling 
three-year period
• A review of the current and future 
customer contracts has been 
undertaken and it is reasonable to 
conclude that given appropriate 
management these will continue 
throughout the period
• Business risks are reviewed at least 
annually and the Group manages a 
risk-based assurance programme which 
is set over a three year period. This is 
consulted on with the business units 
and the Board on a regular basis and 
the Group believes that this enables 
assurances to be obtained on the 
systems of internal control in those areas 
which have been identified as barriers 
to achieving its strategic objectives
• This has been further underpinned by the 
regular Board briefings provided by the 
Executive Directors as part of a robust 
reporting and business unit review 
framework. This process highlights 
business strategy risks and opportunities, 
which are considered within the Board’s 
risk appetite framework
PRINCIPAL RISKS
During 2016/17 the Board has continued 
to assess and monitor the principal risks 
of the business. This includes those risks 
(financial, operational and compliance) that 
would impact on the Group’s Strategy to 
achieve long-term profitable growth, taking 
account of global economic and political 
volatility (e.g. Brexit). The principal risks 
have been categorised into:
• Strategic
• Financial 
• Market
• Operations
• Regulatory and compliance
The strategic risks that have been identified 
in the Annual Report and Accounts are 
specific to the Group and are a reflection 
of the importance that the Group places 
on its robust risk management programme, 
which is continually being reviewed.
More details of the processes adopted 
are provided in the Risk Management and 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties sections 
on pages 12 to 18 of this report.
CURRENT POSITION 
AND PROSPECTS
The Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation, absent a major 
unforeseen event outside of the Group’s 
control, that the Group will continue to 
operate and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due for the next three years. 
The Directors’ assessment has been 
made with reference to the Group’s 
current position, prospects and Balance 
Sheet strength, the Group’s strategy 
and the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed in the 
Strategic Report.

year of profitable growth. We continue to 
strive to become their strategic outsource 
partner of choice, and to invest and 
innovate to fulfil customer needs and 
solve their challenges. 
MARKET TRENDS AND OVERVIEW
Demand for products and services 
within the healthcare industry is ever-
changing and complex. Global healthcare 
organisations and consumer brands are 
faced with pressure to efficiently deliver 
the highest quality products at the lowest 
possible price. There are two ways to 
achieve this: internally they can invest 
heavily in differentiating technologies and 
infrastructure while attempting to lower 
their cost of manufacturing, or they can 
find the right strategic outsource partner. 
Responding to these market demands, 
Scapa Healthcare has established itself 
as a trusted outsource partner for leading 
healthcare companies. 
Globally, healthcare companies continue 
to focus on strengthening both their 
internal research and development, 
marketing and distribution channels 
while utilising outsource partners as 
a more efficient means of producing 
their products, improving supply chain 
efficiency, shortening development 
times and bringing products to market 
faster. As a result, demand for third party 
services has grown as brands seek to 
establish trusted strategic outsource 
partnerships with scale and unique abilities. 
Expectations and capabilities continue to 
evolve as outsource partners are required 
to deliver more than just high quality 
products. They are tasked with delivering 
a complete turn-key solution, including 
design, regulatory and development 
“ O U R D E E P 
UNDERSTANDING

MARKETS HAS

DELIVER ANOTHER 
SUCCESSFUL YEAR 
OF PROFITABLE 
GROWTH.”
expertise that can take a product from 
its earliest concept through design and 
manufacturing, while maintaining strict 
quality, process, design and cost controls. 
This capability ultimately results in rapid 
speed to market to enhance the brand 
owner’s competitive position. 
Both the healthcare market and leading 
healthcare companies continue to call 
for innovation that will streamline their 
development process. Scapa Healthcare’s 
innovation strategy seeks to build a robust 
pipeline of both research and development 
projects and new customer development 
projects to propel the business forward. 
Through our strategic development and 
acquisition strategy, Scapa Healthcare has 
positioned itself for growth as an innovative 
partner to existing and emerging healthcare 
companies around the world. 
Last year’s acquisition of EuroMed, 
a leader in the development and 
manufacturing of hydrocolloid-based 
dressings, has added tremendous value 
to the Scapa Healthcare portfolio. The 
Orangeburg, NY site continues to deliver 
profitable growth with the introduction 
of hydrocolloids into Scapa Healthcare’s 
technology platforms. The new technology 
has leveraged synergies between both 
organisations’ client bases, engaging 
new development programmes at existing 
advanced wound care and consumer 
wellness customers. Hydrocolloids have 
also enabled Scapa Healthcare to become 
a stronger player within the health and 
beauty segment of the consumer 
wellness market. 
Building on last year’s tremendous 
success, the 2015 acquisition of First 
Water Limited (based in Ramsbury, UK) 
continues to leverage its growing portfolio 
of hydrogel formulations. Scapa Healthcare 
has strengthened its partnerships with 
leading brands to develop next generation 
products and expand the technology into 
completely new markets such as over-the-
counter wearable devices and dressings 
to stop the inception of wounds. These 
new developments have positioned Scapa 
Healthcare as an innovative and trusted 
partner with large consumer and wound 
care brands.

BUSINESS REVIEW: HEALTHCARE CONTINUED
Ongoing development work to meet the 
growing spectrum of wearable medical 
device users led to a more comprehensive 
Scapa MEDIFIX
®
 Long-term Wear Solutions 
range. Long-term Wear Solutions are 
designed to adhere a medical device to 
the skin for an extended period of time 
with the creation of custom material and 
design combinations based on clinical and 
user requirements. Market demands for 
longer-wearing adhesives resulted in two 
subsequent wear studies. Both studies 
demonstrated the importance of adhesive 
and substrate combinations and developed 
a solution lasting up to 16 days, two days 
longer than earlier studies. 
The Delivering Long-term Wear Solutions 
project resulted in a separate sterilisation 
method study and white paper publication 
to evaluate adhesives minimally affected by 
e-Beam sterilisation. Before use, wearable 
medical devices must undergo sterilisation; 
e-Beam sterilisation is not detrimental 
to electronics and therefore is most 
commonly used. Our range of e-Beam 
stable extended wear adhesives enables 
us to deliver custom developments and 
scalable production across the rapidly 
growing wearables market for devices such 
as patient monitoring, insulin delivery and 
continuous glucose monitoring. 
STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MODEL
Scapa Healthcare continues to concentrate 
on being the strategic outsource partner 
of choice, providing turn-key solutions 
for current and future industry leaders 
in our three target markets: Advanced 
Wound Care, Consumer Wellness and 
Medical Devices. 
Our strategy is to remain a business-to-
business partner to global healthcare 
customers, supporting them in the design, 
development and launch of their new 
products into the healthcare market. 
Our team of experts and full turn-key 
capabilities allow us to quickly take a 
product from concept to market faster 
than many of our partners can do internally. 
Delivering rapid speed to market allows 
us to offer our partners a differentiated 
competitive advantage in the market-place. 
This enables us to build long-term trusted 
relationships, supported by multi-year 
contracts that provide visible and secure 
streams of income for the business. 
To enhance our plan, we refined a 
comprehensive go-to-market strategy, 
targeting senior level engagement and 
outlining a strategic growth platform for the 
three key markets that we service. We will 
continue to establish a strong platform for 
growth with long-term contract renewals 
OUR BUSINESS MODEL – HOW WE CREATE VALUE 
2016/17 PERFORMANCE 
Scapa Healthcare made good progress  
this year, increasing revenue by 16.5%, 
or 5.0% at constant exchange rates. 
We saw continued success in obtaining 
long-term contract renewals and 
structured programmes with customers. 
Margins increased to 15.3% and trading 
profit growth was 18.6%, or 4.4% at 
constant exchange rates. With good 
visibility of revenue and a strong pipeline 
of projects, we have continued to invest 
in innovation and design, setting 
ourselves up for future growth. 
OUTLOOK
Our turn-key value proposition 
continues to resonate with customers. 
As the Scapa Healthcare brand and 
reputation continues to grow, so does 
the pipeline of new development 
projects and opportunities. 
We are actively engaged with major 
healthcare companies across all of our 
business sectors and at every level of 
the value chain. We will continue to invest 
in the business, developing the tools, 
infrastructure and talent needed to deliver 
the world class service that leading global 
healthcare providers require from their 
outsource partners. 
We remain very positive about the future 
for Scapa Healthcare.
22 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 22 STRATEGIC REPORT and increased strategic engagement with 
our customers. We actively aim to expand 
our technology and product portfolio, sales 
channels, manufacturing capabilities and 
capacity, and quality systems to remain 
a value-add partner to our customers and 
increase our share of the customers’ total 
spend. In order to do so, we must focus 
on the full supply chain and complete 
product processes from design and raw 
material selection, through converting and 
packaging, to sterilisation and logistics. 
We strive to be our customers’ strategic 
outsource partner of choice. 
Delivering high quality products is at 
the heart of everything we do; it is the 
foundation of trust with our customers. 
We have dedicated global healthcare 
quality teams at each site, and all product 
development and production are subject 
to rigorous quality control measures. 
We continue to invest in quality systems, 
resources and manufacturing infrastructure 
to meet the highest industry standards. 
This year we have made significant 
investments in capacity, quality and 
account management to better serve 
our customers. In order to deliver in the 
ever-changing healthcare market, we will 
continue to expand and strengthen our 
current capabilities and monitor any gaps 
in our value chain. We will invest through 
targeted acquisitions to support our growth 
strategy and deliver more value.

EuroMed has enhanced Scapa 
Healthcare’s core competencies 
and competitive advantage in delivering 
hydrocolloid-based turn-key solutions. 
A long-standing partner in the consumer 
wellness segment, EuroMed has 
established confidence with customers, 
delivering products that live up to each 
customer’s brand reputation. By 
demonstrating superior service and 
encouraging trusted partners to expand 
their brands into new segments, the 
EuroMed acquisition has created inroads 
into new consumer wellness areas within 
the health and beauty segment. 
CHALLENGE
Introduce a new platform for a global 
consumer brand’s skin care portfolio. 
OUTCOME
Leveraging EuroMed’s proprietary 
hydrocolloid technology, a turn-key 
supply agreement was created to 
manufacture a new hydrocolloid 
consumer skin care product in a finished 
retail box. EuroMed’s on-site research 
and development achieved the required 
performance characteristics to support 
the efficacy of the product. Clinical data 
and regulatory support were provided to 
aid the customer in launching the product. 
The extreme responsiveness of the site 
was realised when the first order was 
delivered in five weeks, a reduced lead 
time. The result was entry into the health 
and beauty section of retail and pharmacy 
stores around the US. The partnership 
continues to evolve as both teams work 
to develop a next generation product.

The Industrial business unit strategy is to 
drive improvements in Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) while focusing on 
servicing our customers in our chosen 
market segments; Automotive, Cable, 
Construction, Consumer and Specialty 
products. Our approach continues to 
deliver significant improvements in trading 
profit and margins, coupled with good 
revenue growth in specific areas against 
a difficult macro environment. 
MARKET TRENDS AND OVERVIEW
Our Engineered Products business 
continues to serve our Automotive and 
Cable markets with bespoke solutions. The 
commercial teams partner with customers 
and give technical assistance, to design-in 
tailored adhesive solutions, which meet the 
customers’ specific needs. We then follow 
the design-in work to the manufacturing 
locations where the product is used. We 
work within our global footprint, and with 
trusted partners, to provide products to 
customers in a timely manner. 
In the Automotive segment, our core 
products are used in protection wraps 
for shipping and wire harnesses. We 
also have a unique specialty film business 
which serves the seat heating sub-
segment. Our growth, particularly in 
Europe, with the Top 5, Tier 1 wire harness 
system manufacturers continues. In North 
America, our renewed focus has produced 
multiple contract wins at major Tier 1 
suppliers for new platforms, with initial 
builds occurring in 2017. As we move 
beyond the protective and wire harness 
business we continue to see improved 
margins. Year-on-year growth continues 
in Europe and BRIC countries. New 
water-based low Volatile Organic 
Compound (VOC) products align with 
China’s demand for environmentally-
friendly products and continue to provide 
growth opportunities. Automotive OEMs 
expect a global footprint with a local 
presence. Our key products have been 
localised to meet this requirement and 
strengthen our supply position. 
“ WE R E M A IN 
CONFIDENT THAT 
THERE IS FURTHER 
SCOPE TO IMPROVE 
THE BUSINESS.”
Our Cable segment products are primarily 
used in protection against abrasion and 
water ingress for power transmission 
and fibre-optic communication lines. The 
products are highly sought after because 
of their reliability in the field. As we move 
beyond protection and look at fire retardant 
and anti-rodent products, we continue to 
expand our margins. Our success depends 
on the ability to win future contracts and we 
secured several large contracts with major 
European subsea and high-voltage cable 
manufacturers. Creation of a new narrow 
thickness water blocking foam tape, 
which minimises signal losses in fiber-optic 
cables, is creating further opportunities 
with core customers. Our water-blocking 
marine tapes continue to help our 
customers produce in a more cost-effective 
manner while meeting the high standards 
required in the subsea industry. Our growth 
in revenue, margin and profit extends to 
almost every area of the globe. 
Our Commercial Products business serves 
the Construction, Consumer and Specialty 
markets with application-specific 
consumable solutions. 
The Construction segment, the main 
driver for the Commercial Products 
business, is largely dependent on macro 
trends, is seasonal and is driven by short 
lead times. We focus on the spring and 
summer months to ensure we are in a 
position to support the spikes in demand. 
Our Construction segment clearly stood 
out as a high performer as it doubled GDP 
growth rates in both Europe and North 
America. Traditionally, our large range of 
products is used globally by contractors, 
professionals and do-it-yourself enthusiasts. 
We have been working to increase our 
presence with OEMs while maintaining our 
relationship with retailers and distributors. 
We have seen this strategy pay dividends 
in Europe and North America. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
24 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 25 24 STRATEGIC REPORT The Consumer segment is led by our  
key retail brands. In France, where we 
manufacture the Barnier
®
 brand, the tape 
is used by professionals in the construction 
business throughout Europe. In Canada, 
where our market leading Renfrew Pro 
Tape™ is manufactured, the new ‘Feel the 
Game™’ tagline is positioned to allow the 
hockey playing consumer to know our 
top quality tape products will give them the 
puck control and game-time confidence to 
achieve their best performance on the ice. 
Our Consumer business in Europe and 
North America had mixed results, with 
some good highlights. In the year of 
celebrating our Centenary, we believe 
Barnier’s 100 years in the market allows 
us an advantage in the professional usage 
arena. The global re-brand of our Renfrew 
Pro Tape™ portfolio to hockey players and 
retailers via online media has increased the 
pace of new retail partnership enquiries as 
well as greater interest in our new NHL 
branded hockey tape portfolio at the end 
user, retailer and professional team levels.
Our Specialty segment consists of a 
diverse portfolio of niche technologies 
and globally-dispersed clients which led 
to solid performance across top accounts 
and an understanding of the highest-value 
technologies and regions for future growth. 
Our Specialty team has leveraged several 
existing bonding and laminating 
technologies into new applications with 
industry-leading companies across the 
aerospace, technical packaging, white 
goods and military markets. 
Our Commercial Products business saw 
significant growth in the top 20 accounts. 
 
The announcement to close our 
Rorschach, Switzerland facility was 
made in April 2015 with a closure date 
of November 2016. A 20-month transfer 
programme began for approximately 
50 Scapa product groups in which we 
employed a phased and systematic 
validation and cutover plan including 
coating trials, regulatory approvals 
and customer validations. With special 
consideration to protect customer 
service, we invested in a substantial stock 
build to support us during this product 
and equipment transfer period. 
Throughout this initiative, it was 
imperative that an appropriate employee 
communications and retention bonus 
scheme was implemented. The Swiss-
based team remained highly professional 
and co-operative right until the closure 
date, with no industrial labour issues or 
Health and Safety issues reported during 
the closure period.
The vacant Swiss facility is proving to 
be an attractive opportunity for property 
developers and investors. Working 
with our own urban planners and the 
Rorschach town planning authorities, we 
jointly engaged in a process to maximise 
the development parameters for density 
and usage. This enabled us to generate 
a resilient re-zoning and planning timeline. 
The sale process is ongoing with a 
number of interested parties.
SUCCESS
This highly complex, global project was 
delivered on time and on budget. The 
project delivered significant profit and 
cash improvements plus several other 
benefits including: 
• Further improved ROCE at the 
Industrial Business Unit, through 
increased equipment utilisation 
• No industrial relations or Health and 
Safety issues at the Swiss facility
• Minimal disruption to our customers 
during the transition phase
• Strategic range reviews and use of 
tactical product rationalisation

Our strategy is to continue improving 
ROCE through a business model where 
we continually review our asset base 
and expense structure. We will deliver 
complementary offerings within and 
across the Industrial segments, driven 
by combining the needs of our strategic 
partners with Scapa’s broad technical 
toolbox of chemistries, materials and 
global supply access. Our broad portfolio 
development across multiple markets 
leverages existing products, material and 
manufacturing knowledge into the hands 
of new and existing customers. 
2016/17 PERFORMANCE
The Industrial performance exceeded 
expectations with regard to trading profit 
and margin. Our continued emphasis on 
improving return on assets, cost controls 
and engaging with our strategic partners 
lifted our performance. The business 
benefitted from the weakening of Sterling, 
the revenue growth of 11.4% being 
entirely because of currency. Revenue 
at constant currency declined by 0.3%, 
which included some business we chose 
not to continue after the closure of our 
Switzerland facility. Trading profit is where 
we made the most impressive increase of 
66.4%, and 45.9% at constant currency. 
Margins improved for the seventh year in 
a row to 10.4% as the business continued 
to improve its operational efficiency and 
supply chain. The closure of the Swiss 
business in the second half delivered the 
expected benefits, with minimal disruption 
to customers. 
OUTLOOK 
Whilst 2016/17 saw an increase in margins 
to 10.4%, we remain confident that there 
is further scope to improve the business 
through continued execution of the ROCE 
strategy and driving better asset utilisation. 
Further margin improvement will come 
from the full year impact of the Swiss 
closure, and other opportunities are under 
evaluation. Whilst conscious of the macro 
challenges, the business will continue to 
BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY

our high-value technologies portfolio 
and connecting market needs with the

consumer branded websites, will allow 
new and existing customers a greater

Scapa’s broad product portfolio, market 
experience, technical expertise and

targeted market communications 
programmes, new prospect outreach

IN REVENUE AND 
PROFITS AND INCREASED 
MARGINS IN BOTH OF 
THE BUSINESSES.”
This was another excellent year for 
Scapa, with the Group once again delivering 
a strong set of results. We have seen 
continued growth in revenue and profits and 
increased margins in both of the businesses 
in which we operate; Healthcare and 
Industrial. The dividend has again been 
increased, by 14.3%, supported by higher 
earnings and good cash generation. 
REVENUE AND TRADING PROFITS
Group revenue increased by 13.3% to 
£279.6m (2016: £246.7m); on a constant 
currency basis growth was 1.7%. 
Healthcare revenue was £108.7m (2016: 
£93.3m), an increase of 16.5% or 5.0% 
on a constant currency basis. Industrial 
revenue was £170.9m (2016: £153.4m), 
an increase of 11.4%, or (0.3)% on a 
constant currency basis.
The Group delivered another record year 
for trading profit, which increased by 37.1% 
to £29.2m (2016: £21.3m) or 18.2% growth 
on a constant currency basis. Trading 
profit margin improved to 10.4% (2016: 
8.6%). Healthcare contributed £16.6m 
(2016: £14.0m), growing the margin to 
15.3% (2016: 15.0%). Industrial contributed 
trading profit of £17.8m (2016: £10.7m), 
a very strong growth of 66.4% or 45.9% 
on a constant currency basis. Industrial 
trading profit margin improved to 10.4% 
(2016: 7.0%), achieving the double-digit 
margin target. 
Total Group operating profit was £23.8m 
(2016: £11.7m) after charging pension 
administration costs of £0.7m (2016: 
£0.7m), intangible amortisation costs 
of £3.7m (2016: £2.3m) and exceptional 
costs of £1.0m (2016: £6.6m). Trading profit 
continues to be adjusted for these items  
to give better clarity of the underlying 
performance of the Group.
CURRENCY
Currency translation had a significant 
impact on both sales and profits in 2017 
as a result of the weaker Sterling. In the 
year Sterling averaged US$1.32 (2016: 
US$1.50) and €1.20 (2016: €1.36). Currency 
translation increased sales compared 
to 2016 by £28.2m (11.4%) and trading 
profit by £3.4m (16.0%).

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional income in the period was 
£0.3m (2016: £2.1m) and related to a 
pension liability management exercise  
for the Group legacy UK defined benefit 
scheme that concluded in the period. 
Exceptional costs in the period were  
£1.3m (2016: £8.7m). This comprised costs 
of £0.7m (2016: £5.1m) associated with the 
closure of our Swiss site, including asset 
write-offs and retention payments, along 
with acquisition-related costs of £0.6m 
as a result of the acquisition of EuroMed 
in May 2016. 
In order to provide a clearer understanding 
of the performance of the Group, the above 
items, both income and expenses, have 
been separated out from trading results 
in line with the Group’s exceptional items 
accounting policy disclosed in note 4 
on pages 95 and 96. 
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE 
MEASURES
Scapa uses alternative performance 
measures such as trading profit, adjusted 
earnings per share, trading profit margin, 
and free cash flow, together with current 
measures restated at constant exchange 
rates, to allow the users of the financial 
statements to gain a clearer understanding 
of the underlying performance of the 
business, allowing the impact of restructuring 
and reorganisation activities and acquisition 
costs to be identified separately. 
NET FINANCE COSTS AND 
GROUP FACILITIES
Net finance costs increased slightly to 
£2.0m (2016: £1.9m). Net cash interest 
payable increased to £1.2m (2016: £0.7m) 
following the acquisition of EuroMed and 
relates to the Group’s committed £60m 
revolving facility which matures in June 
2018. During the year the Group drew 
down upon the uncommitted £20m 
accordion facility to increase the revolving 
credit facility from £40m to £60m to fund  
its acquisition strategy. Non-cash interest 
reduced to £0.8m (2016: £1.2m) and  
relates to the Group legacy defined  
benefit pension plans. 
TAXATION
The Group’s tax charge of £4.2m  
(2016: £3.7m) includes a £5.6m charge 
(2016: £4.9m) on trading activities and  
a £1.4m credit (2016: £1.2m credit) 
on exceptional items. 
The Group’s effective tax rate is a 
blend of the different national rates from 
the operating subsidiaries in the various 
countries in which we operate, applied 
to locally generated profits. Our tax 
arrangements are driven by commercial 
transactions, managed in a responsible 
manner based on compliance, 
transparency and co-operation with  
tax authorities.
We report an adjusted effective tax rate  
to give the best indication of the Group’s 
tax commitments. This tax rate is 
calculated on trading activities after the 
deduction of cash interest. The rate in the 
current year is 20.0% (2016: 23.8%), the 
same as the UK standard rate. Although 
the national rates applied to local profits are 
generally higher than the UK standard rate, 
the Group benefits from unrecognised tax 
losses in the UK along with sensible and 
compliant tax planning.
The Group’s cash tax payment in the  
year was £2.8m (2016: £3.0m) or 9.6% of 
trading profit. Cash tax remains below the 
effective tax rate as the Group continues to 
use the significant brought forward losses. 
As the Group continues to increase its 
profitability, we expect to see cash tax 
payments becoming more in line with the 
effective tax rate as brought forward losses 
in certain jurisdictions are used up.
ACQUISITION ACTIVITY
The Group continues proactively to seek 
out complementary acquisitions to 
enhance the product and service offering 
to our customers. 
On 23 May 2016, the Group acquired  
100% of the share capital of EuroMed, 
a healthcare business specialising in 
hydrocolloid based wound care solutions, 
located in Orangeburg, New York, USA at 
a cost of US$35m (£28.3m). The company 
has innovative R&D capabilities that will 
further enhance and complement Scapa 
Healthcare’s existing resources, whilst 
broadening and strengthening our internal 
intellectual property and increasing the 
turn-key value proposition for Healthcare.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share improved 
by 39.6% to 14.8p (2016: 10.6p) and basic 
earnings per share was 11.6p (2016: 4.1p).
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT 
The Group continued to see healthy 
cash generation and closing net debt 
was £16.1m (2016: £2.6m) following the 
acquisition of EuroMed.
Net cash generated from operating 
activities before exceptional items was 
£32.7m (2016: £19.0m) which represents 
112.0% of trading profit. Net cash interest 
paid was £1.2m (2016: £0.6m). Income 
tax paid was £2.8m (2016: £3.0m) resulting 
in a net cash generated from operating 
activities of £25.1m (2016: £12.9m). The site 
consolidation programme continues and 
accounts for a significant portion of the net 
capital expenditure of £8.3m (2016: £9.8m) 
with the completion of the closure of the 
Rorschach site this year and transfer of 
operations to Valence.

STRATEGIC REPORT
28 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 29 28 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW CONTINUED
DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL 
ALLOCATION
The Board is recommending a 14.3% 
(2016: 16.7%) increase in the full year 
dividend with a final dividend of 2.0p  
(2016: 1.75p). This increased dividend 
balances both our cash performance in  
the period and our underlying confidence  
in our business with the need to support 
the future growth of the Group. Dividend 
cover (being the ratio of adjusted earnings 
per share to dividend per share) is 7.4 times 
(2016: 6.1 times). If approved at the Annual 
General Meeting the final dividend will be 
paid on 18 August 2017 to shareholders 
on the register on 21 July 2017.
Our objective is to maximise long-term 
shareholder returns through both organic 
growth and growth through acquisitions. 
We continue to adopt a cash allocation 
policy that allows for: continuing investment 
in capital projects that support growth; 
regular returns to shareholders from our 
free cash flow; acquisitions to supplement 
our existing portfolio of business; and an 
efficient Balance Sheet appropriate to the 
Company’s investment requirements.
CONTINUED PROGRESS ON  
POST‑RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group has no open defined benefit 
schemes and the majority of the post-
retirement benefit schemes for employees 
are defined contribution. The Group’s 
Balance Sheet carries pension deficits that 
relate to schemes that have been closed 
for many years, and some very small 
overseas leaving indemnities that are 
classed as defined benefit.

support the acquisition of EuroMed. The current facility goes through to June 2018, so the 
Company will be reviewing and extending the banking facilities in H1 of 2017/18. Current 
availability of finance is good and we expect to be able to refinance on favourable terms. 
At the year end net debt was £16.1m (2016: £2.6m). The ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 
0.45 times, giving significant headroom against our facility covenant of 2.75 times. The

under each ratio at year end.

30 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 30 STRATEGIC REPORT Over recent years we have been very active 
in trying to address the cost and volatility  
of the legacy pension deficits. This strategy 
has continued into the current year where 
we have continued to see good take-up of 
the Flexible Retirement Options (FRO) that 
is now embedded into the UK scheme. In 
addition, we have undertaken a Pension 
Increase Exchange (PIE) exercise whereby 
a number of pension members agreed to 
exchange future non-statutory pension 
increases for an immediate one-off 
increase in their current pension, resulting 
in a reduction in the scheme’s liabilities 
and a past service credit to the P&L of 
£0.3m (2016: £Nil) which was treated 
as exceptional income. 
During the year the fair value of the  
scheme assets grew by £19.0m whilst  
the total liabilities of the schemes grew by 
£22.9m, resulting in an overall increase in 
the deficit of £3.9m which was driven by 
the decrease in the rate used to discount 
the scheme liabilities to 2.45% (2016: 
3.45%) due to prevailing external market 
conditions. The scheme’s investment 
strategy includes a portfolio of assets that 
are matched to the duration of the member 
liabilities. This strategy hedges the deficit 
from changes in bond yields that affect the 
discount rate and is reflected in the asset 
and liability movements in the current year. 
Overseas cash contributions were  
£0.9m (2016: £1.0m); these contributions 
relate to leavers and not to a deficit 
repair schedule of payments. Pension 
administration expenses of £0.7m (2016: 
£0.7m) in relation to the pension schemes 
are reported through operating profit 
under IAS 19 (revised).
Scapa has other pension projects in  
the pipeline and will continue to execute 
projects that provide a good balance  
of member and Company benefits whilst 
looking to de-risk the scheme further. 
In 2012 we put in place a Central Asset 
Reserve (CAR) structure with the UK 
Trustee and continue to make contributions 
under this arrangement. In the year we 
made contributions of £3.7m (2016: £3.7m). 
The triennial pension scheme valuation 
date is 31 March 2017, but no changes to 
the current arrangements are expected. 
With a reasonable projection of investment 
returns, we have the intention of reaching 
a position where we can achieve buy-out 
of the pension scheme within the next 
ten years.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
Shareholders’ funds increased by £22.7m 
to £100.4m (2016: £77.7m). Profit after tax 
increased to £17.6m (2016: £6.1m). The 
pension loss in the period was £6.9m 
(2016: £7.9m gain). Movements in equity 
that related to share issues, dividends and 
options reduced shareholders’ funds by 
£0.7m (2016: £0.4m decrease). Currency 
movements on overseas asset values were 
favourable in the period £12.7m (2016: 
£2.5m). Tax items booked directly into 
reserves £Nil (2016: £0.2m decrease).
UK REFERENDUM ON  
EU MEMBERSHIP
As a global business with over 90% of  
the Group’s activities outside of the UK, 
Scapa’s trading is less likely to be affected 
by Brexit than many UK plcs, and current 
results are benefiting from the weaker 
Sterling. With so little information on the 
likely shape of future relationships between 
the UK, the EU and beyond, we are 
engaged in developing a deeper 
understanding of the implications of the 
changes as they emerge, in particular 
relating to customs and duties. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE  
YEAR AHEAD
Risk is managed closely and is spread 
across our businesses and managed to 
individual materiality. Our key risks have 
been referenced in this annual report 
primarily on pages 12 to 18, in the Chief 
Executive’s review and in the Audit and 
Risk Committee report on pages 47 to 50. 
We have a Code of Conduct which  
is adopted internationally and reflects our 
ethical approach to business. The Board 
has considered all of the above factors in 
its review of going concern as described  
on page 68 and in the Viability Statement 
on page 19 and has been able to conclude 
the review satisfactorily.

ENABLING A HIGH‑
PERFORMING CULTURE
At Scapa, we are proud of the broad 
spectrum of experience, talent and skills 
that comes from our global workforce and 
understand that developing and managing 
our talent is essential in achieving our plans 
for growth.
Providing managers with effective tools to 
help drive value creation within their teams 
is essential in developing our employees 
as our competitive advantage. 
DEVELOPING OUR KNOWLEDGE‑
SHARING PLATFORM 
Last year, we developed our knowledge-
sharing platforms to equip our leaders 
with the best information to make 
effective decisions.
In April 2016, we launched our in-house 
employee database, HR Connect, 
which provides instant access to real-time 
people data, to support effective people 
management across the full employee 
lifecycle. Our integrated Recruiting Excellence 
portal allows managers to conduct all 
recruitment activity online and interact with 
candidates, strengthening our capabilities 
to recruit and select high talent into the right 
roles within the business.
In addition, as we continue to drive a 
high-performing culture, our focus on 
rewarding and recognising value creation 
was a key driver in building a new in-house 
performance management platform 
tailored specifically to our performance 
management structure. Launched as part 
of HR Connect in October 2016, the online 
system is now available to over 500 of our 
leaders, managers and employees to 
record and manage their expectations 
throughout the year.
In addition, our Executive Mentoring 
programme was offered to a further six 
members of the Leadership Team, totalling 
15 participants since it was formally offered 
as a development opportunity in 2016.
In July 2016, we launched our Succession 
Planning tool, which complements our 
talent development structure to complete 
the launch of our full talent management 
programme. We maintained talent 
assessment coverage of our leadership 
population at 100% and increased our 
assessment coverage of our management 
population to 12%.
Furthermore, our new Salary Review tool, 
launched at the beginning of the year, 
allows managers to make informed 
decisions based on reliable external  
market data and internal performance 
reviews to incentivise and reward high 
performance appropriately.
INVESTING IN FUTURE LEADERS 
We continue to develop and optimise our 
talent management programme with the 
aim of future-proofing the organisation by 
developing our people, defining our future 
talent requirements and identifying and 
preparing those with leadership potential 
for succession roles. 
To enhance our capabilities to effectively 
link business requirements with individual 
development plans, we strengthened our 
talent development structure with the 
introduction of new opportunities. Leaders 
now have the opportunity to participate as 
a judge in our annual CEO Awards process, 
allowing them the chance to work with 
other leaders and gain insight into projects 
and learnings from across the Group. 
In addition, employees with leadership 
potential are invited to become a champion 
for our culture programme, ‘The Scapa 
Way’, to act as an ambassador for the 
programme and support local leaders 
on key implementation initiatives.
We also continue to leverage on our 
partnership with Harvard Business School 
offering the Harvard ManageMentor
®
 
programme to a further eleven leaders this 
year as part of their development, totalling 
25 employees who have participated in the 
scheme since 2015 when it became a 
formal part of our talent management 
programme.

their knowledge on our business policies

this year’s e-learning programme, launched 
in the Academy, enabled employees to 
complete the course to suit their schedules 
and commitments. We achieved 100% 
compliance, with all employees completing 
the training. 
In support of our annual performance 
management cycle, we also provided 
workshops for employees at their local 
sites with refresher training on our 
performance management tool, RREs 
(Role, Responsibilities and Expectations). 
The workshops were designed to support 
managers and employees in developing 
value-creating objectives, aligned to our 
functional, business unit and Group visions.
PROVIDING FLEXIBLE AND 
ACCESSIBLE LEARNING 
OPPORTUNITIES 
In April 2016 we launched our online 
Learning Management System, ‘The Scapa 
Academy’, as the central tool for employees 
to access learning resources to support 
personal and professional development. 
The Academy also provides a central 
resource for managers in order to provide 
the same training opportunities to our 
operations’ employees at sites. The launch 
of the Academy has allowed us to reach 
a broader population, with 63% of the 
targeted population actively accessing key 
Group-wide, local and functional training.
In February 2017, we launched our Code 
of Conduct training. Our annual business 
training programme is sponsored by the 
Board of Directors and is delivered to all 
employees across the business to refresh 
STRATEGIC REPORT
32 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 33 32 STRATEGIC REPORT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED
SUPPORTING DIVERSITY
We value the diversity that comes from our 
people across our 20 sites globally. In line 
with upcoming Equality and Diversity 
legislation, we have completed a thorough 
analysis against our legal obligations and 
have taken actions to ensure we are 100% 
compliant, and are equipped to support the 
new legislation in 2018. We strive to create 
a more diverse workforce and aim to 
increase our effectiveness in attracting 
talent from diverse backgrounds by 
continuously reviewing and improving our 
attraction and recruitment programmes. 
Lastly, we will work with our leadership 
population to further strengthen our 
capacity to deliver high performance 
through embracing diversity.
DRIVING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
In the third year of our culture change 
programme, we have seen leaders and 
employees take ownership of ‘The Scapa 
Way’, adopting and driving our culture 
framework locally, and using the tools and 
standards driven at group level to reward 
and recognise achievements, manage 
performance and define ways of working.
The ‘Living our Guiding Principles’ 
recognition scheme is widely used across 
the business since its launch, and usage 
has increased since the online nomination 
form was launched in July 2016. The 
scheme provides the opportunity for any 
employee to recognise a colleague for 
demonstrating one or more of our Guiding 
Principles, across three levels; Bronze, 
Silver and Gold. Each award level carries 
a different weight in reward, with emphasis 
placed on awarding something of individual 
interest or value to the recipient. This 
approach is designed to incentivise 
individuals by offering more personal 
recognition and reward. 
In July 2016 we launched a maturity  
matrix tool for employees to assess the 
implementation of the programme at a  
local level, and define their own actions 
to support further integration. 
CREATING VALUE WITHIN 
OUR COMMUNITIES
Our global footprint allows us the 
opportunity to contribute to local 
communities across the world and we 
continue to seek opportunities to engage 
with and support charities, organisations 
and initiatives. Often, our partnerships 
come from introductions made by our 
own employees who have a special 
interest or connection to the causes.
In August 2016, our employees in Knoxville, 
USA, partnered with local charity The 
Water Angels, to support a back-to-school 
engagement drive, where the team 
donated new school supplies for children 
to begin the new school year. In December 
2016, leaders from the site participated 
in the second annual ‘Dress for Success’ 
initiative at a local school, where over 35 
community and business leaders, officials, 
parents and teachers visited the school 
dressed in their best business attire to 
greet and encourage students to strive for 
the best as they start their school day.

At a Group level, we continue our 
partnership with The Hallé, who offer 
concerts, recordings, radio broadcasts and 
educational outreach programmes to local, 
national and international communities.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH 
AND SAFETY
Scapa’s overriding commitment in the 
workplace continues to be the health, 
safety and welfare of its employees and all 
those who visit the Company’s operations. 
This commitment extends to those who 
carry out work on our behalf.
Identifying and complying with applicable 
legislation underpins all our health and 
safety activities and improvement initiatives.
The Board provides environmental, 
health and safety leadership and the 
Chief Executive has primary responsibility 
for setting the principal objectives within 
which the detailed policies operate. The 
Chief Operating Officer, supported by the 
Group EH&S Director ensure adequate 
resource is available to successfully deploy 
and measure operational health, safety 
and environmental improvement plans.
Performance
Over the last 12 months we have focused 
our resource and initiatives on delivering 
improvements in three key areas:
1. Increasing the level of EHS involvement 
across the entire organisation
2. Improving the level of accountability 
and expectation for health and safety 
continuous improvement
3. Strengthening our processes and 
systems for identifying and complying 
with global legislation
Although improvement has been 
achieved and sustained, we believe the 
EHS continuous improvement cycle is a 
journey. Initiatives to improve involvement 
and accountability will continue over the 
next 24 months to help us to further 
reduce our accident potential.
Headline achievements
• 37.5% reduction in our Lost Time Injury 
Frequency Rate
• Identified over 6,100 safety opportunities 
via our Stop, Think & Ask programme
• Completed over 5,000 corrective actions 
and improvements
• Ghislarengo achieved OSHAS 18001
• Ramsbury achieved ISO 50001
Employees at our site in Ramsbury, UK, 
supported local youth organisation SMASH 
Swindon Youth Mentoring by arranging a 
summer event for all mentors and young 
people who participate in the mentoring 
scheme. At Christmas, the team also 
donated gifts to a local women’s refuge 
where many women and children live to 
escape abusive home lives. 
Our team in Renfrew continue to support 
the Renfrew Victoria Hospital Foundation. 
The five-year commitment supports the 
‘I Choose RVH’ campaign, launched in May 
“In my first role with Scapa, I was 
responsible for the full supply chain 
process, from production planning and 
logistics, to warehousing, shipping and 
procurement. Two years after joining, 
I was given the opportunity to enhance 
my experience with further qualifications, 
and applied to study a postgraduate 
course in Supply Chain and Operations 
Management. Scapa supported me 
through the course, allowing me time to 
attend lessons and supporting me with 
the course fees. When I had gained my 
master’s degree, I moved into the role 
of Deputy Site Manager and took on 
additional responsibilities managing 
projects, which stretched my skills and 
provided me with new challenges. 
When the role of Site General Manager 
became available, Scapa considered me 
for the role and ultimately offered me the 
opportunity. My most recent career move 
with Scapa was to Director of Operations 
Excellence in the Group function, where 
I lead change projects and drive our 
standards of excellence across sites.
I have been with Scapa for almost nine 
years now, and during my time here I 
have been offered some valuable 
opportunities to learn and develop my 
career. Being in a global company, I have 
had the chance to work with colleagues 
around the world, and develop skills 
working with a diverse range of cultures, 
languages and working practices. In my 
roles I have always felt like I could make a 
difference, and our culture means that we 
can apply a level of entrepreneurship to 
achieve our goals, something which we 
continue to do and which makes me feel 
very proud to work for Scapa.”

Environment
Scapa recognises the importance of 
world class environmental stewardship. 
To help us deliver on this expectation, 
we apply a structured approach to 
assessing, maintaining and reducing 
our environmental impact by:
• Implementing and maintaining 
environmental and energy management 
systems based on international 
standards
• Measuring and monitoring consumption 
and emissions, and setting targets to 
improve performance
• Conducting environmental impact 
assessments and developing site 
improvement plans
• Providing training to employees and 
engaging with customers and suppliers 
to raise environmental awareness
• Identifying and complying with all relevant 
environmental laws and regulations
Given the diversity of Scapa’s international 
operations, local management drives 
environmental performance in accordance 
with Group policy. Specific site-level 
objectives have been established to ensure 
compliance with local legislative and 
external management system requirements.
Scapa uses a variety of indicators to 
monitor environmental performance, but 
the following core impacts are identified 
for the Group as a whole:
• Greenhouse gas emissions from energy 
use, including electricity, natural gas and 
heating fuel
•  Use of resources
•  Generation and disposal of waste
The following assumptions, methodology, 
definitions and data validation processes 
have been used to report the Group’s key 
environmental performance indicators in 
2016/17. The reported data complies with 
the Companies Act, for the Mandatory 
Reporting of Greenhouse Gases.
• Boundary scope: Data from all locations 
over which the Company has operational 
control is collected and measured
•  Primary data sources: These include 
billing, invoices and other systems 
provided by the supplier of the energy 
to communicate energy consumption
•  Secondary data sources: These include 
the Company’s internal systems used 
to record and report the above 
consumption data
•  Internal data validation: The process 
used to review and compare primary 
data with secondary data
•  Conversion factors: The 2016 
Government GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting, published by 
the UK Department for Environmental 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), are used 
when converting gross emissions. The 
applicable country conversion factors 
published in this guidance have been 
applied to operations outside of the UK
•  Intensity metrics: Total carbon emissions

RESPONSIBILITY
We have a robust framework of corporate 
responsibility policies, including our Human 
Rights Policy, our Code of Conduct and 
sustainability approach. 
Scapa has invested time and resources 
in a project we called “S.P.I.R.E.” (Supplier 
Performance Improvement & Requirements 
Evaluation) which will reinforce and 
supplement Scapa’s existing procedures 
and best practice methods of supplier 
evaluation. S.P.I.R.E. has been rolled 
out on a pilot basis to a number of global 
suppliers, with a view to wider global 
rollout during the next three to six months. 
The global procurement teams have 
adopted a consistent, robust, documented 
and interactive supplier evaluation, selection 
and ongoing assessment approach 
which includes detailed due diligence and 
supplier certification in respect of many 
compliance issues including slavery and 
human trafficking. Subsequent disclosure 
statements will include an update of the 
S.P.I.R.E. project and the effect of its use 
throughout the business.
Human rights
We define human rights as basic rights 
that allow individuals the freedom to lead 
a dignified life, free from fear or want, 
and free to express independent beliefs. 
We acknowledge the responsibility of 
businesses to respect human rights, by 
acting with due diligence to avoid infringing 
on the rights of others and to address any 
adverse impacts in which they are involved, 
in line with the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights 
(the Ruggie Framework).
Our aim is to ensure that we adhere 
to international human rights standards, 
both through our own actions and by 
association with business partners and 
suppliers, by providing a framework of 
fundamental principles of human rights 
by which Scapa will be guided in the 
conduct of its business. Scapa sources 
materials (including fabrics, paper, rubber, 
films and chemicals) from a wide variety 
of suppliers around the world that range 
from large international organisations 
to specialist local companies. 
Scapa has made a disclosure in 
accordance with the UK Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 which incorporates 
the requirements under the California 
Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010. 
This can be found on the Scapa Group 
website at www.scapa.com/en/Modern 
Slavery Act.
Code of conduct and 
sustainability approach
Scapa aims to act with integrity and 
professionalism with all suppliers and to 
support them to help achieve a responsible 
and sustainable approach across the supply 
chain. We recognise that some smaller 
suppliers may find it challenging to adopt 
the practices expected. In such cases, 
Scapa will adopt a risk-based approach 
to ensure that their contribution to its 
responsibility and sustainability agenda 
progresses in line with their capabilities.
Our supply chain corporate responsibility 
policy statement is founded upon this 
belief. For suppliers, Scapa will look to 
ensure that:
• suppliers’ products comply with both 
their own product legislation and that 
of any countries for which the product 
is ultimately destined
• human rights responsibilities in line 
with the UN Ruggie Framework are 
conformed to 
• employee working conditions of our 
suppliers are safe and hygienic, with 
working hours that are not excessive, 
and at least the legal minimum wage 
is paid for the location
• employees are not subject to 
harassment or discrimination
• materials used during the manufacturing 
process do not create any adverse 
environmental impacts
• materials purchased by suppliers are 
sourced from responsible producers, 
with appropriate traceability systems
• products supplied to Scapa do not lead 
to any adverse impacts on the health 
of any users in the supply chain
• consideration is given to the 
environmental impacts of the products 
supplied (including packaging and 
transport to Scapa manufacturing 
locations)
• suppliers have ethical business practices 
in place, including those relating to the 
avoidance of bribery or corruption
For supply chain management, Scapa will 
ensure that:
• procurement teams segment their 
suppliers based on spend and by 
responsibility and sustainability risk
• certain suppliers receive, complete 
and return the self-assessment 
responsibility and sustainability 
questionnaire, together with copies 
of Scapa’s Code of Conduct and 
anti-bribery guidance
• responsibility and sustainability 
development plans will be agreed 
with larger suppliers, identifying 
mutual benefits
• training on responsibility and 
sustainability matters will be provided 
to each procurement team
This Strategic Report is approved.

“ WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
GOOD GOVERNANCE  
IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE 
SUCCESS OF THE GROUP .”
The statement of corporate 
governance practices set out on 
pages 38 to 69, including the reports 
of Board Committees, and information 
incorporated by reference, constitutes 
the Corporate Governance Report 
of Scapa Group plc. 
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased  
to present Scapa Group plc’s Corporate 
Governance Report for the year ended  
31 March 2017. This report seeks to 
provide shareholders and stakeholders 
with a clear understanding of how we 
discharge our governance duties and  
apply the principles of good governance 
set down in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’).
Having joined the Board as Chairman-
Designate in January 2017 and assumed 
the role of Chairman at the end of March 
2017, I have observed the Board’s 
commitment to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance 
throughout the Group. The Board is fully 
supportive of the principles laid down in the 
Code and continues to review its systems, 
policies and procedures that support the 
Group’s sustainability and governance 
practices. This governance leadership 
has guided the Company through 
another successful year. 
We acknowledge that good governance  
is fundamental to the success of the  
Group and it is woven into the strategy  
and decision-making processes throughout 
the business. The tone from the top is 
cascaded from the Board to the Executive 
Team and out to the business. 
The composition of the Board is routinely 
assessed to ensure that we have a  
diverse balance of skills, experience  
and knowledge required to achieve our 
strategic goals. Board succession planning 
is an important element of our corporate 
governance regime and rigorous 
procedures are in place to attract, assess 
and develop Board and Executive Team 
talent. The Board embraces widening 
diversity in terms of background, ethnicity, 
age, experience, gender and perspective 
and it ensures that all appointments are

made on merit alone. As reported in last 
year’s Annual Report, David Blackwood 
was appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director on 1 May 2016  
and currently chairs the Audit and Risk 
Committee. In December 2016, James 
Wallace announced his intention to retire  
as Chairman at the end of March 2017  
and I assumed the role of Chairman at  
that time, having been appointed 
Chairman-Designate on 3 January 2017. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank James for the enormous contribution 
he has made to the success of Scapa over 
his ten-year tenure and we wish him well 
for the future. 
As in prior years, an internal evaluation  
of the Board and each of its Committees 
has been undertaken. The conclusions 
from the evaluation confirmed that the 
Board continues to function effectively  
as a whole and in Committee, and that all 
Directors properly discharge their duties. 
The Board also identified areas to focus on 
improvement in the coming year. In line with 
best practice, consideration is being given 
to undertaking next year’s evaluation using 
an external consultant. 
In January 2016, the Board took the 
decision that all Directors be proposed  
for election or re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting of the Company. Richard 
Perry, Senior Independent Director, has 
been in his role since May 2006 and 
has indicated a willingness to remain 
on the Board for a further term subject 
to shareholder approval. Richard is a 
highly valued member of the Board 
and we wholeheartedly support his 
continued tenure. 
The current Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (‘Policy’) was first approved by 
shareholders at our 2014 Annual General 
Meeting, although, as an AIM listed 
Company, Scapa is not required to have a 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. After three 
years under the current arrangements, 
Scapa will be submitting its Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for shareholder 
approval at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. Further details of the revised 
policy can be found within the 
Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 60.
Details of the Annual General Meeting  
to be held on 18 July 2017 are included in 
this report and I look forward to meeting 
shareholders at that meeting.

BOARD COMMITTEES
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is responsible 
for Board recruitment and succession 
planning, to ensure that the right skill 
sets are present in the Boardroom.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining all elements  
of remuneration for the Executive Directors 
and for reviewing the appropriateness and 
relevance of the Group’s remuneration policy.
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee’s main 
responsibilities are to monitor the integrity 
of the Group’s financial statements, to 
review internal and external audit activity 
and to monitor the effectiveness of risk 
management and internal controls.
Compliance statement
A detailed review of the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) in September 
2014 (‘the Code’) has been undertaken. 
The review took into account the FRC 
Guidance on Board Effectiveness issued  
in March 2011, the FRC Guidance on Audit 
Committees issued in September 2012 and 
the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and

relevant provisions of the Code throughout 
the year ended 31 March 2017 and through 
to the date of this report. The Group’s

page 46.
LEADERSHIP
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long-term 
success of the Group and is ultimately 
accountable for the Group’s strategy,  
risk management and performance.  
The Board’s primary roles are to provide 
entrepreneurial leadership to the Group 
within a framework of prudent and effective 
control which enables risk to be assessed 
and managed, and to set the Group’s 
strategic objectives and to ensure that the 
necessary resources are made available  
so that those objectives can be met. The 
Board also sets the Group’s values and 
standards and is responsible for ensuring 
that its obligations to its shareholders and 
other stakeholders, including employees, 
suppliers, customers and the community, 
are understood and met.
The Board currently comprises two 
Executive Directors, a Non-Executive 
Chairman and three Non-Executive 
Directors. During the Group Chairman’s 
handover period from James Wallace  
to Larry Pentz between 3 January and  
31 March 2017, the Board had a Non-
Executive Chairman and a Non-Executive 
Chairman-Designate. The names, 
biographical details and Committee 
memberships of the current Board 
members are set out on pages 40 
and 41 of this report. 
Division of responsibilities of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive. Each role has its own formal 
written description of specific responsibilities.
The Chairman’s principal responsibility  
is to lead the Board in the determination  
of its strategy and the achievement of its 
objectives. The Chairman is responsible  
for organising the business of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness by facilitating  
full and constructive contributions to the 
development and determination of the 
Group’s strategy and its overall commercial 
objectives from each member of the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for promoting 
the highest standards of integrity, probity 
and corporate governance throughout  
the Group. The Chairman manages the 
relationship with shareholders in relation  
to governance matters and regularly 
considers the composition and skill sets  
of the Board through evaluation. The 
Chairman sets the Board agenda and,  
with the Company Secretary, ensures  
that the Directors receive accurate, clear, 
comprehensive and timely information so 
that the Board is properly informed prior  
to each meeting in order that there can 
be appropriately thorough consideration 
and debate of the issues at Board and 
Committee meetings.
The Chief Executive is directly responsible 
for all executive management matters 
affecting the Group. His principal 
responsibility is ensuring achievement  
of the agreed strategic objectives and 
leadership of the business on a day-to-day

to the Board for the financial and 
operational performance of the Group.  
The management structure of the business 
under the Chief Executive’s leadership is 
set out in the diagram below. 
The role of the Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring 
independence and a wide range of 
experience to the Board. Their role is to 
help develop strategy and to promote 
constructive debate and challenge in Board 
discussions. Richard Perry is currently 
Senior Independent Director. The Senior 
Independent Director provides a sounding 
board for the Chairman and serves as an 
intermediary for the other Directors as 
necessary, as well as carrying out the 
evaluation of the Chairman. He also acts  
as a line of contact for shareholders if they 
have concerns which are not appropriate 
for discussions through the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Group Finance Director. 
Richard’s tenure exceeds the nine 
years recommended by the Code but 
the Board has determined that he 
remains independent.
The role of the Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary advises the Board 
through the Chairman on all governance 
matters. All Directors have access to the 
services of the Company Secretary and 
may take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense in conducting 
their duties. In accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association and 
the schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board, the appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the 
whole Board.
Operation of the Board
The Board held six formal meetings during 
the fiscal year 2017 and there were five 
telephone update calls and a number of  
ad hoc conference calls during the year to 
deal with matters as required. Attendance 
at each meeting is set out in the table on 
page 44. The Company Secretary was in 
attendance at all Board meetings as well  
as at all telephone updates and conference 
calls. The Board held its annual strategy 
meeting in the US in September 2016, 
whilst visiting the Windsor operations and 
the recently acquired EuroMed site. 
The provision of relevant, up-to-date 
information is fundamental to the effective 
leadership delivered by the Board. Reports 
from the Executive Directors are circulated 
in advance of each Board meeting and 
focus on major operational matters. 
Reports are also produced by the Chief 
Operating Officer and the Company 
Secretary on key business areas for each 
Board meeting. To ensure that the Directors 
are kept fully informed on the status of the 
business, presentations from across the 
Group’s divisions and functions are made 
to the Board on a regular basis. During the 
year, overviews were presented by each 
member of the Executive Team. The Board 
also received presentations from senior 
managers on commercial and EHS matters 
as well as risks affecting the Group, and 
met with the Group’s broker/NOMAD and 
legal advisers. Other business undertaken 
by the Board during the year includes: 
review of the culture programme 
implemented throughout the Group to 
promote entrepreneurship and value 
creation; approval of the acquisition of 
EuroMed Inc; approval of the annual 
budget; review of governance issues 
affecting the Company; review of the 
corporate structure of the Group; review 
of the manufacturing footprint of the Group; 
succession planning; and assessment of 
the corporate risk map. Where appropriate, 
certain matters were delegated to a 
Committee of the Board.
Governance across the Group
All areas of the Group are required to meet 
high standards of governance and controls. 
The Group’s operations are reviewed by the 
Executive Team through regular reports, 
meetings and presentations. The Group 
Risk & Assurance team performs regular 
audits of governance and control 
standards, reporting its findings to the 
Audit and Risk Committee of the Board.

BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
Composition and independence  
of the Board
During the year under review, the 
composition of the Board varied as a result 
of appointments and retirements but at all 
times the Board comprised a Chairman, at 
least two Executive Directors and at least 
three Non-Executive Directors. Graham 
Hardcastle was appointed as Group 
Finance Director on 1 May 2016 following 
Paul Edwards’ retirement from the post 
and David Blackwood was appointed as an 
independent Non-Executive Director, also 
on 1 May 2016. Mike Buzzacott retired as 
an independent Non-Executive Director  
on 31 May 2016. 
Following the notice of retirement of James 
Wallace at the end of the financial year, 
Larry Pentz was appointed Chairman-
Designate on 3 January 2017 and assumed 
the role of Chairman of the Board and 
Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
with effect from 31 March 2017. Larry is 
currently also Chairman of Victrex plc, 
a position he has held since 2014 and 
he has been on the Victrex Board as 
a Non-Executive Director since 2008.  
Larry was an Executive Director of Johnson 
Matthey plc from 2003 to 2016 and has 
over 30 years’ service within multi-national 
businesses in a variety of operational and 
general management positions. 
The Code requires that at least one-half 
of the Board should be independent 
Non-Executive Directors and this requirement 
has been met throughout the year. All 
Non-Executive Directors are considered by 
the Board to be independent and free from 
any relationship or circumstance that could 
affect independent judgement. 
The Board currently comprises a Non-
Executive Chairman, three Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. 
Their names, biographical details and 
Committee memberships are set out  
on pages 40 and 41 of this report.

44 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 44 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The skills and experience of the Non-
Executive Directors are wide and varied 
and they provide constructive challenge  
in the Boardroom. The composition of  
the Board is intended to ensure that 
its membership represents a mix of 
backgrounds and experience that will 
optimise the quality of deliberations and 
decision-making. We consider diversity in 
the composition to be an important factor 
in the effectiveness of the Board and, in 
searching for prospective Directors, we 
take into account the existing skillset of  
the Board and areas we have identified  
for development to meet future needs  
and address succession planning. 
Board diversity
The Board recognises the importance  
of gender diversity throughout the Group  
and is committed to supporting women in 
achieving positions in senior management. 
Our Executive Team, details of which are 
set out on page 7, currently comprises 
seven positions, two of which are held by 
women. Further information on the total 
female representation in our workforce  
is set out in the Sustainability Report on  
page 34.
We also recognise the importance of a 
Board diverse in all respects and our Board 
comprises members with a wide range of 
experience and backgrounds. The Board 
published a statement on Board diversity, 
which is set out on page 52 of this report 
and also in the Corporate Governance 
section of our website (www.scapa.com/
en/CorporateGovernance). Further 
information on our HR policies is set  
out on page 69. 
Subject to the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Companies Act 2006 and 
satisfactory performance, Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term  
of three years. Before the third and sixth 
anniversaries of appointment, the Director 
discusses with the Board whether it is 
appropriate for him or her to serve a further 
term of three years. The appointment of 
any Non-Executive Director who has 
served more than nine years is subject  
to annual review by the Board. The letters 
of appointment for the Non-Executive 
Directors set out the number of days 
expected to be required to perform their 
duties. Additional time commitments are 
expected from those Non-Executive 
Directors who individually serve as the 
Chairman of any Committee of the Board.
Scapa recognises that Non-Executive 
Directors have other business interests 
outside the Company and that other 
directorships bring benefits to the Board. 
All existing directorships are included in  
the biographical details of the Directors  
on pages 40 and 41. Non-Executive 
Directors are required to obtain approval 
from the Chairman before accepting any 
further appointments.
The Non-Executive Directors meet formally 
without the Executive Directors at least 
once a year, and also meet informally on 
other occasions.
Election/re-election
Larry Pentz was appointed to the Board  
as Non-Executive Chairman-Designate  
on 3 January 2017 and assumed the role  
of Non-Executive Chairman on 31 March 
2017. His appointment will be subject to 
formal approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on  
18 July 2017. The Board has voluntarily 
adopted a policy that all Directors wishing 
to remain in post will propose themselves 
for re-election annually. 
Further information on the appointment  
and replacement of Directors is given in  
the Directors’ Report on page 69.
Conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006, a Director 
must avoid a situation where a direct or 
indirect conflict of interest may occur.  
The Company has in place procedures to 
deal with any situation where a conflict may 
be perceived.
The Nominations Committee annually 
reviews and considers the interests and 
other external appointments held by the 
members of the Board. The Directors have 
a continuing duty to inform the Board of 
any potential conflicts immediately so that 
they may be considered. There is a formal 
register of conflicts in which any authorised 
conflicts of interest would be recorded. 
During the year, none of the Directors 
declared a conflict of interest. 
The Board has specifically considered the 
other appointments of the Directors, details 
of which are included in their biographies 
on pages 40 and 41, and has confirmed 
that each Director is able to devote 
sufficient time to fulfil the duties required  
of them under the terms of their contracts 
or letters of appointment.
Board performance and evaluation
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board has 
established a formal process for the 
rigorous evaluation of the performance of 
the Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors on an annual basis. This year the 
evaluation was conducted by the Chairman 
–designate. Interviews were conducted 
with each Board member using a template 
of topics on a range of matters including 
the balance of skills and experience of  
the Board, independence of Directors, 
diversity, and relations between the 
Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors. Each discussion followed its own 
course with different emphases emerging. 
No questionnaires were employed in this 
evaluation. The outcome was presented to 
the Board and discussed openly and fully 
at the March 2017 Board meeting. The 
overall assessment of the Board and each 
of its Committees and members was that 
the Board continues to function effectively 
to a high standard, with all members 
contributing fully and constructively. A 
consistent message from the evaluation 
was the importance to continue to improve 
our discussions with emphasis on the 
areas of strategic review, succession 
planning and risk management as we  
move into the next year. The Board will  
also consider using a third party external 
reviewer for next year’s Board evaluation. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance of the Executive Directors. 
The Chairman reviews the performance  
of the Non-Executive Directors and Board 
Committees, with the exception of 
Committees chaired by the Chairman.  
The Senior Independent Director reviews 
the performance of the Chairman and 
Committees chaired by the Chairman. 
During the year, the Chairman met with  
the independent Non-Executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors present, 
and the Senior Independent Director met 
with the other Non-Executive Directors 
without the Chairman present.

Induction and training
On appointment, each Director takes part 
in an induction programme through which 
they are provided with comprehensive and 
up-to-date information about the Group 
and its business, the role of the Board and 
the matters reserved for its decision, the 
Terms of Reference and membership of the 
Board and Committees, and the powers 
delegated to those Committees. The 
programme includes meetings with other 
Directors, the Executive Team and senior 
management members. In addition, each 
new Director is provided with guidance 
from the Company Secretary on the 
Group’s corporate governance practices 
and procedures, regulatory obligations 
applicable to the Board and briefings on 
wider responsibilities on areas such as 
Directors’ duties. The induction programme 
is supplemented by visits to key locations 
and meetings with key Senior Executives. 
Throughout their period in office, the 
Directors are updated on the Group’s 
business, the competitive environment, 
corporate social responsibility matters and 
other changes affecting the Group and  
the industrial sectors in which the Group 
operates. The Board tries to visit different 
Group operations each year to help  
extend the breadth and depth of the 
Non-Executive Directors’ understanding  
of the Group’s business.
Training is provided to the Directors, to 
ensure that they are kept up to date with 
corporate governance best practice as well 
as legal and regulatory matters affecting 
the Group.
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
that the Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information. Under direction from 
the Chairman, the Company Secretary 
ensures good information flow which 
includes executive commentaries from the 
Chief Operating Officer, in addition to the 
reports from the Executive Directors and 
Company Secretary which are provided  
in advance of each Board meeting. The 
reports explain issues affecting the Group 
and how the Group’s strategy is being 
implemented through current and future 
activities. The Board is provided with 
sufficient management information and 
reports on a timely basis and receives 
briefings by members of the Executive 
Team and senior management regularly  
to ensure that the Board is fully up-to-date 
with key issues concerning the Group. 
We continue to use the electronic delivery 
system adopted in the fiscal year 2014 for 
Board documentation to be delivered direct 
to the Directors’ electronic devices, which 
facilitates timely and efficient delivery of 
information and Board packs to the 
Directors. This approach also reduces the 
amount of paper used by the Board and 
is in line with our move to use electronic 
communications with shareholders which 
we implemented following the relevant 
approvals at the Annual General Meeting 
held in July 2013. 
Indemnification of Directors
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions, 
as defined in section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006, are in force for the benefit of 
Directors who held office during the year. 
The Company maintains Directors and 
Officers liability insurance for the Group’s 
Directors and Officers.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Financial and business reporting
The Board is responsible for presenting  
a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects. The statement setting out the 
reasons why the Board continues to adopt 
the going concern basis for preparing the 
financial statements is included in the 
Directors’ Report on page 68.
Internal control system 
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks to the 
achievement of Scapa’s strategic objectives 
and this process was in place throughout 
the year under review and up to the date  
on which the Annual Report and Accounts 
were approved. The process accords with 
the Code and is regularly reviewed by the 
Board, through the Audit and Risk 
Committee, whose review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems includes:
• a formal review of the Group’s Risk 
Profile to assess potential risk areas and 
action plans to address these risks
• review of the strategic and annual 
internal audit plan
• review of the external audit strategy  
and plan
• review of the implementation  
of internal audit recommendations
• review of declared financial and 
operational control self-assessments 
against minimum control standards 
across all locations 
• review, on an annual basis, of Group 
policies in relation to whistleblowing, 
anti-bribery and corruption, and 
prevention of fraud
The Board, supported by the Audit 
and Risk Committee, is responsible 
for determining the nature and extent 
of the significant risks that the Group 
is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for maintaining 
sound risk management and internal 
control procedures. 
The Group’s internal control system is 
designed to manage the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, rather than  
to eliminate that risk. Such systems can 
only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement  
or loss. 
During the year there have been no 
significant failings, weaknesses, or any 
material internal control failures that have 
been identified and which require reporting 
in the 2016/17 Annual Report and Accounts.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS
At the Company’s Annual General 
Meetings, all Directors are available to 
respond to questions from shareholders 
present. The Annual General Meeting 
provides a forum for constructive 
communication between the Board and 
shareholders. Throughout the year, the 
Executive Directors, and separately the 
Chairman, meet with investors to discuss 
matters relevant to the Company.

The Audit and Risk Committee (‘the 
Committee’) report for the year ended 
31 March 2017 is set out on the following 
pages 47 to 50. The Committee completed 
its work plan for the year and continuously 
reviewed internal control, risk, accounting 
policies and regulatory guidance. 
There is nothing to bring to your attention 
as a result of the work plan. In summary, 
the Committee considers that it has 
delivered what it set out to do and has a 
clear plan for 2017/18. The Chairman of 
the Committee will be available at the 
Annual General Meeting to respond to 
any questions shareholders may raise 
on any of the Committee’s activities.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The overall aim of the Committee is 
to monitor the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and announcements, 
its accounting processes, and the 
effectiveness of internal controls and risk 
management. The Committee assists 
the Board in fulfilling its responsibility 
to ensure that the Group’s financial 
systems provide accurate and up-to-date 
information on its financial position, and 
supports the Board in its consideration 
as to whether the Group’s published 
financial statements are fair, balanced 
and understandable. 
COMPOSITION
The Board nominated David Blackwood 
as Chairman of the Committee with effect 
from 1 June 2016, having joined the

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
46 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 47 46 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
In order to discharge its responsibilities, 
during the year, the Committee has 
undertaken the following activities:
Financial statements and reports
• Reviewed and discussed changes 
to the UK Corporate Governance 
framework and its impact on 
reporting requirements 
• Reviewed the interim accounts and 
related statements and discussed:
 – key accounting judgements
 – Income Statement for the half year, 
specifically revenue, trading profit 
and foreign exchange
• Reviewed and considered the 
significant issues in relation to the 
financial statements and how these 
have been addressed, including:
 – Viability statement – The 2014 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
provision C.2.2 has set out a 
requirement for the Directors to 
explain in the Annual Report how 
they have assessed the prospects of 
the Company, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate. The 
Committee reviews the analysis 
undertaken in relation to strategic 
risk management and risk 
assessment, risk appetite, internal 
control, risk and control reporting 
structure and the principal risks 
identified on an ongoing basis. 
This monitoring and review informs 
the draft statement which is 
documented annually.
 – Pension liabilities – The Group has 
a material defined benefit pension 
scheme deficit in the UK and smaller 
schemes in the US and Europe. 
Small changes to the assumptions 
used to value the retirement benefit 
obligations can have a significant 
impact on the financial position of 
the Group. The Committee reviews 
the assumptions put forward by the 
actuaries and reviews their 
reasonableness. The Committee 
reviews the assumptions by 
comparison to external benchmark 
data and also considers the 
adequacy of disclosures in respect 
of the sensitivity of the deficit to 
changes in these key assumptions. 
 – Inventory valuation – Inventory is a 
significant item on the Balance Sheet 
and therefore exposes the Group to 
risks around valuation and existence. 
The Committee reviews the year end 
reports on inventory with particular 
focus on the level of provisioning and 
the results from the annual stock-
takes. The Committee reviews the 
analysis of stock write-offs throughout 
the year. 
 – Exceptional items – The Committee 
received reports and challenged 
the basis and completeness of 
information. In particular, the 
Committee considered the nature of 
the items and determined whether 
separate disclosure was appropriate 
or not. The Committee discussed with 
management the key judgements 
behind all the exceptional items and 
agreed with their recommendations.
 – Acquisition and fair value 
accounting – Valuing and assessing 
the assets procured as part of the 
acquisition of EuroMed Inc involves 
assumptions around the values and 
cash flows of both tangible and 
intangible assets. The Committee 
reviewed the fair value assumptions 
and discussed the reasonableness of 
the conclusions with senior 
management and the auditors.
 – Carrying value of goodwill, 
intangible and fixed assets –  
The Committee receives an annual 
update on the impairment reviews 
based on the recoverability 
determined on a value in use basis  
on each cash-generating unit (CGU) 
using the management approved  
forecasts for each CGU within the 
Group.
• Reviewed the Annual Report and related 
statements and auditor’s report for 
2016/17 to ensure that the report is fair, 
balanced and understandable
External audit
• Monitored and ensured the 
independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor 
• Reviewed and approved the external

• Reviewed and approved the scope 
and methodology of the external audit 
strategy for 2016/17
• Reviewed the performance of the 
external auditor and considered the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP as 
auditor for 2016/17 and recommended 
their re-appointment to the Board
Internal audit

and annual internal audit plan

including the co-source provision 
and associated costs

of compliance with the Group’s 
processes to prevent and detect 
bribery and corruption

and the ongoing development and 
implementation of action plans to 
mitigate these risks
• Reported to the Board on how it 
has discharged its responsibilities

insurance coverage
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
48 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF 48 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Others who are invited to attend meetings 
of the Committee:
• External Audit – Deloitte LLP
• Head of Group Risk & Assurance
• Group Chief Executive
• Group Finance Director
• Group Financial Controller
The Committee’s full Terms of Reference 
can be found in the Group Corporate 
Governance section of the Company’s 
website (www.scapa.com/en/
CorporateGovernance). 
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are 
reviewed annually. This year’s review was 
conducted in line with the Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
(ICSA) guidance to reflect the UK 
Governance Code. 
In summary, the Committee is required to:
• oversee and advise the Board on the 
current risk exposures of the Company 
and related future risk strategies
• oversee the activities of internal audit
• review internal control policies and 
procedures for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of material 
financial and non-financial risks

of risk limits and the adequacy of 
proposed actions
• review the Group’s procedures for 
detecting fraud
• review the Group’s procedures for the 
prevention of bribery and corruption

ensuring that appropriate arrangements 
are in place to enable employees to 
raise matters of possible impropriety 
in confidence (the Scapa Open 
Door Policy)
• review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
financial reporting
EXTERNAL AUDIT
Effectiveness
To assess the effectiveness of our external 
auditor, a formal performance review is 
undertaken on an annual basis to identify 
the adequacy of their approach to the 
following:
Audit staffing – it is important that the 
external auditor has achieved the right 
balance of audit team resource. While they 
should be providing team continuity and 
knowledge, they should also be providing 
a fresh perspective through new team 
members to enable the current audit 
processes and accounting policies to be 
challenged.
Effective communication – is key to 
obtaining the highest quality audit service 
from our external auditor and includes:
• communicating key audit judgements 
at the earliest opportunity to promote 
discussion and challenge between 
themselves and management
• informing Scapa of audit issues as they 
arise, so that these can be dealt with 
in a timely manner
• in-year communication regarding good 
practice, changes to reporting 
requirements and accounting standards 
to enable Scapa to be prepared prior to 
year end
• timely provision of Audit and Risk 
Committee papers to enable adequate 
management review and feedback
• quality of the reports and publications 
provided by the external auditor in terms 
of content, relevance and presentation
Scoping and planning – specifically 
relating to the year end audit work:
• consultation with stakeholders including 
Group and local finance teams, local 
warehouse teams, Group Risk & 
Assurance and the Audit and 
Risk Committee
• timely provision of the external audit 
strategy and timetable to stakeholders
• transparency in the communication and 
management of changes to the external 
audit plan and related timings
Fees – are transparent and communicated 
prior to the commencement of any work 
undertaken. Where variations occur, these 
are informed at the earliest opportunity 
to enable dialogue and negotiation to 
be undertaken.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Responsibilities
Internal audit at Scapa is managed and 
delivered by the Group Risk & Assurance 
team. Against an agreed mandate, this 
function performs independent internal 
audits and facilitates standardised and 
structured risk assessment across the 
Group. Specialist internal audits are 
conducted by experts (in-house and 
outsourced) under the direction and 
management of the Head of Group 
Risk & Assurance. 
In line with the Group’s Internal Audit 
Charter, a three-year internal audit strategy 
and an annual internal audit plan are 
approved by the Committee each year. 
These target the most significant areas of 
risk to provide assurance that key controls 
are effectively designed and consistently 
operated. Audit reports are produced to 
convey the extent of control assurance 
derived from the formal testing of controls. 
In providing independent good practice 
guidance, the Group Risk & Assurance 
team assists the business in the continuous 
improvement of controls and procedures. 
Yearly summary reports are presented by 
the Group Risk & Assurance team to the 
Committee to convey:
• an up-to-date view of the Group’s 
risk profile
• details of internal audits undertaken 
during the period
• an overall assessment of the Group’s 
control environment
• the status of management actions arising 
from the risk management and internal 
assurance processes
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
48 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 49 48 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
The Head of Group Risk & Assurance 
is accountable to the Committee and has 
access to the Committee and its Chairman 
at any time during the year. As a matter 
of course, the Head of Group Risk & 
Assurance meets with the Chairman of the 
Committee independently of management.
The Group Risk & Assurance team has no 
operational responsibility or authority over 
any of the activities it has reviewed during 
the year, nor has the team designed the 
control frameworks in place. For a period 
of four months during the year, as part 
of a role transition, the Head of Group 
Risk & Assurance held some operational 
responsibility over our French site. 
However, all risk work for the site was 
independently reviewed and there was no 
conflict of interest during this period. The 
Group Risk & Assurance team members 
do not hold shares in the Company. This 
ensures that the team is sufficiently 
objective and independent of the areas 
under review to avoid prejudice and 
conflicts of interest.
EXTERNAL AUDIT GOVERNANCE
Auditor independence
The Committee continues to monitor 
the external auditor’s compliance with 
applicable ethical guidance and guidelines 
and considers the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor as part 
of the Committee’s duties. The Committee 
received and reviewed written confirmation 
from the external auditor on all relationships 
that, in their judgement, may bear on their 
independence. The external auditor 
has also confirmed that they consider 
themselves independent within the 
meaning of UK regulatory and 
professional requirements.
In all services purchased, the Group 
selects the provider best placed to deliver 
the work in terms of quality and cost. As 
a general principle the external auditor is 
excluded from consultancy work and other 
non-audit work. However, there may be 
occasions when it is appropriate to use our 
external auditor for non-audit services and 
this will be reviewed on an individual basis 
and allocated according to merit.
The external auditor may be appointed to 
provide non-audit services where it is in the 
Group’s best interests to do so, provided a 
number of criteria are met. These are that 
the external auditor does not:
• audit their own work
• make management decisions 
for the Group
• create a conflict of interest
• find themselves in the role 
of an advocate for the Group
Non-audit services for up to £10,000, 
which comply with the above criteria, 
may be provided by the external auditor 
with authorisation in advance by the 
Group Finance Director. 
All projects where forecasted expenditure 
exceeded £10,000 were approved by the 
Audit and Risk Committee.
Tendering policy and review 
of auditor effectiveness
Deloitte LLP was appointed as the Group’s 
external auditor in 2011 after a competitive 
tendering exercise and has been the 
Group’s external auditor for six financial 
years. Following the completion of five 
years as audit partner, a smooth transition 
to a new engagement partner, Christopher 
Robertson, took place in 2016/17.
Following the positive outcome of a 
performance and effectiveness evaluation 
undertaken by the management, the 
Committee concluded that it was 
appropriate to recommend to the Board 
the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Group’s external auditor for the next 
financial year.

appropriate for the Company. The Policy 
is set out below and a copy is located in  
the Group Corporate Governance 
section on the Company’s website 
www.scapa.com/en/
CorporateGovernance)
Following recommendation by the 
Committee, all Directors submit 
themselves for election or re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting following 
their appointment and annually thereafter.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
During the year under review, the 
Committee focused on Board succession 
and composition. Following Mike 
Buzzacott’s decision to retire as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 
31 May 2016, a formal and extensive 
recruitment process was undertaken with 
an independent executive search firm to 
identify a potential successor for the role. 
Following a rigorous selection process, 
David Blackwood was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 
1 May 2016 and assumed Chairmanship 
of the Audit and Risk Committee with 
effect from 1 June 2016.
In addition, following James Wallace’s 
decision to retire as Non-Executive 
Chairman with effect from 31 March 2017, 
a formal extensive search was again 
undertaken with an independent executive 
search firm to identify his successor. 
Following a thorough review of potential 
candidates, Larry Pentz was appointed 
as Non-Executive Chairman-Designate 
with effect from 3 January 2017 and was 
appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Board and Chairman of the Nominations 
Committee with effect from 31 March 2017.
In the coming year the Committee will 
continue to monitor the composition and 
effectiveness of the Board and Committees 
of the Company, and keep abreast of 
developments in corporate governance 
to ensure that we continue to act in 
accordance with good governance practice.
BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY
The Board recognises the importance 
of diversity in its broadest sense in the 
Boardroom as an essential element in 
maintaining Board effectiveness and a 
competitive advantage.
Diversity of skills, background, knowledge, 
international and industry experience, and 
gender will be taken into consideration 
when seeking to make new appointments 
to the Board and its Committees. All 
appointments will be made on merit, 
taking into account suitability for the role, 
composition and balance of the Board 
to ensure that the Company has the 
appropriate mix of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge. 
The Board will consider suitably qualified 
applicants for Non-Executive Director roles 
from as wide a range as possible, with 
no restrictions on age, gender, religion, 
ethnic background or current executive 
employment, but whose competencies 
and knowledge will enhance the Board. 
Independence and the ability to fulfil time 
commitments required will also be taken 
into account.
The Board will ensure that procedures are 
in place for orderly succession to the Board 
so as to maintain the correct balance and 
to ensure ongoing progression.

CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
REPORT OF THE  
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
This report sets out the activities 
of the Remuneration Committee 
(‘the Committee’) for the year ended 
31 March 2017. The report sets out the 
remuneration policy and remuneration 
details for Scapa’s Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, and has been 
prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 
of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended 
in August 2013, which the Company has 
voluntarily chosen to follow.
The information provided in this part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report is  
not subject to audit.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 March 2017.
OUR STRATEGY
Our continued success has been shaped 
by maintaining a disciplined approach in 
executing our strategy to create a balanced 
portfolio of businesses in our chosen 
markets of Healthcare and Industrial, 
develop and leverage strategic relationships 
with companies who are global market 
leaders, expand scale and scope through 
acquisitions and continue to focus on 
efficiency improvement and cost control.
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION 
AND LINK TO STRATEGY
In 2014, we voluntarily sought and obtained 
shareholder approval for the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, which is clearly 
focused on rewarding superior and 
sustained performance. It is our belief that 
executives should be rewarded on the 
basis of their individual performance and 
the value created for shareholders. Variable 
elements of pay are therefore focused on 
simple and transparent measures of key 
strategic objectives, operating profit, 
EPS growth and sustainable growth in 
shareholder value. Bonus and long-term 
incentive scheme targets are purposely 
designed to be challenging and drive the 
long-term success of the Group. 
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES  
OF 2017
Full details of the remuneration decisions 
for 2017 are set out in the Directors’ 
Annual Remuneration Report on pages 
61 to 67. The Group reported very 
pleasing results, achieving £29.2m 
trading profit on revenue of £279.6m, 
and continuing year-on-year growth since 
2010 under the direction of Heejae Chae 
and the Executive Team. Trading profit 
margin improved to 10.4% and adjusted 
EPS increased to 14.8p.
The Committee agreed to increase the 
salary of the Chief Executive to £440,000  
(a 9.2% increase) with effect from  
1 January 2017. The Committee is fully 
aware that general investor expectation  
is for any salary increases for Executive 
Directors to be limited and to use the 
overall increase for all employees as 
a reference point. This is the typical 
approach we have taken in the past 
in respect of our Executive Directors. 
However, the Committee felt it was 
important to recognise the very strong 
performance of the Group over 2016/17 
as well as preceding years and the impact 
this has had on the value created for 
shareholders, as outlined above.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
53 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 53 REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
The annual bonus targets for the Executive 
Directors and Executive Team were set by 
the Committee at the beginning of the 
financial year. The targets were met and the 
Executive Directors will receive an annual 
bonus equivalent to 100% of salary for 2017. 
The Committee has also reviewed the 
Company’s EPS growth over the three-year 
period ended 31 March 2017 to establish 
whether the performance criteria for vesting 
of awards made under the Company’s 
Performance Share Plan in 2014 had been 
achieved. The adjusted EPS growth over 
the three-year performance measurement 
period exceeded the target for 100% 
vesting and the awards will vest in full. 
The Company’s share price over the 
three-year measurement period rose  
from 116.25p to 353.75p and market 
capitalisation grew from £170.6m to 
£538.9m, with £6.3m returned to 
shareholders by way of dividends.
MEETING FREQUENCY 
AND ATTENDANCE
The Committee meets formally at 
least three times each year, with other 
meetings taking place on an ad hoc 
basis as required. Only members of 
the Committee have the right to attend 
Committee meetings. However, other 
individuals such as the Chief Executive, the 
Head of Human Resources and external 
advisers may be invited to attend for all or 
part of any meetings, as and when 
appropriate and necessary.

TRANSPARENCY IN DISCLOSURE
The Committee seeks to operate 
in a clear and transparent manner 
and to demonstrate good practice 
in executive remuneration.
The Committee’s report comprises three 
sections, namely:
• This statement, which sets out a 
summary of and explains the major 
decisions on Directors’ remuneration
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy,  
for shareholder approval at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting
• The Directors’ Annual Remuneration 
Report, which provides details on 
how the Policy will operate in the 
forthcoming year and states the 
remuneration earned by the Directors 
in the year to 31 March 2017
Although, as an AIM listed Company, 
Scapa is not required to have a Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (“Policy”) the 
Company introduced a policy which  
was approved by 99.75% of shareholders 
at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
Consequently after three years under  
the current arrangements, Scapa will be 
submitting its Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy for shareholder approval at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting. The Committee 
has been reviewing the Policy which now 
includes the Value Creation Plan approved 
by shareholders at a General Meeting on 
16 November 2015, to help ensure it 
remains fit-for-purpose for the next three 
years and continues to reinforce delivery 
of the business strategy and to ensure it 
promotes motivation and retention of high 
quality executives who are key to delivering 
continued sustainable profitable growth 
and value creation for shareholders. In 
reviewing the Policy, the Committee 
have also taken into account institutional 
investor guidance and developments in 
remuneration governance and in market 
practice, as well as any shareholder views 
expressed during dialogue. The Committee 
believes the Policy continues to be 
appropriate and is therefore proposing the 
Policy remains broadly unchanged. The 
Board will treat the shareholder vote as 
binding, notwithstanding that as an 
AIM-listed company Scapa is not required 
to put the Policy to a binding vote.
The Directors’ Annual Remuneration 
Report will be subject to an advisory  
vote by shareholders at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting.
ENGAGEMENT WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS
Scapa’s updated Remuneration Policy 
was circulated to major shareholders for 
feedback on 18 April 2017. We welcome 
shareholder engagement and take account 
of such views when considering both policy 
development and reward outcomes.

PROPOSED REMUNERATION POLICY
The table below sets out the proposed 
remuneration policy to be put to 
shareholders for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 18 July 2017.
REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES FOR 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The main principles of the senior executive 
remuneration policy are set out below:
• Attract and retain high calibre executives 
in a competitive international market, 
and remunerate executives fairly and 
responsibly
• Motivate delivery of our key business 
strategies and encourage a strong 
performance-oriented culture
• Reward achievement of stretching 
targets over the short and long-term
• Support both near-term and long-term 
success and sustainable shareholder 
value
• Align the business strategy and 
achievement of planned business 
objectives
• Be compatible with the Company’s 
risk policies and systems
• Ensure that a significant proportion of 
remuneration is performance-related
• Link maximum payout to outstanding 
performance
• Take into consideration the views 
of shareholders and best practice 
guidelines, as they apply to Scapa, 
taking into account its AIM listing
Fixed remuneration comprises salary, 
pension contribution and benefits. Variable 
pay includes annual bonus, LTIP awards 
and the Value Creation Plan. Together, fixed 
and variable remuneration comprise total 
remuneration for the Executive Directors. 
The Committee recognises that it may be 
necessary on occasion to use its discretion 
to make remuneration decisions outside 
the standard remuneration policy, such as 
agreeing a sign-on payment, to attract 
and retain particular individuals. 
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
PURPOSE OPERATION MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
SALARY

of senior executive required to 
support the long-term success 
of the business.

• increases given to all Scapa 
employees

performance of the individual 
is considered by the Committee 
when setting and reviewing 
salaries annually.
PENSION
Provide a market competitive 
level of pension provision and 
allow Executive Directors to 
build long-term retirement 
savings.
Defined contribution based on 
a percentage of salary. The rate 
of contribution for Executive 
Directors exceeds the rates 
for the broader employee 
population; this reflects market 
practice for senior executives.
The rate of contribution for 
any new Executive Director 
is benchmarked at the date 
of appointment. 
Directors may elect to take all 
or part of their pension 
contribution as a cash 
supplement.

Protect against risks and 
provide other benefits reflecting 
the international aspects of 
Executive Directors’ roles.
Current benefits include a car 
allowance paid monthly, private 
medical insurance in the UK, 
permanent health insurance 
and life assurance cover. 
Other benefits may be paid 
if the Committee considers 
it appropriate.
The Chief Executive 
participates in a US 
contributory private medical 
insurance plan.
Set at a level which the 
Remuneration Committee 
considers is appropriate taking 
into account comparable roles 
in companies of a similar size 
and complexity, and provides a 
sufficient level of benefit based 
on the role.
None.
ANNUAL BONUS
Provide a direct link between 
measurable individual 
performance and rewards. 
Encourage the achievement 
of outstanding results aligned 
to the business strategy and 
achievement of planned 
business objectives.
Individual bonus decisions are 
based on Executive Directors’ 
performance during the year, 
measured against Group and 
personal objectives. 
Performance measures may 
include both quantitative and 
qualitative, and both financial 
and non-financial.
Bonus awards are made 
by the Committee following 
discussions with the Chairman 
(for the Chief Executive’s bonus) 
and the Chief Executive (for the 
Group Finance Director’s bonus).
Bonus awards are paid in cash 
or, at the discretion of the 
Committee, as a combination 
of cash and shares, after the 
results of the Group are audited. 
The Committee may elect to 
satisfy a part of the bonus in 
shares and match the number 
of shares received. Any shares 
issued in satisfaction of bonus 
shall be held for a minimum 
period as the Remuneration 
Committee specifies.
The value of any annual bonus 
is limited to a percentage 
of salary. 
The current maximum 
percentage is 150% for both 
the Chief Executive and the 
Group Finance Director if 
exceptional outperformance 
of targets is achieved.
Performance is assessed using 
specific metrics set by the 
Remuneration Committee, 
which may include Group 
Trading Profit improvement. 
The measures and targets are 
set by the Committee each 
year. The measures that apply 
are set out in the relevant 
Directors’ Annual Remuneration 
Report. Measures for future 
years will be described in the 
Directors’ Annual Remuneration 
Report for the relevant year.

PURPOSE OPERATION MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
LONG‑TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARD
Reward execution of Scapa’s 
strategy and growth in 
shareholder value over a 
multiple-year period.
Long-term performance 
measurement discourages 
excessive risk-taking and 
inappropriate short-term 
behaviours, and encourages 
Executive Directors and Senior 
Executives to take a long-term 
view by aligning their interests 
with those of shareholders.
The LTIP is designed to 
retain Executive Directors 
and Senior Executives over 
the performance period of 
the awards.
LTIP awards are made by the 
Committee following discussion 
of recommendations made 
by the Chairman (for the Chief 
Executive’s award) and the 
Chief Executive (for the Group 
Finance Director’s and Senior 
Executives’ awards).
Achievement of stretching 
performance measures 
determines whether and to what 
extent LTIP awards will vest.
Awards vest three years after 
the date of the award, subject 
to achievement of performance 
criteria. At vesting, the LTIP 
awards are satisfied in 
Scapa shares.
Awards will typically lapse on 
termination of employment, 
although the Committee may 
determine that awards may 
vest after termination of 
employment, in accordance with 
the plan rules and taking into 
account performance during 
the date of grant and date of 
termination of employment.
In the event of a change of 
control of the Company, awards 
shall vest and be exercisable.
Awards are made as a 
percentage of salary up to 
a maximum of 200%. In the 
absence of exceptional 
circumstances which the 
Committee considers warrant 
additional levels of award, the 
PSP awards will be granted at 
not more than 100% of salary 
each year. 
The Committee has discretion 
to award additional shares 
(or equivalent cash amount) 
to reflect the value of dividend 
paid on some or all of the 
shares vesting up to the end 
of the performance period.
Performance is assessed 
against delivery of long-term 
financial performance. Existing 
awards vest against growth in 
EPS. Alternative or additional 
criteria may be used to 
determine future rewards.
VALUE CREATION PLAN
Reward the Executive 
Directors and other Senior 
Executives to create 
exceptional and sustainable 
increases in shareholder value 
during the five-year period to 
31 March 2020.
Awards are made by the 
Committee to the Executive 
Directors and Executive Team.
Awards may vest before March 
2020 in certain circumstances in 
accordance with the rules of the 
VCP in the event of a change of 
control, other relevant corporate 
event or in certain ‘good leaver’ 
circumstances. 
The Committee has discretion 
to operate the VCP in 
accordance with its rules as 
approved by shareholders. 
Participants will share 5% of 
the increase in value created 
for shareholders above a share 
price of £1.95 up to a share 
price of £5.00.
The Committee has discretion 
to award additional shares 
(or an equivalent cash amount) 
to reflect the value of dividends 
paid on some or all of the 
vested shares up until the 
release date. 
Share price growth, 
measured on 31 March 2018 
and 31 March 2020 using 
the average closing price in 
the 30 days ending on the 
Measurement Date. Where an 
award vests early as a result 
of a change of control, other 
relevant corporate event or in 
‘good leaver’ circumstances, 
the growth in share price will 
be measured in accordance 
with the VCP rules.

SAYE SCHEME
Reward execution of Scapa’s 
strategy and growth in 
shareholder value over a 
multiple-year period.
UK employees are eligible 
to join this savings related 
share option scheme, which 
is an HM Revenue and 
Customs tax favoured scheme. 
The Company grants each 
participant an option to 
subscribe for Scapa shares at 
an option price per share which 
is set at the commencement

is at a discount to the market 
price on the date of grant.
On a change of control of 
the Company, options shall 
be exercisable.
Participation limits are set by 
HM Revenue and Customs. 
Although the participation limit 
on SAYE schemes has been 
increased to £500 per month, 
the limit applicable to the 
current Scapa SAYE scheme 
is £250 per month. 
The Committee may adjust 
the maximum to reflect HMRC 
saving limits.
None.
CHAIRMAN AND NON‑EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
Provide an appropriate reward 
to attract and retain high calibre 
individuals.
Neither the Chairman nor any 
of the Non-Executive Directors 
are entitled to a bonus or 
benefits and their fees are not 
performance related.
The fee for the Chairman 
reflects the level of commitment 
and responsibility of the role. 
The fee is paid monthly in 
cash and is inclusive of all 
Committee roles. 
Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees are set at a level which 
ensures that the Company can 
attract and retain individuals 
with the required skills, 
experience and knowledge 
to enable the Board effectively 
to carry out its duties. 
Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration comprises a base 
fee together with an additional 
fee for chairing one or more 
Board Committees and a 
further fee for the role of 
Senior Independent Director. 
The Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are entitled 
to reimbursement of reasonable 
expenses.
Set at a level which reflects the 
commitment and contribution 
expected from the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors, 
and is appropriately positioned 
against comparable roles in 
companies of a similar size 
and complexity. Fees are 
benchmarked externally from 
time to time, as appropriate.
Actual fee levels are disclosed 
in the Directors’ Annual 
Remuneration Report for the 
relevant financial year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
58 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 59 58 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION 
ARRANGEMENTS
When recruiting a new Executive Director, 
whether from within the organisation or 
externally, the Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors to ensure 
that remuneration arrangements are in the 
best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders without paying more than is 
necessary to recruit an executive of the 
required calibre. The Committee will seek 
to align the remuneration package offered 
with the remuneration policy outlined 
above, but retains discretion to make 
proposals on hiring which are outside the 
standard policy. The Committee may make 
awards on appointing an Executive Director 
to compensate for remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving the 
previous employer. In doing so, the 
Committee will consider all factors relevant 
to the forfeited arrangements, such as the 
nature of the remuneration forfeited, any 
performance conditions and time periods 
over which they would have vested, and 
any compensatory awards will be on a 
comparable basis.
DIRECTOR SHAREHOLDING 
GUIDELINES
All Executive Directors are expected to 
build up over a reasonable period from 
appointment, and hold, a minimum level of 
shareholding in the Company equal to one 
year’s salary. Non-Executive Directors are 
expected to build up and hold a material 
level of shareholding within a reasonable 
period of appointment. This is considered 
an effective way to align the interests of 
the Directors and shareholders over the 
long term. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE 
CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION 
PAYMENTS
Scapa’s Executive Director service 
contracts entitle the Executive Directors 
to the fixed elements of remuneration and 
to consideration for variable remuneration 
each year. The contracts are terminable by 
the Company on not more than 12 months’ 
written notice. The Company may terminate 
an Executive Director’s contract 
immediately with payments in lieu of notice 
of between six to 12 months’ salary plus 
contractual entitlements. There are no 
express provisions for compensation 
payable on early termination of an 
Executive Director’s contract as at the date 
of termination other than as set out above 
and any awards made may be pro-rated 
for time and performance and payable on 
the usual payment dates The Committee 
will seek to mitigate the cost to the 
Company while dealing fairly with each 
individual case. The Company may 
contribute to the reasonable legal fees 
of a Director in relation to any agreement 
to cease employment. 
It is the policy of the Company that all 
executive appointments to the Board will 
have contract notice periods no longer 
than 12 months. 
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
It is the policy of the Company, which is 
reflected in the contract of employment, 
that no Executive Director may accept any 
Non-Executive directorships or other 
appointments without the prior approval of 
the Board. Any outside appointments are 
considered by the Nominations Committee 
or the Board to ensure that they would 
not give rise to a conflict of interest. It is 
the Company’s policy that remuneration 
earned from any such appointment 
may be retained by the individual 
Executive Director.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE 
CHAIRMAN AND NON‑EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS 
The Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed under a letter of 
appointment for an initial term of three 
years, subject to earlier termination by 
either party upon written notice. In each 
case, the letter of appointment may be 
extended by mutual consent. The 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
are not contractually entitled to termination 
payments. The letters of appointment cover 
such matters as duties, time commitment 
and other business interests. 
The Remuneration Committee determines 
the remuneration for the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors within the 
limits set in the Company’s Articles 
of Association.
The fee for the Chairman’s role takes into 
account the time commitment required 
for the role, the skills and experience 
of the individual and market practice in 
comparable companies. The Chairman’s 
fee is currently set at £125,000 per annum. 
The Non-Executive Director fees policy is 
to pay a basic fee for membership of the 
Board, with additional fees for the Senior 
Independent Director and chairmanship 
of a Committee to take into account 
the additional responsibilities and time 
commitments of these roles. The Non-
Executive Directors’ fee structure was 
reviewed during the year by the Board 
and no changes were proposed. The fee 
structure, with effect from 1 May 2017, 
remains as follows:
• Basic fee – £40,000 
• Committee Chairman fee – £5,000
• Senior Independent Director fee –

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR SINGLE FIGURE FOR TOTAL REMUNERATION TO 31 MARCH 2017
Salary
The Chief Executive’s salary from 1 April to 31 December 2016 was £402,900 (on an annualised basis) and was increased by 9.2% to 
£440,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017, reflecting the continued success of the development of the Group and his track 
record in the role. The Committee is fully aware that general investor expectation is for any salary increases for Executive Directors to be 
limited and to use the overall increase for all employees as a reference point. This is the typical approach we have taken in the past in 
respect of our Executive Directors. However, the Committee felt it was important to recognise the very strong performance of the Group 
over 2016 and prior years and the impact this has had on the value created for shareholders.
The Group Finance Director joined the business on 1 February 2016 and assumed his role on 1 May 2016 following the retirement of the 
previous incumbent. His commencement salary of £245,000 on an annualised basis remains unchanged as he was not eligible to receive 
a salary review in the year under review. 
Pension contributions
The Company pays contributions to the nominated personal pension plans of the Executive Directors, or makes a cash in lieu 
supplement, in each case at a rate equal to 20% of salary. 
Annual performance bonus
The 2017 bonus for the Executive Directors was based on growth in the Group’s trading profit measured against prior year and achievement 
of a cash target. The actual target range has not been disclosed, as the Board considers this to be commercially sensitive information. The 
maximum potential payout for the Group trading profit measure is 150% and 100% for the cash measure. A 50% payout occurs at the entry 
point of the target. The actual bonus awarded to each Executive Director was 100% of target bonus for the year.

LONG‑TERM INCENTIVES
Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The Company adopted a PSP in 2004, which was replaced in 2011 by a new PSP adopted by the Company at the Annual General 
Meeting. During the year, Mr Chae exercised 400,000 vested options under the 2004 PSP, having exercised his option over 100,000 
shares in December 2012. All awards under the 2004 PSP have now been exercised or have lapsed. Since 2011, all PSP awards have 
been made under the 2011 PSP.
PSP is a long-term incentive for Executive Directors, the Executive Team and key members of the Leadership Team. It is designed to 
encourage participants to deliver sustained profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value. The policy of granting awards based on 
up to 100% of salary is expected to be applied to the awards to the Executive Directors and other participants in the PSP for the financial 
year ended 31 March 2017. The single performance criterion used in the PSP is trading EPS, which the Committee believes is a fair 
and appropriate condition for rewarding participants as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders and, being measured over 
a three-year period, aligns the reward with the Company’s strategy for growth by encouraging longer-term profitable growth. When 
determining the trading EPS growth, the impact of material acquisitions, disposals and changes in the issued share capital will be 
disregarded to ensure that they do not artificially affect the EPS measurement.
Awards granted in 2014 (audited information)
The PSP award in 2014 was based on adjusted EPS growth over the three-year period ending 31 March 2017. The adjusted EPS in 
March 2014 was 7.2p. The table below sets out achievement against targets for the EPS measure: 
EPS target (p) Award vesting (%) Adjusted EPS achieved (p)
Resulting level of award  
(% of maximum opportunity)
3 year RPI +40% 100% 14.8p 100%
Total shareholder returns (three years)
The Company’s share price over the three-year measurement period rose from 116.25p to 353.75p and market capitalisation grew from 
£170.6m to £538.9m, with £6.3m returned to shareholders by way of dividend.

The value of the PSP awards, based on the market price of the Company’s shares on the day prior to the date of grant, does not exceed 
100% of the base salary of the participant to whom the award has been made.
Value Creation Plan
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, together with the Executive Team, participate in the Scapa Group plc 2015 Value 
Creation Plan which was approved by shareholders in General Meeting on 16 November 2015 (‘the Plan’). The Plan is intended to directly 
align Senior Executives’ interests with those of shareholders by connecting remuneration specifically with shareholder value. Entitlements 
under the Plan were awarded in February 2016 and are set out below. The Plan includes an overall cap on the value of Company shares 
that can be delivered, as well as an ‘off-set’ mechanism whereby any shares that may be delivered under the Plan are reduced by the 
value of any shares that vest pursuant to awards made under the PSP in the financial years ending 31 March 2016, 2017 and 2018. 
The Plan will reward participants for creating value through growth in the Company’s share price in excess of £1.95 and up to £5.00 per 
share, measured on 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2020 (each a ‘Measurement Date’) and subject to gateway share price targets of £3.00 
on the first Measurement Date and £4.00 on the second Measurement Date. If the gateway target is not met on the first Measurement 
Date, none of the awards will vest unless and until the gateway target of £4.00 is achieved on the second Measurement Date. For the 
purposes of the Plan, the share price on each Measurement Date will be the average closing price of the Company’s shares over the 
30-day period commencing on the Measurement Date. Awards vested in respect of the first Measurement Date are subject to a 
24-month holding period.
The maximum pool available to participants is 5% of the value created above a share price of £1.95 up to a share price of £5.00. 
Assuming there were no changes to the number of shares in issue during the life of the Plan (150,033,428 at 31 March 2016), if the share 
price increases to £5.00 or above, the Plan would pay out a maximum of approximately £22.9m ((150 million shares x 5%) x (£5.00 – 
£1.95)). The aggregate number of shares in respect of which awards would crystallise at that time would therefore be 4.6 million shares. 
The Group Chief Executive, who has been granted a 40% participation, would hold an option to acquire 1.8 million shares and the Group 
Finance Director, who has been granted a 20% participation, would hold an option to acquire 0.9 million shares. These options would 
be reduced by the value of awards vested under the PSP, as described above.
No further awards were granted in 2017.
Dilution limits
The Company’s share plans are subject to dilution limits approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2009 Annual General Meeting, that 
overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital. On the 
assumption that all outstanding awards vest and will be exercised, and including all exercised awards as at 31 March 2017, the Company 
will have utilised 9.6% of the 10% in the ten years.

CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE COMPARED TO GROUP EMPLOYEES
The table below sets out the increase in remuneration of the Chief Executive and that of the Leadership Team, which comprises 25 
employees (excluding new starters during the year):
Percentage change in remuneration in 2016 compared with remuneration in 2017

Benefits 0.3% –
Annual bonus 3.8% 13.7%
Total remuneration* 3.7% 9.0%
* Excludes share-based payments and share price incentives as these do not permit fair comparison with the Leadership Team
The Committee has selected the Leadership Team as the most relevant comparator group, taking into account the structure of 
remuneration and ability of the Leadership Team to earn a bonus in addition to receiving a base salary.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURNS (EIGHT YEARS) 
The graph below shows the Company’s total shareholder returns (TSR) compared to the FTSE AIM All Share Index over the last eight 
years. TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends. The Directors consider the FTSE AIM All Share Index to be the 
most appropriate index against which the TSR of the Company should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies 
to Scapa Group plc.

OTHER DISCLOSURES
Pages 68 to 70 inclusive (together with 
sections of the Annual Report incorporated 
by reference) constitute a Directors’ Report 
that has been drawn up and presented 
in accordance with applicable English 
company law and the liabilities of the 
Directors in connection with that report are 
subject to the limitations and restrictions 
provided by that law.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND 
BUSINESS REVIEW
Scapa Group plc is the holding company 
for a global group of companies operating 
in the manufacture of bonding products 
and adhesive components for applications 
in the healthcare and industrial markets.  
A review of the performance and future 
development of the Group’s business is 
contained on pages 1 to 37 and forms part 
of this report.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
Trading profit was £29.2m (2016: £21.3m), 
an increase of £7.9m. Exceptional charges 
in the year were £1.0m (2016: £6.6m). No 
interim dividend was paid to shareholders 
(2016: £Nil). The Directors recommend 
payment of a final dividend of 2.0p  
(2016: 1.75p).
A profit before tax of £21.8m (2016: £9.8m) 
was recorded for the year ended 31 March 
2017, with basic and diluted earnings per 
share of 11.6p and 11.1p respectively  
(2016: 4.1p and 3.9p respectively).
GOING CONCERN
In presenting the annual and interim 
financial statements, the Directors 
aim to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects. After making 
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. In 
arriving at this conclusion the Directors 
have considered the committed facility and 
assume that the facility can be operated as 
contracted for the foreseeable future 
because there is sufficient headroom in the 
facility covenants. The facility is repayable in 
June 2018 and the Group expects to be 
able to renew the facility on favourable 
terms. In performing this analysis the 
Directors reviewed downside sensitivity 
analysis over the forecast period thereby 
taking into account the uncertainties arising 
from the current economic climate. The 
Group continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held  
on 18 July 2017 at the Village Hotel, Pamir 
Drive, Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside, 
Manchester, OL7 0PG. Details of the 
business to be considered at the Annual 
General Meeting and the Notice of Meeting 
are included in a separate document.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the issued share capital, together 
with details of the movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the 
year are shown in notes 26 and 27 to the 
Group financial statements on pages 117  
to 120. The Company has one class of 
ordinary shares which carry no right to 
fixed income. Each ordinary share carries 
the right to one vote at General Meetings  
of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the 
size of a holding nor on the transfer of 
shares, which are both governed by the 
general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation.  
The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities  
or on voting rights.
No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital and all 
issued shares are fully paid.
Subject to the provisions of the Company’s 
Articles of Association and the Companies 
Act 2006, at a General Meeting of the 
Company the Directors may request 
authority to allot shares and the power  
to disapply pre-emption rights and the 
authority for the Company to purchase its 
own ordinary shares in the market. The 
Board requests such authority at each 
Annual General Meeting. Details of the 
authorities to be sought at the Annual 
General Meeting on 18 July 2017 are set out 
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
SHARE OPTIONS
Details of the Company’s share capital and 
options over the Company’s shares under 
the Company’s employee share plans are 
given in notes 26 and 27 to the Group 
financial statements.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, the Directors will once again seek 
shareholders’ approval, by way of special 
resolution, for the grant of an authority for 
the Company to make market purchases  
of its own shares. The authority sought  
will relate to up to approximately 10% of  
the issued share capital and will continue 
until the Company’s next Annual General 
Meeting. The Directors consider that the 
grant of the power for the Company to 
make market purchases of the Company’s 
shares would be beneficial for the 
Company and accordingly they 
recommend this special resolution to 
shareholders. The Directors would only 
exercise the authority sought if they 
believed such purchase was likely to result 
in an increase in earnings per share and it 
would be in the interests of shareholders 
generally. The minimum price to be paid will 
be the shares’ nominal value of 5p and the 
maximum price will be no more than 5% 
above average middle market quotations 
for the shares on the five days before the 
shares are purchased.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS: 
CHANGE OF CONTROL 
All of the Company’s current share plans 
contain provisions relating to a change  
of control. On a change of control, 
outstanding awards would normally vest 
and become exercisable, subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions 
at that time.
The Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and  
its Directors or employees that provide  
for compensation for loss of office on  
a change of control.
TAKEOVER DIRECTIVE
The Company has only one class of 
ordinary share and these shares have  
equal voting rights. The nature of individual 
Directors’ holdings is disclosed on page 
66. There are no other significant holdings 
of any individual.

68 SECTION TITLE: PAGE REF SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 69 68 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare such financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent
• state whether applicable Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework has been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business
In preparing the Group financial 
statements, IAS 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies
• present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole
• the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and  
the position of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face
• the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model 
and strategy

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• Inventory valuation
• Retirement benefits
• Carrying value of goodwill, intangible and certain tangible fixed assets and investments in 
subsidiaries
• Acquisition accounting.
Within this Independent Auditor’s Report, any new risks are identified with 
 
and any risks which 
are the same as the prior year identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £1,000,000 which was determined on the 
basis of 4.4% of adjusted profit before tax.
Scoping Based on our scoping assessment, our audit work covered 97% of the Group’s profit before tax, 
95% of the Group’s revenue and 96% of the Group’s net assets.
Significant changes in our 
approach
During the year the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of EuroMed Inc. We have 
included EuroMed Inc. as a full scope component in the current year and have included 
acquisition accounting in relation to the purchase as a key risk in the current year. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 71 70 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Going concern and the directors’ 
assessment of the principal risks 
that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the group
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 19 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 15 to 18 that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the accounting policies note to the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to 
the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on page 19 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in respect of 
these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we 
did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not 
provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the 
greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team.
Last year our report included a risk related to exceptional items which has not been 
included in the current year due to the significant reduction in quantum and judgement 
of exceptional items in the current year.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF SCAPA GROUP PLC CONTINUED
72 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Inventory valuation 
RISK DESCRIPTION HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
RESPONDED TO THE RISK 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
Inventory is a significant balance sheet 
caption with gross inventory balances of 
£33.2 million (2016: £29.5 million) and 
provisions of £2.5 million (2016: £2.4 million) 
held by the Group at the year end.
There is a specific risk arising in relation 
to the valuation of inventory (both in terms 
of the absorption of overheads into work in 
progress and finished goods and the 
provisions held against it) as disclosed in 
note 17 and on page 48 of the Audit and 
Risk Committee’s Report. The calculation 
to determine the standard cost of inventory 
is complex. In particular the estimates 
involve the calculation of overhead 
absorption rates in work in progress and 
finished goods, such as percentages of 
labour and type of overhead costs to be 
absorbed. Judgement is also needed to 
calculate the level of inventory provisions 
for aged, obsolete and/or damaged stock 
to ensure that the inventory held by the 
Group is held at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value in line with the 
requirements of IAS 2.   
We tested the design and implementation 
of key controls in the inventory cycle. We 
performed tests of detail to confirm that 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value, through testing 
of labour and overhead absorption 
into inventory and post period end 
sales values. 
In addition we challenged the 
appropriateness of the Group’s inventory 
provisioning policy and tested the 
application of the policy by assessing 
inventory ageing profiles and comparing 
the historical levels of write offs against 
the amounts provided. 
We also attended year-end inventory 
counts, covering £31.2 million, 94.0%, 
(2016: £28.1 million, 95.3%) of the year 
end gross inventory balance. At the 
inventory counts, along with other 
procedures, we assessed the condition 
of inventory to evaluate the adequacy 
of inventory provisions for obsolete 
and damaged goods.
The value of inventory held is appropriate 
and in line with the requirements of IAS 2. 
We are satisfied that the judgements made 
by management in calculating the 
provisions in place and the overheads 
absorbed into inventory at year end are 
reasonable based on the audit evidence 
obtained.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 73 72 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Acquisition accounting 
RISK DESCRIPTION HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
RESPONDED TO THE RISK 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
On 23 May 2016 the Group acquired 100% 
of the share capital of Euromed Inc. for 
consideration of £28.3 million as disclosed 
in the critical judgements section of the 
accounting policies note, note 12 and on 
page 48 of the Audit and Risk Committee’s 
report.
Therefore we have a new risk in the current 
year which concerns the judgements 
applied in determining:
• the identification and valuation of 
intangible assets; and
• the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities acquired.
The risk identified also concerns the 
Group’s disclosures, specifically whether 
they meet the requirements of IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’.
We reviewed the sale and purchase 
agreement for evidence of any warranties 
or provisions in order to challenge the 
assumptions underpinning fair value 
adjustments made by management to 
the assets and liabilities acquired and 
to assess the completeness of the 
adjustments made. We also assessed the 
design and tested the implementation of 
key controls in relation to acquisition 
accounting.
We challenged the rationale used 
by management in the identification of 
intangible assets acquired. We have also 
challenged the assumptions underpinning 
the cash flow forecasts that have been 
used to value the intangible assets 
acquired. 
We performed substantive testing on the 
opening balance sheet acquired and we 
reviewed the disclosures in the annual 
report and accounts to ensure compliance 
with the requirements of IFRS 3. 
We concluded that the intangible assets 
identified are appropriate and the 
assumptions used in calculating the value 
assigned to these assets are reasonable. 
We concluded that the fair value of assets 
and liabilities acquired are appropriate and 
that the disclosures made in note 12 to the 
accounts are in line with the requirements 
of IFRS 3.
Retirement benefits 
RISK DESCRIPTION HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
RESPONDED TO THE RISK 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
The Group has a net deficit on its 
retirement benefit schemes of £31.4 million 
(2016: £27.5 million).
This risk concerns the appropriateness of 
actuarial assumptions in calculating the 
Group’s IAS 19 liability. The valuation of the 
Group’s IAS 19 deficit involves significant 
judgement as described on page 48 of the 
Audit and Risk Committee’s Report, the 
critical accounting judgements section of 
the accounting policies and note 25, in 
particular in relation to the discount rate, 
inflation and mortality assumptions. 
Further details can be found in point 2 
of the critical accounting judgements 
on page 87.
We considered the appropriateness 
of the assumptions underpinning the 
valuation of pension scheme liabilities 
provided by the Group’s actuary. 
Specifically we challenged the discount 
rate, inflation and mortality assumptions 
applied in calculating the scheme liabilities 
by using our internal pension specialists 
and benchmarking against comparable 
third party data.
We assessed the competency of the 
Group’s actuary and assessed whether the 
requirements of IFRS are met in accounting 
for the pension scheme. We also assessed 
the design and tested the implementation 
of management’s key controls in relation 
to valuation of the retirement benefit 
obligation.
We are satisfied that the assumptions used 
in the calculation of the Group’s retirement 
benefit obligation are reasonable and fall in 
the middle of our reasonable range based 
on our benchmark data. We have 
concluded that the liability has been 
appropriately calculated.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF SCAPA GROUP PLC CONTINUED
74 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Carrying value of goodwill, intangible and certain tangible fixed assets and investments in subsidiaries 
RISK DESCRIPTION HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
RESPONDED TO THE RISK 
KEY OBSERVATIONS
The Group has £56.4 million (2016: £34.7 
million) of goodwill in relation to Acutek, 
Webtec, First Water and EuroMed. The 
balance has increased due to the 
acquisition of EuroMed in the year and the 
impact of foreign exchange. The Group 
also holds intangible assets in relation to 
the acquisition of EuroMed of £5.2 million 
(2016: £Nil) and First Water of £1.4 million 
(2016: £2.4 million). The Group holds 
tangible fixed assets of £49.3 million (2016: 
£46.1 million).
The carrying value of the Parent Company’s 
investments at 31 March 2017 is £136.1 
million (2015: £135.5 million).
The impairment risk relates to the key 
sources of estimation required in calculating 
the discounted future cash flows of each of 
the relevant cash generating units which 
support the value of the goodwill and 
intangible assets balance as described in 
notes 13 and 14 and the investments in 
subsidiaries in the Parent Company’s 
Balance Sheet. This is described in the Audit 
and Risk Committee’s Report on page 48 
and the key sources of estimates section of 
the accounting policies, with particular 
attention to cash flow, growth rates, 
discount rates and sensitivity assumptions.
We challenged the assumptions used in 
management’s impairment model for 
goodwill, intangible assets, certain tangible 
fixed assets and investments. As part of 
our procedures we tested the clerical 
accuracy of the models and assessed 
whether they were prepared on a 
consistent basis with the prior year.
We have challenged management’s 
assumptions in relation to growth rates 
by reference to the historical trading 
performance and comparing recent growth 
rates of both revenue and operating profit 
across the Group’s geographical and 
market segments, and against latest market 
expectations. In performing our procedures 
in relation to the appropriateness of the 
discount rate, we used internal valuation 
specialists and third party evidence to 
assess the appropriateness of the discount 
rates applied.
We assessed the design and tested the 
implementation of controls in relation to the 
preparation of cash flow forecasts and in 
the calculation of the discount rate used 
by management.
We concluded that the assumptions applied 
in the impairment models were appropriate 
and no additional impairments were 
identified.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £1,000,000 (2016: £775,000)
Basis for determining materiality 4.4% of adjusted profit before tax (2016: 4.3%).  
Rationale for the benchmark applied Profit before tax is used as the benchmark for materiality as it is considered the critical 
performance measure of the Group. In line with the prior year, the current year profit before tax 
has been adjusted for exceptional items incurred in the year related to site closure costs and 
asset write offs as disclosed in note 4 of the accounts. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 75 74 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Component materiality

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £50,000 (2016: 
£10,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  The increase is to align 
with market practice. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily 
on the audit work at eleven (2016: ten) components. The increase is due to the acquisition of EuroMed in the period. 
The structure of the Group’s finance function is such that certain transactions are accounted for at the central European shared service 
centre based in the United Kingdom, where we centralised elements of our audit work, with the remainder accounted for in the operating 
units or at consolidation level. 
Given the nature of the Group’s corporate structure, where all evidence relating to each component is compiled at the Group’s central 
European shared service centre, the Group audit team undertook all the audit work for four of the European full scope components. In 
addition the Group audit team performed audit work for the new acquisition of EuroMed and the existing US and Canadian locations and 
visited those components. The work on all seven of these full scope components was led by the senior statutory auditor.
Ten (2016: nine) of the components were subject to a full audit, whilst one (2016: one) was subject to an audit of specified account 
balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality 
of the Group’s operations at those locations.
In terms of the three full scope components, for which the audit work was not led by the senior statutory auditor we included the 
component audit teams in our team briefing, discussed their risk assessment, attended relevant close meetings and reviewed 
documentation of the findings from their work.
The components which were subject to a full scope audit represent the Group’s principal business units and account for 95% (2016: 
95%) of the Group’s revenue, 96% (2016: 96%) of the Group’s net assets and 97% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s profit before tax (offset on 
consolidation by losses elsewhere in the Group). They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to 
address the risks of material misstatement identified above.  The other component subject to more limited audit procedures covers 
a further 1.2% (2016: 1.5%) of the Group’s revenue.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject 
to audit or audit of specified account balances.

our knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the 
annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 77 76 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other matters In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied 
were the company a quoted company.
Corporate governance statement
Although not required to do so, the directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate 
governance statement detailing the extent of their compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We reviewed the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim 
to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality 
controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent 
partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

82 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 83 
Scapa Group plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) manufacture bonding products and adhesive components for 
applications in the healthcare and industrial markets. The Group has manufacturing plants around the world and sells mainly in countries 
within Europe, North America and Asia.  
The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 997 Manchester 
Road, Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, OL7 0ED. The Company has its listing on the Alternative Investment Market.  
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 23 May 2017.  
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements is set out below.  
BASIS OF PREPARATION  
The consolidated financial statements of Scapa Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRSs. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the 
revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the Income Statement.  
GOING CONCERN  
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt a going concern basis  
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 68 and in the Viability 
Statement on page 19.  
EARLY ADOPTION OF STANDARDS  
The Group has not early adopted any Standards in the current or prior year.  
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS  
The following amendments have been adopted in the year: 
IFRS 1 “Clarification of the meaning of ‘effective IFRSs’” 
IFRS 3 “Clarification of the scope exclusion for joint ventures” 
IFRS 13 “Clarification of the scope of the portfolio exemption” 
IAS 40 “Clarification of the relationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40” 
IAS 19 “Defined benefit plans: employee contributions” 
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 cycle (Dec 2014) 
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 cycle (Dec 2013) 
The above interpretations and revised standard have not had any material impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements  
or the disclosures required.

84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 
IFRS 14 Regulatory deferral accounts 
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 
IFRS 16 Leases 
IRFIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative 
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 The application of the investment entities exemptions 
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture 
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interest in joint operations 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation 
Amendments to IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial statements 
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative 
Amendment to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer plants 
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle (Sep 2014) 
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 cycle (Dec 2016) 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows: 
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments; 
IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue disclosures but is unlikely to impact significantly the financial statements; and 
IFRS 16 will impact the recognition, measurement and disclosure of operating leases. It is considered that a material amount of lease assets 
and liabilities will require recognition on the Group balance sheet as the lessee recognises a ‘right-of-use’ asset for all leases. It is anticipated 
that finance charges will require reclassification in the Group income statement. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed. 
CONSOLIDATION  
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved when the Company has power over the investee, is exposed, 
or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the elements listed above. 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control 
of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement from the date the Company gains control of the subsidiary or until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with the 
Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
The Group has an interest in Scapa Scottish Limited Partnership, whose head office is located at 13 Queens Road, Aberdeen, AB15 4YL. 
The financial statements of the Group include the results and financial position of the Group’s interest in Scapa Scottish Limited Partnership. 
Accordingly advantage has been taken of the exemptions provided by Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from the 
requirements for the preparation, delivery and publication of the partnership’s accounts. 
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 85 
SEGMENTAL REPORTING  
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires that the segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information that is 
provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Group adopts this policy and the chief operating decision maker has been identified 
as the Board of Directors. The Directors consider there to be two reportable segments, being the main customer groups which the Group 
serves in: Industrial and Healthcare (business units).  
Internal reports reviewed regularly by the Board provide information to allow the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and 
make decisions about the operations. The internal reporting focuses on these business units. The chief operating decision maker relies 
primarily on turnover and trading profit to assess the performance of the Group and make decisions about resources to be allocated to 
the segment. Trading profit is reconciled to operating profit on the face of the Income Statement. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION  
Revenue comprises the fair value for the sale of goods, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the 
Group. Revenue is recognised as follows:  
(a) Sales of goods  
Sales of goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer, 
and when the Group entity has no continuing managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods.  
Where items are sold with a right of return, accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.  
(b) Interest income  
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.  
TRADING PROFIT  
Trading profit is operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and pension administration costs. 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS  
Items which are both material, either qualitatively or quantitatively, and non-recurring in nature are presented as exceptional items so as to 
provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance and are shown separately on the face of the Income Statement. 
Items classed as exceptional in the Income Statement are treated as exceptional in the cash flow until the items are fully unwound. 
OPERATING PROFIT  
Operating profit is trading profit stated after charging all exceptional costs, pension administration costs and the amortisation of intangible 
assets, but before investment income and finance costs. 
LEASES  
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-
line basis over the period of the lease.  
Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are recognised as assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The interest rate 
implicit in the lease is used as the discount rate in calculating the present value of the cash outflows. Where the Group does not obtain 
ownership of the asset at the end of the lease period, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term. Where 
ownership does pass to the Group at the end of the lease period, the policy for depreciating the asset is consistent with that for depreciable 
assets that are owned.  
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge 
is calculated based on the amount of borrowing outstanding, and is charged against profits over the primary lease period.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 85  
86 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
GOVERNMENT GRANTS  
Grants from the Government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the 
Group will comply with all attached conditions.  
Government grants relate to tangible fixed assets and are treated as deferred income, and are credited to the Income Statement over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE 
Research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Costs associated with developing or enhancing existing product lines are recognised  
as an expense as incurred. Development costs are assessed as to whether they meet the IAS 38 criteria for capitalisation.  
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  
(a) Functional and presentation currency  
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling.  
(b) Transactions and balances  
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement, except when deferred in equity as 
qualifying net investment hedges.  
(c) Group companies  
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:  
(i) assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that Balance Sheet; and 
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the dates of the transactions).  
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of long-term borrowings that 
are considered to form part of that net investment, are taken to the translation reserve within shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation 
is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.  
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL  
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred, and are 
normally treated as exceptional. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interests in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
 
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
86 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 87 
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, 
measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they 
qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified 
as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified 
as equity are not recognised. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or when an indication of impairment is identified, and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.  
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Each of those cash-generating units represents the 
Group’s investment in each site. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING LAND AND BUILDINGS)  
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and offices. All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.  
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other 
repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement when incurred. 
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to reduce their cost to their residual values 
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:  
• Freehold buildings: 40 years  
• Leasehold buildings: life of the lease  
• Plant and machinery: 5–20 years  
• Furniture, fittings and equipment: 5–20 years  
• IT systems: 3–8 years  
Assets held in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each Balance Sheet date. An asset’s 
carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.  
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the Income Statement 
within operating profit.  
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE  
Assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale or transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available 
for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition 
as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified 
as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain interest in its former subsidiary after 
the sale.

INTERNALLY GENERATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally generated intangible assets 
arising from development are recognised only if all of the following conditions have been demonstrated: 
• Technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use 
• The intention to complete and use the asset 
• How the asset will generate probable future economic benefit 
• The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the asset 
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development 
The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the same as the expenditure incurred from the date when the 
asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
All acquired intangible assets are measured at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. All of the 
Group’s intangible assets have finite lives, the lengths of which are disclosed separately under the notes in the accounts. 
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS  
Assets, such as goodwill, that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and instead are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units).  
Value in use is determined based on the estimated future cash inflows and outflows derived from the continued use of the asset and from 
its ultimate disposal. These forecasts form the basis of the Group’s annual budget, have been signed off by the Board and are the best 
estimates available to management in assessing future profitability. These cash flows are discounted using the Group’s pre-tax weighted 
average cost of capital of 10.0% (2016: 10.0%), adjusted to reflect any risks specific to the asset for which the estimated future cash flows 
have not already been adjusted (see note 13). 
Where the recoverable amount of assets (other than goodwill) subsequently materially increases, impairment losses recognised in previous 
periods will be reversed. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
The Group has financial instruments in the form of loans, receivables and payables.  
Loans, receivables and payables are non-derivative financial assets and liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor or creditor with no intention of 
trading the receivable or payable. They are included in current assets or liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the 
Balance Sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets or liabilities. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other 
receivables or trade and other payables in the Balance Sheet. Loans, receivables and payables are measured at invoice or historic 
cost less any impairment.  
INVENTORIES  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of 
finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated 
on a systematic basis (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective 
inventory on a line by line basis, or by grouping similar or related items, by reference to accumulated experience.  
TRADE RECEIVABLES  
Trade receivables are recognised initially at invoice value, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of 
receivables. The provision is recognised in the Income Statement as an operating charge.

SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 89 
INSURANCE RECEIVABLES 
Where some or all of the cost of a provision is reimbursed by another party, the Group recognises that reimbursement when it is virtually 
certain it will be received. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the 
Balance Sheet.  
SHARE CAPITAL  
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or in respect of interim dividends when approved by Directors.  
TRADE PAYABLES  
Trade payables are recognised at the invoice amount, which is equal to their fair value.  
BORROWINGS  
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently stated at amortised cost. Interest 
charges are recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.  
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has a right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
Balance Sheet date.  
TAXATION 
Taxation expense, comprising both UK and non-UK taxation, represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable profit for the period using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date, together with any adjustments in respect of previous years. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported 
in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in 
other years. 
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, unless specifically exempt. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
realised. The resulting charge or credit is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case the charge or credit is also recognised directly in equity. 
DIVIDENDS 
Dividends proposed by the Board are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  
(a) Pension obligations  
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are funded through payments to trustee-administered funds, determined 
by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension 
plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such 
as age, years of service and compensation.  
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the Balance Sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past 
service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to 
the terms of the related pension liability.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
88 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 89  
90 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
shareholders’ equity.  
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the 
employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period.  
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to 
employee service in the current and prior periods.  
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.  
(b) Share-based compensation  
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the 
grant of the options is calculated using appropriate valuation models and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.  
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. At each 
Balance Sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity, 
over the remaining vesting period.  
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.  
(c) Holiday pay  
The Group recognises an asset or liability relating to holiday pay obligations at the Balance Sheet date. Movements in the period are taken 
to the Income Statement.  
(d) Bonus plans  
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on a pre-determined formula for key performance indicators. The Group 
recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where past practice has created a constructive obligation.  
(e) Share Price Incentive Plan  
The Group accounts for the Share Price Incentive Plan in line with IAS 19 as the basis of compensation is not an award of shares and 
therefore does not fall under the remit of IFRS 2. 
PROVISIONS 
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.  
Where the effect is material, provisions are discounted in line with IAS 37 using a pre-tax nominal discount rate. The discount rate does not 
reflect risks for which the estimated future outflows have already been adjusted. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
The Group’s accounting policies have been set by management and approved by the Audit and Risk Committee. The application of these 
accounting policies to specific scenarios requires reasonable estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future. These are 
continually evaluated based on historical experience and expectations of future events. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results.  
Under IFRSs estimates or judgements are considered critical where they involve a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities from period to period. This may be because the estimate or judgement involves matters which are 
highly uncertain, or because different estimation methods or assumptions could reasonably have been used.

SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 91 
(a) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the directors have made the following judgements 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are 
dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments. 
1. Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance 
with actuarial assumptions. The choice of discount rate applied in the calculation of scheme liabilities is a key judgement in applying the 
Group’s accounting policy (see note 25). 
2. Taxation (see note 9). The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining 
the worldwide provisions for income taxes and the recognition of deferred tax assets. The recognition of deferred tax is based on the 
availability of suitable future taxable profits of a specific business unit in a specific tax jurisdiction and satisfies the relevant recognition 
criteria. The assumptions used are considered the best available and reasonable. A significant deterioration in results would need to 
occur in order to result in an impairment of the deferred tax recognised. 
3. In assessing the separable identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for any acquisition, the Group establishes an appropriate fair value 
and this is assessed in line with external valuation tools and techniques. The valuation techniques used in the identification of separable 
identifiable intangible assets are a key judgement in the application of the Group’s accounting policies. 
 In assessing the separable intangible assets and goodwill for the EuroMed acquisition in May 2016, the assumptions used to calculate 
fair values have been externally assessed as reasonable and are supported by the recoverable amount of the business when calculated 
at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 10%. 
(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed 
below: 
1. Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (see notes 13 to 15). The Group tests annually whether 
goodwill has suffered any impairment, and tests tangible assets where indication of impairment exists. For goodwill the recoverable 
amounts of cash-generating units are determined on a value-in-use basis. Determining this value requires the use of estimates. The 
main estimates are around the forecast cash flows, which are based on approved budgets and growth rates of 3%–10% per annum in 
years 1–5 and 1% each year thereafter including an assessment of the terminal value. The 3% growth rate is used for the majority of 
cash flows and the higher rate of 10% is used for two specific cash-generating units. The assumptions used are considered the best 
available and reasonable. Any reasonable change in the assumptions would not result in any impairment. The Group has conducted 
a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test. If the assumed growth rate was reduced to 0%, the recoverable amount of all cash-
generating units individually would remain greater than their carrying values. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 14.0% would 
result in positive headroom remaining, compared to the carrying value of goodwill for each cash-generating unit. 
2. Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance 
with actuarial assumptions. The future assumptions applied in the calculation of scheme liabilities, which are set out in note 25, 
represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Group. The Group also applies sensitivities to these assumptions to assess 
the financial impact; these sensitivities are set out in note 25.

Business unit segments 
The Group operates two standalone business units: Healthcare and Industrial, supported by a strategic Corporate function. All inter-
segment transactions are made on an arm’s length basis. 
The chief operating decision maker (CEO) relies primarily on turnover and trading profit to assess the performance of the Group and make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment; assets and liabilities are looked at geographically. Trading profit is reconciled 
to operating profit on the face of the Income Statement. 
The Board reviews the performance of the business using information presented at constant exchange rates. The prior year results have 
been restated at constant currency as shown on the following pages.

The prior year exceptional income related to pension projects in the UK and US £1.6m. In the UK, the offer to a sub-set of members to buy 
different benefits led to £10.8m of liabilities being extinguished in exchange for assets valued at £10.2m. In the US, a project offering lump 
sums to deferred members resulted in £5.5m of liabilities being extinguished in exchange for assets valued at £4.5m. The resulting gains of 
£1.6m have been reported as an exceptional settlement gain, consistent with our historical treatment of legacy defined benefit pension costs. In 
addition the sale of land relating to a dormant site in Bellegarde France was completed on 31 March 2016 resulting in £0.5m income.

Exceptional operating expenses 
The closure of the Rorschach site in Switzerland was announced in April 2015 and subsequently provided for in the 2016 accounts. 
However, certain costs have been incurred in the period that could not be provided for previously, being retention payments made to 
certain key members of staff of £0.5m and £0.2m impairment of assets that continued to be used up until cessation of production at the 
site. The acquisition costs are directly related to the acquisition of EuroMed and are covered in note 12. 
The prior year expenses that relate to the closure of the Rorschach site include the impairment of the plant and machinery down to its 
recoverable value, £1.5m and the then best estimate of costs to close the site of £3.4m The closure costs included all the employee 
consultation costs, the remediation and building strip-out costs, the legal costs associated with closing the site and certain costs related 
to revalidating a number of products at alternative sites, essential to ensure the continued production within the Group. These estimates 
remain our best estimate and no additional provisions have been made in the year. Also during the prior year £2.0m was paid to the former 
owners of First Water Limited relating to post combination remuneration based on the performance of the business during 2015/16. The 
Group incurred exceptional costs of £1.2m relating to a Group-wide reorganisation and spent £0.4m on costs associated with potential 
acquisitions. The purchases were aborted and the costs have been separately disclosed.

Basic  
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
Diluted  
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of 
all potentially dilutive ordinary shares 157,873,262 (2016: 157,296,423). Diluted earnings per share has been calculated including share 
options in existence at 31 March 2017. 
Adjusted 
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the trading profit less cash interest less tax on operating activities by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

12. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY 
On 23 May 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of EuroMed Inc, obtaining control. EuroMed is a hydrocolloid-based wound 
care solutions provider. The company is based in New York State. 
The Directors believe that the acquisition of EuroMed brings multiple advantages to Scapa, including: 
• proprietary and patented technology to broaden and strengthen Scapa Healthcare’s Turn-Key value proposition 
• innovative R&D capabilities complementing Scapa Healthcare’s existing resources 
• expanded opportunities for growth in new markets and with new customers 
• significant cross-selling opportunities across the customer base 
• improved manufacturing infrastructure 
• acceleration in Scapa Healthcare’s growth 
• the acquisition is expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full year in the enlarged Group 
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below:

Property, plant and machinery  1.9

Net cash outflow arising on acquisition:

In addition to the above, the former owners of the business had the opportunity to earn an additional US$7.0m (GBP £5.6m) consideration 
based on the future performance of EuroMed. None of the consideration has been recognised as the targets for payment were not met. 
The goodwill of £16.8m arising from the acquisition is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes in the US. Acquisition-related 
costs (included within exceptionals) amount to £0.6m. 
EuroMed Inc contributed £10.3m of revenue and £1.1m to Group profit between the date of acquisition and 31 March 2017. If the 
acquisition of EuroMed Inc had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been 
£281.2m and Group trading profit would have been £29.4m.

Goodwill relates to the Acutek Medical operation £15.4m (2016: £13.4m), Webtec £16.8m (2016: £14.6m), First Water Limited £6.7m 
(2016: £6.7m) and EuroMed £17.5m (2016: £Nil). 
The carrying value of the Group’s goodwill is not subject to annual amortisation and was tested for impairment at March 2017. 
The recoverable amount has been determined on a value in use basis on each cash-generating unit using the management approved 
12-month forecasts for each cash-generating unit. The base 12-month projection is inflated by 3.0% – 10.0% up to year 5, which 
management believes does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry, and then is subject to a 1% growth and costs 
inflation through to year 20, with a terminal value calculated on a perpetuity basis.  
These cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% (2016: 10.0%) and adjusted for specific risk factors that take into 
account the sensitivities of the projection. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test. If the assumed growth 
rate was reduced to 0%, the recoverable amount of all cash-generating units individually would remain greater than their carrying values. 
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 14.0% would result in positive headroom remaining, compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
for each cash-generating unit.

The brought forward intangible assets relate to the acquisition of First Water Limited in 2015 and Webtec in 2011. No value has been 
assigned to brand names, as Scapa companies are contract manufacturers and inherent brand value resides with customers rather than 
the manufacturer.

21. BORROWINGS CONTINUED 
In January 2014 the Group entered into a committed multi-currency facility with a club of three UK banks. The principal features of the 
facility are: 
• the initial committed value of the facility was £40m 
• an accordion of £20m 
• it is unsecured 
• it is repayable in June 2018 
• the interest payable on drawings under the loan is based on inter-bank interest plus a sliding scale margin determined by the Group’s leverage; 
the margin is currently 1.5% 
• the facility has two covenants – the ratio of EBITDA to interest paid must be above 4:1, and the ratio of EBITDA to net debt must be less 
than 2.75, reducing to 2.5 over time 
As part of the acquisition of EuroMed in May 2016, the Group drew down on the committed accordion facility of £20m therefore resulting in 
an overall committed facility of £60m, which is repayable in June 2018. 
 
The carrying value of borrowings is approximate to their fair value. The effective interest rates at the Balance Sheet date were as follows: 
 % 
31 March 2017 – Bank loans and overdrafts 2.4% 
31 March 2016 – Bank loans and overdrafts 2.1% 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s borrowings are denominated in the following currencies:

£m 
2016 
£m 
Pounds Sterling  4.0 11.6 
US Dollars 24.2 9.7 
 28.2 21.3 
The total borrowings figure is presented net of unamortised debt issue costs of £0.3m (2016: £0.3m). 
Movements in forward currency contracts used to hedge against the exposure to exchange differences due to the timing of cash flows are 
taken through the Income Statement as it is not Group policy to hedge account for these instruments. At 31 March 2017 there were no 
assets or liabilities recognised in the Balance Sheet relating to the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts in place (2016: £Nil) 
(see note 22).

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 
The Group’s overall risk management procedures focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the Group finance department (in close co-operation with 
the business units) under policies approved by the Board of Directors.  
– Foreign exchange risk  
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk, arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the US Dollar, the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets 
and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. As the Group has certain investments in foreign operations, these net assets are 
exposed to foreign currency translation risk.  
To manage its foreign exchange risk the Group uses foreign currency bank balances, and makes occasional use of foreign currency forward 
contracts to avoid short-term fluctuations in currencies. In addition, purchases of large items of capital in foreign currency are covered by 
forward contracts at the point of authorisation.  
– Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it has borrowings at floating rates. Interest rate risk is evaluated periodically to consider interest 
rate views and defined risk appetite; to seek to ensure that reasonable economic strategies are applied, by either positioning the Balance 
Sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles. Deposit risk is managed by spreading deposits across high credit 
rated institutions, and capping the maximum deposit with an institution at one time.  
– Commodity price risk  
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as it buys a number of commodity products that are vital to its production process. 
The Group mitigates this risk by fixing pricing with its suppliers where possible. The contracts entered into continue to be held for the 
purpose of the receipt of the commodity in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase or usage requirements. There is no intention 
to re-sell the commodities bought. 
– Liquidity risk  
The Group maintains a mixture of committed long-term and short-term facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash funds 
available for operations and planned investment.

In accordance with IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be classified 
as Level 2 instruments. Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices in active markets 
(Level 1 categorisation) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
– Credit risk  
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with 
an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are spread across a number of financial institutions. The credit risk 
position for our major customers is detailed below. This shows a fairly predictable level of credit utilisation across the regions and years, and 
highlights that there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables.  
Europe  
The top five customers by balance at 31 March 2017 had a total receivable of £3.9m, versus their cumulative credit limit of £4.4m.  
The top five customers at 31 March 2016 had a total receivable of £2.3m, versus their cumulative credit limit of £3.8m.

23. CAPITAL RISK 
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total equity. The Group’s primary objective when managing capital is to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. 
The Group must ensure that sufficient capital resources are available for working capital requirements and meeting principal and interest 
payments as they fall due. In order to ensure that sufficient capital is available, the Group may adjust the amount of new shares issued, 
return capital to shareholders, alter its dividend policy or dispose of assets to reduce net debt. 
The Group monitors capital using the following main indicators: 
Gearing ratio 2017 2016  
Total equity (£m) 100.3 77.7 
Total assets (£m) 227.0 186.1 
Equity % ratio 44% 42% 
  
Net debt to EBITDA ratio 2017 2016 
Net debt (£m)  (16.1) (2.6) 
EBITDA (£m) 35.4 26.5 
Net debt to EBITDA ratio 0.45 0.10 
Net debt to EBITDA comprises net debt divided by trading profit before depreciation. 
EBITDA interest cover 2017 2016 
EBITDA (£m) 35.4 26.5 
Net interest payable (£m) (1.2) (0.7) 
Interest cover – times 30 38 
EBITDA interest cover comprises trading profit before depreciation, divided by net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans 
and bank deposits. 
The Group’s principal loan covenants are: EBITDA interest cover (EBITDA being at least 4 times the net interest payable); and net debt to 
EBITDA ratio (net debt being less than 2.75 times adjusted EBITDA, reducing over time to 2.5).

(2016: £0.3m) in relation to reorganisation costs. There is also a £0.7m provision relating to the closure of the Rorschach site which 
is expected to be fully utilised during the coming year. 
– Environmental provisions  
Environmental provisions relate to expected costs required to clean up environmental contamination of a number of sites in Europe of £0.4m 
(2016: £0.4m). The Group expects the majority of the spend against the environmental provisions to be incurred over the next four years. 
25. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS  
– Defined contribution schemes  
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. Employer’s contributions are charged to the Income Statement as incurred. 
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of these schemes for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £2.0m (2016: £1.9m). The assets 
of these schemes are held in independently administered funds. 
– Defined benefit schemes  
The total amounts recognised in the Group financial statements for defined benefit schemes are summarised on pages 107 to 113. 
(a) UK schemes  
By far the largest defined benefit scheme in the Group is the Scapa Group plc Pension Scheme, which has the assets and liabilities of 
former UK employees. The scheme has been closed to new members and future accrual since 2007/08 and is wholly funded by the 
sponsoring employer, Scapa Group plc. The assets of the scheme are held separately from the Company under Trust and both the 
assets and liabilities are held on a non-sectionalised basis. The scheme is managed by a professional trustee. 
The IAS 19 Retirement Benefits valuations have been updated from the prior year using formal valuation calculations carried out as at 1 April 
2014, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 March 2017. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 March 2017.

25. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED 
– Funding arrangement 
On 11 March 2013 Scapa Group plc agreed an asset-backed funding arrangement with the Trustees of the UK Pension Funds to 
help address the UK pension funding deficit. The asset backed funding structure provided £3.75m cash per annum to the UK Pension 
Funds. The present value of this funding stream is recognised as an investment of the UK Pension Funds and removes the funding deficit 
on actuarial valuation.  
The contributions under the asset backed structure are as follows: 
• the arrangement provides a cash flow of £3.75m per year subject to RPI indexation  
• the Company pays £0.35m per year subject to RPI indexation, towards the administration costs of the scheme 
• the Company pays non-administration costs as agreed on a project by project basis with the trustee 
Total cash payments in the year, including both deficit repair and expenses, were £4.4m (2016: £4.4m). As at 31 March 2017 no amounts 
were outstanding (2016: same). 
(b) Overseas schemes  
The Group operates a number of pension schemes in different countries. There are several small defined benefit schemes and a number of 
defined contribution schemes. In addition, in certain countries, the Group must provide for various employee termination benefits. These are 
accounted for as if they were defined benefit pension schemes. The total defined benefit pension charge to operating profit for the Group 
in respect of overseas pension schemes for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £0.4m (2016: £0.4m), excluding settlement gains. The 
forecast future contributions into these schemes are expected to be similar to the current year contributions, but are subject to the number 
and nature of leavers in any period. 
Details of the Group’s material overseas defined benefit schemes are as follows:  
– North America  
The Group operates three pension plans in North America, a funded defined benefit scheme and two unfunded pension plans. The defined 
benefit scheme was closed during the prior year and all three schemes are therefore now closed to new members and future accrual. The 
disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations of liabilities and asset market values at 31 March 2017. During the year a lump 
sum initiative was made available to certain deferred members. These members were able to elect to withdraw the value of their pension 
funds from the scheme and place into private control. The value of the liabilities extinguished during this exercise were higher than the 
carrying value of the assets transferred out of the scheme; the resulting gain has been treated as an exceptional settlement gain in the 
income statement. 
– France 
The Group operates an unfunded statutory retirement benefit scheme in France with liabilities of £4.2m (2016: £3.8m), with payments made 
to employees on retirement. 
– Italy  
There is an unfunded statutory termination indemnity plan in Italy, with payments made to employees on retirement or termination of service. 
The Italian scheme is closed to future accrual following changes in local legislation in 2013. It has liabilities of £0.6m (2016: £0.5m). 
– Switzerland  
The Group has an insured retirement fund in Switzerland that is accounted for under IAS 19, with assets in excess of liabilities for the 
31 March 2017 valuation period. The scheme is subject to an asset ceiling therefore no asset is recognised for the surplus.

The salary increase assumption is no longer relevant in the UK and US as the schemes are closed to future accrual.  
The expected investment returns have been calculated using the weighted average of the expected investment returns for the different asset 
classes. The expected return on investments for the UK schemes are set out in the table below; the expected return on investment for the 
overseas schemes is not a key judgement given the small asset values. 
The assumptions relating to UK longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the Balance Sheet date are based on standard actuarial 
mortality tables, with adjustments to reflect actual experience. For the year to 31 March 2017, the IAS 19 calculations have been performed 
using standard actuarial tables known as S2PA. Future improvements in mortality have been allowed for using the core CMI 2013 model, 
with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum. In the current year these tables have then been adjusted with a loading to reflect 
the geographic membership profile of the scheme. During the year to March 2016 a postcode mortality exercise was conducted on the 
schemes membership. The results of this exercise showed that a best estimate adjustment to the base table used on the 1 April 2014 
actuarial valuation was 115% for all members. This assumption, reducing the expected longevity of members, has been used in the March 
2017 disclosures. 
Actuarial assumption sensitivities  
The calculation of the schemes’ deficits is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions listed above. The following tables show the 
approximate effect of changes in the key assumptions on the UK scheme’s liabilities (and deficit) at the year end. These are approximate 
and only show the likely effect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same. Note that sensitivities are not 
provided for the overseas schemes because the materiality of the results is not significant.

During the year the following options were exercised; 400,000 options under the 2009 Performance share plan; 95,013 options under the 
2012 Performance share plan; 1,764,500 options under the 2013 Performance share plan; 45,773 options under the 2012 5-year 
Sharesave option plan; and 12,105 options under the 2015 3-year Sharesave option plan. 
All other movements from 2016 are expired or lapsed options and new grants. As at 31 March 2017, 435,561 options were exercisable 
under the 2015 3-year Sharesave option plan, 85,158 options were exercisable under the 2012 Performance share plan and 15,500 options 
were exercisable under the 2013 Performance share plan.  
The Group operates several share option schemes. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group’s 
shares on the date of grant. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group through resignation or dismissal before the options vest. 
Equity settled share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed over 
the vesting period, based upon the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
There are no cash-settled share options. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Black Scholes model according to the relevant measures of performance. The models include 
adjustments, based upon management’s best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural considerations and expected 
dividend payments. The option life is derived from models based upon these assumptions and other assumptions identified below. 
The Group recognised total expenses of £1.9m (2016: £1.8m) related to equity-settled share-based payments. This expense includes the charge for 
new options granted during the year net of release of charge for the options for which it has been concluded that vesting criteria will not be met. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan  
The Company has a long-term incentive plan that operates based on the 2004 and 2011 Performance Share Plans.  
Options granted in 2009/10 and 2010/11 relate to the incentive plan known as the Scapa Group plc 2004 Performance Share Plan which 
was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 22 July 2004. Awards under the plan take the form of either an annual 
allocation of ordinary shares or a grant of nil cost options over shares with a market value at the time of grant equivalent to a maximum of 
100% of basic salary at that time with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to 
attainment of the performance targets.

27. SHARE OPTIONS CONTINUED 
Awards in the form of an allocation of ordinary shares lapse at the end of the three-year performance period to the extent that the 
performance conditions have not been met. Awards in the form of a nil cost option remain exercisable until their tenth anniversary of the 
date of grant, subject to achievement of the performance conditions, after which they lapse.  
Options granted in 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17 relate to the 2011 incentive plan known as the Scapa 
Group plc 2011 Performance Share Plan, details of which can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report contained in these accounts. 
Sharesave 
The Scapa Group 2011 Sharesave Scheme is an Inland Revenue approved Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) share option scheme pursuant to 
which eligible employees (including Executive Directors) in the United Kingdom who have worked a minimum six-month qualifying period 
and agree to save a fixed amount for three or five years under an approved savings contract are granted options to subscribe for shares in 
the Company at a discounted exercise price. The maximum amount that can be saved by a participant is £250 per month. In normal 
circumstances options are exercisable for six months following the completion of a savings contract using the proceeds from that contract. 
The exercise price is based on the market value of the shares as of the date of grant, less a discount of 20%. 
The following tables show the inputs to the model used to calculate the fair value of equity-settled share options granted during the years

Scapa Group 2015 Value Creation Plan 
The Company set up the Value Creation Plan (VCP) in 2015/16 to reward participants for creating value through growth in the Company’s 
share price. If defined share price targets are met on defined dates, the growth in excess of £1.95 (up to a maximum of £5.00) will be 
shared by the Plan’s participants. The total amount awarded to participants in the Plan has been set as 5% of the number of shares in 
issue. The earliest opportunity to exercise rights under the VCP is April 2020. The first measurement date is 31 March 2018 where the share 
price target is £3.00. The second measurement date is 31 March 2020 where the share price target is £4.00. Any rights obtained in March 
2018 must be held for 24 months before exercise. Any right obtained in March 2020 must be held for 12 months before exercise.  
The VCP will be equity settled and a charge has been calculated under IFRS 2 and applied in the current year. In determining the likelihood 
of the VCP vesting, the Company used a simulation model to predict the various outcomes of share price at the target dates. The main 
assumptions used in the model were the expected volatility, expected dividends payable over the period, the risk free rate of return and the 
granting and vesting of other LTIP awards which are deducted from any VCP payment. These assumptions were all based on historic data 
as the best estimate of future outcome.

It is Group policy to lease certain fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The Group has lease agreements in the US with lease 
periods to 2018 and average borrowing rates of 6.5% (2016: 6.6%). Interest rates are fixed at contract date. All leases are on fixed 
repayment terms and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. The fair value of the Group’s lease 
obligations approximates to their carrying amount. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights 
over the related assets. 
31. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT 
On 23 May 2017 the Group announced its intention to exit production in Korea and transfer the technology and plant and machinery to 
other existing sites within the Group. At the Balance Sheet date it is not possible to estimate the financial impact of the exit given the range 
of options under consideration. The announcement does not represent a situation that existed at the Balance Sheet date and accordingly 
no adjustments have been made.

SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 127 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING  
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable law. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied 
consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
financial statements. In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results 
of the Company has not been presented. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a cash flow statement, presentation of comparative 
information in respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets, business combinations, discontinued operations 
and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements. 
A summary of the Company’s principal accounting policies is set out below. These have been applied consistently throughout the year and 
prior year.  
GOING CONCERN 
The Directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 68 and in the Viability Statement on page 19. 
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided on the basis of writing off the 
cost of the relevant assets over their expected useful lives. The Company applies the straight-line method. The effect is to reduce the cost 
of plant, equipment, fixtures and computer systems to estimated residual value over a period of 5–20 years.  
TAXATION  
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been substantively enacted 
by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
Balance Sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and losses and its results as stated in the 
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.  
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, 
it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-
discounted basis. 
DIVIDENDS 
Dividends proposed by the Board are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. 
PROVISIONS  
Provisions are made in accordance with IAS 37 where an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the 
amount of obligation can be reliably estimated.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
126 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SCAPA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 127  
128 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
PENSION COSTS  
For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements 
and curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the 
benefits have vested. If the benefits have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
For defined benefit schemes, the Company recognises plan assets where they are separable, solely for payment to the fund or to fund 
employee benefits, not available to the Company’s creditors in bankruptcy and where the assets cannot be returned to the Company 
unless all employee benefit obligations are met. 
Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee-administered 
funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method 
and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the 
scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations are obtained annually and are updated at each Balance Sheet date. The resulting defined benefit 
asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the Balance Sheet. 
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement 
benefits is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are 
shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet. 
FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS  
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment in value. Where circumstances indicate that there may have 
been impairment in the carrying value of a tangible or intangible fixed asset, an impairment review is carried out using cash flows from 
approved forecasts and projections discounted at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.  
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, 
is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve. 
FOREIGN CURRENCIES  
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange at the Balance Sheet date. Exchange differences on borrowings 
(including differences arising due to currency swaps) taken out to hedge overseas equity investments and on long-term loans which are 
considered equivalent to equity are taken to the translation reserve. All other differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

The recoverable amount has been determined on a value in use basis on each cash-generating unit using the management approved 
12-month forecasts for each cash-generating unit. The base 12-month projection is inflated by 3.0% up to year 5, which management 
believes does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry, and then is subject to a 1% growth and costs inflation through 
to year 20, with a terminal value calculated on a perpetuity basis.  
These cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% (2016: 10.0%) and adjusted for specific risk factors that take into 
account the sensitivities of the projection.

8. BANK LOANS AND OVERDRAFTS  
In January 2014 the Company together with other members of the Group entered into a committed multi-currency facility with a club 
of three UK banks. The principal features of the facility are: 
• the initial committed value of the facility was £40m 
• an accordion of £20m 
• it is unsecured 
• it is repayable in June 2018 
• the interest payable on drawings under the loan is based on inter-bank interest plus a sliding scale margin determined by the Group’s 
leverage; the margin is currently 1.5% 
• the facility has two covenants – the ratio of EBITDA to interest paid must be above 4:1, and the ratio of EBITDA to net debt must be less 
than 2.75, reducing to 2.5 over time 
As part of the acquisition of EuroMed in May 2016, the Company along with other members of the Group drew down on the committed 
accordion facility of £20m therefore resulting in an overall committed facility of £60m, which is repayable in June 2018. 
The borrowings of the Company under the facility at the Balance Sheet date were as follows:  
The effective interest rate at the Balance Sheet date was as follows:

12. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS  
(a) Defined contribution scheme  
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme in the UK. Employer’s contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as 
incurred. The total pension cost for the Company in respect of this scheme for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £0.2m (2016: £0.3m).  
(b) Defined benefit schemes  
The Company is a sponsoring employer to the Scapa Group plc Pension Scheme, which has the assets and liabilities of former UK employees. 
The scheme has been closed to new members and future accrual since 2007/08 and is wholly funded by the sponsoring employers, Scapa 
Group plc and Scapa UK Ltd. The assets of the scheme are held separately from the Company under Trust and both the assets and liabilities 
are held on a non-sectionalised basis. The scheme is managed by a professional trustee.

12. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED 
The IAS 19 Retirement Benefits valuations have been updated from the prior year using formal valuation calculations carried out as at 1 April 
2014, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 March 2017. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 March 2017.  
Set out below are the key financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19.  
 2017  2016 
Discount rate 2.45% 3.45% 
Salary rises – – 
Price inflation (RPI) 3.10% 2.85% 
Price inflation (CPI) 2.10% 1.85% 
Future pension increases – RPI max 5% 
2.97% 2.78% 
Future pension increases – RPI max 3% 2.33% 2.22% 
Amount of pension commuted for cash 25.00% 25.00% 
The salary increase assumption is no longer relevant in the UK as the scheme is closed to future accrual.  
The expected investment returns have been calculated using the weighted average of the expected investment returns for the different asset 
classes. The expected return on investments for the UK scheme is set out in the table below. 
The assumptions relating to UK longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the Balance Sheet date are based on standard actuarial 
mortality tables, with adjustments to reflect actual experience. For the year to 31 March 2017, the IAS 19 calculations have been performed 
using standard actuarial tables known as S2PA. Future improvements in mortality have been allowed for using the core CMI 2013 model, 
with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum. In the current year these tables have then been adjusted with a loading to reflect 
the geographic membership profile of the scheme. During the year to March 2017 a postcode mortality exercise was conducted on the 
scheme’s membership. The results of this exercise showed that a best estimate adjustment to the base table used on the 1 April 2014 
actuarial valuation was 115% for all members. This assumption, reducing the expected longevity of members, has been used in the March 
2017 disclosures. 
Actuarial assumption sensitivities  
The calculation of the scheme’s deficits is sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions listed above. The following tables show the 
approximate effect of changes in the key assumptions on the UK scheme’s liabilities (and deficit) at the year end. These are approximate 
and only show the likely effect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same.
