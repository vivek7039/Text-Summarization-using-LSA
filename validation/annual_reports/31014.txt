producing royalties
A mining royalty is a non-operating 
interest in a mining project that 
provides the royalty holder with the 
right to a proportion of revenue, profit 
or production.
Historically, royalties originated as a 
result of the sale of a mineral property, 
allowing the seller to retain some 
ongoing economic participation in the 
property. However, an increasing 
number of royalties are now created 
directly by operators and developers 
as a source of finance. A royalty holder 
is not generally obligated to contribute 
towards operating or capital costs, nor 
environmental or reclamation 
liabilities.
TYPES OF ROYALTIES
The Group’s royalties are mostly revenue or 
production-based royalties. Typically, these 
royalties are either Gross Revenue royalties or 
Net Smelter Return royalties, each of which 
can be described as follows: 
GRR : GROSS REVENUE ROYALTY 
A GRR entitles the royalty holder to a fixed 
portion of the gross revenues generated  
from the sales of mineral production from a 
property. In calculating a GRR payment, 
deductions, if any, applied by the property 
owner to reduce the royalty payment are 
usually minimal, and GRRs are therefore the 
simplest form of royalty to account for and 
implement.
NSR : NET SMELTER RETURN ROYALTY
An NSR entitles the royalty holder to a fixed 
portion of the net revenues received from a 
smelter or refinery from the sales of mineral 
production from a property, after the 
deduction of certain offsite realisation costs. 
Typical realisation costs include those related 
to transportation, insurance, smelting and 
refining. These deductions are generally 
higher in base metals mines due to the 
semi-finished product, such as concentrate, 
often being produced at the mine site, when 
compared to precious metals mines, which 
produce a nearly-finished product on site.
PRIMARY VERSUS SECONDARY 
ROYALTIES
Primary royalties are entered into between a 
royalty company and the property owner 
directly, where the property owner grants a 
royalty to the royalty company in return for 
one or more up-front cash payments from  
the royalty company. In contrast, secondary 
royalties are existing royalties that are acquired 
from a third party with no payment made to 
the owner of the underlying property.
METAL STREAMS
A metal stream is an agreement that provides, 
in exchange for an upfront payment, the right 
to purchase all or a portion of one or more 
metals produced from a mine, at a price 
determined for the life of the stream. 
Streams, whilst providing similar outcomes for 
Anglo Pacific, are not royalties because they 
do not constitute an interest in land and there 
is an ongoing cash payment required to 
purchase the physical metal. However, a 
stream holder is not ordinarily required to 
contribute towards operating or capital costs, 
nor environmental or reclamation liabilities.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS  
This is my first report as Chairman, having assumed the role after 
the 2017 AGM. Undoubtedly, 2017 has been a year of considerable 
progress for Anglo Pacific with record royalty revenue, two 
successful transactions and an increase in the dividend whilst 
repaying our borrowings in full. We enter 2018 in a strong financial 
position and with an exciting pipeline for growth, which is the clear 
focus for the year ahead.  
KE Y RESULT S
06 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK PERFORMANCE IN 2017
Our royalty income in 2017 increased by 90% from £19.7m to 
£37.4m, continuing the trend of recent years, and representing 
a record year for the Company. This was primarily due to a 
significant increase in volumes from Kestrel being subject to 
the Group’s royalty (93% in 2017 vs 67% in 2016) in addition  
to higher coal prices. Commodity prices exceeded most 
commentators’ expectations at the beginning of 2017, with 
the average price achieved at Kestrel being some 30% higher 
than the previous year. Thermal coal and vanadium prices 
were also strong which contributed to the Group’s record 
performance. We have also enjoyed income from the Denison 
investment for the first time. 
The higher commodity prices and revenues during 2017 
translated directly into higher profits and cash generation. 
Operating profit increased to £28.4m from £12.7m in 2016. 
Operating costs also increased in the period due to a 
combination of higher staff costs and a greater level of 
investment in business development as we target a higher 
rate of growth in the coming year.
Our results were, as usual, impacted by a number of 
revaluation adjustments which led to overall profit before tax 
being £11.8m compared to £28.3m in 2016, the decline being 
driven in the main by the valuation of the Kestrel royalty.  
Basic and diluted earnings per share were 5.88p compared 
with 15.60p in 2016. Stripping out these non-cash items,  
we present an adjusted earnings measure (refer to note 11  
to the accounts) which, we believe, more closely reflects the 
performance within management’s control. On this basis 
adjusted earnings per share were 16.82p (2016: 9.76p). 
DIVIDENDS
In light of the strong results in 2017, and the strength of our 
dividend cover, the Board has recommended that the final 
dividend be increased by 1p per share (subject to approval by 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM), which will result in an overall 
dividend for the year of 7p per share. We have also increased 
the level of the interim dividend payments from 1.5p to 
1.625p, which will be reflected in the Q1 2018 dividend.  
We believe that these levels strike the right balance between 
offering shareholders an attractive dividend yield and 
retaining sufficient resources to drive the growth strategy. 
FOCUS FOR 2018
Given the strong financial position that we now enjoy, and  
the positive outlook for the sector, we are focused on 
accelerating the growth of our asset base in the coming years. 
We wish to increase the diversity of our portfolio such that it 
includes a wider range of commodities and assets, thereby 
reducing the percentage of our income coming from coal, and 
Kestrel in particular. We have also announced a desire to build  
a meaningful presence in commodities which are focused on  
the growing electric vehicle market, where we see great 
potential. Our investment in 2017 in the Piauí nickel project is  
an example of this focus combined with our strategy of 
looking to add pre-production royalties which will offer high 
return potential over the years. Our principal objective, 
however, remains the acquisition of producing or near 
production royalty and streaming assets.
The team continues to be very disciplined in ensuring that 
acquisitions are of the highest quality in terms of project 
characteristics both technically and commercially and that we 
design transaction structures to optimise risk management.
CORPORATE CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE
Anglo Pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in  
all areas of its business. I believe this starts at the top.  
We broadened the agenda at our annual strategy day in 2017  
to include sessions on strategy, including corporate social 
responsibility, risk and board effectiveness. These sessions 
were primarily facilitated by industry experts who brought  
an objective and impartial insight as to how the Board 
approaches these areas in executing its strategy.  
Whilst we acknowledge that we are not directly responsible 
for the operation of many of the underlying assets in our 
portfolio, we are committed to making the pursuit of best 
practice in environmental, social and community, human 
rights, health and safety and diversity matters a high priority.
BOARD
We were disappointed to announce in February 2018 that 
Rachel Rhodes had decided not to put herself forward for 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM due to the ever-increasing 
time commitments of her other roles. Rachel has played an 
enormous part in the success of the Company over the past 
few years, and we will miss her valuable sector insights and 
views. We have commenced the process to find a suitable 
replacement. Mike Blyth has assumed the role of chair of  
the audit committee.
Since taking over from Mike Blyth as Chairman at the 2017 
AGM, I have been actively seeking to help drive the growth of 
the business on which the whole team is focused. The other 
Directors bring different skills to the table and, I believe, enable 
the Board to operate effectively with appropriate diversity of 
approach whilst operating the various Board Committees with 
the independence expected of us as a listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
I am indebted to Mike Blyth for his efforts during his tenure  
as Chairman to ensure we have robust corporate governance 
structures and culture in place. I am delighted that he has 
agreed to continue as a Director such that we may still benefit 
from his wise counsel.  
OUR STRATEGIC REPORT
Our 2017 Strategic Report, from pages 08 to 43, was reviewed 
and approved by the Board on March 27, 2018.
OUTLOOK
2018 should be a year of continued growth for Anglo Pacific  
as production at our key assets continues to demonstrate 
strength and as new assets make their contribution.  
Much, however, will depend on how prices move during the 
year.  In addition, as confidence returns to the mining sector, 
fresh opportunities will arise. We have shown our ability to be 
innovative and imaginative in our approach to the Denison 
and Piaui opportunities and believe that such an approach  
will continue to bear fruit in the year ahead.
In conclusion, I should like to thank all Directors and the entire 
executive team led by Julian Treger for their continued 
diligence and hard work during the year.
On behalf of the Board

CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S STATEMENT
The business review on pages 25 to 36 and the finance review 
on pages 37 to 41, will provide the detail behind the significant 
increase in our KPIs during the year and a review of the 
performance and progress at the underlying operations over 
which we have royalties. As such, the following is my summary 
on the market, our focus for the year and some comments  
on the dividend.
MARKET OUTLOOK
The recovery of the mining sector has continued over the past 
year with prices generally rising. Despite being clearly in the 
upward phase of the cycle, there is still a good window for 
Anglo Pacific to make investments which will provide good 
returns in the coming years and we intend to take advantage 
of this opportunity.
Fortunately, our area of focus is also one of the most 
promising for commodity investment. The world is finally, for 
the first time in a decade, in a moment of coordinated global 
growth. The beneficiary of this will be the base and bulk 
materials which we specialise in and where demand is driven 
by GDP growth. Even more positively, the developments in 
new technologies such as electric vehicles and improved 
battery storage should create significant incremental demand 
for associated materials. In contrast to this positive demand 
picture, the supply side can be expected to be constrained for 
a number of years, first by the general lack of investment in 
new mines over the past five years but also by the continued 
relative scarcity of finance for new projects even today. The 
result should be an extenuated cycle longer than the previous 
one where Anglo Pacific, as a supplier of scarce capital to the 
sector, should be able to capture enhanced returns. 
Within this context, we will continue to focus on base 
commodities like copper, nickel and zinc where we see visible 
industrial demand and deficits which could be increased by 
new technologies. We will also focus on alloys which can be 
used for light weighting and more specialised commodities 
such as vanadium, which we already have exposure to, and 
where we believe demand will outstrip supply. 
Opportunistically, we will look at bulks where we believe the 
price and risk equation is attractive.
In contrast, we believe many commodities are already in the 
upper range of their pricing and have more downside risk  
than upside, and we will be avoiding them. This includes gold 
which, though a beneficiary of inflation, may underperform in 
a situation where cryptocurrency alternative abounds, and 
interest rates increase holding costs. In addition materials 
such as lithium, are temporarily in short supply but we will 
need to model opportunities very conservatively for longer 
term investment given longer-term supply prospects.
THE FOCUS FOR THE 
YEAR AHEAD IS FIRMLY 
ON GROWING AND 
DIVERSIFYING THE 
PORTFOLIO
Anglo Pacific delivered on its guidance 
during the year. Including the cash received 
from our Denison investment, our income 
more than doubled, the third consecutive 
year in which it has done so. With less 
organic revenue growth expected in 2018, 
the focus for the year ahead is firmly on 
growing and diversifying the portfolio.  
With a strong balance sheet and improved 
market fundamentals, we believe we are  
well placed to deliver innovative and 
accretive transactions in the year ahead.

08 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 COAL OUTLOOK
The continuing strength of coal pricing has surprised many, 
particularly in the U.K. who had believed the commodity to be 
ex growth. In fact, coal consumption continues to increase in 
absolute terms though coal's share of the global energy mix is 
slowly declining. Demand for energy coal, particularly in the 
East, is being fuelled by higher demand for grid power from 
new sources like electric vehicles.  At the same time, supply  
is being squeezed, first by the Chinese restrictions on low 
quality product which seem to be a permanent feature of the 
market, but also because of continued depletion of mines 
without any sizable investment in bringing on new capacity. 
As a result, we expect coal prices to be higher for longer than 
the market consensus (which is rising already).
Within the coal complex, we have always argued for longer-
term exposure to the higher quality less polluting material 
which, we believe, will serve to reduce pollution quicker than 
the impact which the gradual introduction of clean 
technology will achieve in the medium term. The Chinese 
policy is supportive of this trend and, in the market, we have 
observed higher discounts or premia being applied to lower  
or higher quality products. We are pleased that our exposure  
is to premium cleaner product and are comfortable with our 
ongoing strategy of reducing, exposure to this commodity.
STR ATEGY
Consistent with the above market view and our enhanced 
balance sheet, we intend to accelerate our rate of growth in 
transforming Anglo Pacific into the preferred royalty vehicle 
for twenty first century commodities. There is a gap in the 
market to be a derisked mode of providing exposure to the 
raw material for new technologies and Anglo Pacific, as the 
only truly global non-precious metals royalty company, is  
well placed to occupy this niche. We believe that as we 
continue to execute on this pivot, the rating of the Company 
should increase.  
Given our confident outlook, we are also prepared at this  
stage of the cycle to take slightly more risk and also to invest 
more in growth. We announced last year a new strategy to 
include development royalties as a new minor focus for  
our investments. We are pleased to have executed one of 
these and would hope for more in the current year. These 
investments should be largely funded through cash on  
hand. We have also decided to consider exposure to new 
geographies such as South America, Africa and Eastern 
Europe. However, we are unlikely to compound risk by 
investing in development opportunities in these countries, 
instead we will focus on operating assets.
From a financing perspective, with a strong balance sheet  
and income, we will seek to fund transactions by using our 
cash and by leveraging our balance sheet in the first instance. 
We have an undrawn revolving credit facility and believe this 
can be comfortably expanded whilst retaining low borrowing 
metrics. Should we come across larger transformative deals, 
we will consider other sources of finance.
DIVIDEND
Although our focus is on investing in growth at this stage  
of the cycle (and shareholders should thus expect ongoing 
higher due diligence costs), we will seek to balance this  
with continuing to pay a proportion of this growth to our 
shareholders in the form of progressive dividends.  
We announced an overhaul in our dividend structure during 
2017 which created quarterly payments, reduced the period 
between announcement and payment by almost three 
months, and created a flexible final quarter dividend.  
This was well received by shareholders. 
We put this policy into action with the recommendation 
(subject to shareholder approval) of a final dividend for the 
year of 2.5p per share which increased the level of total 
dividends for the year from 6p in 2016 to 7p for the year just 
gone. We have also reset the level of the quarterly interim 
dividends from 1.5p to 1.625p per share, meaning that the  
run rate for 2018 has increased from 6p to 6.5p per share,  
with any overall increase for 2018 being reserved for the final 
quarter. As such, and on a cash basis, shareholders will actually 
receive 7.375p per share in the next 12 months.
We believe this dividend policy strikes the right balance at this 
stage of the cycle between returns to shareholders and 
investing in growth.
OUTLOOK
We enter 2018 in a position of strength, having enjoyed a 
record 2017. Strong earnings have translated directly into cash 
flow, we are debt free and see many opportunities in what is 
still a capital constrained sector. We expect to generate 
significant cash as commodity prices continue to remain at 
much higher levels than anticipated even just 12 months ago. 
With less organic revenue growth anticipated in 2018, our 
focus is to accelerate the growth of our asset base by 
acquiring royalties which provide immediate cash flow or the 
potential to deliver significant growth over the longer term.

through to 2018 with miners having returned to financial stability 
and regained a positive growth outlook. Additionally, battery related 
materials, particularly vanadium, cobalt, lithium, nickel and

10 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 On the demand side, better than expected economic 
activity in China, combined with Chinese Government 
environmental initiatives which resulted in cutbacks in 
domestic Chinese processing and mining output, were 
prominent drivers of underlying commodity prices in 2017. 
Closures in iron ore mining and anticipated higher vanadium 
requirements in Chinese reinforcement steel were key factors 
behind the ~75% YoY increase in the price of vanadium over 
the course of 2017. 
Supply side constraints also played a role in dictating 
commodity pricing dynamics; in particular coal, where 
lower Chinese production and logistical disruptions arising 
from seasonal factors, in particular Cyclone Debbie in April, 
which sent coking coal prices to a year high of US$314/t.  
Such supply side constraints were a key feature for many 
other commodities in 2017, including zinc, which hit its 
highest level in a decade (+32% YoY), aluminium (+34% YoY), 
and lead which rose to a six year high (+29% YoY). 
A further theme that has supported underlying prices  
in certain commodities is speculation over future 
electric vehicle (EV) demand. Copper, in particular, hit a 
three-year high (+33% YoY) off the back of net long positioning  
in the futures market as well as supply side disruptions 
(Escondida, Grasberg) and strong Chinese demand.  
Cobalt also saw significant price gains (+130% YoY) from a 
combination of EV demand and long expected structural  
supply issues. 
Stronger commodity pricing has helped strengthen 
balance sheets in 2017 with many of the majors choosing to 
increase capital return to shareholders via share buybacks and 
dividends. Capital discipline remained intact across the sector 
as companies focused on controlling capital expenditure and 
minimising operational costs. Companies largely opted to 
de-lever, with an estimated 15%  reduction in net debt across 
the sector. 
M&A deal value in the sector rose to US$51bn in 2017 
(+15% YoY), its highest level since 2013, despite the 
number of transactions falling by 6% YoY. However, portfolio 
realignment was a key driver of M&A related activity, as 
diversified producers looked to divest non-core assets in 
favour of leaner, more consolidated portfolios. 
This divestment trend opened up opportunities for 
financial investors, who were responsible for 22% of deal 
activity in 2017. Private equity investors showed a preference 
for copper, which saw ~70% of investment, with Africa being 
the most popular jurisdiction, seeing 13 deals, totalling 
US$1,036m (45%; 2017). The strong performances of coking 
and thermal coal in 2016 similarly led to large increases in  
deal flow, with coal acquisitions growing 156% YoY and steel 
transactions doubling in value to US$3.8bn. 
Deal activity in the exploration space was also 
significantly more popular in 2017 with a total of 31 
transactions, up from six in 2016. China continued to be a key 
driver of M&A activity at ~28% (2017) of value, closely followed 
by North America which captured ~25% (2017) of deal volume 
and led by number of transactions. 
Rising commodity prices have also had an impact on 
equity valuations. In 2017 IPO and secondary market 
activity rose to its highest level in six years with US$2.8bn  
and US$30.7bn raised respectively. 
Demand for debt instruments remained relatively 
unchanged, despite the easing of credit conditions with 
US$218bn raised, similar to the US$219bn recorded in 2016. 
Convertible bonds remained less prevalent, accounting for  
1% (2017) of new capital. 
Alternative financing options, such as mineral royalties 
and metal streams, continue to be a popular and well 
supported form of raising capital, especially in the mid to 
junior end of the mining sector. Our view is that the availability 
of traditional financing such as equity for development 
projects, or debt, will remain constrained in the near term. 
Anglo Pacific Group, through its current focus on bulks, base 
metal and battery material royalties and streams, enjoys a 
financing space which is far less crowded than its precious 
metals focused peers, and we continue to see a considerable 
number of new opportunities.
Looking towards 2018, we expect a continuation of the 
battery materials theme to drive an increasing proportion of 
M&A in mining and capital markets activity. Demand for these 
materials is predicted by some analysts to grow exponentially 
due to government commitments to shift to electric vehicles, 
and carmakers looking to lock-in longer-term access to 
materials supply. Whilst some investors remain wary on 
battery materials given price volatility, lithium assets in lower 
political risk regions such as South America and Australia 
should see growing interest, whilst cobalt assets outside of the 
Democratic Republic of Congo are likely to be of interest given 
the challenges posed in that country. The DRC’s heightened 
risk profile is driven in part by the recently revised mining code 
which includes increases in mining royalties, the government 
free carry and also an excess-profits tax, in addition to the 
re-designation of cobalt as a strategic metal.
The mining market outlook for 2018 remains broadly 
positive as commentators expect underlying commodity 
prices to remain strong, balance sheets to continue improving 
and equity valuations to tend towards mid-cycle multiples.  
A major driver for 2018 will be continued supply-side 
constraints driven in part by Chinese environmental reform 
initiatives which should continue to negatively impact supply. 
The political backdrop in key producing and trading countries 
will also increasingly impact sentiment towards the sector, 
especially as a potential trade war emerges between the US 
and China. Overall, volatility in 2018 should help surface 
attractive growth opportunities for Anglo Pacific.

12 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK HOW WE CREATE VALUE  
FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Our most recent investments (Narrabri, Maracás 
Menchen, the Denison financing arrangement  
and Piauí) demonstrate, by adhering to exacting 
investment criteria and conducting rigorous due 
diligence, how management has created value for 
shareholders to date. We will look to leverage this 
experience and our reputation in the market to 
execute our strategy over the coming years. 
Generating long-term cash returns 
The Group is seeking to grow its portfolio of cash-generative 
royalties and streams by investing in producing or near-term 
producing assets with long mine lives. Given the relatively low 
overhead requirements of the business, the Group believes cash 
flow to shareholders can be maximised through economies of 
scale, which would allow for growth in the portfolio without 
significantly increasing our cost base.
Lower risk through top-line, revenue participation in 
mining companies 
Revenue-based royalties limit the Group’s direct exposure to 
operating or capital cost inflation of the underlying mine 
operations, as there is no ongoing requirement for the Group  
to contribute to capital, exploration, environmental or other 
operating costs at mine sites. 
Lower volatility through commodity and geographic 
diversification 
The Group is seeking to build a diversified portfolio of royalties 
across a variety of different commodities and geographic 
locations. Investing in royalties across a wide spectrum of 
commodities and jurisdictions reduces the dependency on any 
one asset or location and any corresponding cyclicality. A fully 
diversified portfolio can help to reduce the level of income 
volatility, stabilising cash flows which contribute towards 
investment and dividend payments.
Exposure to increases in mineral reserves and production 
Royalty holders generally benefit from improvements made to the 
scale of a mining operation. Exploration success, or lower cut-off 
grades as a result of rising commodity prices, can serve to increase 
economic reserves and resources. Increased reserves will extend a 
mine’s life, or facilitate an expansion of the existing operations. Any 
subsequent increases in production will generally result in higher 
royalty payments, without the requirement of the royalty holder to 
contribute to the cost of expanding or optimising the operation.  
Exposure to commodity price upside 
Royalties and streams provide exposure to underlying commodity 
prices. The Group expects to benefit from a rising commodity price 
environment, with the upside feeding through to increased royalty 
receipts.
HOW WE CREATE VALUE  
FOR OUR COUNTERPARTIES
An investment by Anglo Pacific, after conducting 
thorough due diligence, is seen as an endorsement  
of the project, which can provide other stakeholders 
with greater confidence and possibly result in a 
re-rating for the operator.
We serve as a partner to the mine operator 
Royalties and streams reduce the upfront capital required to fund 
the development of a project. These are generally structured as 
asset (or even by-product) specific, often leaving the remaining 
assets of the operator unencumbered for raising additional 
finance.   
An alternative form of financing to conventional equity, 
which can be an expensive form of finance 
Compared to the issuance of new equity, royalties and streams do 
not depend on the prevailing state of the capital markets but are 
rather the result of bilateral negotiations. The issuance of new 
equity can also serve to dilute existing shareholders, particularly 
during periods of depressed share prices. Furthermore, as royalties 
and streams are asset specific, the reduction in the upside for 
existing shareholders can be limited to a certain mine or product.   
PRIMARY ROYALTIES
Alternative form of finance to conventional debt providing 
greater flexibility and which does not impact on credit ratings 
Royalties and streams do not typically levy interest, nor do they 
typically require principal repayments or have a maturity date. 
More importantly, unlike conventional debt arrangements where 
interest payments tend to start immediately or are capitalised until 
cash payments can be made from a project’s cash flow, most 
royalties are payable only once the project comes into production 
and is generating sales. In addition, many forms of debt, such as 
project finance, include restrictive covenants and may require 
commodity price hedges to be put in place. These are not only 
typically costly in terms of fees, but can also limit the miner’s 
exposure to upside in the prices of their core commodities. 
SECONDARY ROYALTIES
Source of liquidity for holders of existing royalties 
The value of a royalty is realised over the duration of the mine life. 
Often royalty owners may have a need to free up cash in order to 
recycle capital. There is a limited secondary market for royalties 
and Anglo Pacific can be a source of valuable liquidity for private 
royalty holders.

APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK TRANSACTION HIGHLIGHTS 
Anglo Pacific Group entered into a royalty agreement 
with Brazilian Nickel Ltd (Brazilian Nickel) to acquire  
an initial 1% gross revenue royalty (GRR) over the Piauí 
nickel-cobalt project (Piauí or the Project) for a US$2m 
(~£1.6m) cash payment
The initial US$2m consideration part funded further 
project assessment and the expansion of the existing 
nickel-cobalt demonstration plant to a nameplate 
production capacity of 1,000 tonnes of nickel per annum
Once the process is proven at the 1,000 tonnes of 
nickel per annum level, Brazilian Nickel intends to 
ramp-up production to 24,000 tonnes, or alternatively 
Brazilian Nickel may pursue a lower-capex staged 
development first ramping-up to 10,000 tonnes and then  
to 24,000 tonnes of nickel per annum
Upon the achievement of certain Piauí development 
milestones and Anglo Pacific board approval for each 
tranche, the Company has the right to invest up to a total  
of US$70m (~£51.9m) in additional GRRs with proceeds 
restricted to funding in-part the construction or expansion  
of a processing facility:
Under the staged ramp-up development scenario:  
US$20m for an incremental 2.0% GRR when plans for  
the construction of a processing plant with a nameplate 
capacity of 10,000 tonnes of nickel per annum are 
implemented and US$50m for an incremental 2.5% GRR 
when plans to ramp-up to 24,000 tonnes of nickel per 
annum are implemented; OR 
US$70m for an incremental 3.0% GRR at the point when 
plans for the construction of a processing plant with a 
nameplate capacity of 24,000 tonnes of nickel per annum 
are implemented
The staged consideration approach allows for 
flexibility with regards to potential Piauí development 
scenarios as well as for the Project to be de-risked prior to 
Anglo Pacific proceeding with additional tranches
The transaction is in-line with the Company’s strategy 
to invest in development opportunities with significant 
growth potential to complement its existing portfolio of 
income producing assets.

17 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK BACKGROUND
Risk is integral to every aspect of the Group’s 
business model and how it executes on its 
strategy. We ensure that our investors 
understand our business model and how an 
investment in Anglo Pacific is different to 
investing in an operating company, albeit we 
address operating risk closely through our due 
diligence procedures. The Board is responsible 
for identifying, understanding and managing 
these risks. The Audit Committee is then tasked 
with overseeing how risk is being managed on  
a regular basis.  
RISK APPETITE AND VIABILITY
The Company is once again voluntarily complying 
with provision C2.2 of the 2014 Combined Code, 
which requires a statement on viability to be 
made in this report, including the determination 
and consideration of stress tested “severe but 
plausible” scenarios. This analysis was performed 
for a three-year period, consistent with the 
Group’s medium-term planning horizon and the 
term of its borrowing facility.
The viability statement, and underlying 
supporting papers, are intended to intertwine 
risk disclosure and going concern into a more 
meaningful discussion about the financial 
impact of principal risks. Risk can never be  
fully eliminated, but can be mitigated to a level 
which the Directors are prepared to accept as 
necessary to execute the Group’s strategy.
Although the ultimate success of Anglo Pacific 
will depend on its ability to continue to add value 
enhancing royalties and streams to its portfolio, 
the focus of the viability statement is on the 
existing business of the Group and the ability of 
the current royalty portfolio to generate 
sufficient cash to meet the Group’s outgoings, 
including the dividend. Under our “severe but 
plausible” case, this results in the Group drawing 
down on its borrowing facilities as income 
reduces. The Directors’ risk appetite is therefore 
capped with reference to an acceptable and 
supportable level of borrowings relative to the 
Group’s income profile over the next three years 
on a “severe but plausible” basis.
INTERACTION WITH STRATEGY
Risk is often perceived purely as a negative and 
associated with loss or prevention. In fact, for 
Anglo Pacific, the acceptance of a certain level 
of risk is part and parcel of its business model 
and is necessary in order to generate 
investment returns and can often present 
opportunities for growth. It is the point at which 
the Board determines to accept a higher or 
lower appetite for risk that is important in the 
context of the Group’s risk framework i.e. the 
Board should anticipate or acknowledge that an 
event has occurred which has altered the 
previously held position on risk.
We have seen this recently at Anglo Pacific, 
when the Board relaxed its investment criteria at 
the beginning of 2017 to include non-producing 
royalties. This was a function of the impact that 
the sudden recovery in commodity prices at the 
end of 2016 had on the Group’s cash position 
which enabled the Board to determine that it 
was prepared to accept more risk when 
investing modest amounts of surplus cash into 
royalties which have the potential to deliver 
superior returns over a longer time horizon – 
whilst still sticking to strict investment criteria 
(as outlined on page 14). Key to this was the view 
of the Board that the outlook for commodity 
prices was favourable, particularly in the 
commodities from which the Group currently 
derives most of its income. 
The Board also re-examined country risk, in light 
of any developments observed over the course 
of the last 12 months. It was decided that there 
are some countries, or regions, which have 
made considerable progress of late and which 
the Group could now consider investing in. This 
included certain countries in South America, 
Eastern Europe and Africa, although it is unlikely 
that the Group will compound risk by investing 
in non-income producing royalties in such 
jurisdictions. 
The Group’s risk framework is designed to 
identify instances such as these when the risk 
environment changes and there could be an 
impact on the Group’s business model or 
strategy, in addition to providing the basis for 
continuous and robust monitoring and 
management of risk.
ACTIVITY DURING 2017
The Board was keen to re-examine risk during 
2017, and made this a focal point of its annual 
strategy day, led by the Chairman. Keen to 
encourage an open dialogue and to avoid 
“group-think”, the session was facilitated by a 
risk expert from outside of the mining industry 
who was able to bring an impartial perspective 
to the debate. 
The Board and senior management were asked 
to list their “top three” principal risks in relation 
to the business model or strategy. From this list, 
the facilitator asked the Chairman and Company 
Secretary to compile a list of the top ten risks 
which resulted from this exercise. 
The following table summarises the top ten 
risks (in terms of impact on viability, not 
likelihood) as identified and agreed by the Board.

18 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 Having agreed on the principal risks, the Board 
wanted to ensure that it was addressing each 
risk appropriately and actively managing any risk 
exposure that is within the Board’s control. In 
order to do this, a mapping exercise was 
undertaken, assisted by the facilitator. Given the 
bespoke nature of the Group’s business model, 
and being one step removed from being in 
control of how the mines are operated, it 
became apparent that conventional mapping 
tools did not really apply to the Group. As such 
the matrix opposite was agreed upon as the 
most appropriate.
The template focuses on a “prediction vs 
control” concept. This acknowledges that the 
impact of market events (in the top right box) on 
the Group’s prospects, both pre and post-
acquisition, are both difficult to predict and, 
once occurred, are difficult to control. It is risks 
that fall into this category which are primarily 
outside of management’s ability to either 
manage or mitigate, other than by monitoring. 
Some risks which are easier to predict (i.e. 
operational and financial) can still be difficult to 
control, whilst the risks in the bottom two boxes 
can be more effectively managed. 
The table opposite demonstrates how there 
will always be a level of risk tolerated by the 
Board in executing the Group’s strategy. It also 
identifies techniques which management 
should be looking to implement when 
addressing risks which have some element to 
either control or predict. 
CONCLUSION
Monitoring risk is an ongoing process and not  
an annual exercise. In order to better govern this, 
the Board determined it appropriate that the risk 
matrix above be reviewed by the Board on a 
quarterly basis, with a more fulsome discussion 
on strategy and risk to occur twice a year. This, it 
is intended, should allow reporting against the 
green and amber risks along with a discussion 
where there have been changes in the market 
circumstances in the red box.
Taking into account the quantitative 
analysis performed around each risk 
identified above and having tested these 
scenarios under a “severe but plausible” 
set of criteria, the Directors conclude that 
they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their 
assessment. 
Characteristics Management / mitigation 2018 Action points
 • Difficult to predict outside  
of the short term
 • Tend to be driven by  
market forces or extreme 
localised events
Limited ability to manage  
or mitigate other than  
through ongoing  
monitoring
Increase 
frequency of 
monitoring with 
formal review 
twice a year
 • Easier to predict  
through regular cash  
flow projections, pipeline 
review and operator  
updates
 • Harder to control as 
dependent on 
counterparties
Increasing control is 
important, with regular 
dialogue with lenders and 
shareholders (both existing  
and potential) considered 
important in anticipating the 
availability of finance. 
Dialogue with counterparties  
is also equally important to 
discover any early warning  
signs of underperformance.
Continue to  
focus on operator 
performance  
and promote the 
business with 
potential new debt 
/ equity investors 
and seek 
alternative means 
of financing
 • Easier to control as  
the Board can influence 
strategic direction based  
on market conditions
 • Deal-flow is harder to  
predict 
Increasing prediction  
of strategic risks (deal-flow)  
is a core focus. The Group 
increased its marketing 
initiatives significantly  
in 2017.
Use the Group’s 
strong balance 
sheet to 
considerably 
increase deal-flow 
during 2018
 • Risks for which good 
governance and  
internal controls should  
limit any financial or 
reputational loss
Board Committees, along  
with the internal controls,  
are designed to mitigate  
and prevent loss due to 
operational events or 
mismanagement.
Zero-tolerance  
for escalation i.e. 
ensure that 
operational risk 
remains in the 
“green box”.

continued
Risk Possible cause Mitigation Management comment and actions
CATASTROPHIC EVENT
IMPACT : HIGH
A significant event which 
causes revenue to halt from 
one of the Group’s key 
income producing royalties 
would have a profound 
impact on the Group’s 
prospects.
LACK OF DEMAND  
FOR ROYALTIES
IMPACT : HIGH
In order to execute its 
strategy, the Group needs  
to acquire further royalties  
to ultimately replace the 
income from Kestrel.
Demand for royalties can 
change depending on 
macro-economic conditions 
at any point in the cycle.
 • Mine collapse
 • Natural disaster
 • Destruction of 
infrastructure
 • Resource nationalisation
 • Resource contamination
 • Failure by royalty 
counterparty to make 
payments
 • Improvement in 
commodity prices
 • Inflows into mining funds
 • Availability of debt
 • Demand for 
commodities
 • Global GDP growth
Monitor 
These risks, by their nature,  
are difficult to predict or 
influence.  The Board monitors 
its royalty portfolio and 
underlying performance 
regularly.
Monitor 
The Group monitors the 
market closely and pays close 
attention to trends and 
commentary.
Secondary royalties are less 
sensitive to market conditions 
and are generally available 
through the cycle.
LIKELIHOOD : REMOTE 
By continuing to focus on 
investing in well-established 
mining jurisdictions with stable 
political and geological history, 
along with investing in good 
operations and management, 
the Group can reduce the 
likelihood of the occurrence  
of this risk.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM / 
LOW 
Demand for royalties can  
never be predicted, but 
demand is usually greater  
when the underlying market 
conditions are challenging for 
small/mid-sized operators. 
We continue to see good 
demand for royalties and our 
pipeline is significantly 
developed for growth during 
2018.
INVESTMENT APPROVAL
IMPACT : MEDIUM
Anglo Pacific’s success will 
depend on the performance 
of the royalties acquired 
matching or exceeding 
expectations at the point  
of acquisition. 
The governance and due 
diligence process adopted  
by the Group when looking  
at each unique investment is 
key to reduce the risk of 
making a bad investment.
Misjudging:
 • Geology & technical 
process
 • Long-term commodity 
price assumption
 • Country risk
 • Time to production
 • Counterparty covenant
 • Economic viability 
(project or counterparty)
 • Tax regime
Thorough due diligence  
The Group has considerable  
in-house  technical, financial 
and tax expertise to identify 
potential fatal flaws and uses 
consultants to assist with due 
diligence.
The Board also has significant 
mining experience and 
constructively challenges 
management on the due 
diligence process.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM / 
LOW 
The current management  
team has demonstrated a  
track record of successful 
investments to date.  
Anglo Pacific has strict and 
exacting investment criteria 
and avoids overly competitive 
bidding processes where these 
could result in sub-optimal 
outcomes.
PIPELINE / SUPPLY
IMPACT : HIGH
The Group needs to be 
working several potential 
deals at any one point  
which requires constant 
replenishment of 
opportunities in its deal 
pipeline.
 • Ineffective marketing/
PR
 • Insufficiently networked
 • Size / financing 
credibility
Increase deal-flow 
The Group devotes a 
considerable amount of 
management time to 
marketing and attending  
trade shows and conferences 
with a view to identifying 
royalty opportunities.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM / 
LOW 
The Group has a significant 
global network of brokers, 
advisors and consultants who 
constantly bring deal-flow. In 
addition, our significant 
management and Board 
industry expertise enables us to 
identify opportunities internally.
The Group is confident that it 
has not lost out on any material 
deals during 2017, and is invited 
to participate in bidding 
processes on a regular basis.

INCREASED 
COMPETITION
IMPACT : MEDIUM
Anglo Pacific does not 
compete with the well 
established precious metals 
royalty companies, instead 
focusing on the base and bulk 
sector.
Competition can always arise, 
and Anglo Pacific is not 
complacent in driving the 
growth of its business.
 • Recovery in the mining 
sector
 • Inflows into private 
equity funds
 • Low bond yields entice 
life assurance / pension 
funds 
 • Change of focus from 
precious metal peers
Continue to scale 
Anglo Pacific has considerable 
first mover advantage in a 
capital-intensive business 
model, with a highly cash 
generative portfolio to 
leverage and facilitate growth.
It also has considerable 
contacts throughout the 
sector to generate deal-flow 
along with expertise in terms 
of appraising and valuing 
royalty transactions.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM / 
LOW 
Some direct competition exists 
but this has not had a material 
impact on our growth hitherto. 
With a focus on non-precious 
metals and being a permanent 
capital vehicle, management 
considers itself well placed to 
be an attractive partner for 
small/medium-sized operators. 
S T R AT E GI C O P E R AT I ON A L
MANAGEMENT 
PERFORMANCE
IMPACT : LOW
Ensuring that management is 
performing to the standards 
expected of them for the 
benefit of all stakeholders.
 • Underperformance
 • Unmotivated
 • Uncommitted
 • Lack of focus
Performance review
The Remuneration Committee 
undertakes a thorough review 
of performance each year, 
with any rewards being strictly 
granted upon demonstrated 
meeting of pre-agreed 
objectives.
In addition, the Board regularly 
undertakes an annual 
self-assessment, which was 
performed by a consultant 
during 2017 to identify any 
skills gaps or the way in which 
the Board works together.
LIKELIHOOD : LOW
Anglo Pacific is a small 
organisation in terms of 
headcount where everybody 
has to perform to the highest 
standards. 
Any underperformance would 
be readily evident and dealt 
with by the CEO and Board 
promptly.
OPERATIONAL 
MANAGEMENT
IMPACT : LOW
Inadequate attention to detail 
in managing the business.
 • Monitoring accuracy of 
royalty payments
 • Monitoring newsflow 
impacting counter-
parties
 • Lax cost control
 • Managing risky 
investment processes
 • Appropriateness and 
functioning of internal 
controls
 • Leadership
Maintaining high 
standards
The Group undertakes a 
thorough budgeting process 
each year which highlights the 
reasons for variances.
Costs are reported against 
budget on a monthly basis to 
identify timely instances of 
any unexpected expenditure. 
Management performance is 
monitored by the Board.
LIKELIHOOD : LOW
Management are committed to 
the highest standards of 
internal control, in running the 
Company to the standards 
which would be expected of a 
FTSE listed organisation in 
order to maximise shareholder 
returns.

OPERATOR  
DEPENDENCE
IMPACT : MEDIUM
The Group is dependent on 
the operators of the mines 
over which it has royalties to 
continue to honour royalty 
contracts and make timely 
and accurate royalty 
payments, and to continue  
to operate and finance their 
business in a sensible and 
responsible manner.
 • Market conditions
 • Poor CSR/environmental 
record
 • Overleveraging
 • Inaccurate royalty 
calculation
 • Non-payment/disputes
Diversify dependence
The best way the Group can 
mitigate dependence on any 
one operator is to continue  
to expand and diversify its 
royalty portfolio to ensure that 
it has a well-balanced source 
of income.
APG has audit rights which  
it generally exercises on the 
identification of any 
unexpected royalty outcome.
The Group tries to insert 
change of control clauses into 
its new royalty agreements to 
ensure its exposure is to 
counterparties of good 
reputation.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM
The Group has a good 
relationship with most of the 
underlying operators and aims 
to visit site at least once every 
second year.
FINANCING  
CAPABILITY
IMPACT : MEDIUM / HIGH
The Group is dependant on 
access to capital in order to 
finance its growth ambitions.
 • Sudden adverse  
change in equity market 
conditions   
 • The Group’s cost of 
capital makes executing 
accretive deals more 
challenging
 • Production issues or 
significant price volatility 
could adversely impact 
on the Group’s borrowing 
capacity
 • Execution risk through 
inadequate immediate 
access to finance
High quality deal-flow
It is managements’ view that 
high quality, accretive deals 
should always be capable of 
being financed. We regularly 
meet with advisors,  
shareholders and lenders to 
discuss the types of deals we 
are looking at to gauge their 
support.
We will look to finance 
non-income producing 
royalties primarily from our 
internal resources.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM
Our record income year in 2017, 
along with being debt free and 
cash generative, naturally 
increases the financing 
capability of the Group.
Given the strength of the 
balance sheet and the outlook 
for 2018, we believe we have 
higher debt capacity and will 
look to use internal resources 
before needing to rely on 
equity markets to finance 
opportunities.

CREDIT RISK
IMPACT : LOW
That there is a risk of default 
by those owing the Group 
money or those institutions 
holding the Group’s cash 
reserves.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE  
RISK
IMPACT : MEDIUM/LOW
That foreign exchange 
movements adversely impact 
on the Group’s cash flow 
projections.
INTEREST RATE  
RISK
IMPACT : LOW
That an increase in interest 
rates could adversely impact 
on the Group’s prospects.
COMMODITY AND  
OTHER PRICING RISK
IMPACT : HIGH
The Group’s results are 
determined by other pricing 
inputs which could result in 
unrealised losses at each 
reporting date.
 • Royalty payment default
 • Bank collapse
 • Cash flow risk associated 
with dollar derived 
income and costs 
(including dividend) 
largely payable in pounds
 • Translation risk of  
having a presentational 
currency in GBP but 
assets denominated  
in A$
 • Financing risk when 
raising equity in GBP to 
fund dollar denominated 
acquisitions
 • The Group is exposed to 
the US and UK LIBOR rate 
as part of its bank facility
 • The Group’s asset values 
are underpinned by the 
forward commodity 
price outlook at each 
reporting date.  
A decline in these prices 
could result in further 
impairment or 
revaluation charges
 • The Group has a portfolio 
of certain publicly 
quoted equity 
investments which are 
marked to market at 
each reporting date
The Group operates  
controlled treasury policies 
which spreads the 
concentration of the Group’s 
cash balances amongst 
separate financial institutions 
with sufficiently high credit 
ratings.
The Board approved a 
currency hedging policy  
which looks to protect a 
significant amount of the 
Group’s next 12 month 
expected royalty income. 
Under the policy, the Group 
can hedge up to 70% of the 
next quarter’s income, 60% of 
the second quarter followed 
by 30% and 25% thereafter.
The Group has a relatively  
low level of borrowings and,  
as such, interest rate risk is  
not considered material  
when assessing the Group’s 
longer-term prospects.
The Group uses independent 
third party consensus prices  
at each reporting date in 
assessing for impairment. 
The Group’s equity portfolio 
has largely been divested, 
meaning any future 
impairment should be much 
less material to the Group.
LIKELIHOOD : LOW
The risk of counterparty default 
is assessed when entering into 
new royalty agreements. The 
Directors are confident that the 
royalties, which represent the 
majority of the Group’s 
receivables, are at relatively low 
risk of default due to the nature 
of the operators involved.
LIKELIHOOD : MEDIUM
Management engaged with a 
specialist consultant during the 
year to review foreign exchange 
risk. The review concluded that 
the Group’s policy is, by and 
large, sufficient. Commodity 
price risk is the primary risk and 
the objective is to keep foreign 
exchange as a secondary risk.
LIKELIHOOD : LOW
Interest rates currently remain 
at low levels, although they 
have been rising recently. This 
could impact on the cost of the 
Group’s capital when acquiring 
future royalties.
LIKELIHOOD : HIGH
The Group is exposed to 
commodity prices and a 
significant decrease in 
commodity prices is likely to 
result in further impairment 
charges.
At this stage the Board does  
not hedge against specific 
commodity risk, and will 
continue to review this position 
in light of commodity prices.

It is a policy of the Group to pay a significant portion of its 
royalty income as dividends. Just as important as maintaining 
the dividend is maintaining the quality of the dividend. 
Dividend cover is calculated as the number of times adjusted 
earnings per share exceeds the dividend per share.  
(refer to note 12 for further details)
In any period where there is an adjusted loss, the dividend 
cover will be reported as nil.
The structure of a number of the Group’s royalty financing 
arrangements, such as the Denison transaction completed  
in February 2017, result in a significant amount of cash flow 
being reported as principal repayments, which are not included 
in the income statement.  As the Group considers dividend 
cover based on the free cash flow generated by its assets, 
management has determined that free cash flow per share  
is a key performance indicator, going forward.
Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing net cash 
generated from operating activities, plus proceeds from the 
disposal of non-core assets and any cash considered as 
repayment of principal, less finance costs by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue.  
(refer to note 33 for further details)
The Group’s strategy is to acquire royalties which will be 
accretive and in turn enable dividend growth. The chart  
shows how much the Group invested in royalty acquisitions  
in each period.
Royalty income reflects the revenue from the Group’s 
underlying royalty and streaming assets on an accruals basis. 
(refer to note 4 for further details)
Adjusted earnings per share excludes any non-cash valuation 
movements, impairments, amortisation and share-based 
payment expenses.
It also adjusts for any profits or losses which are realised from 
the sale of equity instruments within the mining and 
exploration interests.
Valuation and other non-cash movements such as these are 
not considered by management in assessing the level of profit 
and cash generation available for distribution to shareholders.  
As such, an adjusted earnings measure is used which reflects 
the underlying contribution from the Group’s royalties during 
the year.
Adjusted earnings divided by the weighted average number  
of shares in issue gives adjusted earnings per share.

APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK WHAT WE OWN 
Kestrel is an underground coal mine 
located in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, 
Australia. It is operated by Rio Tinto 
Limited (‘Rio Tinto’). The Group owns 50% 
of certain sub-stratum lands which, 
under Queensland law, entitle it to coal 
royalty receipts from the Kestrel mine. 
The royalty rate to which the Group is 
presently entitled is prescribed by the 
Queensland Mineral Resources 
Regulations. These regulations currently 
stipulate that the basis of calculation is  
a three-tiered fixed percentage of the 
invoiced value of the coal as follows:
Average price per tonne for period Rate
UP TO AND INCLUDING A$100  7%
OVER A$100 AND UP TO  
AND INCLUDING A$150 FIRST A$100  7% 
 BALANCE  12.5%
MORE THAN A$150 FIRST A$100  7% 
 NEXT A$50  12.5% 
 BALANCE  15%
PERFORMANCE
The Group received royalty income of 
£28.7m from Kestrel during 2017, an 
increase of 119% compared to £13.1m in 
2016 and £3.6m in 2015. The significant 
increase in royalty income in 2017 was due 
to a combination of higher overall tons 
sold, a much higher portion of these sales 
from production within the Group’s private 
royalty land (see below), higher average 
realised prices and a favourable exchange 
gain on translating the Australian dollar 
income into pounds (average rate in 2017: 
1.6811; 2016: 1.8252). 
OUTLOOK 
In accordance with Anglo Pacific’s 
Kestrel information rights, the Group 
estimates that 90%+ of mining at Kestrel 
will be within our royalty lands during 
2018 (2017: 93%, 2016: 67%).
Overall production from Kestrel in 2017 
was 5.1mt, which was slightly ahead of  
the 4.9mt produced in the previous year. 
With life of mine ROM guidance of 5.7mt 
per annum, there remains some growth 
to come in terms of volumes from Kestrel.
VALUATION
The Kestrel royalty was independently 
valued at A$180.2m (£104.3m) and 
accounts for 41% of the Group’s total 
assets as at December 31, 2017 (2016: 
A$200.3m; £116.9m; 46%). Having 
generated £28.7m of income from Kestrel 
during the year, the decrease in valuation 
of £12.6m means that resource depletion 
has been offset somewhat by a revision to 
forward price assumptions, with the 
consensus view showing that the 
long-term price for coal has increased by 
6% compared to the end of 2016.   
The decrease in the valuation of Kestrel 
resulted in a loss of £11.9m (2016: gain 
£17.9m) on the income statement, 
together with a foreign currency 
translation loss of £0.7m (2016: gain 
£16.3m). The value of the land is 
calculated by reference to the discounted 
expected royalty income from mining 
activity, as described in note 14. 
The independent valuation has been 
undertaken by a Competent Person in 
accordance with the Valmin Code 
(AusIMM, 2005), which provides guidelines 
for the preparation of independent expert 
valuation reports. The Group monitors the 
accuracy of this valuation by comparing 
the actual cash received to that forecasted.
As the asset has a nominal cost base, the 
carrying value virtually represents the 
valuation surplus. The Group recognises  
a deferred tax provision against the 
valuation surplus and, as such, the net 
value on the balance sheet is £75.1m 
(2016: £82.4m).

26 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 THE NARRABRI MINE HAS SCOPE TO 
MATERIALLY INCREASE PRODUCTION 
OVER THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM
WHAT WE OWN
In March 2015, the Group acquired a 
royalty interest in the Narrabri coal 
project, a low cost thermal coal and 
pulverised coal injection (‘PCI’) coal mine 
located in New South Wales, Australia, 
operated by ASX-listed Whitehaven Coal 
Limited (‘Whitehaven’). The Narrabri 
royalty entitles the Group to royalty 
payments equal to 1% of gross revenue 
on all coal produced from within the area 
covered by the Narrabri royalty. The 
Narrabri royalty includes the Narrabri 
mine, and the Narrabri South project.
The Narrabri mine has scope to increase 
production over the short and medium 
term, following Whitehaven’s approval to 
expand production to 11Mt per annum. 
Whitehaven estimates Narrabri to have a 
reserve based mine life of 25 years, and the 
potential to extend production thereafter 
with the development of Narrabri South.
PERFORMANCE
Production continues to be impacted  
by a fault which runs through a portion  
of the deposit, as announced by 
Whitehaven at the start of 2017. They  
are also experiencing changing roof 
conditions in certain parts of the 
longwall which is also slowing down 
production rates. 
As such, Whitehaven revised its guidance 
for FY 2017 (12 months ended June 30, 
2017) downwards by ~0.5mt. Actual ROM 
produced was just below guidance. 
Bringing these numbers into a calendar 
year, and translating to sales, Narrabri 
posted sales of 6.7mt in 2017, which was 
down on 7.8mt in 2016.
Importantly for Anglo Pacific, the pricing 
environment was favourable over this 
period, such that price more than 
compensated for the reduced volumes 
allowing Anglo Pacific to show an 
increase in royalty income of 17%.
Whitehaven noted an increase in 
demand for higher quality thermal coal 
along with some supply disruptions in 
South East Asia combined to support a 
higher price for seaborne Australian 
thermal coal over the past 12 months. 
Whitehaven considers the outlook for 
thermal coal in the short to medium 
term to be favourable.
OUTLOOK 
Whitehaven has reduced its guidance  
for FY 2018 from 8.0-8.4mt to 6.0-6.5mt, 
reflecting the geotechnical issues noted 
above. It has guided production levels of 
7.7mt for FY 2019 and 7.0mt for FY 2020. 
Whitehaven is a supplier of some of the 
highest quality coal globally. Many of its 
customers operate high efficiency low 
emission (HELE) technologies, particularly 
in South East Asia. Combining high quality 
coal with HELE technology, Whitehaven 
believes, will have a positive impact on  
air pollution. It sees considerable growth  
in this technology which should ensure 
good demand for their products in the 
longer term.
Source: Whitehaven 2017 Annual Report pages 20-23
VALUATION
The Narrabri royalty is classified as a 
royalty intangible asset on the balance 
sheet.  As such, this asset is carried at 
cost less amortisation and impairments 
and does not benefit from any valuation 
uplift resulting from the positive 
developments in the year as described 
above. Its carrying value does however 
reflect the impact of translation from 
Australian dollars to pounds which, at the 
year-end, resulted in a favourable uplift. 
Royalty intangible assets are amortised 
when commercial production 
commences, on a straight-line basis over 
the expected life of the mine.

WHAT WE OWN
The Group has a 2% NSR royalty on all 
mineral products sold from the area of the 
Maracás Menchen project to which the 
royalty interest relates. The project is located 
250km south-west of the city of Salvador,  
the capital of Bahia State, Brazil and covers an 
area in excess of the current permits which 
offers the Group the potential for some 
exploration upside. Maracás Menchen is 
99.97% owned and operated by TSX listed 
Largo Resources Limited (‘Largo’). 
PERFORMANCE
Largo has had a very strong year,  
regularly posting record levels of monthly 
production at Maracás Menchen. This has 
coincided with a notable recovery in the 
price of vanadium pentoxide (‘V
2
O
5
’) during 
2017. As a result, the Group’s revenue 
increased from £0.8m in 2016 to £2.0m  
in 2017, a 155% increase. 
Largo announced a record quarter of 
production for Q4 2017 of 2,539 tonnes, 
which was 5.8% above the nameplate 
capacity of the plant. Total production for 
2017 was 9,297 tonnes, a 17% increase 
from the previous year.  
The chart (left) shows the progress Largo has 
made since they commenced commercial 
production at the beginning of 2015.
Largo has been achieving steady 
production since Q2 2016, with a slight 
reduction at the start of 2017 reflecting a 
planned 20 day shut down of the plant to 
perform improvement works.
The chart also shows the strong recovery  
in vanadium prices over the past 18 months 
or so. Largo, one of the lowest cost global 
pure play producers of vanadium has, at  
the same time, managed to considerably 
reduce its costs, meaning at current prices  
it is highly profitable at operating level. V
2
O
5
 
prices were approximately $10/lb at the  
end of 2017 and have traded above these 
levels in 2018. 
The strength of production at Maracás 
Menchen during the year resulted in the 
first US$1.5m tranche of the deferred 
consideration becoming due and payable  
in November 2017. This amount had been 
expected to become payable for some time, 
and was fully provided for at December 31, 
2016. A further payment of US$1.5m would 
be payable if production reaches an 
annualised rate over a quarter of 12,000t.  
Based on the current guidance, however, 
the Directors do not consider this probable 
and as such no liability has been recognised.
VANADIUM PRICING AND OUTLOOK
The vanadium market is relatively small and 
pricing opaque. That said, the fundamentals 
behind pricing, both in terms of supply and 
demand, currently look favourable. V
2
O
5
 
prices increased by 130% over the past year 
due to tightened supply, stricter steel 
regulations in China and strong orders from 
steel manufacturers. 
On the supply side, a lot was taken out of 
the market when lower quality Chinese 
iron ore mines were forced to shut over 
the last 12 months. Vanadium is often a 
by-product of iron ore, with 70% of the 
global supply coming from slag generated 
in Russia and China. 
A significant amount of supply came off 
the market with the Highveld operation in 
South Africa, Atlantic Vanadium and MVPL 
going into administration in 2015, although 
the fall in prices around that time was, in 
our view, most likely down to product 
being dumped onto the market following 
the closure of mines. As a result, the supply 
side pressure has come out of the market 
somewhat over the past few years.
On the demand side, the Chinese 
environmental closures coincided with 
relatively low stock levels prompting a 
price spike. In addition, in the second half 
of 2017 it appeared that there was a shift 
in demand for higher rebar quality steel in 
China, following the collapse of buildings 
constructed using weaker steel in recent 
earthquakes. This was confirmed by Largo 
on February 9, 2018 which it expected to 
result in higher demand for high strength 
low alloy vanadium steel. 
Longer term, vanadium has also been 
proven to be highly efficient in the 
manufacture and performance of large 
battery storage technology. This could 
provide a very significant secondary use 
for vanadium and alter the supply 
demand profile even more favourably 
towards producers in what is already a 
tight market for steel demand. 
 VALUATION
The Maracás Menchen royalty is classified 
as a royalty intangible asset on the balance 
sheet. As such, this asset is carried at cost 
less amortisation and impairments.  
Royalty intangible assets are amortised 
when commercial production 
commences, on a straight-line basis over 
the expected life of the mine.

28 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 WHAT WE OWN
The Group has a 2.5% life of mine NSR 
royalty on the EVBC gold, copper and 
silver mine owned by TSX-listed Orvana 
Minerals Corp (‘Orvana’). EVBC is located 
in the Rio Narcea Gold Belt of northern 
Spain and was previously mined from 
1997 to 2006 by Rio Narcea Gold Mines. 
The royalty rate increases to 3% when  
the gold price is over US$1,100 per ounce.
PERFORMANCE
The Group received royalty income of 
£1.7m from EVBC during the past year. 
This compares to £1.2m received in 2016.  
Orvana achieved a much better outcome  
in 2017, with gold production up 24% and 
copper production up 44%. 
The production increases achieved during 
2017 followed investment by Orvana in 
infrastructure and equipment over the 
course of the last 18 months. Increased 
production and throughput helped to 
compensate for declining grades during 
the year. Orvana are focused on increasing 
the proportion of high grade ore being fed 
to the process plant during FY 2018. 
Orvana sustained a mill throughput rate  
of over 2, 000t per day in the second half  
of their FY 2017, matching those reported 
in December 2016. 
OUTLOOK
Using a midpoint range, Orvana is guiding 
gold production of 68,500oz for FY 2018 
(to September 30, 2018), which would 
represent an increase of 32.9% on FY 2017.  
Orvana is also targeting near mine 
exploration at the Carles Mine, with 
2,700m of infill drilling undertaken during 
FY 2017, along with 23,000m at El Valle.  
It is also continuing to explore greenfield 
expansion on the investigation permits 
which are located adjacent to the EVBC 
mine. As such, we remain of the view that 
there is a good prospect of mine life 
extension at EVBC.
Anglo Pacific earns a royalty over all 
throughput from the EVBC process plant 
and is not restricted to licence geographic 
boundaries. 
VALUATION
The EVBC royalty is classified as an 
available-for-sale equity financial asset 
within royalty financial instruments on 
the balance sheet.  As such, the asset is 
carried at fair value by reference to the 
discounted expected future cash flows 
over the life of the mine.
WHAT WE OWN
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR 
royalty on the Four Mile uranium mine in 
South Australia. Four Mile is operated by 
Quasar Resources Pty Ltd (‘Quasar’).
PERFORMANCE
The Group did not receive any income 
from its Four Mile royalty in 2017 
compared to the £0.3m it received 
during 2016. This is due to the ongoing 
dispute with the operator over how the 
royalty should be calculated. Quasar 
continues to treat the contract, in our 
view, as akin to a profit interest, whereas 
the Group remain of the view that this is 
an NSR and that refining or processing 
costs should not be taken into account.
We have engaged with senior counsel, 
lawyers and experts in Australia to build 
a case file and, once complete, we will be 
seeking to escalate the matter through 
the judicial system in South Australia.  
We remain confident of being successful 
in this process.
VALUATION
The Four Mile royalty is classified as a 
royalty intangible asset on the balance 
sheet. As such, this asset is carried at 
cost less amortisation and impairments. 
Royalty intangible assets are amortised 
when commercial production 
commences, on a straight-line basis  
over the expected life of the mine.

29 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 WHAT WE OWN
Anglo Pacific provided Denison Mines Inc 
(Denison) with a C$40.8m 13-year loan 
bearing interest at a rate of 10%pa. The 
interest payments are payable from the 
cash flows which Denison receives from 
the toll revenue generated from its 22.5% 
interest in the McClean Lake mill, 
operated by Orano Group (previously 
Areva). The mill processes all ore currently 
produced from the nearby, world class, 
Cigar Lake uranium mine, operated by 
Cameco, and pays a $/lb toll rate for use 
of the mill. In any period where the cash 
flow from the toll revenue exceeds the 
interest payment, the balance is received 
by Anglo Pacific as a repayment of 
principal. In any period where the cash 
flows are less than the interest, the 
interest will capitalise and be repaid out  
of cash flows in the following period.  
Any amounts outstanding at maturity are 
due and payable regardless of the cash 
generated from the toll.
In addition to the loan, the Group also 
entered into a financial transaction with 
Denison to purchase the entire share of 
their toll receipts received from Cigar Lake 
for C$2.7m. This allows for potential mine 
life extension at Cigar Lake. 
PERFORMANCE
The Cigar Lake mine produced 18Mlbs  
of uranium during 2017, meeting 
Cameco’s production guidance and our 
expectations. The cash flow received by 
Denison under the toll arrangement 
should produce a regular and predictable 
flow of cash, owing to the world class 
deposit and blue-chip operator supplying 
the mill. The cash received of £5.0m 
during 2017 included an amount of  
£1.8m relating to H2 2016. As such, the 
remaining £3.2m generated represents 
the level of run rate we would expect to 
see on an annual basis. 
The income from the toll revenue is not 
sensitive to movements in the uranium 
price, which continues to be depressed. 
As such, the Group’s cash flows will not 
alter with uranium price fluctuations.  
The risk to the Group’s cash flow from  
this asset could arise if uranium prices fall 
to a level where the operation providing 
the throughput to the mill became 
uneconomic and shutdown. The Group 
considers this unlikely in the case of  
Cigar Lake.
VALUATION
The loan instrument is accounted for  
as a receivable and carried at amortised 
cost. The stream is considered a financial 
instrument in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policies and is 
therefore carried at fair value.

WHAT WE OWN
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR 
royalty on the Salamanca uranium  
project located in Spain and operated  
by ASX-listed Berkeley Energia Limited 
(‘Berkeley’). The project consists of four 
main deposits (Retortillo, Alameda, Zona 7 
and Gambuta) and is located in the 
Salamanca Province, Spain, approximately 
250km west of Madrid.
PERFORMANCE
Berkeley had another eventful and 
successful year. 
Berkeley began the year by announcing 
an offtake agreement with Curzon 
Resources under which it will provide 
2Mlbs of uranium per annum over five 
years at US$43/lb, a significant 
commercial milestone. Berkeley 
announced in December that it has now 
contracted uranium for 2.75Mlbs for the 
first six years, and has granted the Oman 
sovereign wealth fund the right to match 
any future long-term offtake agreements. 
A large focus for the year was on raising 
finance to fund the construction of the 
mine. To that extent and undoubtedly  
the highlight of the year for Berkeley was 
the agreement entered into with the 
sovereign wealth fund of the Sultanate  
of Oman to invest up to $120m into the 
project. The first $65m was received in 
November 2017. This is in addition to 
Berkeley’s $30.0m equity raise in H1 2017.
These fundraising initiatives largely 
remove the financing risk associated  
with construction of the mine. Progress  
is continuing at site, with the delivery to  
site of the primary crusher in July 2017. 
Berkeley continues to explore for 
additional deposits similar to that of  
Zona 7. 
Berkeley expect construction to be 
largely completed by the end of 2018  
with production commencing shortly 
thereafter.

WHAT WE OWN
The Group retained a royalty on the 
Groundhog anthracite project located  
in north-west British Columbia, Canada, 
following its disposal of the related 
mining licences in 2014 to the project’s 
operator, ASX-listed, Atrum Coal Limited 
(‘Atrum’).  The royalty entitled the Group 
to the higher of 1% of gross revenue on  
a mine gate basis or US$1.00/t from  
coal sales derived from the Panorama 
licences. Following a series of 
discussions during 2016, an agreement 
was reached to settle amounts 
outstanding under a promissory note in 
return for additional royalties as follows: 
0.5% GRR covering all production  
within Atrum’s Groundhog Anthracite 
Project (‘Groundhog’) tenements from 
first production until ten years from the 
date that Atrum declares commercial 
production on the project; and 
subsequently
0.1% GRR from production within the 
Groundhog North Mining Complex 
project area.
PERFORMANCE
There was limited progress by Atrum  
in relation to Groundhog during the  
year as it focused its efforts on acquiring 
outright the Elan hard coking coal 
project in Alberta. Atrum is continuing 
discussions with potential partners to 
help advance the project.
Atrum is currently awaiting the results  
of drilling undertaken on the Panorama 
North deposits and will announce these 
results as soon as they are signed off.

Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy 
chromite deposits, owned by TSX-listed 
Noront Resources Limited. (‘Noront’),  
in the Ring of Fire region of Northern 
Ontario, Canada.
PERFORMANCE
There was limited progress reported by 
Noront in the year. Noront has several 
projects in the region, and it is currently 
appraising sites for the location of its 
proposed ferrochrome production facility. 
In its AGM presentation, published on 
June 7, 2017, Noront indicated that the 
Eagle’s Nest project is currently within  
the feasibility stage, while preliminary 
economic analysis is being undertaken in 
respect of the Blackbird and Black Thor

over three exploration tenements in  
the central Pilbara region of Western 
Australia, owned by a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of BHP Billiton Limited (‘BHP 
Billiton’), which is dual-listed on the LSE 
and ASX.
The tenements, covering 263km

, host  
a number of known iron occurrences, 
including the Railway deposit. The 
tenements are supported by extensive 
rail infrastructure including the rail lines 
from Rio Tinto’s West Angeles and 
Yandicoogina mines and BHP Billiton’s 
rail line serving its current operations at 
Mining Area C, which lie immediately to 
the east of the Railway deposit.
PERFORMANCE
The Pilbara royalties are over 
undeveloped tenements of BHP Billiton’s 
iron ore operations in Western Australia. 
The Group was encouraged that BHP 
approached the Company in 2016 to 
seek certain consents to advance  
the tenements towards planning, an 
indication that BHP is moving this asset 
towards production.
We were further encouraged by BHP’s 
announcement on June 26, 2017 that 
they were approving capex of $184m to 
commence funding its South Flank 
project. Although this does not bring 
mining within the Group’s royalty 
licences, it does indicate that BHP are 
now moving in this direction. The

WHAT WE OWN
The Group entered into a royalty financing 
agreement with AIM-listed Hummingbird 
Resources PLC (‘Hummingbird’) in 
December 2012 in relation to its Dugbe 1 
gold project in Liberia. In exchange for 
US$15.0m, payable in three tranches of 
US$5.0m, the Group is entitled to a 2% life 
of mine NSR royalty from any sales of gold 
mined within a 20km radius of a specified 
point in the Dugbe 1 Resource.
PERFORMANCE
There has been limited progress in the 
year to advance the Dugbe 1 project. 
Although the Mineral Development 
Agreement has been signed by the 
Government, it has yet to be passed into 
law. Until such time as this is done, it is 
unlikely that any meaningful investment 
will be made. In the meantime, 
Hummingbird are making considerable 
progress in bringing their Yanfolila gold 
mine in Mali into production, which 
achieved first gold pour on December  
19, 2017. Hummingbird’s management 
team has done a great job in bringing a 
project to production, and this 
experience should stand it in good stead 
when it turns its attention to Dugbe 1.
VALUATION
The Dugbe 1 royalty is classified as an 
available-for-sale debt financial asset 
within royalty financial instruments on 
the balance sheet. As such, the asset is 
carried at fair value by reference to the 
discounted expected future cash flows 
over the life of the mine. There are 
certain provisions within the contract 
which would entitle Anglo Pacific to seek 
its capital to be returned, however, at 
present the prospect of these being 
triggered seems remote.

project operated by ASX-listed Indo 
Mines Limited (‘Indo Mines’). Until the 
project reaches commercial product,  
the Group receives 8% interest on the 
initial advance of US$4.0m in perpetuity. 
Upon entering commercial production 
the NSR royalty is calculated at 2% until 
the initial advance of U$4.0m is repaid. 
The NSR royalty remains at 2% where  
the pig iron price is more than US$700/t.
PERFORMANCE
The Group fully provided for the 
remaining carrying value of its Indo Mines 
debenture at June 30, 2017. Since then, 
Indo Mines’ main shareholder, the 
Rajawali Group, has launched a takeover 
approach for the company, having 
invested considerable amounts of capital 
over the past few years. The takeover is 
intended to cover both debt and equity.
Anglo Pacific agreed to settle the 
remaining outstanding debt of  
US$4.0m at 50c in the dollar and for  
full recovery of interest (both capitalised 
and accruing) up until the date of the 
completion of the takeover, currently 
expected to be March 28, 2018. 
Importantly, the debt settlement is not 
conditional on a successful takeover 
outcome but is contractually payable ten 
business days after the close of the 
takeover period. As such, the Group can 
expect to receive ~US$2.3m around the 
middle of April 2018. This receivable has 
not been included on the balance sheet.

36 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW
2017 was another year of significant growth for Anglo Pacific. Royalty income increased by 90% to a record £37.4m, the third year of posting a 
significant increase in revenue. The increase in the current year was due to a combination of increased commodity prices across the portfolio 
along with a significant increase in mining within the Group’s private royalty land at Kestrel compared to 2016.
This record level of royalty revenue led to significant cash being generated during 2017 which, when including the £5.0m receipts from the 
Denison financing arrangement and £2.4m from non-core assets, resulted in free cash flow of £41.5m (2016: £13.4m). This cash was used to 
invest £16.4m into the portfolio, pay £15.9m to shareholders as dividends and repay our borrowings in full. 
There is some organic growth expected from the portfolio during 2018, but this is not expected to result in a material increase in revenue as 
has been the case in the past three years. As such, the focus for 2018 is to leverage our unencumbered balance sheet and strong cash flow  
to add further royalties to our portfolio. 
2018 will also see the introduction of IFRS9, which will have an impact on how our results are presented. Income from EVBC will no longer be 
shown as royalty income on the face of the Income Statement. Instead, the royalty will appear as a debt like asset with the cash being split 
between a deemed effective interest and principal element. Its revaluation at each reporting date, previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income, will now be recognised in the income statement, along with any deferred tax. Had this been adopted in 2017, 
reported royalty income would have been £1.7m lower. It is for this reason, along with the completion of the Denison financing arrangement 
in February 2017, that we introduced a cash based key performance indicator in 2016, which is designed to show the cash generated by the 
portfolio and against which the dividend cover can be assessed. The full impact of IFRS9 is discussed in note 3.1.2. 
INCOME STATEMENT
Overall, the Group reported a profit after tax for the year of £10.5m compared to £26.4m in 2016. This resulted in basic earnings per share of 
5.88p compared to 15.60p in the prior year. 
Our Income Statement includes a number of valuation items which account for significant volatility and, in our view, does not present the true 
underlying performance during the year. The largest variance is in relation to the valuation of Kestrel, an investment property. This showed a 
surplus of £17.9m in 2016 only to reverse to a deficit of £11.9m in 2017, a swing of £29.8m. Also included is the fair value movement on our 
royalty assets which are accounted for as IAS 39 debt instruments. In the current period, the £6.3m deficit includes the full provision for the 
Jogjakarta debenture and a £3.3m fair value charge against the Group’s Dugbe 1 royalty. There were no impairment charges in relation to the 
Group’s royalty intangible assets in the period. These valuation movements also result in a corresponding but opposite deferred tax 
adjustment.

Adjusted earnings increased by 72% during the year to £30.1m from £16.5m in 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the 90% increase 
in royalty income, despite receiving no income from the Four Mile royalty as the dispute continues. This has been offset somewhat by a 42% 
increase in overheads to £4.7m due to higher staff costs and a greater investment by the Company in pursuing growth.
Elsewhere, finance income includes the £1.9m portion of the £5.0m Denison cash flows treated as interest. This also includes the impact of 
foreign exchange on the Group’s monetary assets, which had a much higher impact in 2016 post the result of the EU referendum and 
associated impact on the value of the pound. The pound has been much more stable during 2017. Finance costs are lower, reflecting lower 
financing activities during the year. The tax charge doubled in the period to reflect a higher level of profit in the Group and higher withholding 
tax on royalties. In addition, 2016 benefitted from tax recoveries.
Overall, adjusted earnings per share were 16.8p in 2017, a 72% increase on the 9.76p earned in 2016. This results in dividend cover of 2.4x in 
2017 compared to 1.6x in 2016.

continued
Royalty income increased by 90% during the year to £37.4m, which represents a record year of royalty revenue for Anglo Pacific. The Group’s 
income continues to be heavily weighted towards Kestrel, which contributed £28.7m (76.9%) of the total. Elsewhere, there was a record 
contribution of £2.0m from Maracás Menchen, more than two and a half times of that in the previous year. Frustratingly, we did not receive 
any royalty income from Four Mile, where our dispute over the basis for calculating the royalty continues along the path towards judicial 
review.
Kestrel
Income from Kestrel increased by 119% in the year. This was mainly a function of a significant increase in the portion of mining at Kestrel 
being within the Group’s private royalty land (92% in 2017 vs 67% in 2016) and much higher coal prices. 
The increase in volumes from the Group’s land was largely anticipated at the beginning of the year and can be seen clearly on the chart on 
page 26. We now expect to receive >90% of the royalties from Kestrel in the medium-term. Overall, production from Kestrel remained 
relatively static during 2017 at ~5mt. We anticipate some organic growth in these volumes, as the stated ROM is 5.7mtpa. 
In addition to volume, the Group benefitted from significantly higher coal prices throughout 2017 compared to what most forecasters had 
anticipated at the beginning of the year. The average price realised at Kestrel was some 30% higher in 2017. This not only impacts on the 
headline royalty rate, it also serves to increase the weighted average royalty rate due to the ratchet-based calculation. As such, the weighted 
average royalty rate increased from 8.8% in 2016 to 10.5% in 2017. 
Finally, the average GBP:AUD exchange rate in 2017 was 1.6811 compared to 1.8252; the latter was higher as the impact of Brexit was only in 
H2 2016. As such, converting the Australian dollar income into sterling resulted in a favourable variance in 2017 compared to 2016 of ~£2.3m. 
All of this combined to produce overall royalty revenue of £28.7m in 2017 (2016: £13.1m), a record year of income from the Kestrel royalty.
Narrabri
Narrabri had a mixed year. The higher thermal coal price compensated for an overall reduction in sales volumes. Volumes at Narrabri continue 
to be impacted by a fault which is currently being experienced in part of the longwall panels, resulting in a step around being required which  
is impacting on production levels. Whitehaven are also experiencing changing roof conditions earlier than expected, which has slowed down 
the pace of mining. As such, they twice reduced their guidance for FY 2017 and achieved sales of 6.7mt in calendar year 2017 compared to 
7.8mt in 2016. They expect the fault to persist for the next three years and have reduced their guidance accordingly.
The lower volumes in 2017 were compensated for by higher coal prices. Thermal coal prices were very resilient during 2017 and remained  
at levels well in advance of most commentators’ expectations. Coal prices were, on average, 31% higher during 2017, which more than 
compensated for the 16% lower volume. The outlook for thermal coal, certainly in the short term, remains relatively favourable, as discussed 
on page 27.
Maracás Menchen
Royalty income increased by more than two and a half times in 2017 to £2.0m, a record contribution from this royalty which was acquired  
in 2014. This reflected an increase in both volume and pricing.
In terms of volume, Largo achieved a record year of production at Maracás Menchen. Total production in 2017 was 9,297 tonnes, a 17% 
increase on the previous year and all the more impressive considering the 20-day planned shut down in Q1 2017 for minor modifications. 
Largo achieved regular monthly records during the course of 2017, culminating in a quarterly record of 2,539 tonnes in Q4 2017. These 
productions levels resulted in the first deferred consideration payment of US$1.5m becoming due and payable in November 2017. 
In addition to strong underlying production, the vanadium price recovered significantly in 2017 with average prices almost double those  
of 2016. Spot prices to date in 2018 are at levels considerably higher than the average for 2017.
EVBC
Income from EVBC also showed a meaningful increase of 38% in 2017, contributing £1.7m. This is as a result of a 24% increase in gold 
production over the calendar year, and a 44% increase in copper production. The copper price has also produced significant gains during the 
course of 2017. The increase in production levels follows capital investments made by Orvana over the past 18 months or so. Orvana continue 
to examine the potential for mine life extension at EVBC.
Four Mile
The Group continues to be frustrated by the lack of income from Four Mile during 2017, owing to a dispute with the operator as to what costs 
are allowable deductions in accordance with the royalty agreement. At present, the operator is treating the royalty, in our view, akin to a profit 
share. The Group disagrees with this and considers this contract to be a net smelter return royalty. We have engaged legal and technical 
experts to assist us in compiling a file, at which point we will commence formal proceedings through the Australian judicial system. We are 
confident in the outcome of this process and will update the market when we have further clarity.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Operating expenses increased by 42% in the period to £5.9m compared to £4.1m in 2016. Excluding the non-cash share-based payment 
provision, underlying costs increased from £3.4m in 2016 to £4.7m in 2017.

APG_AR17_04.04.18_MIDDLE_AMENDS
38 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 The main increase is in relation to staff costs, which increased by 45% to £2.5m. Part of the reason for the increase was that 2016 was lower than 
usual due to an overprovision for bonus payments of £0.2m in 2015 which unwound in 2016. Secondly, the bonus period was altered in 2016 to 
be rebased to a calendar year. As such there was a one-off top up of £0.3m in 2017 to reflect the under provision at the end of 2016. Finally, 
salaries increased by £0.2m in 2017, which, when combined with a higher level of bonus provision, resulted in an additional £0.3m in the year.
Elsewhere, other noticeable differences include a large increase in listing costs. This is due to listing costs being a function of market 
capitalisation, which increased during the year. In addition, there are now a greater number of shares in issue post the Denison equity raise. 
The investment costs more than doubled in the period, which reflects a provision for legal costs incurred to date in resolving the Four Mile 
dispute along with some additional costs incurred in pursuing growth opportunities. We expect to incur additional costs in 2018 in searching 
and appraising potential royalty acquisitions. 
Although costs increased during the period, management believe that a run-rate of below £5m is not excessive, and our internal controls are 
focused on disciplined procurement around due diligence and avoiding unnecessary costs.

Finance income includes the exchange differences realised during the year and the exchange effect on monetary assets, which includes the 
Denison loan. The gain booked in 2016 was largely as a result of devaluation of the pound following the EU referendum in Q2 2016. The 
sterling has been less volatile in 2017, but a loss of £0.7m is being reported in 2017 which reflects the exchange difference on the Denison 
receivable.
Finance income also includes the interest income on the Denison loan, which accrues interest at the rate of 10% pa. 
Finance costs reduced by £0.3m in 2017. This largely reflects lower costs associated with raising finance during the year compared to 2016. 
The 2016 costs included aborted deal costs which did not repeat in 2017. 
OTHER INCOME/LOSSES
Other income has reduced by £1.2m in 2017. This is mainly due to a reversal in the fair value of the forward hedges entered into during the

50c in the dollar on its US$4m debenture and full payment of interest (both capitalised and accrued) up to the date of the takeover. This is 
expected to conclude in April 2018, in the meantime, we have continued to provide for the interest in full.
TA X
The current tax charge for the year is £1.9m, which is £1.4m higher than that of 2016. The charge for 2016 was reduced by the receipt of £0.8m 
of tax rebates, which had not been provided for. Elsewhere, the increase is primarily attributable to withholding tax on a higher level of royalty 
income during 2017.

Net assets increased from £210.1m at the beginning of 2017 to £218.9m at the end of the year. Taking into account the shares issued as  
part of the Denison transaction in February 2017, the closing net assets per share remained broadly flat at 121p per share (2016: 124p).
Net assets reconciliation £m
The adjusted earnings, less dividends, added £14m during 2017. The dividend payment above reflects three payments due to the change in 
dividend policy in Q3 2017 which effectively brought forward the payment of the interim dividend for the year into 2017. The ongoing annual 
dividend, based on 7p, is expected to be ~£13m rather than the £16m included in the above table.
The addition for the Denison financing arrangement includes only the portion which was financed from the issuance of equity; the remaining 
portion was financed from internal resources.
The royalty portfolio reduced in value by £18m during 2017.  £13m of this relates to the fair value of the Kestrel royalty, a further £7m relates to 
the fair value movement of the Group's Dugbe 1 and Jogjakarta royalty financial instruments and £3m relates to an amortisation charge on 
the Group's intangible assets (mainly Narrabri, Maracás Menchen and Four Mile).
Despite income from Kestrel of £29m, the overall decline in the Kestrel valuation (after tax) was only £7m. This is due to an upward revision  
to long-term coal prices somewhat offsetting the impact of depletion. The following table illustrates the pre-tax valuation movement of the 
Kestrel royalty.
Kestrel – reconciliation
CASH FLOW AND BORROWINGS
The Group generated considerable cash during 2017. Net cash generated from operating activities more than trebled to £34.6m compared  
to £10.3m in 2016. Management consider this number to understate the true cash flow within their control as it does not include the cash 
received from Denison treated as principal, nor does it include the cash generated from the disposal of non-core equity investments which  
is within managements control. Including these amounts, the free cash flow generated (i.e. cash generated before dividend and debt repayment) 
was £41.5m in 2017 compared to £13.4m in 2016. This equates to free cash flow per share of 23.2p in 2017, compared to 7.93p in 2016.
The following table reconciles the opening cash balance at the beginning of the year to the closing cash balance of £8.1m.

40 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 2017 cash flow sources and usage
The £44.4m royalty income includes the cash flow from the Denison financing arrangement of £5.0m. Of this amount, £1.8m relates to the 
back dating of cash flows for H2 2016. The royalty cash flow in 2017 benefitted from the transition to monthly payments from the Kestrel 
royalty following a change to the Queensland tax regime in Q2 2017. As such, the Group received an additional £4m of income in 2017  
than it would have otherwise expected. This accounted for 2.23p of the increase in adjusted earnings per share noted above.
In total, the Group allocated capital in the following way: £16.4m in royalty acquisitions; £15.9m in dividends; and £6.2m repaying all 
outstanding borrowings. 
The strength of the cash generated in 2017 meant that the Group repaid all of its outstanding borrowings and ended the year debt free with 
£8.1m in cash. We triggered the US$10m accordion option on our borrowing facility in Q4 2017, which means we now have full access to a 
US$40m borrowing facility. This, along with ~US$10m of cash on hand gives us ready access to US$50m. With a well-covered dividend, this 
liquidity is intended to be put towards royalty acquisitions during 2018.
DIVIDEND
As mentioned previously, the Group revised its dividend policy in H2 2017 to move towards quarterly dividend payments. This was largely  
due to much smoother and regular sales volumes expectation from Kestrel, now that production is largely within the Group’s private land.
As part of this transition, the Board also determined to narrow the time gap between declaring a dividend and the date on which this dividend 
is paid. This resulted in the 2017 interim dividend being paid in November 2017 whereas previously this would not have been paid until 
February 2018. Consequently, in 2017, total dividends of 9p per share (or £15.9m) were paid as illustrated in the following table:

Q4 FY adjustment +/- xp +/- xp
Cash flow 7.25 9
The Directors are proposing an increase in the final dividend for 2017 of 1p per share, meaning that the total dividend for 2017 will be 7p rather 
than the 6p paid in respect of 2016, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM. In addition, the level of the quarterly interim dividends 
has been increased from 1.5p to 1.625p effective from the first interim dividend of 2018. This means that the total cash dividends received by 
shareholders over the next 12 months will be 7.375p. We will, once again, adjust the final dividend in 2018 to reflect the overall dividend level 
for 2018.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Following the completion of due diligence, if management proposes 
to proceed with a transaction in excess of a threshold amount,  
it must first seek Board approval. Below this threshold amount, 
management has discretion to proceed with an investment but must 
report the transaction to the Board in order to refresh its executive 
authority before being able to proceed with another investment.
The due diligence process will vary in each case as Anglo Pacific 
deems necessary or appropriate in the circumstances, all applied  
on a risk-adjusted basis. For instance, the purchase of newly created 
royalties or streams, requiring the negotiation of a binding 
agreement with the operator of a project, will typically permit more 
comprehensive due diligence than the acquisition of existing 
royalties where Anglo Pacific is acquiring royalty interests, often 
within a royalty portfolio on an as-is, where-is basis, from a third 
party rather than the operator. In such cases, Anglo Pacific must rely 
on the limited information provided by the third party as well as any 
publicly available information with respect to the operator and the 
project. The due diligence process will also vary based on the 
jurisdiction, type of mineral, and whether the project is an exploration, 
development or producing project, among other things.
INTEGRIT Y
Anglo Pacific is committed to maintaining the highest standards of 
integrity in all areas of its business and to maintaining its reputation 
for fair dealing. The Group does not offer, give or receive bribes or 
inducements whether directly or through a third party. The Group 
has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all Directors, 
officers, employees, consultants, advisors, business partners, and 
anyone else who may be acting on its behalf, are aware of their 
responsibilities in this area. The Group actively promotes a 
transparent approach to all of its business dealings and expects 
employees to adopt a zero-tolerance attitude to corruption. 
Employees are encouraged to report any potential or apparent 
misconduct in accordance with the Group’s internal whistle-blowing 
policy and any employee that refuses to pay bribes, or raises any 
issues honestly, and in good faith, will be supported by the Group.
The Group chooses business partners and counterparties carefully, 
based on merit and reputation, and only works with persons of 
known integrity, who it believes will act consistently with its own 
standards. The Group does not make facilitation payments. Where 
business is conducted in countries with laws that are less restrictive 
than the Group’s policies and procedures, it will seek to follow its own 
policies and procedures, promoting its standard of integrity 
wherever possible.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC is committed 
to responsible mining extraction in all 
aspects of its investments including 
with respect to environmental, social 
and governance issues.
Anglo Pacific’s core business is investing in the business of others 
and Anglo Pacific does not directly operate any of its assets and 
hence does not control or influence the operations of any of the 
properties over which it has an interest. The projects on which the 
Company has royalties and streams are owned and operated by 
independent mining companies which are typically publicly listed. 
We are nevertheless committed to responsible mining extraction 
and seek to address environmental, social and governance issues 
through a combination of the following:
• Our policies which guide investment decisions
• Our due diligence process for new investments
• Our contractual rights in our royalty and stream agreements
• Monitoring investments for their adherence to adequate 
standards
The approach taken by Anglo Pacific has generated value for 
shareholders and has allowed Anglo Pacific to acquire royalties and 
streams on projects operated by some of the best operators in the 
industry. Anglo Pacific is committed to considering potential 
partnerships with its operators to support appropriate environmental 
and social initiatives in the communities associated with its 
producing assets.
In terms of Anglo Pacific’s own environmental impact, the 
Company’s carbon footprint is very small. Anglo Pacific operates 
solely within one office environment with a small workforce. The 
Company has 10 employees located at its head office in London. 
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS IN NEW ACQUISITIONS
When conducting due diligence, environmental, social and 
governance issues are considered as these are critical to the 
long-term success of a project and the industry generally, which  
in turn, is key to Anglo Pacific’s success. Anglo Pacific will typically 
assess the following as part of its due diligence:
• community initiatives and engagement with indigenous peoples
• safety records
• whether the operator is committed to the principles of the 
International Council on Mining & Metals or other relevant 
standards
• water management and reduction plans
• other environmental programmes and initiatives put in place  
by the operator including carbon reduction and biodiversity 
protection
• operating plans and closure plans
• workplace standards, protections and policies

APG_AR17_04.04.18_MIDDLE_AMENDS
42 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 ENVIRONMENT 
Anglo Pacific is committed to an environmental policy of 
collaborating fully with statutory authorities, local communities  
and other interested parties in order to limit any potential adverse 
impacts of its activities on the natural and human environments 
associated with its operations. The nature of the Group’s royalty 
investments is such that it does not operate any of the properties 
underlying its royalty portfolio and, consequently, it does not always 
have the ability to influence the manner in which the operations  
are carried out. Nevertheless, a responsible approach to a project’s 
environmental impact and its sustainability management is essential 
to the success of the project over its life.
As part of the Group’s investment decision process, careful 
consideration is given to the environmental aspects of any potential 
asset purchase during the due diligence phase. In particular, the 
Group typically engages with consultants who have the requisite 
expertise to ensure that it can consider and, if necessary, mitigate 
any risks in this regard to a properly maintainable level. In 2017, as 
part of the Brazilian Nickel agreement, Anglo Pacific engaged an 
independent consultant to conduct an environmental review 
relating to the project. No breaches were identified as part of this 
process. The Group expects employees to address environmental 
and sustainability responsibilities within the framework of normal 
operating procedures and to look to minimise waste as much as 
economically practicable. The Audit Committee is responsible for 
periodically reviewing the Group’s environmental practices and for 
monitoring their effectiveness.
SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY ISSUES
Anglo Pacific acknowledges that, whilst its activities have little direct 
contact with communities, it can positively influence the social 
practices and policies of companies it conducts business with. 
Positive social and community relationships are essential to 
profitable and successful mining activities. The Group endeavours  
to ensure that companies it works with have appropriate procedures 
in place to facilitate this. More specifically, Anglo Pacific’s investment 
decision process for potential asset purchases involves due diligence 
relating to the full range of CSR issues, including the social and 
community aspects of the project. As part of its Brazilian Nickel 
agreement, Anglo Pacific reviewed the social and community factors 
associated with the Piauí Project. No issues were identified as part of 
this process.
DIVERSIT Y
The Group’s employees are instrumental to its success, and it 
respects and values the individuality and diversity that every 
employee brings to the business. As at December 31, 2017, 50% of 
the Group’s employees were female as the Group had 10 employees, 
five of whom were female. In terms of the Company’s Board of 
Directors, there were six Directors, five of whom were male and one 
of whom was female. Prior to any appointment to the Board, the 
Nomination Committee gives due regard to diversity and gender 
with a view to appointing the best placed individual for the role. 
The Group recognises that it has more to do in encouraging and 
supporting diversity and hopes to be able to identify and develop 
talent at all levels in the organisation as the Group continues to  
grow. More information on the Nomination Committee’s approach 
to diversity can be found on page 48. 
HUMAN RIGHTS
The debate on the role of business and human rights has gained 
increasing prominence in recent years. Anglo Pacific welcomes this 
focus as respect for human rights is implicit across the Group’s 
employment practices. Further, a commitment to human rights is an 
important part of any successful organisation. As part of the Group’s 
investment decision process, if necessary, consultants with the 
requisite expertise are engaged to assist in identifying and mitigating 
any such risks.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The health and safety of the Group’s employees is of fundamental 
importance and is a responsibility it takes seriously. The Group’s 
small size allows the day-to-day responsibility to remain at Board 
level, being monitored by the Chief Executive Officer. The Group has 
both a health and safety policy and office risk assessments in place, 
which are reviewed on an annual basis. Furthermore, a commitment 
to health and safety is a fundamental component of any mining 
project, and, as part of the Group’s investment decision process, 
consultants with the requisite expertise are engaged to assist in 
identifying and mitigating any such risks.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
The UK Government requires that UK listed companies should 
report their global levels of greenhouse gas emissions in their 
Annual Report. Anglo Pacific is a relatively small organisation, with  
10 employees, which means that any emission sources within its 
operational and financial control, such as business travel, purchase 
of electricity, heat or cooling by the Group, are not material in their 
impact. As the management and operation of the underlying mines 
generating the Group’s royalty and stream income is outside its 
control, it is unable to report on these emissions.
The information on pages 08 to 43 represents the Group’s Strategic 
Report and has been approved by the board.

Our approach towards corporate governance
As a standard listed company on the London Stock Exchange,  
the Company is required to comply with the minimum regulatory 
requirements imposed by the EU that apply to all securities admitted 
to trading on EU regulated markets. Accordingly, the Company is 
subject to the relevant Listing Rules, the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
Prospectus Rules. However, it is not required to comply with the 
super-equivalent provisions of the Listing Rules which apply to 
companies with a premium listing.
The Company is, however, complying on a voluntary basis with 
related party requirements that are substantially equivalent to  
those set out in Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules.
The Board remains committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and considers all Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent.
Board and Committee structure
The Board is collectively responsible for approving the Group’s 
long-term objectives and strategy and for reviewing performance 
against them. The Board is also responsible for the general oversight 
of the Group’s operations and management.
At the conclusion of the 2017 AGM in May 2017, Patrick Meier 
assumed the role of Non-Executive Chairman from Mike Blyth and is 
responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the Board. The 
time commitment expected of the Non-Executive Chairman is 
around six days per month. Mr. Meier’s other commitments are 
shown on page 45, none of which is considered to be significant.
The day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the Chief 
Executive Officer (‘CEO’), save for certain matters reserved for 
consideration by the Board. The Chairman and CEO have distinct 
roles which have been defined in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The CEO is supported by the Chief Financial Officer & Company 
Secretary and the Head of Investments who meet as an Executive 
Committee. The Executive Committee is no longer a formal Board 
Committee because it is not currently comprised of a majority of 
Executive Directors. 
Other responsibilities are devolved to the Nomination, 
Remuneration and Audit Committees; their members are all 
Non-Executive Directors and their work is described more fully 
below. The terms of reference of each Committee, and the matters 
reserved to the Board, are available on the Group’s website.
David Archer is Anglo Pacific’s Senior Independent Director (‘SID’).  
The role of the SID is to be available to shareholders to discuss any 
concerns they may have about the running of Anglo Pacific where 
the normal channels of communication are not appropriate. The SID 
is not required to seek meetings with shareholders, however is 
available to do so if required in order to understand shareholder 
concerns and take them to the Board for discussion. The SID is also 
required to lead discussions at meetings of Non-Executive Directors 
without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the 
chairman’s performance and on such other occasions as are 
deemed appropriate.

BOARD EVOLUTION
There have been no appointments to the Board during 2017, 
however, Mr. Blyth, having overseen revisions to the Group’s internal 
governance and investment process, stepped down as Chairman at 
the conclusion of the 2017 AGM and was succeeded by Mr. Meier.
In February 2018 Rachel Rhodes announced her intention to step 
down as a Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of the 2018 
AGM in order to focus on her other professional commitments. The 
Board is in the process of seeking to appoint a further Non-Executive 
Director.
APPOINTMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF DIRECTORS
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment. Under the terms of the 
Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are required to retire 
and seek reappointment by shareholders at an AGM on the third 
anniversary of their appointment. All current Non-Executive 
Directors were appointed for an initial three-year term, renewable  
at the Board’s discretion for up to two further three-year periods 
thereafter, and the Board intends that all future Non-Executive 
Director appointments will be on similar terms. Notwithstanding this, 
it is the Board’s intention that all Directors, including the Non-
Executive Directors, shall be subject to re-election at each AGM.
Each Director is required to disclose to the Board their other 
significant commitments prior to appointment and when there is 
any significant change. The Board considers that all of the Directors 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.
The Company’s Directors have a wide range of skills as well as 
updating their knowledge and capabilities. The Chairman regularly 
reviews the Directors’ training needs and, where appropriate, the 
Group provides the resources to meet the Directors’ requirements. 
The Board has in place a formal induction process for new Directors 
on joining the Board, which is tailored to the needs of the individual.

The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for setting the Board’s agenda and for ensuring that the 
Board receives accurate, timely and clear information. The agenda 
includes regular reports from the executive management and from 
the Board’s Committees on all matters relating to the running of  
the Group. 
The Chairman is also responsible for ensuring that adequate time is 
available for discussion of all agenda items and in particular strategic 
issues. As part of the Board effectiveness review in the current year, 
the Chairman asked the facilitator to review the Board packs which 
the Directors receive and provide any recommendations, if any, as  
to how these could be improved. There was a particular focus on the 
ad-hoc reports which the Directors receive in relation to potential 
investments, as this is an area where the Board spends considerable 
time challenging management decisions and judgements. 
The Group’s Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. A large 
area of focus in the current year was in relation to risk and risk 
management, which is the responsibility of the Board. There were  
a number of action points raised as part of this review to ensure  
that there is a more formal and regular monitoring of risk at Board 
meetings. This process is discussed in more detail on pages 18 and 19.
All of the Directors have access to the Company Secretary’s  
services and advice. All of the Directors may also seek independent 
professional advice in the performance of their duties, at the  
Group’s expense. 
Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings which they 
were eligible to attend during 2017 was as follows:

BOARD EVALUATION
Every year, the Board undertakes an evaluation of its own 
performance and that of the Board Committees and individual 
Directors (including the Chairman). This year, we commissioned  
an external review from Clare Chalmers Limited to examine the 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees as well as to make 
recommendations as to where the effectiveness could be enhanced. 
The review included interviews with all the directors, the Chief 
Financial Officer and Company Secretary and senior management, 
as well as a desktop review of Board materials and corporate 
governance documentation. In addition, the review team attended 
certain Board and Committee meetings.
The findings of this review along with recommendations for 
improvement were presented by Clare Chalmers Limited and 
discussed at a meeting of the Board in November and a number  
of actions to further improve Board performance were agreed.
Overall, the review concluded that the Board is performing 
effectively, with the following key points noted:
• The Board comprised a wide range of skills and experience with  
a spirit of openness combined with a robust degree of challenge.
• Leadership of the Board is effective and a high level of integrity 
exists throughout the organisation beginning at the Board.
• The Board governance and Committee structure is effective.
• Detailed discussion around material matters impacting the 
Company takes place including risk management, which was  
the focus of a dedicated session with external professional  
input at a Strategy Away Day in November 2017.
The areas for focus and continuous improvement are:
• Board papers – need to rationalise and improve use of executive 
summaries to aid readability of the papers;
• Timing of meetings – monitor the timing of Board and Board 
Committee meetings to make sure that there remains sufficient 
time to address all the relevant issues, in particular strategic 
matters;
• Increase frequency of meetings of Non-Executive Directors; and
• Development of a skills matrix to identify skills needed to optimise 
the composition of the Board.
The Board is committed to making improvements in these areas 
highlighted in the Board evaluation.

G OV E R N A N C E The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational 
structure with clear lines of responsibility and appropriate 
delegation of authority.
• There are established procedures for planning and approving 
investments and information systems for monitoring the Group’s 
financial performance against budgets and forecasts.
• The Chief Financial Officer is required to undertake an annual 
assessment process, to identify and quantify the risks that face the 
Group’s businesses and functions, and to assess the adequacy of 
the prevention, monitoring and mitigation practices in place for 
those risks. This process covers all material controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls.
• The Board is responsible for reviewing the risk assessment and risk 
management processes for completeness and accuracy.
• In addition to its work on the above, the Audit Committee also 
receives reports about significant risks and associated control  
and monitoring procedures. The Group’s internal controls and 
procedures documentation are regular agenda items for the 
Committee. The Committee also receives regular reports from  
the external auditors.
• The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on these 
matters, so as to enable the Directors to review the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control. The Board also receives regular 
reports or updates from its other Committees and directly from 
management in addition to carefully considering the Group’s risk 
register at regular intervals.
• The system accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and up to the 
date of approval of the report and financial statements that have 
required the Board to deal with any related material internal control 
issues.
The Directors confirm that the Board has reviewed the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control during the period and concluded 
that the controls and procedures are adequate. The Board will 
continue to review the adequacy of the Company’s internal controls 
and will test the controls and procedures again during 2017. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group is the only major natural resources royalty company listed 
on the LSE and recognises the importance of developing a fuller 
understanding of its business model and risks amongst investors 
and an effective two-way communication with fund managers, 
institutional investors and analysts. Management undertake regular 
meetings with shareholders following results or investment 
announcements. The Chairman and SID also meet with major 
shareholders, a range of fund managers and institutions on a  
regular basis.
There are over 2,000 private investors in the Group. The Board was 
pleased by the attendance at the 2017 AGM and the active 
engagement of investors to further their understanding of the 
current business activity.
The Company has three joint brokers, BMO Capital Markets, 
Cannacord Genuity and Peel Hunt, and the Board remains satisfied 
that the UK, Europe and Canada, which are the jurisdictions likely to 
make up most of our shareholder base, are well covered by brokers 
with significant local expertise.
At the same time, the Board continues to receive regular investor 
relations reports, including commentary on the perception of the 
Company, views expressed by the investment community, media 
reports, share price performance and analysis, so as to ensure that 
all Directors are made aware of the major shareholders’ issues and 
concerns.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board retains overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management and determines the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. As discussed above, the Board has recognised 
the importance of increased focus on risk and risk management and 
has agreed to extend the remit of the Audit Committee to monitor 
the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management processes  
on behalf of the Board. The Board, supported by executive 
management, will also enhance the review and monitoring of the 
Group’s principal risks.
As discussed in the principal risk section on pages 18 and 19, risk  
was a significant focus during the year and the Group engaged  
with a consultant to assist the Board in taking a fresh look at our 
approach to risk.
A statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial 
statements is set out on page 68.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to provide the 
Directors with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the 
Group will not be hindered in achieving its business objectives, or in 
the orderly and legitimate conduct of its business, by circumstances 
that may reasonably be foreseen. However, no system of internal 
control can eliminate the possibility of poor judgement in decision-
making, human error, fraud or other unlawful behaviour, 
management overriding controls, or the occurrence of unforeseeable 
circumstances and the resulting potential for material misstatement 
or loss.

MAIN ACTIVITIES COVERED DURING 2017
The Nomination Committee was actively involved during 2017 in 
reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, in light  
of the need to maintain a balance of appropriate skills and accepted 
best corporate governance practice. The Committee approved the 
appointment of Mr. Meier as Chairman in succession to Mr. Blyth and 
the continuing appointment of Mr. Blyth as a Non-Executive Director. 
It concluded that no other changes were required during the year. 
Subsequent to the year end, the announced intention by Ms. Rhodes 
to step down has led to the Committee initiating a search for a 
suitably qualified replacement, who can also contribute to the 
diversity of the Board.
The Committee has reviewed the Company’s Succession Planning 
Policy for Executive Directors and senior staff members and the 
policy to govern any future changes to executive management.

ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The primary responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are to:
• Set guidelines (with the approval of the Board) for the types of 
skills, experience and diversity being sought when making a 
search for new directors. With the assistance of external 
consultants, identifying and reviewing in detail each potential 
candidate available in the market and agreeing a ‘long list’ of 
candidates for each directorship. Following further discussions 
and research, deciding upon a shortlist of candidates for interview. 
Interview of shortlisted candidates by the Committee members 
who then convene to discuss their impressions and conclusions, 
culminating in a recommendation to the Board.
• Make recommendations as to the composition of the Board and  
its Committees and the balance between Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors, with the aim of cultivating a board with 
the appropriate mix of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company.
• Ensure that the succession plans for Directors and senior 
management are regularly reviewed for subsequent debate with 
the Non-Executive Directors and Chief Executive Officer.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the Group’s 
website.
DIVERSITY POLICY
To increase diversity, in particular the representation of women and 
ethnicity on the Board.
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity and that its current 
composition is still deficient in several respects. The announced 
intention by Ms. Rhodes to step down as a Non-Executive Director  
is a step backwards in addressing this. The Company will ensure that 
the search for a replacement Non-Executive Director is focused on 
re-establishing diversity to the Board and will maintain a policy to 
appoint positions on merit and the needs of the Group at any one 
time. The opportunities for developing and appointing women to 
Executive Directorships will be kept under review.

Significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements How the issue was addressed by the Committee
Review of carrying values of royalties held at amortised cost along 
with the investment portfolio and resulting impairment charges
The Committee reviewed and interrogated management’s key 
assumptions including production profiles, forecast commodity prices 
and discount rates used to estimate the recoverable amount of each 
royalty and compared this to the respective carrying value. The 
Committee reviewed the disclosures related to the Group’s 
impairment policy outlined in note 2. The Committee is satisfied with 
the conclusion that there is no impairment charge for the year ended 
December 31, 2017.
The Committee reviewed management’s application of the Group’s 
impairment policy in relation to available-for-sale equity investments 
outlined in note 3.9 together with the disclosures related to the 
impairment charge described in note 17 for the year ended December 
31, 2017. The Committee is satisfied with management’s assessment 
that there are no further impairments at December 31, 2017.
Review of the carrying value of royalties held at fair value The Committee reviewed and interrogated management’s key 
assumptions including production profiles, forecast commodity prices 
and discount rates used to determine the carrying value of those 
royalties held at fair value.
The Committee reviewed the disclosures related to the revaluation 
deficit of £11.9m in relation to coal royalties, together with the 
revaluation charge of £6.3m in relation to royalty financial 
instruments, described in notes 14 and 15 respectively, for the year 
ended December 31, 2017. Particular focus was given to the Group’s 
Dugbe 1 royalty, and the changes to the assumptions regarding 
discount rate and start date given public announcements (or lack 
thereof) by the operator, which resulted in a valuation deficit of £3.4m.
The Committee concluded that the fair value has been calculated in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy outlined in note 2, is 
appropriate as at December 31, 2017 and is adequately disclosed.
Adoption of new accounting standards (IFRS 9, IFRIC 23) The Committee considered the impact on the Group’s financial 
statements on the imminent introduction of new accounting 
standards, particularly IFRS 9 and IFRIC 23. The Committee noted that 
the material impact on the Group’s financial statements will be that 
the EVBC royalty income will no longer be presented as such, rather  
it will be disclosed with the fair value movement on the face of the 
income statement.
The Committee also considered IFRIC 23 in the context of uncertain 
tax provisions, which requires a weighted average approach. The 
potential impact of this on any tax matters arising during 2019 will be 
carefully monitored by the Committee.
Group tax exposures The Committee considered the Group’s material accumulated tax 
losses and management’s assessment of any tax exposures (whether 
included in current tax provisions or deferred tax assets). The 
Committee challenged management, and its professional advisors, on 
tax positions taken where there is no precedent or guidance in the 
public domain and concluded that the disclosures contained in note 2 
are sufficient and that no additional provision or derecognition of 
deferred tax assets is appropriate.

G OV E R N A N C E There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and up to the 
date of approval of the report and financial statements that have 
required the Board to deal with any related material internal control 
issues.
The Directors confirm that there have been no significant changes  
to the system of internal controls, nor have there been any 
significant breaches reported during the year. As a result the Board 
has concluded that the controls and procedures are adequate.
The Committee also considers, on an annual basis, whether an 
internal audit function is required. Its present view is that one is not 
yet justified given the compact size of the Group and the Directors’ 
involvement with individual transactions.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
To safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external audit 
process, it remains the Committee’s policy to review and approve all 
fees related to non-audit services. The policy prohibits the auditors 
from providing certain services such as accounting or valuation 
services. Details of the auditors’ remuneration are disclosed in note 5b.
The Committee will continue to review its activities in light of any 
regulatory developments going forward.
The Committee has satisfied itself that the external auditors’ 
independence was not impaired.
The Committee held meetings with the external auditors without the 
presence of management on three occasions and the Chairman of 
the Committee held regular meetings with the lead audit 
engagement partner during the year.
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ performance 
and independence underpins its recommendation to the Board to 
propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as 
auditors until the conclusion of the AGM in 2018. Resolutions to 
authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine the remuneration 
of Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the AGM on May 10, 2018.

FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
A key requirement of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts is that 
it be fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit Committee and 
the Board are satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts meet 
this requirement as appropriate weight has been given to both 
positive and negative developments in the year.
In justifying this statement, the Audit Committee has considered the 
robust process which operates in creating the Annual Report and 
Accounts, including:
• the thorough process of review, evaluation and verification by 
senior management, which considered and drew on best practice 
for the creation of the Annual Report and Accounts; 
• a meeting of the Audit Committee held to review and consider the 
draft Annual Report and Accounts in advance of the final sign-off; 
and
• final sign-off provided by the Board.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Committee is responsible for the oversight of internal control 
and risk management systems across the Group. 
In carrying out its role, the Committee reviews the following:
• Regular updates of key internal control matters in respect of the 
Group financial reporting processes, such as financial reporting 
systems and controls.
• Procedures developed by management to identify and evaluate 
key business, financial and operational risks, and the effectiveness 
of the responses being implemented to mitigate the potential 
impacts.
• Policies and procedures in place to detect, monitor and investigate 
activity in respect of anti-fraud, bribery and corruption, such as the 
Group whistle-blowing facilities. 
The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational 
structure with clear lines of responsibility and appropriate 
delegation of authority.
• There are established procedures for planning and approving 
investments and information systems for monitoring the Group’s 
financial performance against budgets and forecasts.
• The Chief Financial Officer is required to undertake an annual 
assessment process to identify and quantify the risks that face the 
Group’s businesses and functions, and to assess the adequacy of 
the prevention, monitoring and mitigation practices in place for 
those risks. This process covers all material controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls. The process 
undertaken during the year is discussed in more detail within  
the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 18 to 23. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the risk 
assessment process for completeness and accuracy.
• In addition to its work on the above, the Audit Committee also 
receives regular reports about significant risks and associated 
control and monitoring procedures. The Group’s risk register and 
internal controls and procedures documentation are regular 
agenda items for the Committee. The Committee also receives 
regular reports from the external auditors.
• The Audit Committee reports to the Board on these matters, so as 
to enable the Directors to review the effectiveness of the system  
of internal control. The Board also receives reports from its other 
Committees and directly from management.
• The system accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.

APG_AR17_04.04.18_MIDDLE_AMENDS
52 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
G OV E R N A N C E Dear Shareholder,
Our remuneration report is, as last year, in two parts: a statement  
of the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration, and an Annual 
Remuneration Report which describes how the policy was 
implemented during 2017. There have been no changes to the 
policy in the current year and, as such, the format for the 
forthcoming AGM vote will be advisory rather than of formal 
approval. 
This report is set against a background of continued strong 
Company performance during 2017, which generated total 
shareholder returns (‘TSR’) of 24.7% in the period. The main focus 
for the Committee this year was in relation to the setting of bonus 
matrices, Director fees and salary benchmarking. The salary of the 
Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) was comprehensively benchmarked 
at the end of 2017. The Committee concluded that a 5% increase to 
the basic salary of the CEO was appropriate at this stage and will 
continue to conduct this exercise on a regular basis in order to 
ensure that the Company is paying market rates that attract and 
retain key personnel. 
The Company contributes to money purchase pension 
arrangements on behalf of staff on a matched basis subject to an 
overall cap. This cap has been increased for 2018 to 11% (2017: 10%) 
for the CEO and 7% (2017: 5%) for all other staff. In addition, the 
Company has introduced a private health insurance scheme on 
behalf of all staff.
The fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors were 
re-assessed at the beginning of 2017 and will remain unchanged. 
They will be reviewed again with effect from January 1, 2019.
In terms of short-term incentives, the CEO and the CEO’s direct 
senior reports have individually crafted bonus objectives which 
were agreed for the 2017 financial year. The bonus award criteria 
relate to a series of agreed corporate and personal performance 
targets which are scored out of a total of 100 points. The criteria 
have been amended from those of 2016 both in recognition of the 
changed circumstances of the Company and to introduce more 
precision to the link between the real ‘stretch-performance’ targets 
and favourable outcomes for the Company. This score is then 
applied to a maximum bonus calculated as a percentage of total 
salary as outlined on page 60.
The CEO was awarded a bonus of £256,680 under the bonus criteria 
matrix or 71.3% of the total potential award. 
The Value Creation Plan ('VCP') is a major plank in our overall 
remuneration strategy and is a long-term incentive plan which 
provides awards of shares (in the form of nil cost share options) at 
the end of five years to the CEO and to senior executives for 
increases in TSR at rates above 7% per annum. The VCP is designed 
to support the Company’s growth strategy by providing incentives 
aligned with shareholder interests. The changes made to the VCP at 
the 2016 AGM extended the term of the plan such that there are still 
four years remaining before management’s performance will be 
assessed against TSR. The Committee continues to believe this is an 
effective plan to incentivise its participants and to encourage the 
retention of key employees by giving them an opportunity to share 
in the growth of the Company over the long term. The 2016 awards 
which were also approved at the 2016 AGM were granted in the year, 
following the end of a closed period. Further details can be found in 
the Remuneration Policy part of this report. 
The Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘USOP’) approved by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM was established to provide the Group 
additional scope to incentivise employees, particularly those who do 
not participate in the VCP, over and above the limit of the Company 
Share Ownership Plan. The first grant of awards under the USOP 
occurred during the year and did not include any participation by the 
Executive or Non-Executive Directors. Further details can be found 
in note 28.
The main objectives for the Remuneration Committee in 2018 will 
be to:
• Review and further tailor the senior executive bonus criteria for the 
2018 financial year; and
• Maintain an ongoing review of and determine the most appropriate 
balance between, salary and bonus for the senior executive.
More detail is provided in the body of the Remuneration Report and 
the Remuneration Committee trusts you will endorse the resolution 
to approve this report at the forthcoming AGM. 
Yours sincerely

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
A. Strategic overview and policy drivers
The foundations for our remuneration strategy were first 
enumerated in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, and largely 
continue to apply today. The strategy was, historically, based on the 
following Company specific elements, which continue to form the 
backdrop to the overall remuneration strategy: 
• Long investment horizons; often there can be an interval of 
between two and 10 years before a royalty comes on stream and 
the royalty may continue to flow for 20 years or more. As business 
development is now focused on royalty acquisitions, incentives 
are heavily weighted towards longer-term performance.
• No comparable peer group, certainly in the UK, for the purposes  
of benchmarking Director performance. As a result, our incentive 
plans have been based on absolute performance rather than 
performance relative to other companies. A relative measure in 
relation to the VCP whereby the rewards for the holders of 2016 
awards (granted in 2017) will only be earned should the Company’s 
share price performance match or exceed the performance of the 
FTSE 350 All Mining Index.
• A relatively high ratio between its market capitalisation (£276m at 
December 31, 2017) and the number of its employees (11, as at 
December 31, 2017, of whom one is an Executive Director). The 
investment team is relatively small and much of the Company’s 
royalty know-how rests with them. The risk to the business of 
losing these and other key employees is correspondingly 
significant, and we have traditionally regarded retention as an 
important objective of our remuneration strategy. 
B. How the views of shareholders and employees have been taken 
into account
The Remuneration Committee has a policy of active engagement 
with shareholders on remuneration matters. The Remuneration 
Committee also considers shareholder feedback received in relation 
to the AGM each year. Details of votes cast for and against the 
resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report are provided in 
the Annual Remuneration Report. This feedback, plus any additional 
feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then 
considered as part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration 
policy. 
Non-Board employees are consulted individually on the executive 
remuneration policy to the extent that it impacts upon the structure 
and level of their own pay and bonuses.

G OV E R N A N C E C. The remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
The policy approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM covers the three years 2016-2019 and was effective from May 10, 2016. The VCP, which 
was initially approved at the 2014 AGM and amended following shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM, remains in place. The Committee’s 
specific policy for each element of remuneration is as follows:
Element, purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum
Salary
To recruit, retain and 
reward executives of  
a suitable calibre for  
the roles and duties 
required
Salaries are set with reference to individual performance, experience and 
responsibilities to reflect the market rate for the individual and their role, 
determined with reference to remuneration levels in companies of similar 
size and complexity, taking into account pay levels within the Company in 
general.
Salaries are reviewed annually. Increases for Executive Directors will normally 
be in line with those for the general workforce except where there is a change 
of role or responsibilities or in other exceptional circumstances.
There is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. 
Pension and benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits
A Company contribution to a money purchase pension scheme, or a cash 
allowance in lieu of pension at the request of the individual. In addition to a 
death in service policy which the Company subscribes to, a private medical 
insurance scheme has now been introduced for all staff.
Executive Directors are entitled to 30 days’ leave.
Pension: 11% (2017: 10%) of salary.
Death in service policy: five times salary.
Annual bonus
To encourage and  
reward delivery of the 
Company’s operational 
objectives
The annual bonus will be paid wholly in cash with no deferred component, 
but with a provision for clawback.
Bonus payments are determined based on the achievement of a combination 
of corporate and personal performance targets. Both are expected to form a 
substantial part of the scorecard.
Corporate performance targets are agreed by the Board at the beginning of 
the year.
Personal performance targets are agreed with the Chairman and the 
Committee.
The Committee will use a balanced scorecard approach to assess 
performance against targets at the end of the year.
The targets are discussed more fully in section D overleaf.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 
100% of salary.
Long-term incentives
To encourage and  
reward delivery of the 
Company’s strategic 
objectives and provide 
alignment with 
shareholders through  
the use of shares and 
incentivise retention  
of key personnel
The LTIP takes the form of a Value Creation Plan (VCP) with a performance 
period to June 16, 2021.
Awards that were granted in 2014 were amended in 2016 with a performance 
period of seven years to June 16, 2021 and are subject to the following 
performance condition:
• Minimum growth in TSR of 7% per annum, with growth measured over the 
seven-year period
2016 awards (granted in 2017) have a performance period to June 16, 2021 
and will be subject to two TSR performance conditions:
• Minimum growth in TSR of 7% per annum, with growth measured from a 
premium to the market capitalisation based on the net asset value per 
share as at December 31, 2015.
• A relative measure of TSR which requires median performance compared 
to a comparator group
For participants with 2014 and 2016 awards, the 2016 awards will accrue  
at a lower level once the 2014 awards reach the threshold growth of 7%  
per annum.
The detailed design is discussed in section E overleaf.
The maximum number of shares that can 
be awarded under the option grants 
equates to 7.5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at the end of the 
measurement period.
In 2016, the Committee allocated the pool 
as follows (and granted to participants in 
2017):
CEO 20.0%
Non-Board senior managers 4.0%
Unallocated reserve: 13.1%
In 2014, the Committee allocated the pool 
as follows:
CEO 56.0%
Non-Board senior managers 6.9%
The potential rewards achievable by Executive Directors under the remuneration policy are illustrated at section F. The policy in respect of any 
future Director appointments is discussed at section I below.
D. Annual bonus – Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting
Annual bonuses are based on a scorecard of performance during the calendar year. The scorecard sets challenging targets for triggering 
bonus, and for rewarding outperformance on a sliding scale. The scorecard will be split between corporate objectives and personal objectives, 
both of which are expected to form a substantial part of the scorecard.
APG_AR17_04.04.18_MIDDLE_AMENDS
55 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION The corporate objectives are agreed by the Board at the beginning 
of each year, together with an assessment of the potential for 
outperformance and the risk of shortfall. This covers such areas as 
business performance, finance, relationships and reputation. This 
constitutes the criteria for triggering a bonus and for assessing the 
levels of challenge and outperformance that would warrant higher 
levels of bonus. The CEO’s personal objectives for the year are 
agreed at the beginning of the year by the Chairman of the Board in 
conjunction with the Committee. The personal objectives focus on 
the required contribution of the individual Executive Director to the 
achievement of the Company’s objectives for the year, but also on 
important but less measurable aspects such as leadership, building 
personal and team relationships, and the extent to which they 
personally have ‘gone the extra mile’.
The CEO’s performance against corporate and personal objectives  
is assessed by the Chairman and the Committee at the beginning  
of the following year, and bonus is awarded on the basis of the 
agreed criteria.
E. LTIP – Principal terms and conditions and reward scenarios
The LTIP takes the form of a Value Creation Plan (VCP). The key 
features of the VCP are as follows: 
Key features:
• Eligibility – All employees are eligible to participate in the VCP, 
although participation has been limited to the Executive Directors 
together with other non-Board members of the senior 
management team at the discretion of the Committee acting in 
consultation with the CEO.
• Alignment with Shareholders – No value accrues under the 
VCP to its participants unless growth in the Company’s TSR over 
the performance period is at least equal to 7% growth per annum.
• Reward pool cap – The maximum number of shares to be 
awarded under the VCP option grants will not be capable of 
exceeding such number equating to 7.5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at the end of the measurement period. This 
provides an effective cap of total growth in TSR above 300%.
Two sets of awards have been made under the VCP: 
• 2014 awards, which were modified in 2016; and 
• 2016 awards, which used the units from the unallocated pool and 
were granted in 2017. 
Both the modification of the 2014 awards and the new 2016 awards 
were approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
2014 Awards 2016 Awards
Performance 
period
Seven-year performance period, ending on June 16, 2021. Performance is measured from the net asset value as at 
December 31, 2015 to June 16, 2021.
Allocation of 
the pool*
CEO: 56%
Non-Board Senior Managers: 6.9%
Total Allocated: 62.9%
CEO: 20%
Non-Board Senior Managers: 4.0%
Total Allocated: 24.0%
Operation Subject to threshold growth of 7% per annum, participants 
become entitled to receive nil or nominal cost options over 
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, subject to  
the cap.
The number of options is set by reference to a share of a pool 
value equal to 10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over the 
seven-year period or, if less, 50% of the growth in the Company’s 
TSR over the seven-year period in excess of the threshold growth.
This will mean that, if the total growth in TSR over the seven-year 
period is:
• below approximately 61%, no value accrues;
• between approximately 61% and 76%, the value that accrues  
is equal to 50% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over the 
seven-year period in excess of the threshold growth; and
• between 76% and the 300% effective cap, the value that 
accrues is equal to 10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR 
over a seven-year period.
This pool value is adjusted to reflect the percentage of the pool 
allocated to these awards (62.9% of the total).
Subject to a threshold growth of 7% per annum over £161.3m, 
participants become entitled to receive nil or nominal cost 
options over ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, 
subject to the cap. £161.3m was the net asset value at December 
31, 2015 and a premium of approximately 61% to the market 
capitalisation on the same date.
The number of options is set by reference to a share of a pool 
value equal to 10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over the 
five-year period. There is no “catch-up” once the threshold 
growth is achieved.
This means that if the total growth in TSR is:
• below approximately 40%, no value accrues;
• above approximately 40%, the value that accrues is equal to 
10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over 94.9p per share 
over the performance period.
This pool value is adjusted to reflect the percentage of the pool 
allocated to these awards (37.1% of the total, when including the 
unallocated reserve).
In addition, a relative measure of TSR ensures it is at least equal  
to the movement in the index of the FTSE 350 Mining Index. In 
the event that the increase in TSR does not equal or exceed the 
aforementioned index, no value will accrue to the new awards.
Pay-outs to the CEO and other participants who have 2014 
awards will accrue at a lower level based on the outcome of the 
awards currently allocated. Once the share price reaches the 
threshold at which value accrues under the 2014 awards, value 
accrues on only half of the units under the 2017 awards held by 
the CEO and any non-Board members of the senior management 
team who have an existing award.

G OV E R N A N C E Vesting Options to which participants become entitled at the end of the relevant performance period ending on June 16, 2021 will become 
exercisable as follows:
• One-third immediately;
• One-third after 12 months;
• One-third after 24 months
Maximum 
value
The maximum value that can accrue for the full award pool (which includes both the 2014 and the 2017 awards) is capped at 7.5%  
of the Company’s issued share capital as at the end of the measurement period.
* Unallocated reserve: 13.1%
Illustrative returns
The following table illustrates the potential return for the CEO and other participants and shareholders for various levels of growth in TSR over 
the performance period to June 16, 2021: 
Benefit assuming total growth in TSR (from an illustrative starting market 
capitalisation plus capital inflows of £262.1m) over a seven-year period of:
Allocation

CEO – 2014 award 56% £0.0m £10.6m £13.9m £20.8m
CEO – 2016 award 20% £2.3m £3.2m £3.8m £5.0m
CEO Total 76% £2.3m £13.8m £17.7m £25.8m
Others – 2014 award 6.9% £0.0m £1.3m £1.7m £2.6m
Others – 2016 award 4% £0.5m £0.7m £0.9m £1.3m
Unallocated 13.1% £1.5m £2.3m £3m £4.4m
Overall Total 100% £4.27m £18.07m £23.24m £34.14m
Shareholders £119.73m £170.91m £224.76m £337.86m
*
Approximately 76% growth in TSR over the seven-year period results in a total pool equal to 9.3% of the growth. This reflects a pool equal to 10% for the original awards and a pool for the new awards 
which reflects the reduction in the value that accrues for participants with original awards once the threshold growth of 7% per annum is met.
**
At the effective cap of total growth in TSR of 300% over the period, the benefit to shareholders would be £677.20m and total participant awards would be £66.80m, of which the CEO would receive 
£41.7m under the 2014 award and £8.7m under the 2016 award.
TSR performance must match or exceed the performance of the FTSE 350 All Mining Index for new awards to payout. Awards in the table are calculated from the respective starting market 
capitalisations (Illustrative starting market capitalisation of £248.0m for original awards and £161.3m for new awards (based on the net asset value as at December 31, 2015)).
F. Reward scenarios
The Company’s policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by the CEO being dependent on Company performance. The 
chart below illustrates how the total pay opportunity for the CEO varies under three different performance scenarios: below target (fixed pay 
only), on-target and maximum. This chart is indicative as share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded. All assumptions 
made are noted below the chart. 
Below target and on-target do not include any VCP vesting and simply allow for salary and pension for the below target level with a bonus 
award included at the on-target level. The maximum level includes the fair value of the VCP assuming outperformance of the FTSE 350 Mining 
Index is achieved. To aid comparability with standard LTIP structures, the chart reflects the total pay opportunity if the VCP (both the 2014 
awards and the 2016 awards) is included on an annualised basis.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION Assumptions: 
• Below Target = fixed pay only (salary + benefits + pension);
• On-target = fixed pay, 50% vesting of the annual bonus and 0%  
of the VCP awards (i.e. the value that accrues for threshold 
performance);
• Maximum (2014 and 2016 VCP awards included on an annualised 
basis) = fixed pay and 100% vesting of the annual bonus and 
annualised 2014 and 2016 VCP awards, granted in 2017. The 
annualised value reflects a seven-year performance period of the 
2014 award and five-year performance period of the 2016 award; 
• Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are 
calculated) are based on those which apply from January 1, 2018. 
Salary for the CEO is 90% of his full time equivalent salary. The CEO 
does not receive any taxable benefits; and
• The fair value of the VCP has been calculated using a stochastic 
model as at the date of grant (or in the case of the 2014 awards, the 
date of modification). The model projects the share price of Anglo 
Pacific using the historical volatility of the Company (whilst past 
behaviour is not always a good indicator of movements in the 
future, it is difficult to determine a more accurate method). For 
each simulation the resulting share price and thus payout is 
determined. The fair value is the average of 100,000 possible 
simulations. 
G. Determinations to be made by and discretions available to the 
Committee
The Committee operates the Group’s variable incentive plans 
according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC 
rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these 
plans, the Committee will be required to make determinations and 
apply certain operational discretions. These include the following:
• selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
• adjusting basic salaries for changes in time commitment  
(within the full-time equivalent levels set out in this policy);
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments  
(within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment  
of performance;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, variation of share capital 
including rights issues and corporate restructuring events, and 
special dividends); 
• determining ‘good leaver’ status for incentive plan purposes  
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan from 
year-to-year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or 
long-term incentive performance conditions and/or targets being 
deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition or 
divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust 
appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter weightings, 
provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially  
less difficult to satisfy.
H. Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
compared to other employees
The Committee aims to ensure, over time, a proper differential 
between the level of the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
other employees, but also appropriate differences in the structure of 
remuneration to reflect different levels of responsibility and planning 
horizons of employees across the Company.
The remuneration framework of non-Board employees was 
reviewed during 2017 and will continue to be reviewed going 
forward. There are currently three main differences to the 
remuneration framework: 
• the Committee will continue to reserve access to the VCP to  
the most senior executives who have the greatest potential to 
influence the Company’s long-term performance; and
• the Executive Directors will receive any annual bonus wholly in 
cash because of the large potential shareholding offered by the 
VCP; but 
• in order to encourage employees without access (or with less 
access) to the VCP to build up a shareholding in the Company, 
consideration will be given to either including a share component 
in any annual bonuses awarded to non-Board employees and 
continuing to offer them options pursuant to the CSOP or the 
USOP, or a combination of the two. 
I. Approach to appointment of new Executive Directors
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be 
set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. Currently, 
for an Executive Director, this would include a potential annual 
bonus of no more than 100%. There is also provision within the VCP 
arrangements for the Committee to dilute the pool by an additional 
10% for new appointees.
The salary for a new Executive Director may be set below the normal 
market rate, with phased increases following an initial probationary 
period and over the first few years as the executive gains experience 
in their new role. The Committee may offer new appointees 
additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers 
these to be in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders, including the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the 
Listing Rules. Such payments would take account of remuneration 
relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect  
(as far as practicable) the nature and time horizons attaching to that 
remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time  
of appointment. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided 
that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest 
opportunity. 
For external Executive Director appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as 
appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

APG_AR17_04.04.18_MIDDLE_AMENDS
58 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
G OV E R N A N C E J. Service contracts and payments for loss of office
The Committee, together with the Nomination Committee, reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure that these 
reflect best practice. 
The current Executive Director’s service contract is for an indefinite term and contains a notice period of six months, which is in line with the 
Company’s continuing policy that service contracts should not have a notice period of more than one year.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination. A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any 
further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross 
misconduct. If the employing company terminates the employment of an Executive Director in other circumstances, compensation is limited 
to salary due for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the Committee as representing the value of other contractual 
benefits (including pension) which would have been received during the period. Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable. The service 
contract of Mr. Treger provides for a six-month notice period and an additional termination payment equivalent to six months’ basic salary.  
In the event of a change of control of the Company there is no enhancement to contractual terms. The service contract of the Executive 
Director is available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
In summary, the contractual provisions for Executive Directors are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms 
Notice period One year or less.
Termination payment Basic salary plus benefits (including pension), paid monthly and subject to mitigation.
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with  
the termination would be paid as necessary.
Additional termination payment to bring the total payment to the equivalent of 12 months’ basic salary.
Remuneration entitlements A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for 
outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below). 
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in relation to a change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the VCP will be determined based on the plan rules. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding unvested awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such  
as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (taking into account the individual’s performance 
and the reasons for their departure) ‘good leaver’ status can be applied. For good leavers, the unvested awards remain subject to performance 
conditions (measured over the original time period) and are reduced pro-rata in size to reflect the proportion of the performance period 
actually served. The Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so. In determining whether an 
executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons 
for their departure.
K. Non-Executive Directors
The Company aims to attract and retain a high-calibre Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors by offering a market 
competitive fee level. 
The Committee’s specific policy is as follows:
Element, purpose and link to 
strategy Operation Maximum
Board fees
Attract, retain and fairly 
reward high calibre 
individuals
Fees are currently paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate  
in the Company’s annual performance related incentive schemes, share option 
schemes or pension scheme.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. The Non-Executive  
Directors are paid a basic fee. Additional fees are paid to Chairmen and members  
of the main Board Committees and to the SID to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Fees are reviewed by the Board taking into account individual responsibilities, factors 
such as Committee Chairmanships, time commitment, other pay increases being made 
to employees in the Company, and fees payable for the equivalent role in comparable 
companies.
Normally fees are reviewed biennially and fee increases are generally effective from 
annual re-election after the AGM.
The Board may adjust the fees for an individual Non-Executive Director during the 
intervening period if there is a significant change in their responsibilities and/or  
time commitments.
Current fee levels are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Overall fee limit will be within the 
£600,000 limit set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association.
Mr. Meier, Mr. Archer, Mr. Blyth, Ms. Rhodes and Mr. Stan were appointed for an initial three-year term, renewable at the Board’s discretion for 
up to two further three-year periods thereafter and the Board intends that all future Non-Executive Directors’ appointments will be on similar 
terms. None of the letters of appointment have provisions that relate to a change of control of the Company.

G OV E R N A N C E B. Annual bonus for the year ending December 31, 2017
A set of individually crafted corporate and personal bonus criteria 
were agreed with the CEO for the 2017 financial year which took into 
account the evolving corporate and financial priorities of the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee was conscious of the need to ‘’sense 
check’’ the bonus arrangements for the CEO both for major negative 
external influences and for truly outstanding performance. As a 
result, the bonus criteria and calculations were made subject to two 
major caveats:
• That the Company had not suffered an exceptional negative event 
in the bonus year or in the lead up to the determination of the 
quantum of the bonus; and
• The Remuneration Committee may look at overriding some or all 
of the bonus criteria should the CEO’s efforts in the 2017 financial 
year result in a major transformational outcome that 
demonstrably benefits shareholders, is reflected in a material 
share price increase and would not otherwise be adequately 
captured in the bonus matrix.
In addition, many of the bonus criteria are referenced to the 
achievement of hurdle performance that is either ‘’superior’ or 
‘’exceptional’’. No bonus is earned for ‘’poor’’ or merely ‘’adequate’’ 
performance. 
The main bonus categories which total 100% are: Growth (40%); 
Financial Performance (25%); Financial Control (10%); Relationships, 
Reputation and Business Development (10%); and, finally 
Professionalism (15%). The largest factor in the CEO’s bonus matrix  
at 40% of the total bonus payable relates to growth and securing 
new royalty opportunities.
Growth: The main acquisition during the year was the transaction 
with Denison in February. In addition, a development royalty, 
Brazilian Nickel, was acquired in September 2017. Growth bonus in 
relation to these transactions was 10%. An element of the growth 
bonus was in respect of the performance of 2017 acquisitions, which 
earned a score of 5.3%. A further part of the growth bonus related to 
the performance of investments in 2015 and 2016 meeting 
modelled returns. The returns as modelled gave an overall score  
of 3%. Total overall score of 18.3% out of a possible 40%.
Financial Performance: Adjusted earnings of £30.1m was 1.5x the 
budgeted amount of £19.4m and earned the maximum bonus of 
10%. Capital of £13m was raised in 2017 in relation to the Denison 
transaction. The bonus earned in relation to this metric was 9%. As at 
year end, the share price was £1.525 versus NAV per share of £1.210 
and hence exceeded the hurdle of >1 and earned the full bonus 
allocation of 5%. Total overall score of 24% out of a possible 25%.
Financial Control: The currency management plan implemented in 
2016 resulted in the Group effectively hedging its Australian dollar 
denominated royalty income against the pound. A longer-term 
currency hedging strategy is currently under consideration. This 
area earned a bonus allocation of 3.5%. Budgeting and financial 
reporting continued to be very effectively carried out and met the 
hurdle bonus level of superior to earn a score of 4%. Total overall 
score of 7.5 % out of a possible 10%.
Relationships, Reputation and Business Development: The investor 
relations plan implemented in 2017 was vigorously followed and a 
very active programme of engagement with equity providers was 
undertaken both during and subsequent to the Denison capital 
raise. Continued high calibre engagement was both maintained  
and developed with royalty sourcing networks. Superior hurdles 
were met in each of the three metrics. Total overall score of 9%  
out of a possible 10%. 
Professionalism: Under the guidance of the CEO, the senior 
management team, whilst small, continued to develop its capability 
and maintained a high tempo of activity in 2017 in terms of 
developing the pipeline of new prospects and evaluating a number 
of significant new business opportunities. Focus was applied to the 
development of a collaborative, goal oriented, ethical company with 
harmonious working relationships. Superior hurdles were met in 
each of the two metrics. The CEO's personal contribution was 
evidenced by his championing the evolving strategy regarding 
development royalties and also the evolving jurisdictional criteria. 
The legacy share portfolio continued to be realised under his 
direction. He helped increase the proceeds from the disposal of a 
non-core royalty. He marketed the Company increasingly in multiple 
jurisdictions and increased our Canadian profile. And finally he 
professionally guided the Company's evolving commodity bias 
towards electric vehicle and battery materials. An overall score of 
12.5 % out of a possible 15%. 
The overall bonus score was agreed at 71.3% under the bonus 
scoring matrix for a total award of £256,680 (71.3% x £400,000 x 
90%). The overall aggregate bonus of £256,680 bonus falls within 
the 100% bonus limit set out in the policy table. 
The CEO’s direct senior reports, none of whom are Executive 
Directors, have individually crafted bonus objectives which were 
agreed for the 2017 financial year. The bonus award criteria relate  
to a series of agreed corporate and personal performance criteria 
which are scored out of a total of 100 points. This score is then 
applied to a maximum bonus calculated as a percentage of total 
salary. The percentages range up to 100% of salary depending on 
the executive’s position and their level of individual participation in 
the VCP. 
Bonus criteria will be further tailored for the 2018 year to ensure that 
these closely match key performance metrics and at the same time 
provide real ‘stretch-performance’ targets.
The bonus matrix for the CEO for 2017 is detailed below. Specific 
measures are excluded due to commercial sensitivity.

Long-term incentive awards made during the year
There were no awards granted to Executive Directors under the JSOP, the CSOP or USOP in 2017. 
As highlighted in last year's report, the allocations determined under the VCP made in 2016 were not allocated in 2016 as the Company was  
in a closed period. During 2017, these allocations under the VCP were made as outlined in the 2015 remuneration report and as approved by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM. 
The CEO’s allocation of units under the VCP out of the pool to Executive Directors has therefore increased from 56,000 units or 56% of the 
total number of units to 76,000 units or 76% of the total number of units. As at the date of this report there are a total of 86,880 units issued 
out of a total pool of 100,000 units, including the awards for non-Board senior managers (2016: 66,880 units).
Outstanding share awards
There are currently no awards to Executive Directors outstanding under the JSOP, the CSOP or the USOP.

G OV E R N A N C E D. Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Committee encourages the Executive Directors to build up a shareholding in the Company, so as to ensure the alignment of their interest 
with those of shareholders, but there is no formal shareholding guideline. In addition, the VCP is designed to increase this alignment. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company although the Chairman and independent 
Non-Executive Directors are expected to ensure that the level of their individual shareholdings is not significant and thereby call into question 
their continuing independence. 
Details of the Directors’ interests in shares are shown in the table below.

permission of the Board.
E. Total pension entitlements
The Company makes contributions to employees’ pensions and has designated the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) as its 
stakeholder pension provider. The Committee is prepared to pay additional basic salary (or fees) in lieu of part or all of a Director’s pension 
contribution.
F. Loss of office payments
There were no loss of office payments made to Directors in 2017 (2016: nil).

The table above shows the movement in the salary, benefits and annual bonus for the CEO between the current and previous financial year 
compared to that for the average UK employee. The Committee has chosen this comparator and it feels that it provides a more appropriate 
reflection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Group’s total wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the 
number of employees. For the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes.

Mr. Treger holds an external non-executive directorship with Mantos Copper S.A. for which he earned fees during the year. This directorship 
does not affect Mr. Treger’s ability to perform his role as CEO of the Company, as this directorship forms part of his 10%-time commitment 
aside from Anglo Pacific (see “The Board” section of the Governance Report). As a result, Mr. Treger is paid 90% of his full time equivalent 
salary of £400,000.

M. Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, the Company’s approach to setting Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is with reference to 
market levels in similar companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments. A summary of current fees is as follows:
2018 2017 % Increase
Chairman 115,000 115,000 –
Committee member 46,000 46,000 –

The Chairman’s fee of £115,000 was set with effect from January 1, 2017 for a two-year period.
Members of the main Board Committees are paid an additional amount, currently £6,000 per annum, to reflect extra commitments, with a 
Committee Chair receiving a further £5,000. The SID also receives a further additional fee, currently £10,000 per annum, reducing to £6,000 
when a committee chairmanship is held, to reflect his extra duties.
N. Performance targets for the annual bonus and LTIP awards to be granted in 2018 and beyond
Annual bonuses for 2017 were made in accordance with the policy approved by shareholders in 2015. 
The CEO was awarded a bonus of £256,680 which reflects his performance against his scorecard being assessed as 71.3%. The 2017 
scorecard for the CEO is detailed on page 62. A similar scorecard approach will continue in 2018. The scorecard will set challenging targets  
for triggering bonus, and for rewarding outperformance on a sliding scale. The scorecard will be a combination of corporate objectives and 
personal objectives. Corporate objectives for 2018 will cover areas such as business performance, funding and finance, relationships and 
reputation. Due to the commercially sensitive nature of the Group’s corporate objectives, further details of the 2018 scorecard will be 
provided in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
No long-term incentive awards are due to be made in 2018. Details of the awards made in 2014 and 2017 under the VCP can be found in the 
notes of the policy table on page 56.

The Directors present their report and audited consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The Group’s principal royalty activities are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 25 and 36. 
GOING CONCERN
The financial position of the Group and its cash flows are set out on 
pages 77 and 80. The directors have considered the principal risks of 
the company which are set out on pages 18 and 23, and considered 
key sensitivities which could impact on the level of available 
borrowings. As at December 31, 2017, the Group had cash and cash 
equivalents of £8.1m as set out in note 22 and subject to continued 
covenant compliance, has access to £29.6m through its undrawn 
secured US40.0m revolving credit facility.
The Directors have considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts for 
the period to the end of March 2019. The Board is satisfied that the 
Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance and other uncertainties, 
together with the Group’s cash position and access to the undrawn 
revolving credit facility, show that the Group will be able to operate 
within the level of its current facilities for the foreseeable future. For 
this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its financial statements.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 75 of the 
financial statements.
The Group reported a profit after tax of £10.5m (2016: £26.4m).

per share), combining the recommended final dividend of 2.50p per 
share for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the interim 
dividends of 3.00p per share paid on November 15, 2017 and 1.50p 
per share paid on February 15, 2018. The final dividend for the year 
ended December 31, 2017, is subject to shareholder approval at the 
2018 AGM. The Board proposes to pay the final dividend on May 31, 
2018 to shareholders on the Company’s share register at the close

Shares at a price of 125p per share amounting to an aggregate 
nominal value of £219,200 and aggregate consideration of 
£13,700,000 as part of a firm placing announced on February 1, 
2017. The issue price was fixed on February 1, 2017 and represented

67 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’). Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them  
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 (United 
Kingdom) and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors who were in office at the date of this statement 
confirm that: 
• so far as they are each aware there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE DISCLOSURE AND 
TRANSPARENCY RULES
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website, www.anglopacificgroup.com. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

G OV E R N A N C E INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Anglo Pacific Group plc 
(the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which 
comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated balance sheet and Company balance sheet;
• the consolidated and Company statement of changes in equity;
• the consolidated and Parent Company statements of cash flows; 
and
• the related notes 1 to 35.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit 
matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Valuation of the Kestrel royalties
• Impairment assessment of the royalties intangibles portfolio
• Accounting for the Denison transaction
• Accounting for deferred and current tax 
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters which are the same as the prior 
year are identified with  .
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £4.3m which was determined on the basis of 2% on net 
assets.
Scoping Consistent with how the Group is managed we consider the Group to be one component. Consequently all assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses are subject to a full scope audit. 
Significant 
changes in  
our approach
We have not included the Dugbe valuation as a key audit matter for 2017. In 2016 the royalty was converted from being held 
at cost on the balance sheet to fair value which meant there was the potential for a significant change in carrying value. 
Having audited the fair value methodology and sources of assumptions during 2016, the potential for a material 
misstatement this year is considered significantly lower. 
We have included a new key audit matter for the accounting for the Denison transaction because of the complexity of the 
accounting and the valuation of the loan and streaming royalty that was measured in February 2017.
We have included a new key audit matter in respect of the uncertainty around the tax treatment of the intercompany loan 
between two subsidiary entities.

FI N A N C I A L S T A T EM E N T S CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 3.1.1 to the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the  
date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that statement 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained  
in the audit.
We confirm 
that we have 
nothing 
material to 
report, add  
or draw 
attention to  
in respect of 
these 
matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge we 
obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of 
the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 18-23 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors' confirmation on page 18 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 18 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group required by Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm 
that we have 
nothing 
material to 
report, add  
or draw 
attention to  
in respect of 
these 
matters.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
VALUATION OF THE KESTREL ROYALTY 
Key audit 
matter 
description
Royalties arrangements held at fair value have a value of £115.0m as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £130.4m). The Kestrel 
royalty comprises £104.3m (2016: £116.9m) of the total and management engaged an independent valuation specialist to 
perform an independent valuation of the royalty asset. The valuation of the Kestrel royalty is subjective and contains 
significant levels of judgement in relation to the discount rate used, the forecast commodity prices and the expected 
production profile. In addition, the heightened coal price volatility during the year has widened the range of analyst forecasts 
and increased the subjectivity in the valuation.
Due to the high level of judgements involved, we have determined that there was a potential for fraud through possible 
manipulation of this balance.
The price and discount rate assumptions are set out in note 14 along with the related sensitivity analysis. The Group discloses 
this risk as a critical accounting judgement in note 2. 
Refer to the Audit Committee report where this matter is considered by the Audit Committee as a significant issue, “Review 
of the carrying value of royalties held at fair value” on page 50.
How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded 
to the key 
audit 
matter
We obtained the valuation model used by management’s independent specialist to determine the fair value of the Kestrel 
royalty. We challenged the assumptions adopted by management`s independent specialist by comparison to recent third 
party forecast commodity price data, reference to third party documentation and the relevant reserves and resources 
reports. To challenge the discount rates we prepared independent discount rates and compared those to the rates adopted 
by management.
We evaluated the independence, objectivity and competence of management’s independent specialist. We challenged the 
valuation assumptions adopted in line with the above methodology by directly reviewing their reporting and speaking 
directly with the specialist. In doing so we assessed the extent to which management may have influenced the key 
assumptions in the valuation model to address the risk of any possible management bias.

FI N A N C I A L S T A T EM E N T S Key 
observations
We concur that the fair value of the Kestrel royalty is within an acceptable range.
IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF THE ROYALTY INTANGIBLES PORTFOLIO 
Key audit 
matter 
description
Royalty arrangements held as intangibles have a gross carrying amount of £115.8m at 31 December 2017 (2016: £115.7m) 
and a net carrying amount of £77.4m (2016: 80.0m). As a consequence of the volatility in current commodity prices, the 
assessment of whether impairment/reversal indicators exist and estimating the recoverable amount of royalty 
arrangements accounted for as intangible assets where necessary require management to adopt key judgements in relation 
to the discount rates used, the forecast commodity prices, the expected production profiles and where relevant the 
probability of production commencing.
Impairment indicators were identified for Four Mile and Pilbara with carrying amounts of £1.5m (2016: £1.7m) and £11.2m 
(2016: £11.3m) respectively. Indicators of impairment reversal were also identified for Ring of Fire which has a carrying 
amount of £3.7m (2016: £3.8m).
No impairment or impairment reversal was recognised for 2017. In 2016 an impairment of £2.1m was recognised at Amapá 
(see note 16). The Group discloses this risk as a critical accounting judgement in note 2. 
Refer to the Audit Committee report where this matter is considered by the Audit Committee as part of the significant issue, 
“Review of the carrying values of royalties held at amortised cost along with the investment portfolio and resulting 
impairment charges” on page 50.
How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded 
to the key 
audit 
matter
We challenged management’s assessment as to whether indicators of impairment exist for specific royalty arrangements 
through evaluation of changes in production and pricing forecasts and a review of publically available information. Where 
such indicators were identified, we obtained copies of the valuation models and challenged the assumptions adopted by 
management by comparison to third party forecast commodity price data, reference to third party documentation and  
the relevant reserves and resources reports. 
To challenge the discount rates we prepared independent discount rates and compared those to the rates adopted by 
management.
We reviewed and challenged management’s assessment of whether projects still in the development phase would reach 
commercial production through an independent assessment based on third party data available from asset operators.
Where there were indicators of impairment reversal for royalty assets we evaluated whether it was appropriate to reverse 
previous impairments.
Key 
observations
We concur with management’s impairment assessment, in respect of the intangible assets where indicators of impairment 
were identified, we found that the assumptions used were within a reasonable range and had been determined and applied 
on a consistent basis across the Group. 
ACCOUNTING FOR THE DENISON TRANSACTION 
Key audit 
matter 
description
During 2017 the Group entered into two new contracts, known together as “the Denison Financing Agreement”. As at 31 
December 2017 management has accounted for the transaction as two separate financial instruments as follows:
1.  A £21.3m 13-year secured loan held as a financial liability at amortised cost. The asset was designated as a loan measured 
at amortised cost due to 
• the mandatory repayment term; 
• the intention of management to hold the asset in order to collect the interest payments and principal repayments 
associated with the contract; and
• the instrument being unquoted in an active market.
See note 20 for further details; 
2.  A £1.9 million available-for-sale debt financial instrument relating to an entitlement to a percentage of the future McClean 
Lake Mill revenue earned by Denison, excluding that revenue earned in relation to the first 215mlbs of throughput. The 
contract meets the definition of an available-for-sale debt as 
• it provides a contractual right to receive cash;
• it has no maturity date; and 
• the cash flows are not fixed and determinable.
See note 15 for further details. 
The Group discloses this risk as a critical accounting judgement in note 2.
Refer to the Audit Committee report where this matter is considered by the Audit Committee as a significant issue, “Review 
of the carrying values of royalties held at amortised cost along with the investment portfolio and resulting impairment 
charges” and “Review of the carrying value of royalties held at fair value” on page 50.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded 
to the key 
audit 
matter
We challenged management’s assessment as to whether this transaction is appropriately accounted for as two separate 
financial instruments through our consideration of the key terms in the contracts. We have reviewed the contracts and 
assessed whether the two instruments are separate due to different contractual rights to cash and ability to sell separately 
the royalty from the loan or vice versa.
We have reviewed the contracts and assessed whether the appropriate accounting treatment was applied to the financial 
instruments under IAS39.
We have engaged our valuation specialists in order to challenge whether the fair value of the loan on day one is appropriate 
through recalculation of loan’s initial value.
We obtained the available-for-sale debt valuation model and challenged the key assumptions adopted by management in 
relation to this model by comparison to third party forecast commodity price data, reference to third party documentation 
and the relevant reserves and resources reports.
To challenge the discount rates for the available-for-sale debt and effective interest rate for the loan we prepared 
independent rates and compared those to the rates adopted by management.
Key 
observations
We concur that the accounting treatment and valuation of the transactions appear reasonable. 
ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED AND CURRENT TAX 
Key audit 
matter 
description
The Group undertook a restructuring of certain loss making entities during the year. The Group obtained advice from 
professional advisors in respect of these transactions. The tax treatment in relation to the restructure is uncertain given the 
lack of precedence and guidance from the tax authorities. In the event this aspect was successfully challenged by the tax 
authorities, possibly through litigation, this would result in a reduction in the deferred tax asset of £3.3m and the recognition 
of current tax liability of £3.6m as at December 31, 2017 with a £6.9 million corresponding income statement tax charge for 
2017.
Management disclosed this as an uncertain tax position in note 10 to the financial statements. The Group discloses this risk 
as a critical accounting judgement in note 2.
Refer to the Audit Committee report where this matter is considered by the Audit Committee as part of the significant issue, 
“Group tax exposures” on page 50. 
How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded 
to the key 
audit 
matter
We reviewed the papers prepared by management’s independent tax expert.
We utilised our specialists to review management’s tax advice and position papers and consider the appropriateness of the 
position for the purposes of the audit; this involved reviewing the tax legislation and case law applied to determine if the tax 
treatment was reasonable. 
We held a meeting with management to discuss our concern that there is no clear precedence or guidance on this matter 
and, as such, this results in an uncertain tax position.
We recalculated management’s analysis of the accounting impact detailed above if the non-taxable treatment was 
successfully challenged by the tax authorities in order to assess whether it is reasonable.
Key 
observations
Given the uncertainty related to the tax accounting treatment, we concurred with management’s conclusion to disclose this 
as an uncertain tax position. 
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Materiality £4.3m (2016: £4.0m) £2.7 (2016: £2.5m)
Basis for determining materiality 2% of net assets (2016: 2%) 2% of net assets (2016: 2%)
Rationale for the benchmark  
applied
Net assets was considered a more stable base 
than profits due to the effect of unrealised fair 
value gains/losses in each financial year.
The long-term value for shareholders is also in 
the asset base as the Group generates its wealth 
through royalties acquired. Considering that 
these are often bought in the development 
phase of an asset's life a significant portion of the 
Company’s value at this moment is not reflected 
in the income statement.

72 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
FI N A N C I A L S T A T EM E N T S We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £86,000 (2016: £80,000) for  
the Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the  
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Consistent with how the Group is managed we consider the Group to be one component. Consequently all assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses are subject to full scope audit.
There were no changes to the overall scope of the audit compared to the prior year.
OTHER INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to  
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to  
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider 
the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the 
auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from  
a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
USE OF OUR REPORT
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
OTHER MATTERS
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by shareholders at the AGM on June 11, 2014 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ending December 31, 2014 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including 
previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is four years, covering the years ending December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 80
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND  
COMPANY STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Anglo Pacific Group PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’) secure natural resources royalties and streams by creating 
new royalties directly with operators or by acquiring existing royalties. The Group has royalties and investments in mining and exploration 
interests primarily in Australia, North and South America and Europe, with a diversified exposure to commodities represented by coal, 
vanadium, uranium, gold and iron ore.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange and incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 1 Savile Row, London, W1S 3JR, United Kingdom (registered 
number: 897608).
2  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINT Y
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and estimates that can have a significant 
impact on the financial statements. Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most critical accounting 
judgement relates to the classification of royalty arrangements and the key sources of estimation uncertainty relate to the calculation of the 
fair value of certain royalty arrangements and the key assumption used when assessing impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets. The use of inaccurate or unreasonable assumptions in assessments made for any of these estimates could result in a 
significant impact on the financial results.
Critical accounting judgements
Classification of royalty arrangements: initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Directors must decide whether the Group’s royalty arrangements should be classified as:
• Intangible Assets in accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’;
• Financial Assets in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’; or
• Investment properties in accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’.
The Directors use the following selection criteria to identify the characteristics which determine which accounting standard to apply to each 
royalty arrangement:
Type 1 – Intangible assets (“vanilla” royalties): Royalties, in their simplest form, are classified as intangible assets by the Group. The Group 
considers the substance of a simple vanilla royalty to be economically similar to holding a direct interest in the underlying mineral asset. 
Existence risk (the commodity physically existing in the quantity demonstrated), production risk (that the operator can achieve production 
and operate a commercially viable project), timing risk (commencement and quantity produced, determined by the operator) and price risk 
(returns vary depending on the future commodity price, driven by future supply and demand) are all risks which the Group participates in 
on a similar basis to an owner of the underlying mineral licence. Furthermore, in a vanilla royalty, there is only a right to receive cash to the 
extent there is production and there are no interest payments, minimum payment obligations or means to enforce production or guarantee 
repayment. These are accounted for as intangible assets under IAS 38.
Type 2 – Financial assets (royalties with additional financial protection): In certain circumstances where the ‘vanilla’ risk is considered too high, 
but the Group still fundamentally believes in the quality or potential of the underlying resource, the Group will look to introduce additional 
protective measures. This has typically taken the form of performance milestone penalties (usually resulting in the receipt of cash or cash 
equivalent), minimum payment terms and interest provisions or mechanisms to convert the initial outlay into the equity instruments of the 
operator in the event of project deferral. Once an operation is in production, these mechanisms generally fall away such that the royalty will 
display identical characteristics and risk profile to the vanilla royalties; however, it is the contractual right to enforce the receipt of cash 
through to production which results in these royalties being treated as financial assets in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39. 
Type 3 – Investment property: Royalties which are derived from the ownership of sub-stratum land are accounted for as investment 
properties under IAS 40, even though the substance of their commercial terms is identical to vanilla royalties. The Group does not expect 
to obtain royalties in this manner going forward, as it is unusual for sub-stratum minerals not to be the property of the state.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 A summary of the Group’s accounting approach is set out below:
Accounting classification Substance of contractual terms Accounting treatment Examples
Intangible assets • Simple royalty with no right to 
receive cash other than through 
a royalty related to production
• Investment is presented as an 
intangible asset and carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment provision
• Royalty income is recognised as 
revenue in the income statement
• Intangible asset is amortised on  
a systematic basis
• Intangible asset is assessed for 
indicators of impairment at each 
period end
• Narrabri
• Maracás Menchen
• Four Mile
• Salamanca
• Pilbara
• Ring of Fire
Available-for-sale debt financial 
asset
• Royalty arrangement with a 
contractual right to receive  
cash (e.g. through a mandated 
interest rate or milestones 
which, if not met, trigger 
repayment)
• Financial asset is recognised at  
fair value on the balance sheet
• Changes in fair value due to 
changes in expected future cash 
flows are recognised within the 
income statement with other 
valuation changes taken to 
reserves
• Fixed effective interest income 
recognised in the income 
statement
• Royalty receipts reduce the  
asset’s carrying value
• Jogjakarta
• Dugbe 1
• McClean Lake
• Piauí*
Available-for-sale equity financial 
assets
• Similar in contractual terms  
to an intangible asset
• However, includes a right to 
convert into equity (noting  
that for EVBC this right was 
subsequently extinguished)
• Financial asset is carried at fair 
value with fair value movements 
recognised in reserves
• Royalty income is recognised as 
revenue in the income statement
• Asset is assessed for impairment 
at each reporting period end
• EVBC
Investment property • Direct ownership of sub-stratum 
land
• Returns based on royalty related 
production
• Investment property is carried at 
fair value on the balance sheet
• Movements in fair value 
recognised in income statement
• Royalty income is recognised as 
revenue in the income statement
• Kestrel
• Crinum
*  Due to having one or more embedded options that are not closely related, the Group has decided to evoke the fair value option for Piauí. We note that on transition to IFRS 9 all royalties currently 
accounted for under IAS 39 will be accounted for as FVTPL under IFRS 9. 
The Group considers that the application of the above accounting standards, and the resulting accounting classification and financial impact 
of each in the financial statements, most appropriately reflects the substance of the underlying commercial terms of each royalty 
arrangement. The application of each standard to the underlying royalty arrangement, rather than electing to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 to all 
royalties, is consistent currently with the Group’s international peer group and as such enables its stakeholders to make informed investment 
decisions.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Assessment of fair value of royalty arrangements held at fair value
A number of the Group’s royalty arrangements are held at fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models (and other 
valuation techniques) using assumptions considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be applied by a market 
participant. The determination of assumptions used in assessing fair values is subjective and the use of different valuation assumptions could 
have a significant impact on financial results.
In particular, expected future cash flows, which are used in discounted cash flows models are inherently uncertain and could materially 
change over time. They are significantly affected by a number of factors including reserves and resources and timing/likelihood of mines 
entering production together with economic factors such as commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates.
The Group’s most significant royalty arrangement held at fair value is Kestrel, for which the key assumptions and sensitivity analysis are set  
out in note 14.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 Impairment review of intangible assets
Intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date with the assessment considering variables such as the 
production profiles, production commissioning dates where applicable, forecast commodity prices and guidance from the mine operators.
Where indicators are identified, the starting point for the impairment review will be to measure the expected future cash flows expected from 
the royalty arrangement should the project continue/come into production. A pre-tax nominal discount rate of between 6.50% and 18.00% 
is applied to the future cash flows. The discount rate of each royalty arrangement is derived using a capital asset pricing model specific to the 
underlying project, making reference to the risk free rate of return expected on an investment with the same time horizon as the expected 
mine life, together with the country risk associated with the location of the operation. Changes in discount rate are most sensitive to changes 
in the risk free rate and the expected mine life.
The outcome of this net present value calculation is then risk weighted to reflect management’s current assessment of the overall likelihood 
and timing of each project coming into production and royalty income arising. This assessment is impacted by news flow relating to the 
underlying operation in the period, in conjunction with management’s assessment of the economic viability of the project based on 
commodity price projections. 
Uncertain tax provisions
The Group has incurred significant losses and impairment charges over the last four years. These losses have resulted, in some instances, in 
capital restructuring involving related Group entities, for which the Group obtained advice from professional advisors. This advice involved the 
interpretation of certain tax legislation for which there is no clear precedent or guidance. Absent clear guidance from relevant tax authorities 
there is the possibility that those tax authorities could interpret the legislation in a different way from the Group, which could result in a 
material reduction in the deferred tax asset and the recognition of a material current tax provision at December 31, 2017. These amounts are 
estimated at £3.3m and £3.6m respectively. See note 10 for further details.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
3.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial statements 
have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical costs basis, as modified by the revaluation of coal royalties (investment 
property) and certain financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed 
in note 2.
We highlight on the face of the income statement the following material balances which have been separated to assist users understand 
the performance of the Group:
• Gain/(Loss) on sale of mining and exploration interests (refer to note 17)
• Impairment of mining and exploration interests (refer to note 17)
• Impairment of royalty and exploration intangible assets (refer to note 16)
• Revaluation of royalty financial instruments (refer to note 15)
• Revaluation of coal royalties – Kestrel (refer to note 14)
3.1.1 Going concern
The financial position of the Group and its cash flows are set out on pages 77 and 80. The Directors have considered the principal risks of the 
Company which are set out on page 18 to 23 as well as access to funding as set out in our borrowings note 24 and considered key sensitivities 
which could impact on the level of available borrowings. As at December 31, 2017, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £8.1m and 
subject to continued covenant compliance, has access to £29.6m through its undrawn secured US$40.0m revolving credit facility.
The Directors have considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the period to the end of March 2019. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance and other uncertainties, together with 
the Group’s cash position and access to the undrawn revolving credit facility, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its 
current facilities for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going basis in preparing its financial statements.
3.1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) Amendments to IFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after January 1, 2017:
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 cycle: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
• Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 83
GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION The adoption of these amendments has not had a significant impact on the accounting policies, methods of computation or presentation 
applied by the Group.
The Group has not early adopted any other amendment, standard or interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective. It is expected 
that where applicable, these standards and amendments will be adopted on each respective effective date.
(b) New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU:
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Group’s royalty income is derived from three sources: assets accounted for as investment property (Kestrel) under IAS 40, assets at fair 
value (EVBC) accounted for under IAS 39 and assets accounted for as intangibles (Narrabri, Maracás Menchen and Four Mile) under IAS 38.
The royalty income derived from investment properties will continue to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 40, while the royalty income 
derived from assets at fair value will be accounted for under IFRS 9 following its adoption. The royalty income derived from assets classified as 
intangibles will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15, which the Directors do not believe will have a material impact on the recognition 
and disclosure of revenue. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s results for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been as follows:
Classification and measurement
The measurement and accounting treatment of the Group’s financial assets impacted by the application of IFRS 9 are outlined in the 
table below:
Assets IFRS 9 Classification IFRS 9 Accounting Treatment
Royalty Financial Instruments
• McClean Lake
• Dugbe 1
• Piauí
• EVBC
• Jogjakarta
Fair value through 
profit or loss 
(‘FVTPL’)
Held at fair value on the balance sheet, with fair value movements taken through 
the income statement.
Royalty income is not recognised as revenue in the income statement and instead 
reduces the fair value of the asset.
Other non-current receivables
• McClean Lake
Amortised cost Carried at amortised cost less impairment on the balance sheet, interest is recognised 
in the income statement at the effective interest rate for the asset.
Mining and exploration interests Fair value through other 
comprehensive income 
(‘FVOCI’)
Held at fair value on the balance sheet, with fair value movements taken through other 
comprehensive income and not recycled to the income statement on disposal.
Dividends recognised as income in the income statement.
There would have been no impact on the Group’s net assets at January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017. The Group’s results for the year would 
have reduced from the reported profit after tax of £11,203,000 to £8,222,000 as a result of the following:
• (£1,774,000) – gain on disposal of mining and exploration interest, no longer recycled and recognised in the income statement;
• (£1,689,000) – royalty income received from EVBC, now recognised in the fair value movement; and
• £482,000 – revaluation of EVBC now recognised in the income statement (net of deferred tax).
Impairment
IFRS 9 introduces an ‘expected credit loss’ model for the assessment of impairment of financial assets held at amortised costs. The Group has 
not undertaken a detailed assessment of expected credit loss applicable to the Group’s other non-current receivable arising from the Denison 
transaction, however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s results. The Group’s royalty financial instrument in relation to 
the Jogjakarta royalty was fully impaired during 2017 and therefore no further losses would arise from expected credit loss.
IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 became effective for the Group from January 1, 2018. As the effects of applying these standards are considered immaterial 
to the Group, the Group has elected not to restate prior period on adoption of the new standards in 2018.

APG_AR17_28.03.18_BACK_ARTWORK
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 84
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 16 was published in January 2016 and will be effective for the Group from January 1, 2019, replacing IAS 17 Leases.
The principal impact of IFRS 16 will be to change the accounting treatment by lessees of leases currently classified as operating leases. Lease 
agreements will give rise to the recognition by the lessee of an asset, representing the right to use the leased item, and a related liability for 
future lease payments. Lease costs will be recognised in the income statement in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use asset over the 
lease term, and finance charges representing the unwinding of the discount on the lease liability.
As the Group’s operating leases relate primarily to office space and office equipment, the adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to result in  
a material increase in lease liabilities or a corresponding increase in property, plant and equipment right-of-use assets. Information on the 
Group’s operating lease commitments is disclosed in note 30. 
Other issued standards and amendments that are not yet effective are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
3.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
The financial statements incorporate a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Company has the power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether 
the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for in the parent company at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in 
consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group.
3.3 Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, 
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date of the transaction (and not retranslated). Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are charged/credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation 
reserve in equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency balances with foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the 
foreseeable future, and therefore form part of the Group’s net investment in these foreign operations, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. If a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in equity are reclassified in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION 3.4 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, 
plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Once a mining project has been established as 
commercially viable, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised as a producing asset within ‘Other 
Assets’ together with any amount transferred from ‘Exploration and Evaluation Costs’ (note 3.6(b)).
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or, where applicable, over the remaining life of the mine if shorter once it  
is operating in the manner intended by management. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units  
of production and/or straight-line basis as follows:
Equipment and fixtures 4 to 10 years
Other Assets:
Producing assets Units of production (over reserves)
Coal tenures Units of production (over reserves)
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
3.5 Coal royalties (investment property)
Royalty arrangements which are derived from the ownership of sub-stratum lands are accounted for as investment properties in accordance 
with IAS 40. Investment property is held to earn a return in the form of royalty entitlements arising from mining activity and is initially 
measured at cost including any transaction costs. Investment property is subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date with any 
valuation movements recognised in the income statement. Fair value is determined by a suitably qualified independent external consultant 
based on the discounted future royalty income expected to accrue to the Group. 
3.6 Intangible assets
(a) Royalty arrangements
Royalty arrangements which are identified and classified as intangible assets are initially measured at cost, including any transaction costs. 
Upon commencement of production at the underlying mining operation intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life 
of the mine. Amortisation rates are adjusted on a prospective basis for all changes to estimates of the life of mine.
(b) Exploration and evaluation costs 
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed 
assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential.
Expenditure on exploration and evaluation activities is capitalised when there is a high degree of confidence in the project’s viability and 
hence it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. If this is no longer the case, an impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement. Amortisation of capitalised exploration and evaluation costs does not commence until the underlying project commences 
commercial production.
3.7 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If such an indication is identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value (less costs of disposal) and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that has been adjusted to reflect the risks specific to that asset. If the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to be less than its carrying value, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is also recognised in the income statement. 
Should an impairment loss subsequently reverse, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment been recognised. A reversal of an impairment loss is also recognised in the income statement.
3.8 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
(a) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. On 
initial recognition loans and receivables are stated at their fair value. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s 
trade and other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 86
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 (c) Derivative financial instruments
The Group will selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with 
its Australian dollar denominated royalty income, when considered necessary. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed 
in note 21.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial 
liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 
months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
(d) Mining and exploration interests
Mining and exploration interests are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under 
a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the time frame established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Mining and exploration interests are classified upon initial recognition as available-for-sale financial assets. 
Interests classified as available-for-sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at their fair value. For available-for-sale investments, 
unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the investment revaluation reserve, until the security is either disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit or loss for the period. Unquoted investments are 
measured at cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. When a market price can be established these investments are revalued 
to fair value accordingly. 
(e) Royalty instruments
Royalty instruments are recognised or derecognised on completion date where a purchase or sale of the royalty is under a contract, and 
are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Royalty instruments are classified as either debt or equity instruments depending on the nature of the individual agreement.
Debt
Assets classified as debt instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Upon initial recognition an effective interest rate is 
computed based on the estimated future cash flows. Expected future cash flows are determined based on non-observable market data 
such as commodity price forecasts and estimated production schedules. Valuation movements caused by changes in expected future cash 
flows, which could be caused by changes in resource estimates or commodity price assumptions, are recognised in the Income Statement 
along with the effective interest, if material, with other valuation changes taken to other comprehensive income. Amounts are required to 
be recognised whether received in cash or not.
Equity
Similar to debt instruments, equity instruments are carried at fair value at each reporting date, based on the estimated future cash flows from 
the underlying operation. All valuation movements are recognised in other comprehensive income, except to the extent where valuation is 
below cost and is considered ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ in accordance with IAS 39 and the policy outlined in note 3.9. In this case, the 
valuation difference is recycled through the Income Statement.
(f ) Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
(g) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition. After initial recognition these are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(h) Borrowings
Interest bearing bank facilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Transaction costs are 
recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility.
(i) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
3.9 Impairment of financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset.
APG_AR17_28.03.18_BACK_ARTWORK
ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 87
GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and 
the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in the income 
statement. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through 
the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to available-for-sale equity investments are recognised when the decline in fair value is considered significant or 
prolonged, which are defined as follows:
• Prolonged: a period of greater than 18 months that the interest’s fair value is below cost; or
• Significant: a decline in fair value of greater than 25% relative to an individual asset’s original acquisition cost, or its rebased cost post 
impairment.
These impairment losses are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income to the income statement. The loss recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost or rebased 
cost and the current fair value. Once the Group has recognised an impairment loss on an available-for-sale equity investment, it cannot 
recognise a reversal through the income statement. 
Impairment losses on debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are reversed only if in a subsequent period, the fair value of that debt 
instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. The amount 
of such reversal is recognised through the income statement.
3.10 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to 
utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is 
included in the accounting for the business combination.

ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 88
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 3.11 Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (options and jointly-owned shares) of the Company. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to 
be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market performance conditions;
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options and jointly-owned shares that are expected to 
vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to 
be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options and jointly-owned shares that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
3.12 Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
• ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares in issue.
• ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of issuance costs.
Other reserves
• ‘Merger reserve’ is created when more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new 
shares by the Company. 
• ‘Warrant reserve’ The warrant reserve was created in June 2014 in connection with the issue of share warrants as part consideration of the 
Maracás royalty.
• ’Investment revaluation reserve‘ represents gains and losses due to the revaluation of the investments in mining and exploration interests 
and royalty instruments from the opening carrying values, including the effects of deferred tax and foreign currency changes.
• ‘Share based payment reserve’ represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
• ‘Foreign currency reserve’ represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
• ‘Special reserve’ represents the level of profit attributable to the Group for the period ended June 30, 2002 which was created as part of a 
capital reduction performed in 2002.
• ‘Investment in own shares’ represents the shares held by the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust for awards made under the Joint 
Share Ownership Plan (‘JSOP’) (note 27 and note 28).
• ‘Retained earnings’ represents retained profits.
Of these reserves £88,601,000 are considered distributable as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: £93,928,000). 
3.13 Revenue recognition
The revenue of the Group comprises mainly royalty income. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable after 
deducting discounts, value added tax and other sales tax. The royalty income becomes receivable on extraction and sale of the relevant 
minerals, and once able to be reliably measured, the revenue is recognised.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the carrying value and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
3.14 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease except where another more 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease, except where another systematic 
basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
3.15 Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of the interim dividend, when it is paid to the shareholders.
3.16 Alternative Performance Measures
The financial statements include certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which include adjusted earnings per share, dividend cover 
and free cash flow per share. These APMs are defined in the table of contents and explained in the Strategic Report on page 24, and are 
reconciled to GAAP measures in the notes 11, 12 and 33 respectively.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION 4 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee evaluates the financial 
performance of the Group based on a portfolio view of its individual royalty arrangements. Royalty income and its associated impact on 
operating profit is the key focus of the Executive Committee. The income from royalties is presented based on the jurisdiction in which  
the income is deemed to be sourced as follows: 
Australia: Kestrel, Narrabri, Four Mile, Pilbara, Mount Ida
Americas: McClean Lake, Maracás Menchen, Ring of Fire, Piauí, Amapá and Tucano 
Europe: EVBC, Salamanca, Bulqiza
Other: Jogjakarta, Dugbe I, and includes the Group’s mining and exploration interests
The following is an analysis of the Group’s results by reportable segment. The key segment result presented to the Executive Committee 
for making strategic decisions and allocation of resources is operating profit as analysed below.
The segment information for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows (noting that total segment operating profit corresponds to 
operating profit before impairments, revaluations and gains/losses on disposals which is reconciled to Profit/(Loss) before tax on the face

The amounts provided to the Executive Committee with respect to total segment liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that 
of the financial statements. These liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
The royalty related income in Australia of £33,692,000 (2016: £17,691,000) includes the Kestrel and Narrabri royalties which generated 
£28,746,000 and £4,946,000 respectively (2016: Kestrel £13,134,000; Narrabri: £4,243,000). Individually the revenue generated by Kestrel 
and Narrabri royalties represents greater than 10% of the Group’s revenue in 2016 and 2017.
Impairments
There has been no impairment of the Group’s royalty intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Group recognised 
an impairment charge of £2.0m in relation to the Amapá royalty, which is within the “Americas Royalties” segment during the year ended 
December 31, 2016. Refer to note 16 for further details on the Group’s impairments.

The Group’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 11.2% (2016: 6.9%). The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared  
to the headline tax rate is mainly due to the utilisation of carried forward losses not previously recognised and the reduction in the tax rates 
applicable to certain deferred tax liabilities.
In future periods, it is expected that the Group’s effective tax rate will mainly be driven by withholding taxes suffered in overseas jurisdictions.
Refer to note 25 for information regarding the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Uncertain tax provisions
The Group has investments in a large number of jurisdictions and has established structures in certain of those jurisdictions where its royalties 
are located. Due to the complexity of tax in relation to royalty assets, the Group frequently takes local tax advice in relation to transactions. 
Where the amount of tax payable or receivable is uncertain, the Group could establish provisions based on its interpretation of tax law and its 
judgement of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery, assisted by third party tax advice received. There can be no certainty that tax 
authorities would make the same interpretation. See note 2 for further details.

Earnings per share – basic 5.88p 15.60p

Earnings per ordinary share excludes the issue of shares under the Group’s JSOP, as the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its right to receive 
dividends on the 925,933 ordinary 2p shares it holds as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: 925,933).
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings represents the Group’s underlying operating performance from core activities. Adjusted earnings is the profit attributable 
to equity holders less all valuation movements, non-cash impairments and amortisation charges (which are non-cash adjustments that arise 
primarily due to changes in commodity prices), finance costs, any associated deferred tax and any profit or loss on non-core asset disposals 
as these are not expected to be ongoing.
Valuation and other non-cash movements such as these are not considered by management in assessing the level of profit and cash 
generation available for distribution to shareholders. As such, an adjusted earnings measure is used which reflects the underlying 
contribution from the Group’s royalties during the year.

In calculating the adjusted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue takes into account the dilutive effect of the 
Employee Share Option Scheme in those years where the Group has adjusted earnings. In years where the Group has an adjusted loss, the 
Employee Share Option Scheme is considered anti-dilutive as including them in the diluted number of shares outstanding would decrease 
the loss per share, as such they are excluded.
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the purpose of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share and basic and diluted 
adjusted earnings per share are as follows:

12 DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND COVER
On February 4, 2017 an interim dividend of 3.00p per share was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2016. On 
August 9, 2017 a final dividend of 3.00p per share was paid to shareholders to make a total dividend for the year ended December 31, 2016 of 
6.00p per share. Following the Group’s move to a quarterly dividend payment, on November 15, 2017, an interim dividend of 3.00p per share 
was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2017. Total dividends paid during the year were £15.9m (2016: £11.8m).
On February 15, 2018 a further interim dividend of 1.50p per share was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2017. 
This dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The Directors propose that a final dividend of 2.50p per share 
be paid to shareholders on May 31, 2018, to make a total dividend for the year of 7.00p per share. This dividend is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The proposed final dividend for 2017 will be payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on May 18, 2018. The total estimated 
dividend to be paid is £4.5m. At the present time the Board has resolved not to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
Dividend cover
Dividend cover is calculated as the number of times adjusted earnings per share exceeds the dividend per share. The Group’s adjusted 
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 is 16.82p per share (note 11) with dividends for the year totalling 7.00p, resulting  
in dividend cover of 2.4x (2016: adjusted earnings per share 9.76p, dividends totalling 6.00p, dividend cover 1.6x).

uncertain and as a result fully impaired these assets resulting in an impairment charge of £1.4m. There were no impairments during 2016

The Group’s coal royalty entitlements comprise the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalties, and derive from mining activity carried out within  
the Group’s private land area in Queensland, Australia. Rather uniquely to this royalty, the sub-stratum land is the property of the freeholder, 
including the minerals contained within. The ownership of the land therefore entitles the Group to a royalty, equivalent to what the State 
receives on areas outside the Group’s private land. This royalty is accounted for as Investment Property in accordance with IAS 40.
The coal royalty was valued during December 2017 at £104.3m (A$180.2m) (2016: £116.9m and A$200.3m) by an independent coal industry 
advisor, on a net present value of the pre-tax cash flow discounted at a nominal rate of 7.50% (2016: 7.50%). The key assumptions in the 
independent valuation relate to price and discount rate.
The price assumptions used in the 2017 valuation decrease from US$141/t in the short-term to a long-term flat nominal price of US$119/t.  
If the price were to increase or decrease 10% over the life of the mine the valuation effect would be:
• a 10% reduction in the coal price would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$152.8m (£88.4m) and an increase of £28.2m 
in the revaluation loss in the income statement to £16.3m; and
• a 10% increase in the coal price would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$209.5m (£121.2m) and a £17.4m reversal of the 
revaluation loss in the income statement, resulting in a revaluation gain of £5.5m.
The pre-tax nominal discount rate used for the asset is 7.50%, of the discount rate used were to increase or decrease by 1% the valuation 
effect would be:
• a 1% reduction in the nominal discount rate would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$186.7m (£108.0m) and a £3.9m 
reduction in the revaluation loss in the income statement to £8.0m; and
• a 1% increase in the nominal discount rate would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$174.2m (£100.8m) and a £3.6m 
increase in the revaluation loss in the income statement to £15.5m.
The net royalty income from this investment is currently taxed in Australia at a rate of 30%. The revaluation of the underlying Australian dollar 
asset is recognised in the Income Statement with the retranslation of the Group’s sterling presentation currency recognised in the foreign 
currency translation reserve.
Were the coal royalty to be realised at the revalued amount there are £5.3m (A$9.2m) of capital losses potentially available to offset against 
taxable gains. As it is not the Group’s present intention to dispose of the coal royalty, these losses have not been included in the deferred tax 
calculation (note 25). Were the coal royalty to be carried at cost the carrying value would be £0.2m (2016: £0.2m). The Directors do not 
presently have any intention to dispose of the coal royalty.
Refer to note 32 for additional fair value disclosures relating to Kestrel.
The shares over the entity which is the beneficial owner of the Kestrel royalty have been guaranteed as security in connection with the 
Group’s borrowing facility (note 24).

Effective interest of £0.3m was recognised in other income (see note 9) for the year ended December 31, 2017 (2016: £0.2m). This was directly 
offset by cash received in the period of the same amount.
Jogjakarta
During 2017, the Group’s convertible debenture with Indo Mines Limited, including a gross revenue royalty over the Jogjakarta project, was 
fully provided for as a result of inherent uncertainty of this project reaching commercial production due to the limited progress made to 
date by the operator in securing long-term strategic investment. This has resulted in a £3.1m impairment charge to the income statement.
Indo Mines is subject to a takeover bid by its majority shareholder, which could see the Group recover some of the debenture provided for.
Dugbe 1
On February 23, 2016, Hummingbird Resources PLC (‘Hummingbird’), the operator of the Dugbe 1 project, gave notice under the US$15.0m 
royalty financing arrangement with the Group that a Mineral Development Agreement (‘MDA’) had been approved by the Liberian 
Government although this is yet to be signed into law. There are certain mechanisms available to the Group to recover the US$15.0m 
investment, although at present these seem unlikely to be triggered.
The net smelter return royalty over the Dugbe 1 project is accounted for as an available-for-sale debt financial asset as outlined in note 2.  
As at December 31, 2017, the Group assessed the likely start date of commercial production at Dugbe 1 to be 2025, and have applied a 75% 
probability factor to the project reaching commercial production to the discounted future flows of the royalty with an 18% post tax nominal 
discount rate, resulting in a valuation of £3.4m (2016: £6.8m). The £3.4m decrease in carrying value has been recognised as an impairment  
to the income statement for the year.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 McClean Lake
On February 13, 2017, the Group completed a C$43.5m (£26.6m) financing and streaming agreement with Denison Mines Inc (‘Denison’).  
The financing agreement comprises two separate transactions: a 13-year amortising secured loan of C$40.8m (£24.9m) with an interest rate 
of 10% per annum payable to the Group and is classified as non-current other receivables (note 20); and a streaming agreement, which 
entitles the Group to receive Denison’s portion of toll milling proceeds from the McClean Lake Mill after the first 215Mlbs of throughput from 
July 1, 2016, was acquired for C$2.7m (£1.7m) and is classified as available-for-sale debt in accordance with note 2. Given the early stage nature 
of the project the Group has considered there to be no value to the option.
As at December 31, 2017, the Group assessed the probability of the McClean Lake Mill achieving throughput in excess of 215Mlbs at 50%, and 
applied this to the discounted future cash flows of the stream with a 6.5% post tax nominal discount rate, resulting in a valuation of £1.9m.  
The £0.2m increase in the carrying value of the stream has been recognised in the income statement for the year.
Piauí
On September 14, 2017, the Group acquired a 1% gross revenue royalty over the Piauí nickel-cobalt project in Brazil for US$2.0m (£1.6m). 
Under the acquisition agreement, subject to certain development milestones, the Group has the option to acquire up to a total of US$70.0m 
in additional gross revenue royalties. The Group has decided to evoke the fair value option in classifying this royalty financial instrument, due 
to there being one or more embedded options that are not closely related in the underlying contract (note 2).
As at December 31, 2017, the Group assessed the probability of the Piauí project reaching commercial production at 30% and applied this to 
the discounted future cash flows of the royalty with a 12% post tax nominal discount rate, resulting in a valuation of £1.6m which is equal to 
the acquisition cost.

Exploration and evaluation costs
The exploration and evaluation costs comprise expenditure that was directly attributable to the Trefi coal project in British Columbia, Canada. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty that the Trefi coal project will be developed, the Group fully impaired it in 2014.
Acquisition of royalty interests
Under the terms of the Maracás Menchen royalty sale agreement entered into in 2014, a further US$3.0m of cash is payable when the project 
reaches certain annualised production milestones. The first of these milestones was annualised production over a quarter of 9,500t which 
was achieved in Q3 2017, resulting in the Group paying the first tranche of deferred consideration of US$1.5m (£1.1m) in November 2017. 
This amount had previously been provided for with a corresponding deferred acquisition cost asset (see note 18) which was transferred to 
intangibles on payment in the year.
The second tranche of deferred consideration of US$1.5m, becomes payable once annualised production over a quarter reaches 12,000t. 
Based on the current publicly available production profile, management do not consider it probable that this milestone will be achieved in 
the foreseeable future. As a result no liability for this portion of the deferred consideration has been recognised as at December 31, 2017.
On March 31, 2016, in satisfaction of the outstanding principal of £0.7m, owed by Atrum Coal NL, the Group accepted a 0.10% gross revenue 
royalty over the Groundhog project in British Columbia. The promissory note arose from the 2014 sale of the Group’s Panorama Coal 
tenements, which included the Groundhog project. 
Amortisation of royalty interests
The Group’s royalty intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis, upon the commencement of production at the underlying mining 
operation, over the life of mine.
Three of the underlying mining operations of the Group’s royalty intangibles assets were in production during 2017, and were amortised on 
the following basis:
Royalty interest

December 31, 2017

Maracás Menchen 23,456 22,318 29 years 26 years
Four Mile 2,597 2,968 10 years 7 years
Amortisation of the Group’s remaining royalty interests will commence once they begin commercial production. As at December 31, 2017, the 
shares over the entity which is the beneficial owner of the Narrabri royalty have been guaranteed as security in connection with the Group’s 
borrowing facility (note 24).
Impairments of royalty intangible assets
As described in notes 3.6 and 3.7, at each reporting date the Group’s royalty intangible assets are reviewed for any impairment indicators. 
Consideration is given to the presence or occurrence of adverse operational developments at the underlying mines, together with any 
significant declines in commodity prices. Where impairment indicators exist, a full impairment review is carried out to determine whether the 
discounted future expected cash flows (calculated on a value-in-use basis) exceed cost. Note 2 outlines the impairment methodology applied.
There were no impairments recognised during the year ended December 31, 2017 in respect of the Group’s royalty intangible assets. During 
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Group’s Amapá royalty was fully impaired, as detailed below.
Amapá
Production at Amapá has been suspended since 2013 following a major port incident. The mine’s then operator, Zamin Ferrous Limited, had 
previously indicated that attempts were being made to restructure its finances in order to fund the rebuilding of the port facilities, however, in 
2016 the Directors understood that Zamin had filed for bankruptcy protection in Brazil. As a result the Directors assessed the timing of Amapá 
returning to commercial production as being indeterminable and recognised an impairment charge of £2.0m for the year ended December 
31, 2016, reducing the carrying value to nil.
There have been no developments at Amapá during the year ended December 31, 2017, that would result in a reversal of management’s 
assessment.

The current strategy of the Group is to obtain royalties by other means, and as such, these assets, which have historically been acquired with 
a view to negotiating royalty acquisitions, have been gradually disposed of as they are now non-core to the Group’s primary business. The 
fair values of listed securities are based on quoted market prices. Unquoted investments are initially recognised using cost where fair value 
cannot be reliably determined. In the absence of an active market for these securities, the Group considers each unquoted security to ensure 
there has been no material change in the fair value since initial recognition. Further guidance on fair value measurement is provided in note 2.
An impairment charge (representing the recognition of losses previously deferred to equity) is recognised in the income statement when 
the absolute decline in value below cost of any individual investment is considered ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ in accordance with the Group’s 
impairment policy. Following further declines in the quoted market prices of a number of the listed securities in which the Group has 
an interest, an impairment charge of £219,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: £29,000) was recognised.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Group realised £2.4m in cash (December 31, 2016: £3.4m) through its disposal of a number of 
its mining and exploration interests from which management no longer considered royalty opportunities to exist. These disposals resulted 
in a gain of £1.8m for the year ended December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: £2.4m).

Deferred acquisition costs
As at December 31, 2016, deferred acquisition costs largely represented the corresponding asset for the deferred consideration payable 
by the Group in relation to its acquisition of the Maracás Menchen vanadium royalty in 2014 (see note 16). Under the terms of the royalty 
sale agreement, the Group was required to pay an additional US$1.5m (£1.1m) once production reached an annualised rate over a quarter 
of 9,500t. The production rate was achieved in Q3 2017, resulting in the Group remitting the deferred consideration in November 2017, 
with the deferred cost asset transferred to give a corresponding increase in the royalty intangible assets (refer to note 16).
As at December 31, 2017, deferred acquisition costs represent those costs associated with royalty acquisitions that the Group are actively 
pursuing and expect to complete in 2018.
Deferred financing costs
As at December 31, 2017, deferred financing costs represent the costs associated with entering into the new undrawn US$30.0m, three-
year secured revolving credit facility with a US$10.0m accordion that have been deferred and will be amortised over the term of the facility. 
All deferred costs relating to the Group’s previous facility were released to the income statement, at the time of refinancing with the new 
facility and accordion.

Trade and other receivables principally comprise amounts relating to royalties receivable for the final quarter in each year. The decrease in 
royalty receivables as at December 31, 2017 is the result of the Kestrel royalty being remitted on a monthly basis since July 2017, compared 
to 30 days after the end of the quarter in 2016. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately their fair value.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION Non-current other receivables
On February 13, 2017, the Group completed a C$43.5m (£26.6m) financing and streaming agreement with Denison. The streaming agreement 
is classified as an available-for-sale debt royalty financial instrument (note 15), with an initial value of C$2.7m (£1.7m).
The financing agreement is structured as a 13-year secured loan of C$40.8m (£24.9m) with an interest rate of 10% per annum payable to the 
Group. The loan contains mandatory repayment provisions in any period where the equivalent toll revenues exceed the interest liability. 
Conversely, in any period when toll revenues are less than the interest payment, the shortfall is capitalised and carried forward to the next 
period. The loan principal, along with any capitalised interest, is repayable in full at maturity.
Subsequent to entering the financing agreement, the Group has earned £1.9m in interest revenue (2016: nil) and received principal 
repayments of £3.1m for the period to December 31, 2017.
Amounts due from subsidiaries are considered long-term loans. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of amounts due from 
subsidiaries is approximately their fair value.
21 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In 2016, the Group implemented a policy whereby foreign exchange forward contracts can be entered into to manage its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk associated with its Australian dollar denominated royalty income (note 32). These foreign exchange forward contracts are 
accounted for as financial assets or liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with note 3.8(c). The fair value of the 
foreign exchange forward contracts as at December 31 is as follows:

Net debt is a measure of the Group’s financial position. The Group uses net debt to monitor the sources and uses of financial resources, 
the availability of capital to invest or return to shareholders, and the resilience of the balance sheet. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group and Company’s net (debt)/cash and cash equivalents position after offsetting the revolving credit facility against cash and cash

in February 2018, which is available at LIBOR plus 250bps. Deferred borrowing costs relate to the establishment fees associated with the 
facility and will be amortised over its three-year term.
In February 2017, the Group refinanced its existing facility with a further three-year revolving credit facility of US$30.0m with a US$10.0m 
accordion, maturing in February 2020, which is available at LIBOR plus 300bps. The Group triggered the accordion in November 2017, 
and as at December 31, 2017 has access to US$40.0m (£29.6m).
The Group’s revolving credit facility is secured by way of a floating charge over the Group’s assets and is subject to a number of financial 
covenants, all of which have been met during the year ended December 31, 2017.

As the EBT has waived its right to receive dividends, the Company’s shares held by the EBT are excluded from the weighted average number 
of shares in issue for the purposes of calculating earnings per share in note 11.
28 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates fur equity-settled share-based compensation plans as follows:
• The HMRC approved Company Share Ownership Plan (the ‘CSOP’);
• The Unapproved Share Ownership Plan (the ‘USOP’);
• The JSOP operated through the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust; and
• The Value Creation Plan (the ‘VCP’).
(a) Company Share Ownership Plan 
Under the CSOP, share options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is 
equal to the average mid-market closing price of an ordinary share for the three days before the grant. The options are conditional on the 
employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period). The options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date, subject 
to the Group achieving its target growth in absolute TSR over the period of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the UK Retail Price 
Index; the options have a contractual option term of ten years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the 
options in cash.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 No awards were made under the CSOP during 2016 or 2017. In accordance with the terms of the CSOP, an employee forfeited 23,831  
options upon their resignation in 2016. 
(b) Unapproved Share Option Plan
The Group’s USOP was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. The plan was established to provide the Group additional scope to 
incentivise employees, particularly those who do not participate in the VCP, over and above the limit of the CSOP. In addition, the USOP  
is intended to replace the Group’s JSOP.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the average mid-market closing price of an ordinary share for the three days before 
the grant. The options are conditional on the employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period). The options are exercisable 
starting three years from the grant date and have a contractual option term of five years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation 
to repurchase or settle the options in cash.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2017 determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model was £0.39 per option 
granted in April 2017. The significant inputs into the model were the weighted average share price of £1.258 at the grant date, exercise price 
of £0.88, volatility of 40.21%, expected dividend yield of 4.77%, expected option life of four years and an annual risk free rate of 0.21%.
Out of the 2,097,593 outstanding options (2016: nil), nil options (2016: nil) were exercisable.

(c) Joint Share Ownership Plan 
Under the JSOP, the Remuneration Committee invites selected Executive Directors and employees to enter into an agreement with the Anglo 
Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Co-owner’) to acquire a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The shares are 
held in the name of the co-owner; however, the selected Directors and employees maintain a beneficial interest in these shares.
Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period) and the Group’s absolute total 
shareholder return growing at an annual rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three-year vesting 
period. In addition the Company’s share price must reach a hurdle price during the three-year vesting period as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at the time of making the award.
Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the Director or employee to 
receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales proceeds in 
excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the Remuneration Committee 
and will not be set less than the market value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP award is made.
No shares were awarded under the JSOP during 2016 or 2017, as a result there are no outstanding awards under this plan. 
(d) Value Creation Plan
Following the approval at the 2014 AGM, the Group implemented a new long-term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and 
selected senior management. The VCP was designed by the Remuneration Committee to incentivise the Executive Directors and senior 
management to drive growth in shareholder return over a five-year measurement period. At the 2016 AGM, shareholders approved the 
extension of the measurement period from five to seven years.
Under the terms of the VCP, no value would accrue to the participants unless growth in the Group’s total shareholder return over the 
measurement period is at least equal to 7% per annum. Subject to such threshold growth, participants would become entitled to receive nil 
or nominal cost options over the ordinary shares of the Company, subject to a cap, set by reference to a share of a pool value equal to 10% 
of the growth in the Company’s total shareholder return over the measurement period or, if less, 50% of the growth in the Company’s total 
shareholder return over the measurement period in excess of the threshold growth.
Options granted under the VCP will comprise three equal tranches, the first tranche exercisable as from the time of the grant of the options 
and the other tranches exercisable as from one and two years thereafter respectively. Subject to appropriate adjustments in accordance with 
the terms of the VCP, the maximum number of shares set under the option grants will not be capable of exceeding such number equating to 
7.5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the end of the measurement period.

the Group to take advantage of new growth opportunities whilst maximising shareholder value. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety 
of financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk. The Group operates controlled treasury policies which 
are monitored by management to ensure that the needs of the Group are met while minimising potential adverse effects of unpredictability 
of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance. The Group’s financial risk management should be read in conjunction with the 
principal risks outlined on pages 18 to 23 of the Strategic Report.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits held by the Group treasury function. The carrying amount of these assets 
approximates their fair value.
Liquidity and funding risk
The objective of the Company in managing funding risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. At 
December 31, 2017 the Group was debt free (2016: borrowings of £6.3m) and continued to have access to its undrawn US$40.0m (£29.6m) 
revolving credit facility.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayments 
periods. The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the 
Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the 
undiscounted amount is derived from the interest rate at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on 
which the Group may be required to pay.

Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, royalty instruments held as financial assets, trade and other receivables and 
investments. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets and total £37.5m at December 31, 
2017 (£16.9m at December 31, 2016).
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables, including royalty receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present the 
amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience 
and the current economic environment. In certain cases the Group has the right to audit the reported royalty income.
The Group’s credit risk on royalty interests held as financial instruments has been reviewed and the estimated current exposure is as disclosed 
in note 15 where the future contractual right to cash flows from these instruments is reflected in their fair value.
The credit risk on bank deposits is mitigated by banking with household name financial institutions in reputable jurisdictions. The Group has 
no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of currencies and counterparties.
The Group’s credit risk on foreign exchange forward contracts is mitigated by entering into these agreements with large financial institutions. 
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk, together with that of the contracting financial institution, by restricting the settlement date to no 
more than a year from the contract date. In addition the Group limits the quantum of the forward contracts to no more than an average 70% 
of forecast royalty revenue expected to be received by the date of settlement.
Share price risk
The Group is exposed to share price risk in respect of its mining and exploration interests which include listed and unlisted equity securities 
and any convertible instruments.
A 10% increase or decrease in the fair value of our mining and exploration interests (listed and unlisted) would increase/decrease the mining 
and exploration interests balance (and investment revaluation reserve in equity) by £1.6m at December 31, 2017 (£1.7m at December 31, 
2016). We note that if a 10% decrease were to occur then a further assessment would be required to determine whether the decrease was 
considered to be “significant” with any resulting impairment recognised in the income statement.
The Group’s mining and exploration interests are held for the purposes of generating additional royalties and are considered long-term, 
strategic investments. This strategy is unaffected by recent fluctuations in prices for mining and exploration equities; however, interests are 
continually monitored for indicators that may suggest problems for these companies raising capital or continuing their day-to-day business 
activities to ensure remedial action can be taken if necessary. This is expected to be a less significant part of the Group’s strategy going 
forward.
No specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these interests and the voting rights arising from these equity instruments  
are utilised in the Group’s favour.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 Other price risk
The royalty portfolio exposes the Group to other price risk through fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the prices of coking coal, iron 
ore, gold and uranium. As the Directors obtain independent commodity price forecasts, the generation of which takes into account fluctuations 
in prices, limited analysis of the impact of fluctuations on the valuations of the royalties has been undertaken in note 14 and note 15.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s transactional foreign exchange exposure arises from income, expenditure and purchase and sale of assets denominated in 
foreign currencies. With royalty income from Kestrel and Narrabri accounting for over 90% of the Group’s income (2016: 88%), the Group’s 
primary foreign exchange exposure is to the Australian dollar, which these royalties are denominated in. In 2016, the Group implemented a 
hedging policy whereby foreign exchange forward contracts can be entered into with a maximum exposure of 70% of forecast Australian 
dollar denominated royalty revenue expected to be received during a period not exceeding 12 months from contract date to settlement. 
Refer to note 20 for further details on the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2017. The  
Group has no other hedging programme in place.
In terms of material commitment, the risk in relation to currency fluctuations is assessed by the Executive Committee at the time the 
commitment is made and regularly reviewed.

Foreign exchange sensitivities
With the exception of the cash balances, the majority of the financial instruments not denominated in GBP are held in entities with the same 
functional currency and for the purpose of this sensitivity analysis, the impact of changing exchange rates on the translation of foreign 
subsidiaries into the Group’s presentation currency has been excluded.
In terms of the cash balance, the significant sensitivities are as follows:
• A +/- 10% change in the GBP: AUD rate would increase/decrease profit after tax and equity by £243k (2016: £114k);
• A +/- 10% change in the GBP: CAD rate would increase/decrease profit after tax and equity by £117k (2016: £117k);
• A +/- 10% change in the GBP: USD rate would increase/decrease profit after tax and equity by £50k (2016: £82k). 
Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis above 
is considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.
Capital management and procedures 
The Group’s capital management objectives are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to realise the full value 
of its assets and to enhance shareholder value in the company and returns to shareholders by acquiring further royalty assets.
The Directors continue to monitor the capital requirements of the Group by reference to expected future cash flows. Capital for the reporting 
periods presented is summarised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
In funding the business activities of the Group, the Directors consider both debt and equity, having regard to the Group’s available debt facility 
and the prevailing share price at the time funding is required. Where funding is obtained through debt, the Group maintains its targeted debt 
capacity of 1.5-2 times free cash flow, although a higher ratio can be tolerated for shorter periods when there is a reasonable expectation of  
a recovery in free cash flow.
Fair value hierarchy
The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet in accordance with the fair value 
hierarchy. This hierarchy aggregates financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of the inputs used in measuring 
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair value 
measurement.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended December 31, 2017 The methods and valuation techniques used for the purposes of measuring fair value of royalty financial instruments gives more prominence 
to the probability of production by applying a risk weighting to the discounted net present value outcome in order to fully reflect the risk that 
the operation never comes into production rather than factoring this risk into the discount rate applied to the future cash flow.
(a) Coal royalties (Investment Property)
The Group’s coal royalties derive from its ownership of certain sub-stratum land in Queensland, Australia. In accordance with IAS 40, this land 
is revalued at each reporting date on the basis of future expected income discounted at 7.5% (2016: 7.5%) by an independent valuation 
consultant. Refer to note 14 for details of the key inputs into the valuation, together with a sensitivity analysis for fluctuations in the price 
assumptions and discount rate. All unobservable inputs are obtained from third parties.
(b) Royalty instruments
At the reporting date, the royalty financial instruments are valued based on the net present value of pre-tax cash flows discounted at a rate 
between 6.5% and 18.0%. The discount rate of each royalty arrangement is derived using a capital asset pricing model specific to the 
underlying project, making reference to the risk free rate of return expected on an investment with the same time horizon as the expected 
mine life, together with the country risk associated with the location of the operation.
For those royalty financial instruments not in production, the outcome of this net present value calculation is then risk weighted to reflect 
management’s current assessment of the overall likelihood and timing of each project coming into production and royalty income arising. 
This assessment is impacted by news flow relating to the underlying operation in the period, in conjunction with management’s assessment 
of the economic viability of the project based on commodity price projections.
The table below outlines the discount rate and risk weighting applied in the valuation of the Group’s royalty financial instruments:
December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
Classification Discount rate Risk weighting Discount rate Risk weighting
EVBC Available-for-sale equity 7.00% 100% 6% 100%
Jogjakarta Available-for-sale debt 10.00% – 8% 100%
Dugbe 1 Available-for-sale debt 18.00% 75% 13% 75%
McClean Lake Available-for-sale debt 6.50% 50% – –
Piauí Available-for-sale debt 12.00% 30% – –
The Group has reviewed the impact on the carrying value of its royalty financial instruments, and does not consider a +/- 1% change in the 
discount rate or a +/- 10% change in the underlying commodity prices to have a material impact.
(c) Mining and exploration interests – quoted
All the quoted mining and exploration interests have been issued by publicly traded companies on well established security markets. Fair 
values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
(d) Mining and exploration interests – unquoted
All the unquoted mining and exploration interests are initially recognised using cost as the best approximation of fair value. The Group notes 
any trading activity in the unquoted instruments and will value its holding accordingly. At present the Group holds these investments with  
a view to generating future royalties and there is no present intention to sell. The vast majority of these are in investments which the Group 
anticipates a realistic possibility of a future listing.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
The derivative financial instruments consist of the foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to hedge the Group’s Australian dollar 
denominated royalty income. At the reporting date the foreign exchange forward contracts are valued based on the net present value of  
the discounted future cash flows estimated based on forward exchange rates and contract forward rates, discounted at rates that reflect  
the credit risk of various counterparties.

The Group measures its entitlement to the royalty income and any optionality embedded within the royalty instruments using discounted 
cash flow models. In determining the discount rate to be applied, management considers the country and sovereign risk associated with  
the projects, together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects of a similar nature.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The structure of a number of the Group’s royalty financing arrangement, such as the Denison transaction completed in February 2017, result 
in a significant amount of cash flow being reported as principal repayments, which are not included in the income statement. As the Group 
considers dividend cover based on the free cash flow generated by its assets, management have determined that free cash flow per share is a 
key performance indicator, going forward.
Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividend net cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from the disposal of non-core assets, 
less finance costs divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.

GROUP OVERVIEW      STRATEGIC REPORT      GOVERNANCE      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      OTHER INFORMATION
O T H E R I N F OR M A T I ON
SHAREHOLDER STATISTICS Performance measures
Throughout the Strategic Report, we use a number  
of financial measures to assess our performance. 
The measures are defined on inside front cover.
Third party information
As a royalty holder, the Group often has limited, if  
any, access to non-public scientific and technical 
information in respect of the properties underlying 
its portfolio of royalties, or such information is 
subject to confidentiality provisions. As such, in 
preparing this Annual Report, the Group has relied 
upon the public disclosures of the owners and 
operators of the properties underlying its portfolio  
of royalties, as available at the date of this Annual 
Report.
References in this Annual Report to websites are 
made as inactive textual references and for 
informational purposes only. Information found  
at the relevant websites is not incorporated by 
reference into this Annual Report. The Group makes 
no representation as to the accuracy of any such 
information.
Cautionary statement on forward-looking 
statements and related information 
Certain statements in this Annual Report, other than 
statements of historical fact, are forward-looking 
statements based on certain assumptions and reflect 
the Group’s expectations and views of future events. 
Forward-looking statements (which include the 
phrase ‘forward-looking information’) are provided 
for the purposes of assisting readers in 
understanding the Group’s financial position and 
results of operations as at and for the periods ended 
on certain dates, and of presenting information 
about management’s current expectations and plans 
relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that 
such forward-looking statements may not be 
appropriate other than for purposes outlined in  
this Annual Report. These statements may include, 
without limitation, statements regarding the 
operations, business, financial condition, expected 
financial results, cash flow, requirement for and terms 
of additional financing, performance, prospects, 
opportunities, priorities, targets, goals, objectives, 
strategies, growth and outlook of the Group 
including the outlook for the markets and economies 
in which the Group operates, costs and timing of 
acquiring new royalties, mineral reserve and 
resources estimates, estimates of future production, 
production costs and revenue, future demand for 
and prices of precious and base metals and other 
commodities, for the current fiscal year and 
subsequent periods.
Forward-looking statements include statements that 
are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to 
future events or conditions, or include words such  
as ‘expects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, 
‘seeks’, ‘intends’, ‘targets’, ‘projects’, ‘forecasts’, or 
negative versions thereof and other similar 
expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as 
‘may’, ‘will’, ‘should’, ‘would’ and ‘could’. Forward-
looking statements are based upon certain material 
factors that were applied in drawing a conclusion or 
making a forecast or projection, including 
assumptions and analyses made by the Group in light 
of its experience and perception of historical trends, 
current conditions and expected future 
developments, as well as other factors that are 
believed to be appropriate in the circumstances. The 
material factors and assumptions upon which such 
forward-looking statements are based include: the 
stability of the global economy; the stability of local 
governments and legislative background; the relative 
stability of interest rates; the equity and debt markets 
continuing to provide access to capital; the 
continuing of ongoing operations of the properties 
underlying the Group’s portfolio of royalties by the 
owners or operators of such properties in a manner 
consistent with past practice; the accuracy of public 
statements and disclosures (including feasibility 
studies, estimates of reserve, resource, production, 
grades, mine life and cash cost) made by the owners 
or operators of such underlying properties; no 
material adverse change in the price of the 
commodities underlying the Group’s portfolio of 
royalties and investments; no material adverse 
change in foreign exchange exposure; no adverse 
development in respect of any significant property in 
which the Group holds a royalty or other interest, 
including but not limited to unusual or unexpected 
geological formations and natural disasters; 
successful completion of new development projects; 
planned expansions or additional projects being 
within the timelines anticipated and at anticipated 
production levels; and maintenance of mining title. 
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of 
future performance and involve risks, uncertainties 
and assumptions, which could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or 
intended in the forward-looking statements.
By its nature, this information is subject to inherent 
risks and uncertainties that may be general or 
specific and which give rise to the possibility that 
expectations, forecasts, predictions, projections or 
conclusions will not prove to be accurate; that 
assumptions may not be correct and that objectives, 
strategic goals and priorities will not be achieved.  
A variety of material factors, many of which are 
beyond the Group’s control, affect the operations, 
performance and results of the Group, its businesses 
and investments, and could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those suggested by any 
forward-looking information. Such risks and 
uncertainties include, but are not limited to current 
global financial conditions, royalty portfolio and 
associated risk, adverse development risk, financial 
viability and operational effectiveness of owners and 
operators of the relevant properties underlying the 
Group’s portfolio of royalties, royalties subject to 
other rights, and contractual terms not being 
honoured, together with those risks identified in the 
‘Principal Risks and Uncertainties’ section herein.  
If any such risks actually occur, they could materially 
adversely affect the Group’s business, financial 
condition or results of operations. Readers are 
cautioned that the list of factors noted in the section 
herein entitled ‘Risk’ is not exhaustive of the factors 
that may affect the Group’s forward-looking 
statements. Readers are also cautioned to consider 
these and other factors, uncertainties and potential 
events carefully and not to put undue reliance on 
forward-looking statements.
This Annual Report also contains forward-looking 
information contained and derived from publicly 
available information regarding properties and 
mining operations owned by third parties. The 
Group’s management relies upon this forward-
looking information in its estimates, projections, 
plans and analysis. Although the forward-looking 
statements contained in this Annual Report are 
based upon what the Group believes are reasonable 
assumptions, there can be no assurance that actual 
results will be consistent with these forward-looking 
statements. The forward-looking statements made 
in this Annual Report relate only to events or 
information as of the date on which the statements 
are made and, except as specifically required by 
applicable laws, listing rules and other regulations, 
the Group undertakes no obligation to update or 
revise publicly any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events 
or otherwise, after the date on which the statements 
are made or to reflect the occurrence of 
unanticipated events.
US Employment Retirement Income 
Security Act
Fiduciaries of (i) US employee benefit plans that are 
subject to Title I of the US Employment Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), (ii) individual 
retirement accounts, Keogh and other plans that are 
subject to Section 4975 of the US Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue 
Code), and (iii) entities whose underlying assets are 
deemed to be ERISA ‘plan assets’ by reason of 
investments made in such entities by such employee 
benefit plans, individual retirement accounts, Keogh 
and other plans (collectively referred to as Benefit 
Plan Investors) should consider whether holding the 
Company’s ordinary shares will constitute a violation 
of their fiduciary obligations under ERISA or a 
prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal 
Revenue Code. Shareholders should be aware that 
the assets of the Company may be or become 
treated as ‘plan assets’ that are subject to ERISA 
fiduciary requirements and/or the prohibited 
transaction rules of ERISA and the Internal Revenue 
Code. The Company’s ordinary shares are subject to 
transfer restrictions and provisions that are intended 
to mitigate the risk of, among other things, the assets 
of the Company being deemed to be ‘plan assets’ 
under ERISA. Shareholders who believe these 
provisions may be applicable to them should review 
these restrictions which are set forth in the 
Company’s Articles of Association and should 
consult their own counsel regarding the potential 
implications of ERISA, the prohibited transaction 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or any 
similar law in the context of an investment in the 
Company and the investment of the Company’s 
assets.
