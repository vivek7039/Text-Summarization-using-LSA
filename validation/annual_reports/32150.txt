03 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STABILITY AND VISIBILITY
STRONG GROWTH IN BILLINGS DRIVES 
DEFERRED REVENUE 
Billings have accelerated in recent years following 
a significant investment in innovation and our 
partner channel. 
Billings are closely aligned with cash flows and are 
an indicator of growth in the business. Subscription 
contracts represent approximately 81 percent of total 
billings and around 75 percent of total billings are 
derived from existing customers.
The average subscription contract duration, consistent 
with prior-year, is close to 28 months, resulting in the 
majority of the contract value being booked to deferred 
revenue to be recognised over the contract’s lifetime. 
This adds to the high levels of visibility into future 
revenues and profits.
NEW BILLINGS AND HARDWARE SALES
Continued strong growth in new billings, +21 percent in 
FY17 and c.40k customers added.
This is principally driven by a strong customer 
proposition, as well as the increasing productivity of our 
30,000 strong partner channel of which 6,100 are now 
“blue chip”.
Hardware sold to existing and new customers generally 
refreshes in line with subscriptions.

05 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We are pleased to report continued growth both in 
market share and company scale, driven by strong 
operating and financial performance. 
Our significant growth in billings and free cash flow 
over the previous financial year was driven by ongoing 
investment in organic and acquired product innovation. 
This growth continues to fuel a strengthening talent 
pool and an extended reach of our selling and 
marketing operations.
Cybersecurity remains a top priority for organisations 
of every size, and our rigorous focus on delivering 
enterprise-grade IT security to mid-market enterprises 
via the channel that serves them differentiates and 
strongly positions Sophos in the enormous and growing 
global IT security market. This past year we have made 
strong progress against our strategic goals in both our 
enduser and network security offerings. We have added 
significant customer value and expanded our market 
opportunity across our product lines through numerous 
product enhancements and additions, including through 
Sophos Central, our rapidly growing born-in-the-cloud 
offering. As we look ahead, we have a robust product 
roadmap, with planned offerings that will incorporate 
next-generation machine learning and artificial 
intelligence technologies, which will further differentiate 
Sophos and strengthen the value we deliver to our 
customers and channel partners. 
We have also strengthened our Board by welcoming 
two highly qualified UK-based global executives as 
independent non-executive directors. 
Vin Murria joined our Board in January and serves on 
our nomination and remuneration committees. Vin 
is a successful entrepreneur with strong operational 
leadership experience in growing UK-based global 
technology businesses and associated shareholder 
value. Rick Medlock joined our Board in April, bringing 
more than thirty years of experience in the financial 
management of large international technology 
companies in the UK and US. Rick also serves on 
our nomination, remuneration and audit and risk 
committees. Rick will be appointed Chairman of the audit 
and risk committee at the next Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). 
Ed Gillis, our current Chairman of the audit and risk 
committee, will be retiring from our Board at the 
upcoming AGM after eight years of service. We thank 
Ed for his very active and impactful leadership and for 
a strong foundation that Rick Medlock will now carry 
forward. 
FY17 has demonstrated the strength of our offerings 
as well as our capacity to execute on our strategy. As 
a result, we feel very encouraged about our ability to 
continue our growth and profitability trends. 
On behalf of our Board, we thank our Sophos employee 
team all around the world for your tireless dedication 
and good work to serve our customers, our partners, 
and our shareholders. We thank our customers and 
partners for your much-valued business and confidence 
in our capabilities throughout our journey together. 
Finally, we say ‘thank you’ to our investors for the trust 
you have placed in Sophos. We appreciate your support, 
and we will continue to work hard to earn your 
continued trust.

THE DEMAND FOR SECURITY SOLUTIONS CONTINUES TO 
GROW. THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE WORLD AND ACROSS 
ORGANISATIONS OF ALL SIZES. INDUSTRY ANALYSTS PREDICT 
THAT THE GLOBAL IT SECURITY MARKET1 WILL BE IN EXCESS OF 
$39B IN 2017, REACHING AN ESTIMATED $48B BY 2020... 
THREAT LANDSCAPE
The 2016 threat landscape was dominated by two 
themes: state-sponsored hacking and cyberwarfare at 
the global level; and the specific threats of ransomware 
and phishing at the local business level.
These themes demonstrated the challenges that face 
all businesses worldwide – attacks can be targeted, 
sustained and highly sophisticated, and they can be 
opportunistic and random. Cybercrime has reached an 
industrial scale and continues to be lucrative.
While the headlines were consumed with high profile 
hacking, customers and partners across the world 
highlighted ransomware and phishing threats as the 
biggest challenge to maintaining security. An increasing 
amount of ransomware intercepted by SophosLabs was 
now seen to be targeting mobile devices, 
especially Android. 
Finding vulnerabilities and exploits on new platforms 
and devices continued. This year the security research 
communities concerns about inherent insecurity in 
internet of things (“IoT”) devices became reality after 
the Mirai assault against one of several companies 
hosting the Domain Name System (“DNS”). That 
denial of service attack affected some of the highest 
profile media, social media and commercial payment 
platforms, in turn impacting millions of users worldwide.
While these new vectors of attack were exploited, 
high profile brands disclosed data breaches dating 
back to 2013, demonstrating how challenging it is to 
identify and investigate breaches at even the most 
sophisticated technology-based companies. Indeed, we 
also heard reports of an alleged auction of hacking tools 
stolen from the US National Security Agency. The year 
ended with allegations of nation-state involvement in 
the leak of emails during the US election, serving as 
a reminder to all that the threat from highly 
sophisticated, well-coordinated and well-funded 
attackers is a new normal.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
The current geo-political landscape in Europe and 
the US will have an ongoing effect on regulations 
and government legislation related to privacy, data 
protection and cyber-security. As the UK moves towards 
Brexit, we anticipate clarification on the regulations 
affecting UK businesses and expect them to remain 
largely in line with the current legislation, as much of the 
EU proposals are built on UK requirements.
There is currently a heightened focus on cybersecurity 
and nation-sate sponsored activity in the US and 
increased collaboration is anticipated between private 
industry and government agencies in the protection of 
US citizens’ data and privacy.
The Investigatory Powers Act that was ratified by the 
UK government in December 2016 continues to remain 
under scrutiny and was most recently declared unlawful 
by the European Court of Justice. 
The EU Data Protection regulation (“GDPR”) will take 
effect at the end of 2017 and companies holding data 
on citizens within the EU will accelerate their readiness 
for it. It has numerous components, but one key 
takeaway is that European businesses will now be held 
responsible for the protection of the data they process, 
including cloud providers and other third parties. 
Indeed, regulatory pressures are here to stay and 
companies must continue to invest resources to 
ensure compliance.

SOPHOS PRINCIPALLY OPERATES AS A SUBSCRIPTION-
BASED SOFTWARE BUSINESS, WITH A DIFFERENTIATED AND 
COMPELLING APPROACH TO ITS CHOSEN MARKET
BUSINESS MODEL
12 Sophos is one of the world’s leading 
providers of cloud-enabled enduser and 
network security solutions, providing 
customers with end-to-end protection 
against known and unknown IT security 
threats, through products that are easy to 
install, configure, update and maintain.
The Group’s products and services 
are suitable for businesses of any size 
seeking enterprise-grade security 
combined with ease of use.
Through Sophos Central, a single 
integrated cloud-based management 
platform, customers are able to manage 
all their security needs from within a 
unified view.
Enduser and network security solutions 
are sold primarily on a subscription basis, 
via a ‘channel first’ sales model supported 
by over 30,000 partners worldwide.
The Group’s scale is a significant 
advantage, with over 100 million 
endpoints protected and more than 
260,000 customers around the globe. 
The Group’s security solutions are 
underpinned by SophosLabs, a world-
leading 24/7 threat intelligence operation, 
employing over 150 people across 
four continents.
On average, subscription contracts 
are typically three-year commitments, 
paid for upfront by the customer, which 
provides ongoing updates over the course 
of the subscription, based on the evolving 
threat landscape.
This software-as-a-service model 
consequently provides significant 
visibility over future revenues and cash 
flows, founded upon a substantial and 
growing renewal book and industry-
leading renewal rates, boosted by cross-
sell and upsell opportunities.
The new business signed today feeds 
the future renewal base.  In addition to 
growing the customer base worldwide, a 
key element of the Group’s strategy is to 
increase the product footprint within the 
existing customer base. This is seen as a 
significant opportunity, with just 9.6% of 
customers using both endpoint and UTM 
products today.
The strength and visibility inherent in the 
subscription-based financial model is 
delivering significant value 
to shareholders.
Sophos offers a highly differentiated array 
of industry-leading IT security solutions. 
The Group is the only security software 
vendor of scale with a strong presence in 
both enduser and network security. This is 
the foundation for the Group’s pioneering 
synchronized security strategy, where the 
products share contextual information 
and thus enhance the protection available 
to its customers.
Sophos is a leader in next-generation 
endpoint security, with more than half a 
million endpoints protected by signature-
less anti-exploit technology. The strongly 
differentiated products and strategy 
are enabling Sophos to deliver growth 
substantially ahead of the market in both 
enduser and network security.
Focused investment in innovation, 
bolstered by selected technology 
acquisitions, supports customers and 
partners over the long-term, confirming 
the Group’s commitment to deliver 
industry-leading, trusted, enterprise-
grade IT security solutions.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13 FOCUS ON STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
SOPHOS CONTINUES TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION AS 
A LEADING VENDOR OF INNOVATIVE, SIMPLE AND HIGHLY 
EFFECTIVE IT SECURITY
STRATEGIC GOALS
Focus on 
IT security 
solutions
Sophos will continue to prioritise its investment in technology and in consolidating 
its leadership position as the only security vendor with a balanced business spanning 
both enduser and network security. As the Group is committed to IT security, it 
believes it has an advantage over competitors who often seek to address disparate 
and unrelated areas of technology.
Sophos is committed to its highly successful channel-only sales strategy. The 
Group has grown its partner ecosystem to more than 30,000 partners during the 
course of FY17, and is seeing considerable success in helping partners to cross-
sell and upsell to existing end users and 6,100 of the partners are now blue-chip 
partners, demonstrating higher levels of productivity. The Group is also helping a 
growing number of partners as they develop Managed Service Provider (“MSP”) 
businesses built around the Sophos product portfolio.
‘Channel first’ 
sales strategy
The Group’s customers derive significant benefits from Sophos Central, the single, 
integrated cloud-based management and reporting platform. Cloud technology 
underpins the channel strategy and it continues to enhance Sophos’ partner-centric 
management console, enabling partners to easily manage, update and configure the 
Group’s products, and to drive cross-sell and upsell opportunities from within the 
Sophos IT security portfolio.
The cloud is 
at the core of 
the Group’s 
strategy
The Group’s industry-leading technologies are amongst the most innovative, 
advanced and effective available in the market, but are simple and easy to deploy, 
manage and use. Sophos believes that simple, integrated solutions deliver better 
security that is easier to manage for organisations of any size and particularly those in 
its chosen markets.
Innovative, 
simple, 
effective 
security
The Sophos cybersecurity portfolio is comprehensive and spans endpoint, mobile, 
server, encryption, web, email, Wi-Fi and UTM/Next-gen firewall. Sophos continues 
to make progress on its multi-year strategy to integrate these different products and 
enable a synchronized security approach for its customers. Synchronized security 
delivers added protection for customers and eliminates manual tasks.

14 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
To measure performance against the Group’s strategy, a number of Key Performance Indicators 
(“KPIs”) are utilised; further explanation of which, including reconciliations to GAAP numbers, is 
included in Note 6 of the financial statements and in the glossary. A description of these KPIs and 
performance against them during the period is set out below:
Continued strong growth in all regions and 
products with a particularly strong YOY Q4 
performance.  See page 29 for a detailed 
review of billings.
Subscription billings driving revenue growth 
into double-digits and trending towards 
billings growth rates.  See page 30 for a 
detailed review of revenue.
Sustained momentum of billings growth 
coupled with leveraging of the existing cost 
base resulted in an increase in cash EBITDA 
and margin (cash EBITDA as a percentage 
of billings).
Revenue reflects the element of billings 
recognised in the period including from 
companies acquired from the date of their 
acquisition. The majority of billings are for 
subscription contracts that are recognised 
rateably over the contract term.
Billings represents the value of products 
and services invoiced to customers. Cash is 
received at the start of a subscription period 
and consequently billings become a key forward 
indicator of future performance.
Cash EBITDA provides visibility of cash earnings 
during the period, even if the associated revenue 
for that period’s billings has not yet been 
recognised.
Strong performance above the Board’s 
expectations, driven by growth in billings and 
close control of working capital.
Unlevered free cash flow represents the 
amount of cash generated by operations 
after allowing for capital expenditure, 
taxation and working capital movements.
As the Group has demonstrated the benefits 
of cross-ownership of its products, the 
level of cross-sell has continued to steadily 
increase through the year. 
The continued growth of the business partially 
depends on successfully selling additional 
products and services to existing customers.  
Customers can derive greater value by owning 
multiple products from the Group as they 
benefit from synergies in management, 
support and functionality.
Small increase due to material contract 
previously announced in Q1.  The 
comparative has been restated as it is now 
measured on a total Group basis.
The weighted average contract length, measured 
over the prior twelve month period, gives the 
Group an indication of the period over which future 
revenue will be recognised.
The Group has continued to leverage its 
product portfolio, leading to a continued 
improvement in the renewal rate. 
Renewal rate (including upsell and cross-sell) 
is a measure of long-term value of end user 
agreements and the Group’s ability to retain 
end users.

PERFORMANCE
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
FY17 WAS ANOTHER STRONG YEAR 
FOR SOPHOS, IN WHICH WE MADE 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AGAINST 
OUR STRATEGIC GOALS, AND 
DELIVERED OPERATIONAL AND 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ABOVE 
OUR EXPECTATIONS
OVERVIEW
Among the many highlights, the Group saw an 18.2 
percent increase in total reported billings to $632.1 
million, underpinned by 21.4 percent subscription 
billings growth to $513.1 million, as we again delivered 
growth in excess of the market in both network and 
enduser security. Encouragingly, the strong momentum 
at the heart of this performance was manifest across all 
major regions and products, and in both new business 
and renewals, and accelerated in the second half of 
the year. Sophos Central remained a core driver of 
our business, delivering growth of 220 percent and 
an expanding opportunity for cross-sell and upsell 
momentum. Our cash generation was very strong, 
with unlevered free cash flow almost tripling to $133.4 
million, from $46.4 million in the prior-year.
STRATEGIC PROGRESS
Sophos made significant progress in FY17, consolidating 
its position as the leading vendor of innovative, simple, 
and highly effective cybersecurity solutions for mid-
market enterprises. A number of factors have helped to 
deliver this success which will continue to drive Sophos 
forward in the years ahead, including:
 » World-class products and innovation that provide 
leading enterprise-grade protection validated by 
numerous third parties, that at the same time are 
easy to deploy, use, and manage
 » Cloud-enabled security solutions that include 
a single, integrated cloud-based management 
console and cloud delivery of multiple security 
capabilities

A FAST-GROWING CHANNEL 
AND CUSTOMER BASE
The number of Sophos partners grew to more than 
30,000, up from 20,000 a year ago, and the number of 
‘blue-chip’ partners rose from 4,700 to 6,100. In FY17 
we added more than 40,000 new customers, with more 
than 260,000 organisations now using one or more 
Sophos IT security products. With more than 60 million 
small and mid-market enterprises around the world who 
could benefit from Sophos’ industry-leading security 
portfolio, integrated and managed through a single, 
easy-to-use cloud-based platform, and sold entirely 
through the channel, our opportunity to continue to 
grow our market share remains significant.
SOPHOS CENTRAL
A robust, comprehensive commitment to the cloud has 
provided Sophos with a growing competitive advantage. 
Sophos Central is a single, integrated cloud-based 
management and reporting platform that has become a 
meaningful driver of the Group’s software subscriptions. 
Sophos Central represents 17.1 percent of subscription 
billings, having grown by 220 percent in the period. 
Leveraging the power of the cloud also allows us to 
deliver compelling cross-sell and upsell opportunities 
for partners, and many are now building additional 
services businesses around the Sophos partner portal, 
which enables them to manage, update and configure 
their customers’ solutions remotely.
The Group expanded and enhanced Sophos Central 
throughout the year, with new endpoint, server and 
mobile security solutions, as well as additional partner 
and managed service provider (MSP) features. In 
addition, Sophos made a number of applications 
available on the platform for the first time, including 
email, encryption, wireless, and web security. 
September 2016 saw the launch of Intercept X, 
an exciting next-generation endpoint protection 
application, featuring signature-less anti-exploit, 
anti-ransomware and root cause analytics capabilities. 
Intercept X has resonated extremely well with partners 
16 and customers. In just two quarters since its launch, 
more than 8,000 customers have purchased Intercept X 
on the Sophos Central cloud-management platform.
WORLD-CLASS PRODUCTS AND INNOVATION
A commitment to industry-leading innovation, focused 
on our target customer, combined with a strong 
demand backdrop and an increasingly powerful channel 
ecosystem enabled Sophos to continue to gain market 
share, outpacing market growth rates in both enduser 
and network security.
In addition to the launch of Intercept X, there was an 
enthusiastic response to the newest release of the 
Sophos XG Firewall, helping the Group achieve 17.8 
percent growth in network security billings for the 
year, at constant currency. With version 16.0 launched 
in October 2016, customers are benefiting from over 
100 new features and significant enhancements to 
the user experience, particularly navigation, policy 
management and logging, as well as additional 
synchronized security features linking the XG firewall 
with endpoint, encryption, mobile, and other security 
offerings. Sophos is already a leader in the emerging 
cloud-based infrastructure market for security, a 
growing opportunity as enterprises adopt infrastructure 
as a service via the cloud. XG Firewall version 16.0 
introduced support for the Microsoft Azure cloud 
platform in addition to the existing support for Amazon 
Web Services.
ACQUISITIONS
In February 2017 Sophos announced the acquisition of 
Invincea, Inc., a leading developer of advanced next-
generation malware protection, consistently ranked 
as among the best performing signature-less, next-
generation endpoint technologies in third-party testing, 
rated highly both for high detection and low false-
positive rates. The Invincea endpoint security portfolio 
prevents, detects, and remediates zero-day and 
sophisticated attacks, and combines neural-network 
based machine learning and behavioural monitoring to 
enhance detection through artificial intelligence and 
stop evasive malware before damage occurs.
Invincea complements and enhances Sophos’ existing 
presence in next-generation endpoint protection, a 
dynamic new segment that is serving to increase 
meaningfully the size and growth rate of the multi-
billion dollar endpoint security market as a whole. 
Invincea’s advanced machine learning technology is a 
critical element in the broad array of advanced endpoint 
technology components that customers will require 
in order to protect themselves effectively against the 
growing number and sophistication of cyber threats 
that face organisations of all sizes. The integration 
of the Invincea technology into the Sophos Central 
endpoint product line is progressing well, with the first 
Sophos products incorporating Invincea’s machine 
learning technology expected to be available and sold 
via our global channel of over 30,000 partners in 2017, 
bringing immediate value to customers.
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 DEEPENING THE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH OUR CUSTOMERS
We further increased the amount of cross-sell and upsell 
business with existing customers, a key element of the 
Group’s growth strategy. Our net renewal rate achieved 
on our subscription business was over 106 percent in the 
year, including cross-sell and upsell, versus 102 percent 
a year ago. Furthermore, the proportion of customers 
purchasing both the Sophos endpoint and unified threat 
management (UTM) products was just under 10 percent 
at the end of the period, up from 7 percent a year ago. The 
continued improvement in these areas demonstrates 
the Group’s success in leveraging its product portfolio 
and the benefits that both partners and customers are 
gaining from an integrated, synchronised approach 
to IT security.
INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP
During the year, leading industry analysts including 
Gartner and Forrester once again endorsed Sophos as a 
leader for products in both enduser and network security. 
In addition, Sophos won numerous channel awards, 
including 2016 Endpoint Security Innovation winner (CRN 
US), 2016 Data Security winner (CRN US), 2016 Network 
Security winner (CRN US), 2016 Security Vendor of the 
Year (CRN UK), and 2016 Channel Excellence Award 
winner - Security Hardware (Channel Partner DACH). 
Furthermore, in February 2017, five senior Sophos 
executives were named in CRN’s prestigious list of 2017 
Channel Chiefs, which represents top leaders in the IT 
channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their 
organisations through channel partners.
While we are pleased with the scale, growth, and 
momentum we have established, we firmly believe 
we are just getting started. Security continues to be a 
mission-critical, board-level priority for organisations 
of every size that only rises in importance with each 
passing year. Delivering true enterprise-grade protection 
to mid-market enterprises, in a way that is integrated 
and simple to deploy and manage, all sold through the 
channel, provides Sophos with a substantial market 
opportunity. Our company mission is to be the best in the 
world at delivering innovative, simple, and highly-effective 
cybersecurity solutions to IT professionals and the channel 
that serves them. We believe we are uniquely positioned 
to successfully execute against that mission, and as we 
do so, our opportunities to continue to grow and succeed, 
both operationally and financially, are dramatic. 
 
Sophos’ success is only possible through the 
commitment and hard work of our global team of 
employees and partners, and I would like to extend my 
personal thanks to them for all they do to support and 
protect hundreds of thousands of organisations around 
the world each day.

ADVANTAGE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
18 Q&A WITH MEMBERS OF THE 
SOPHOS SENIOR MANAGEMENT 
TEAM
MICHAEL VALENTINE 
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, 
WORLDWIDE SALES
Q.
 When you talk to customers, 
what are their most pressing 
issues? 
A.
It really is the need to reduce 
complexity. These companies 
often have limited IT staff and rarely 
a security expert. They struggle to 
manage multiple security products 
and are even more challenged to 
respond to the daily alerts and 
notifications they receive. They want 
simplicity and flexibility. They want 
a seamless experience between 
reseller and vendor. They do not 
have the expertise to run lengthy IT 
procurement projects and rely on 
their IT resellers to make the right 
choices for them. 
 
For our partners, their concerns are 
twofold: what business model do I 
adopt; and, how do I hire and retain 
the right calibre of sales and sales 
engineering staff? The opportunities 
offered by MSP and IaaS models are 
appealing as more customers move 
to AWS or Azure. However, can every 
product reseller make the move to 
value added or managed services? 
It’s a difficult question to answer. 
The demand for cybersecurity skills 
far outstrips the supply and we are 
focused on helping our partners to 
train and retain staff within their 
companies. Nothing motivates 
a sales person like hitting their 
targets and we believe that Sophos 
can offer the best products on the 
market and make business easy to 
close. Everyone wants to be on the 
winning team and that’s what we 
drive towards every day.
Q.
 Can you tell me about the 
importance of the Sophos 
partner ecosystem?
A.
Without a strong partner 
ecosystem, we would have no 
business. As a 100 percent channel-
focused company, it is our ability 
to educate, enable and incentivise 
our channel partners that drives 
our growth and enables us to more 
quickly enter new markets and scale 
up our business.  
 
We are addressing a huge market 
opportunity that relies on its trusted 
IT resellers for advice, services and 
products to protect their critical 
data. Mid-market companies also 
rely heavily on their resellers for 
local support, so we can offer 
three different levels of support 
without additional investment. Our 
customers trust us to develop highly 
effective products that will protect 
them against today’s sophisticated 
threats and we rely on our partners 
to deliver the right advice, training 
and services to them.
 Q .
 What is the biggest challenge 
facing Sophos?
A.
There are more than 60 million 
businesses in the sweet spot 
of our target market and gaining 
brand recognition within a vast 
market is challenging. We compete 
against big established names and 
small challenger companies in both 
endpoint and network security 
markets. We have made huge 
progress over the last five years but 
we still have work to do in continuing 
to make our brand stand out in this 
huge market. 
 
We are differentiated against the 
competition and gaining traction 
with our unique synchronized 
security vision, which is supported 
by our comprehensive network and

TEAM
endpoint security portfolio. However, 
much like the rest of the industry, 
our security-focused partners have 
specialisms in network or endpoint 
security and we need to continue to 
educate them on both sides of our 
portfolio. We are investing heavily 
in partner enablement, education 
and training to make sure that our 
partners are taking advantage of the 
opportunity offered by Sophos; both 
in terms of more business and with 
better security for their customers.
JOE LEVY 
CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER
Q.
 How should customers 
prioritise what they are doing?
A.
Know thyself. All endeavours 
to enhancing security must 
start here. Our information systems 
used to relate to physical things, 
applications and operating systems 
running directly on clients and 
servers that we could see, touch, 
and count, but they become 
more intangible, and abstract 
every day. Cloud, virtualisation, 
mobile, containers, micro 
services and APIs have enabled 
unimaginable advancements 
in automation, manufacturing, 
business intelligence, collaboration, 
personalisation, and prediction, 
but these come at the costs of 
complexity and opaqueness.  
 
In order to protect the 
confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of our assets, among the 
most valuable of which is our data, 
we must know that they exist, where 
they exist, and what they are worth. 
For any security effort to succeed, 
it must begin here. Only then can 
practicable risk management 
strategies be developed and applied.
Q.
 Are attitudes towards security 
changing among your 
customers? 
A.
It is difficult to ignore 
the headlines related to 
information security incidents. 
Whether it is the latest data breach, 
the rise of ransomware, reminders 
to the fragility of our critical 
infrastructure or allegations of 
tampering with democracy, hardly 
a day goes by without coverage 
of some unfortunate exploitation 
of weaknesses in our information 
systems. 
 
But every cloud has a silver lining, 
and a positive consequence of 
these events is a heightened 
awareness of the threat. Businesses 
of all sectors and sizes, institutions 
of learning, corporate boards, 
the insurance industry and 
governments are increasingly 
treating information security 
seriously and saliently. Attitudes 
toward information security are 
shifting from an afterthought that is 
taxing or punitive, to a forethought 
that is among any project’s core 
requirements. We are slowly getting 
better at understanding risk in 
the abstract. It’s an encouraging 
maturation, but we must not allow 
ourselves to become inured to the 
stream of reminders. We must 
be unrelenting in our pursuit of 
adaptation and improvement.
Q.
 What does innovation mean 
to you?
A.
Innovation at its core describes 
improvement through novelty, 
and in the context of information 
security its key attribute is 
continuous adaptation. Security is 
a property of system, so to innovate 
in information security requires not 
just continuous improvements in 
technology, but also in how people 
interact with that technology, and 
how it interfaces with the rest of our 
increasingly interconnected world. 
Advancements in computing and 
data science have given us a world 
where everything is a computer, 
everything is connected, and 
machines operate autonomously.  
 
Our day-to-day lives increasingly 
benefit from and depend on this 
new reality and with such leverage 
comes high-stake risk. Attackers 
exploit flaws in software, fragility 
in complex systems, human 
susceptibility to social engineering, 
and the shroud of anonymity 
provided by the internet and 
crypto-currencies. Innovation 
in information security seeks to 
anticipate and stay one step ahead 
of this and it should be measured by 
its usability, durability, adaptability 
and utility in preventing, detecting 
and responding to today’s and 
tomorrow’s threats.
Q & A WITH MANAGEMENT TEAM CONTINUED
20 DAN SCHIAPPA  
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT 
& GENERAL MANAGER, 
ENDUSER SECURITY & 
NETWORK SECURITY 
GROUPS
Q. 
Can a company be truly 
secure?
A. 
A company can be secure, but 
it will never be impervious. 
There has never been a security 
technology that is perfect, but by 
having a broad and interconnected 
ensemble of capabilities, a company 
can raise the bar high enough that 
the attacks return on investment 
isn’t worthwhile.
Q.
 What is the biggest opportunity 
for Sophos?
A. 
Our biggest opportunity is 
to take a highly innovative 
security portfolio and make it 
simple enough for any business to 
deploy and secure their business. 
Leveraging our portfolio through 
the synchronized security approach 
to differentiate the reason to use 
multiple Sophos products. By 
continuously innovating, staying on 
the front foot to compete against 
the attackers.
Q. 
How would you summarise the 
Sophos business strategy?
A. 
Deliver innovative, easy to use, 
and highly effective security 
solutions to enterprises of all sizes. 
Have end-to-end experiences that 
just work and delight our customers. 
Sell this to customers who value 
innovation, simplicity and highly 
effective security.
SIMON REED 
VICE PRESIDENT, 
SOPHOSLABS
Q. 
 What does Sophos mean by 
security?
A. 
Computers now dominate our 
lives. It is part of everything 
we do, at work and in our personal 
lives. We’ve grown dependent on 
technology. Like any tool, it can be 
used to benefit our lives, or be used 
against us for nefarious purposes. 
Security allows us to have the full 
benefits that computers can provide 
whilst keeping the evil aspects at bay.
Q.
 What is the best way to stay 
ahead of security concerns and 
threats?
A. 
Be a smart consumer of the 
benefit of the IT-ization of 
our lives. Understand the basics of 
staying secure: strong passwords; 
prodigious patching; etc. Consider 
the downsides as well as the 
advantages that can be provided 
and make a balanced decision. Stay 
careful and cautious online and 
when interacting with email and 
websites. If it sounds too good to be 
true, treat with extreme caution.

The key metrics of billings, cash EBITDA and cash flow were all strong in the year. The Group expected cash flow to 
show very strong growth in the year, yet the Directors were particularly encouraged that unlevered free cash flow 
almost trebled to $133.4 million.

Reported billings grew by 18.2 percent to $632.1 million, while billings in constant currency grew at 19.9 percent to 
$648.7 million, revenue grew 12.3 percent on the same basis to $542.1 million, within which subscription revenue 
grew 14.4 percent to $420.4 million. 
 
Adjusted operating profit and operating loss were both impacted by the fact that the majority of billings are 
subscription contracts where the revenue is deferred to future periods; however, the level of spending is driven by 
billings growth and is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. Accordingly, a strong billings performance 
is very positive for the long-term health of the business and cash generation yet the full benefit to the profit and loss 
account is in future periods. Deferred revenues increased by $82.3 million in the period further underpinning the 
confidence in future revenue growth. The Group finished the year with $581.0 million (FY16: $498.7 million) of deferred 
revenue, $330.6 million (FY16: $286.5 million) of which is due for release in the year ahead.

Subscription agreements comprised 81 percent of the 
Group’s billings in FY17, an increase from 79 percent in 
the prior-year. Subscription agreements are paid in full 
upfront with revenue being recognised on a deferred 
basis over the life of the agreements, which mainly 
range from one to three years in duration, resulting in 
a highly visible and predictable future revenue stream. 
BILLINGS BY REGION 
AMERICAS
Billings attributable to the Americas increased by $29.7 
million to $217.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 
2017, representing 15.8 percent growth on a reported 
basis and 15.9 percent on a constant currency basis. 
Network products and sustained adoption of the 
Sophos Central platform, including strong sales of new 
next-generation endpoint products drove the year-on-
year growth. 
EMEA
Billings attributable to EMEA increased by $55.5 
million to $319.5 million in the year-ended 31 March 
2017, representing 21.0 percent growth on a reported 
basis and 25.6 percent growth on a constant currency 
basis, reflecting the impact of the strengthening US 
Dollar against both Sterling and Euro. Enduser growth 
in the region was particularly strong, supported by a 
substantial increase in the adoption of the Sophos 
Central platform and the contribution from a material 
contract with an existing customer in the UK in the first 
quarter of the year.
APJ
Billings attributable to APJ increased by $12.0 million 
to $95.0 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017, 
representing 14.5 percent growth on a reported basis 
and 11.0 percent growth on a constant currency basis. 
Growth in the region was driven by Enduser billings; 
Network billings in the prior-year were assisted by a 
very strong performance in Japan leading to a tough 
comparative. 
BILLINGS BY PRODUCT 
NETWORK PRODUCTS
The Group’s billings attributable to Network products 
increased by $44.8 million to $311.5 million in the 
year-ended 31 March 2017, representing 16.8 percent 
growth on a reported basis and 17.8 percent growth on 
a constant currency basis, despite a strong prior-year 
comparative from larger deals in Japan. This growth 
was balanced across UTM, Email and Web products.
ENDUSER PRODUCTS
The Group’s billings attributable to Enduser products 
increased by $51.5 million to $289.7 million in the year-
ended 31 March 2017 , representing 21.6 percent growth 
on a reported basis and 24.4 percent growth at constant 
currency. Sophos Central, incorporating the new next-
generation endpoint product, Intercept X, was a key driver 
for Enduser billings growth. Growth was also assisted by 
the contribution from a material contract during the first 
quarter of the year with an existing customer in the UK. 
INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 29 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
BILLINGS BY TYPE
Subscription billings increased by $90.3 million to 
$513.1 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017, 
representing 21.4 percent growth on a reported basis 
and 23.3 percent growth on a constant currency 
basis. Encouragingly, Sophos Central billings were 
$87.7 million in the year, increasing from $27.4 million 
in the prior period and now represent 17.1 percent of 
subscription billings up from 6.5 percent in the prior 
period. Hardware billings increased by 6.8 percent on 
a reported basis, 7.6 percent growth on a constant 
currency basis, to $105.7 million primarily due to a 
tough comparative from the strong hardware sales in 
Japan. The share of subscription billings of total billings 
increased marginally in the year as Sophos Central 
continued to gain momentum. 
KEY BILLINGS METRICS
BILLINGS FROM NEW CUSTOMERS
Billings, at constant currency and excluding 
acquisitions, from new customers remained consistent 
at 25 percent of total billings and grew 21.3 percent year 
over year.
RETENTION RATES
The Group’s results are substantially driven by billings 
generated from subscriptions for its products and 
services. The Group’s net retention rates include the 
impact of cross-selling and upselling, which helps the 
Group evaluate its success in fully leveraging its broad 
product portfolio throughout its installed customer 
base. The Group’s net retention rate, excluding 
acquisitions, for the year-ended 31 March 2017 
improved to 106.3 percent from 101.9 percent in the 
year-ended 31 March 2016. 
BILLINGS BY SIZE
Sophos’ products are designed for the Group’s target 
market, mid-market enterprises, typically with less than 
5,000 employees. In FY17 the proportion of billings to 
the Group’s customers with less than 5,000 employees 
increased marginally YOY to 83 percent.
BILLINGS BY LENGTH OF CONTRACT
Subscription agreements sold by the Group are of 
differing durations, most typically being one to three 
years in length. The weighted average contract length 
for the year-ended 31 March 2017 was 28.1 months, a 
small increase on the 27.8 months 
1 
for the year-ended 
31 March 2016, mainly due to the material contract with 
an existing customer in the first quarter.

CROSS-SELL AND UPSELL OPPORTUNITIES
The Group continued to demonstrate to its existing 
customers the benefits of cross-ownership. A measure 
of this success is the percentage of all customers who 
own both a Sophos Endpoint and UTM product (being 
the primary products of the Enduser and Network 
families, respectively). The Group expects this metric to 
steadily improve as customers take advantage of the 
benefits of synchronized security. At 31 March 2017, 
approximately 9.6 percent of customers had both a 
UTM product and an Endpoint product compared to 7.4 
percent of customers at 31 March 2016.
REVENUE
The Group’s revenue increased by $51.5 million, or 
10.8 percent, to $529.7 million in the year-ended 31 
March 2017. Revenue at reported rates was impacted 
throughout the year by currency headwinds, most 
notable a weakening against the US Dollar of Sterling 
and the Euro. Accordingly, revenue growth for the 
year on a constant currency basis was higher at 12.3 
percent, following an increasing trend through the year 
which generated Q4 constant currency revenue growth 
of 14.7 percent.
The majority of the Group’s billings relate to 
subscriptions (FY17: 81.2 percent; FY16: 79.0 percent), 
and hence the benefit from increased billings is spread 
over a number of years based on the subsequent 
recognition of deferred revenue. Revenue of $529.7 
million comprised $277.8 million (FY16: $251.4 million) 
from recognition of prior-year deferred revenues and 
$251.9 million (FY16: $226.8 million) from new billings. 
The deferred revenue balance at the end of the year of 
$581.0 million increased $82.3 million from the end 
of the prior year, an increase of 16.5 percent despite a 
negative translation impact of $24.2 million resulting 
from the devaluation of Sterling against the US Dollar. 
Revenue in the Americas increased by 12.5 percent to 
$186.9 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017 due to 
growth in both Network and Enduser sales.

EMEA revenue increased by 9.9 percent to 
$263.1 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017, 
primarily due to growth in UTM billings as much of the 
benefit of increased subscription billings is deferred into 
future periods. 
APJ revenue increased by 9.8 percent to $79.7 million 
in the year-ended 31 March 2017, predominantly due to 
strong growth in Enduser billings, with lower Network 
growth due to a tough compare in Japan.
COST OF SALES
The Group’s cost of sales increased by $16.9 million to 
$121.3 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017. This 
was primarily due to the continued growth of Network 
product billings, many of which have a hardware 
component, the growth in Sophos Central products 
which are hosted by the Group and higher costs in 
the support function which are increasing, albeit at a 
rate lower than billings thereby delivering operational 
leverage.
SALES AND MARKETING
The Group’s sales and marketing expenses increased 
by $26.6 million or 14.5 percent, to $210.6 million in 
the year-ended 31 March 2017. Sales and marketing 
investments are targeted to drive billings growth.
The Group achieved a growth rate in sales and 
marketing costs that was below the rate of growth in 
billings, contributing to the anticipated leverage as the 
business scales, which is expected to continue. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The Group’s research and development expenses 
increased by $18.2 million, or 18.3 percent, to $117.8 
million in the year-ended 31 March 2017. This reflects 
the significant investment made in new and enhanced 
products released in the period and an ongoing focus 
on product development. Research and development 
investments are broadly targeted to grow at the rate 
of billings. 
GENERAL FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION
The Group’s general finance and administration 
expenses, excluding exceptional items, foreign 
exchange and the amortisation of intangible assets, 
increased by $19.8 million, or 38.1 percent, to $71.8 
million in the year-ended 31 March 2017. The increase 
was substantially due to the share-based payment 
expense, which increased by $16.2 million to $32.5 
million representing the first full-year charge following 
the issue of new equity awards at the time of the 
Initial Public Offering of the Company’s shares in 
the prior-year.

INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Underlying general finance and administration expenses 
have increased by 10.1 percent YOY and have decreased 
as a proportion of billings as the Group continued to 
leverage its strong back office function.
The Group’s exceptional items, included within general 
finance and administration expenses, decreased by 
$10.5 million to $31.4 million in the year-ended 31 
March 2017. Current-year exceptional items relate 
predominantly to expenses incurred connected with 
the defence of certain claims brought against the Group 
in relation to the previously announced intellectual 
property litigation case brought by Finjan Inc., including 
both the costs of an omnibus agreement entered into 
with Finjan Inc. on 30 March 2017 resolving all the 
parties’ disputes and associated legal costs. It also 
includes acquisition costs incurred in relation to material 
acquisitions in the year. Prior-year exceptional items 
included $17.8 million incurred during the Initial Public 
Offering of the Company’s shares, as well as acquisition 
costs and expenses incurred in relation to the defence 
or settlement of claims brought against a number of the 
Group’s employees by their former employer and certain 
intellectual property litigation cases.
AMORTISATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Group’s amortisation of intangible assets 
decreased by $9.3 million, or 31.8 percent, to $19.9 
million in the year-ended 31 March 2017. The decrease 
was due to the Group’s policy of amortising acquired 
intangibles on a reducing balance basis. In the current 
year, the Group’s largest acquisition, Invincea, Inc. was 
completed at the very end of the year, therefore limiting 
amortisation in the period.
CURRENCY MOVEMENTS AND IMPACT
The Group’s foreign exchange loss was $1.2 million in 
the year-ended 31 March 2017, compared with a gain of 
$0.2 million in the year-ended 31 March 2016. The loss 
arises as a result of the weakening of Sterling and the 
Euro against the US Dollar in the year, an impact which 
is mostly mitigated by the Group’s largely naturally-
hedged position. 
CASH EBITDA 
The reconciliation of cash EBITDA to operating loss is 
included in note 6 of the Financial Statements.
On a reported basis, cash EBITDA increased by 24.2 
percent to $150.1 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017 . 
The Cash EBITDA margin increased YOY to 23.7 percent 
from 22.6 percent in the prior year mainly as the Group 
leveraged sales, marketing and back office investments.
ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT
Adjusted operating profit provides a supplemental 
measure of earnings that facilitates review of operating 
performance on a period-to-period basis by excluding 
non-recurring and other items that are not indicative 
of the Group’s underlying operating performance. The 
Directors have chosen to disclose this alternative 
performance measure in order to not only allow a focus 
on underlying operating performance but also to aid 
comparability with other companies that disclose the 
same measure. The reconciliation of adjusted operating 
loss to operating loss is included in note 6 of the 
Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit decreased by $15.1 million 
to $38.3 million in the year-ended 31 March 2017. The 
Group continues to invest to drive billings growth. The 
majority of billings are from subscription contracts with 
the revenue benefit from increased subscription billings 
being deferred into future periods. Accordingly, strong 
subscription billings growth, whilst very positive for the 
long-term health of the business and cash generation, 
can actually show as a detriment to the short-term 
income statement with most of the revenues deferred 
whilst all spending is recognised as incurred. For this 
reason, the Group primarily focuses on billings, cash 
EBITDA and cash flow as the key leading indicators and 
primary operating metrics of the business.
OPERATING LOSS
The Group’s operating loss was $44.3 million in the 
year-ended 31 March 2017, compared to a loss of $32.7 
million in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to 
an increased share-based payment expense, following 
the issue of equity instruments at the time of the Initial 
Public Offering, though this increase was partially offset 
by decreases in exceptional costs and amortisation. 
NET FINANCE COSTS
The Group’s net finance costs decreased by $30.7 
million to $5.0 million in the year due to both the 
repayment in the prior year of the amounts due to 
the previous parent company and, at the time of the 
Company’s Initial Public Offering of shares, an $87.7 
million repayment of bank debt. In addition, foreign 
exchange losses on borrowings in the prior year have 
become gains in the current year as the US Dollar has 
strengthened and the prior year included a $5.9 million 
write-off of un-amortised finance fees that arose on the 
repaid external debt facility.
INCOME TAX
The Group’s tax credit for the year was $2.6 million 
(FY16: $3.5 million charge) with an effective tax rate 
of 5.3 percent (FY16: -5.1 percent). The tax credit 
arises against a reported loss for the Group, however 
cash tax remains payable as a consequence of taxable 
profits in local subsidiaries. The Group also benefited 
from participation in the UK research and development 
expense credit regime.
32 LOSS FOR THE YEAR
The Group’s loss for the year decreased by $25.2 million, 
from a loss of $71.9 million in the year-ended 31 March 
2016 to a loss of $46.7 million in the year-ended 31 
March 2017, predominantly reflecting the reduction in 
finance expenses.
CASH FLOW
Net cash flow from operating activities significantly 
increased YOY to $118.5 million from $21.3 million in 
the prior year. The increase was due to billings growth, 
leverage of operating expenses and management of 
working capital.

Unlevered free cash flow increased threefold over 
the prior-year to $133.4 million due to billings growth, 
significant movements in working capital, reduced 
year-over-year cash tax payments and flat net capital 
expenditure. 
CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital movements result from an increase in 
creditors for activity in the final month of the year while 
debtor days outstanding has decreased in the year to 
42 days (FY16: 44 days). Prior-year working capital 
changes included outflows for significant accrued and 
payable amounts expensed in FY15. 
 
 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The Group’s capital expenditure primarily comprises 
property, plant and equipment as well as intangible 
assets. In the year-ended 31 March 2017, net cash 
capital expenditure decreased marginally by $0.3 million 
on the prior-year. 
CASH TAXATION
Corporation tax paid is lower than in the comparative 
year due to the receipt of a research and development 
expense credit of $5.5 million in the UK.
FINANCING
In the first half of FY17, the Group repaid its revolving 
credit facility which had been drawn to partially finance 
the acquisition of SurfRight in December FY16. In the 
second half of FY17, the Group agreed an additional 
revolving credit facility with its existing lenders in the 
amount of $40 million which at year-end was fully 
drawn along with $10 million from the original revolving 
credit facility in order to partially finance the acquisition 
of Invincea, Inc. At 31 March 2017 the ratio of net debt to 
cash EBITDA was 1.9 times, a decrease from 2.1 times 
as at 31 March 2016; reflecting the cash-generative 
nature of the Group. 
BREXIT
Following the decision by the UK population to exit, in 
due course, from the European Union (“Brexit”), the 
Directors have considered whether or not this will 
manifest itself as an additional risk to the Group. The 
Group’s operations are globally diverse with only 11 
percent of the Group’s revenue being sourced from 
the UK and as the recent devaluation of the Sterling 
exchange rates has a minor benefit to the Group, given 
more sterling denominated costs than revenues in a US 
Dollar denominated functional currency Group. As such, 
Brexit is not considered a principal risk for the Group.
DIVIDENDS 
The Directors propose to pay a final dividend for the 
year-ending 31 March 2017 of 3.3 US Cents per share 
(FY16: 1.1 US Cents), giving a total dividend for the year 
of 4.6 US Cents per share (FY16: 1.8 US Cents). The final 
dividend, subject to shareholder approval, will be paid 
on 13 October 2017 to all shareholders on the register 
on 15 September 2017. The Directors continue to adopt 
a progressive dividend policy, reflecting the cash-
generative nature of the Group; and accordingly intend 
to target continued dividend growth for the financial 
year-ending 31 March 2018.

by the Risk and Compliance Committee (“RCC”), which 
evaluates the principal risks of the Group with reference 
to its strategy and the operating environment.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors and challenges 
these processes, reviewing the Group’s Consolidated Risk 
Register and reporting material risks to the Board.  There 
may be other risks or uncertainties which could emerge 
in the future, however, the Group’s ongoing commitment

(IN NO SPECIFIC ORDER) AFFECTING THE GROUP:
RISK 1: RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF KEY PERSONNEL
How it impacts us
The ongoing success of Sophos is 
dependent on attracting and retaining 
high quality employees at all levels 
in the business who can effectively 
implement the Group’s strategy.
Failure to attract, retain or develop high 
quality employees across the business 
could limit the Group’s ability to deliver 
its business plan commitments.
What we are doing about it
Making Sophos a great place to work is central to the 
Group’s strategy.
Sophos are committed to strong recruitment processes 
supported by robust remuneration programs which are 
benchmarked appropriately.   
Additionally, Sophos has a commitment to all levels of 
training throughout the organisation.
Reward schemes are continuously evaluated to drive and 
recognise performance and ensure retention of key talent.
Annual employee engagement surveys enable the 
progress of our people actions to be monitored, areas of 
improvement identified and necessary actions performed.
Risk 
movement
RISK 2: DEFECTS OR VULNERABILITIES IN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
How it impacts us
The Group’s products and services 
are complex, and as such they have 
contained, and may in the future 
contain, design or manufacturing 
defects or errors that are not detected 
until after their commercial release 
and deployment by end customers.  
These defects could cause the Group’s 
products or services to be vulnerable 
to security attacks, cause them to fail 
to help security networks, temporarily 
interrupt end customers’ networking 
traffic and fail to prevent or detect 
viruses or similar threats.  Further, due 
to the evolving nature of threats and the 
continual emergence of new threats, 
the Group may fail to identify and 
update its threat intelligence or other 
virus databases in time to protect its 
end customers’ networks and devices.
As a result, actual or perceived defects 
or vulnerabilities in the Group’s 
products or services and/or the failure 
of the Group’s products or services to 
prevent a security threat could harm 
the Group’s reputation and divert the 
Group’s resources.
What we are doing about it
Sophos are committed to extensive test cycles and quality 
procedures which are subject to continuous improvement.
Sophos employs combinations of internal and external 
quality reviews and testing of products, including source 
code reviews, public and private 3rd party efficacy testing, 
automated code tests and various forms of penetration 
testing.  Sophos also encourages a healthy collaboration 
with the security research community, as described in the 
Responsible Disclosure Policy: 
www.sophos.com/security
In FY17, Sophos took the additional step of introducing 
a Bug Bounty program to leverage the skills of thousands 
of individuals to help make our products and web 
properties more secure.
Further, the Group protects the privacy and security of 
its customers worldwide through the pledge to never 
engineer backdoors into its products as described here:

INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 35 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
RISK 3: FALSE DETECTION OF THREATS
How it impacts us
The Group’s products may falsely 
detect threats or malware that do not 
actually exist in applications or content 
based on the Group’s classification 
of application type, virus, malware, 
vulnerability exploits, data or URL 
categories (known as ‘false positives).  
These false positives, while inherent 
in the Group’s industry, may impair 
the perceived reliability of the Group’s 
products and may therefore adversely 
impact market acceptance of the 
Group’s products. 
If the Group’s products restrict 
important files or applications based 
on falsely identifying them as malware 
or some other item that could be 
restricted, this could adversely affect 
end customers’ systems and cause 
material system failures.  Any such 
false identification of important files 
or applications could result in negative 
publicity, damage to the Group’s 
reputation, loss of end customer and 
sale, increased costs to remedy any 
problem and risk of litigation, any of 
which could materially adversely affect 
the Group’s financial condition and 
operating results.
What we are doing about it
Sophos is committed to investment in its world class 
Virus Labs facility with emphasis placed on staff training, 
testing and quality procedures.
Moreover, there is a continuous proactive focus on 
improvement of processes to enable early detection of 
a false positive event, as well as applying a ‘lessons 
learnt’ approach through root cause analysis.
Sophos acknowledges the inherent risk associated 
with a false positive incident within the industry and is 
committed to ensuring there are mitigating processes in 
place to manage any incident, large or small, in order to 
minimise the impact on its customers.
Risk 
movement
 
RISK 4: IT SECURITY AND CYBER RISK
How it impacts us
As a provider of IT security products, 
the Group is naturally a target and 
the Group’s networks and products 
may have vulnerabilities that have 
from time-to-time been, and may 
in the future be, targeted by attacks 
specifically designed to disrupt the 
Group’s business and harm the 
Group’s reputation
If an actual or perceived breach of 
security occurs in the Group’s internal 
systems, it could adversely affect 
the market perception of the Group’s 
products.  In addition, a security 
breach could affect the Group’s ability 
to operate its business, including 
the Group’s ability to provide support 
services to end customers.
What we are doing about it
Sophos has a dedicated cybersecurity team that is 
focused on investigation and mitigation of risks related to 
cyber-attack.  The team is focused on day-to-day active 
monitoring processes to identify and deal with IT security 
incidents, and in implementing continual improvements 
in the IT security technology, education and awareness 
and policies that combine in the overall security posture 
of Sophos.
Sophos continues to increase its investment in 
cybersecurity.
The Sophos Group maintains cyber insurance to transfer 
part of the risk of any deliberate attack to the insurer.
Risk 
movement
 
36 RISK 5: PRODUCT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
How it impacts us
Sophos has an extensive number of 
products, enhanced further by acquired 
technologies.  The extent of investment 
in each product needs to be managed 
and prioritised taking into account the 
expected future prospects.  Additionally, 
consideration must be given to the 
ability to be able to adequately support 
the entire product range.
Failure to manage the product portfolio 
adequately could result in inappropriate 
investment focus in relation to research 
and innovation in product development, 
which is essential to meet customer 
and partner requirements.  This could 
result in products that do not meet the 
requirements of customers or partners 
and could increase the risk they will look 
to alternative solutions, resulting in the 
potential loss of both new and existing 
revenue streams. 
Additionally, insufficient focus on key 
research and development projects 
may damage the long-term growth 
prospects of the Group.
What we are doing about it
Sophos continue to focus on and improve the interaction 
between product management, product development, 
sales and marketing and all support functions in an 
integrated product development approach.
Internal processes are run to identify opportunities for 
standardisation and consistency across products lines.  
This helps eliminate redundancies, reduce development 
and support costs and improve partner and customer 
experiences through a more predictable and coherent 
product portfolio.
Sophos are working to bring all products under a 
single cloud management platform to deliver “parity” 
(of management features and user experience) and 
“portability” (to address any privacy or data sovereignty 
issues that our partners/customers might face).
Additionally, during the current financial year, Sophos have 
consolidated both Network and Enduser under single 
leadership in order to improve synchronized security, cross 
business unit interlock and investment efficiencies.
Sophos customer and partner communities continue 
to be invaluable resources in guiding portfolio 
management decisions. They provide immediate and 
constant feedback on how well Sophos are meeting their 
requirements, improvements that Sophos can make 
to its current offerings and opportunities for portfolio 
consolidation or expansion. 
During the year-ended 31 March 2017, the Group 
strengthened its product portfolio through the acquisition 
of Invincea, Barricade and PhishThreat. 
Risk 
movement
RISK 6: DISRUPTION TO DAY TO DAY GROUP OPERATIONS
How it impacts us
Sophos is at risk of disruption to its 
day to day operations from a disaster 
incident which may seriously impact IT 
systems or access to office space.
A failure in the operation of the Group’s 
key systems or infrastructure on which 
the Group relies could cause a failure of 
service to its customers and negatively 
impact the Sophos brand.
What we are doing about it
Sophos has made significant investments in the 
technology and infrastructure of the Group to ensure it 
continues to support the growth of the organisation.
Additionally, incident management procedures and

INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Each year Sophos conducts an employee opinion 
survey to gain direct feedback from employees and 
help identify and deliver actions that will increase 
employee engagement and company performance. 
The results from the survey are reviewed by the senior 
management team and are used to drive global, regional 
or departmental changes so that the business makes 
Sophos a better place to work. 
During the year, the Group introduced a global Save as 
You Earn (”SAYE”) plan, and an equivalent Employee 
Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) for US employees to 
enable all employees to save and participate in the long-
term success of Sophos.
The Group actively engages with local universities in 
our key locations and offers internships and working 
student opportunities in Canada, the USA, the UK, 
Germany and Austria. In the UK, the Group has an 
established intern and graduate program, supporting 
students through a full-year paid internship and 
provides support, expertise and guidance for their final 
year projects. Many of the interns receive permanent 
offers to join Sophos post-graduation, as well as 
financial assistance for their final year of study.
EMPLOYEES
The Group operates by its core values: simplicity, empowerment, passion, innovation and authenticity. The Group 
promotes a culture where people can achieve and be recognised for their achievements, where people have the 
support they need to develop themselves and where people are valued and treated with respect. Development 
opportunities are made available to all employees through unlimited access to one of the largest independent online 
libraries of e-learning courses in the world for technical, personal and leadership skills development, in addition to role-
specific training and access to Instructor-Led Training (“ILT”) aligned to their development and career aspirations. The 
Group is committed to providing equal opportunities and recruits and promotes staff on the basis of their experience, 
qualifications, skills and attitude.

Sophos India, through its ‘Prarambh’ CSR initiative has 
adopted a rural village to uplift the lives of 350 families 
living there. The aim is to improve education, healthcare, 
family welfare, infrastructure, sanitation and sustainable 
livelihood patterns in the village. 
The plan is to bring about all-round development of the 
village by focusing on key areas like education, sanitation, 
basic infrastructure, medical facilities and empowerment 
of women; Sophos works with the people of the village to 
ensure development goals are mutually agreed.
Sophos is a firm believer in using environmentally friendly 
technology for the greater good and has installed solar 
street lights to help meet the energy requirements of the 
village community. There is also a focus on building water 
conservation structures with the active involvement 
of the villagers, the objective being the preservation of 
rainwater and to facilitate agricultural activities. 
Case Study: Village adoption
38 COMMUNITY & CHARITIES
Sophos employees share the core values of a 
commitment to help others and make a positive impact 
in the communities where they live and work. Sophos 
encourages and supports these activities and around 
the world local Sophos offices support a wide range of 
charities and community projects.
During the year, Sophos in the Philippines continued 
its annual Sophos Cares project with Santuario de San 
Jose. Local staff held collections for donations and 
gifts were distributed by eighteen Sophos employees to 
forty orphans aged three to seven years old after having 
spent quality playtime with the children. In Hungary, 
the Budapest office prepared Christmas gift boxes for 
children living in poverty, as well as donating their time 
and creative skills to raise money for a local charity that 
helps support vulnerable people throughout the year. In 
the UK, a series of events were held in the year to raise 
money for Byte Night in support of Action for Children, 
a charity that supports some of the 80,000 young 
people who are homeless in the UK through no fault of 
their own. UK employees participated in a month-long 
series of sponsored events, auctions and fund-raising, 
culminating in 26 of the team, headed by the CFO, 
sleeping out for a night to raise over £16,000 for 
the charity.
MODERN SLAVERY ACT
Sophos is committed to compliance with the 
provisions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. As such, 
the Group has a zero-tolerance approach to modern 
slavery and is further committed to acting ethically, 
transparently and with integrity in all of its business 
dealings and relationships. During the year, the Board 
adopted the Sophos Group Anti-Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Policy and published its Modern Slavery Act 
Transparency Statement, each of which can be found 
on the Group’s website at www.sophos.com.
ENVIRONMENT
The Group recognises that it has a responsibility for 
effectively managing its environmental performance 
and minimising the impact of its operations. The Group 
is committed to continual environmental improvement 
in the management of its premises, operations and 
employee engagement. To that end, an Environmental 
Sustainability Program has been developed that 
will operate over the medium to long term with key 
stages of:
 » A scoping review to explore in depth Sophos’ current 
position, establish appropriate standards for the 
Group and perform a gap analysis and action plan to 
attain the standards.
 » Development of a comprehensive policy, embracing 
all aspects of environmental sustainability that 
would include a road map for the Group to follow.
 » Perform a sustainability materiality audit to identify 
and prioritise issues, risks and opportunities to 
enable the Group to focus on those activities which 
make the most significant contribution to the 
business and to sustainable development.
 » Greening audit of buildings to explore opportunities 
for greening the interior and exterior of building 
and site, guided by the principles of sustainability, 
biodiversity and health and wellbeing.

transportation to students as well as providing skill 
development courses.
To improve the health and wellness of villagers, free 
medical check-up camps are organised and a rural

of women empowerment in the village by imparting 
training in arts, crafts and other skillsets to aid self-
dependence.

Acquisitions
Strong heritage in 
driving value from 
acquisitions.
MACHINE LEARNING 
ANTIVIRUS 
In FY17 Sophos acquired neural-
network based machine learning 
and behavioural monitoring 
technology to enhance malware 
detection through artificial 
intelligence. Invincea, Inc., a next-
generation endpoint security 
company based in the US, had 
developed its portfolio to prevent, 
detect and remediate zero-day and 
sophisticated attacks.
Sophos expects to rapidly integrate 
Invincea technology into the 
endpoint product line, and make it 
available through Sophos channel 
partners worldwide.
CLOUD-BASED 
ANALYTICS
Sophos acquired a start-up 
company that had created a 
real-time security monitoring and 
analysis technology that leverages 
machine learning to monitor 
users and devices for anomalous 
behaviour, significantly enhancing 
the ability to identify malicious or 
suspicious activity. 
The technology will deliver further 
capabilities around user and 
entity behaviour analytics and 
synchronized security intelligence 
through the Sophos Central 
management platform. 
AUTOMATED, INTEGRATED 
SECURITY AWARENESS 
The threat of phishing, which 
exploits human trust and 
behaviour to instigate an attack 
on an organisation, is growing 
in sophistication and volume. 
Sophos has acquired technology 
to help customers address the 
human side of corporate security. 
Sophos has since launched Sophos 
Phish Threat, an automated 
security training product that can 
significantly reduce the potential 
for phishing to be successful in 
a company, through consistent 
training and awareness. 41 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

45 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
FY17 has been a year of continued successful progress 
in our business, as well as in strengthening our status 
as a UK public listed company. The Board has kept 
under review its policies and procedures created to 
meet the various corporate governance and regulatory 
requirements applicable to the Company following its 
Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and built upon them in 
order to take in to account new regulations, including 
the EU Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) and the UK 
Modern Slavery Act 2015. In response to MAR, the 
Board approved the adoption of a new Sophos Dealing 
Code, established a Disclosure Committee of the Board 
and implemented accompanying internal processes. In 
respect of the Modern Slavery Act, the Board approved 
the adoption of the Sophos Anti-Slavery and Human 
Trafficking policy, together with associated internal 
processes, and published the Sophos Modern Slavery 
Act Transparency Statement on its website, accessible 
from the homepage. 
BOARD COMPOSITION AND COMPLIANCE
The Board has forged ahead with its plan to further 
strengthen its composition and to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) by 
successfully welcoming two new independent Non-
Executive Directors in early 2017. I, and my fellow 
Board members, were delighted to welcome Vin Murria 
on 3 January 2017 and Rick Medlock, shortly after the 
end of the financial year on 3 April 2017. Vin Murria is 
a successful entrepreneur with a strong background 
in both building and advising technology-based 
companies in the UK, and in growing shareholder 
value. Vin was previously named Quoted Company 
Entrepreneur of the year and Woman of The Year 
in the Cisco Everywoman Technology Awards. Rick 
Medlock has 30 years of experience in the financial 
management of large international technology 
companies. His deep understanding and knowledge 
of financial management in the technology industry, 
and extensive experience with global businesses 
listed in both the UK and the US will be of great benefit 
to the Board. 
In addition, Ed Gillis announced his intention to retire 
as an independent Non-Executive Director and 
chairman of our Audit and Risk Committee, with effect 
from the conclusion of the Company’s 2017 Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”). Ed has been a member of 
the Board for eight years, leading the Audit and Risk 
Committee, including seeing the Company through its 
IPO and he has brought considerable insight, diligence 
and professionalism to the Board throughout his 
tenure, for which we are all very grateful. Rick Medlock 
will assume the role of chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee at the time of Ed’s retirement.
Following Ed’s retirement, the Board with the 
Nomination Committee will keep the Board’s overall 
composition under review and in particular, the 
proportion comprised of independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
BOARD EVALUATION
Sophos supports the Code principle that each FTSE 350 
company should undertake a thorough review of Board 
process, practice and culture on an annual basis; with 
the input of an external facilitator at least once every 
three years. The Board considers such annual reviews 
as an essential part of good corporate governance. 
During the year, we assessed the effectiveness of 
the Board externally for the first time, building on the 
findings from the previous year’s internal exercise. We 
focused on our effectiveness as a Board as a whole, on 
each committee’s effectiveness and the performance 
of each individual Director. The evaluation concluded 
that the Board continued to operate in a functional, 
collegiate way which is committed, effective and 
purposeful in seeking to deliver value to shareholders. 
In addition, the committee structure in place, together 
with orderly and thoughtful refreshment of the Board 
in the past year, has ensured that an appropriate level 
of specialist support and assurance is available to the 
main Board. The review is discussed in more detail on 
pages 52 to 53 of this Report.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
At Sophos, all our shareholders are important to us 
and the Board looks to encourage and maintain an 
open dialogue with them. The design and operation 
of a robust, yet evolving governance structure 
appropriate for a group of the scale and ambition of 
Sophos remains critical to meeting their needs. The 
Company’s approach to governance is based firmly 
on the concept that good corporate governance 
enhances long-term shareholder value and sets the 
culture, ethics and values for the rest of the Group. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for reviewing 
and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and 
it has considered and endorsed the arrangements 
for their preparation, under the guidance of its Audit 
and Risk Committee. The Directors confirm the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
Peter Gyenes
Non-Executive Chairman
46 UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE COMPLIANCE
This report, which is available on the Company’s website, explains the key features of the Company’s governance 
structure to provide a greater understanding of how the main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the 
Code”) have been applied and to highlight areas of focus during the year. The Code can be found on the FRC’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk 
During the year, the Company complied with all the principles and provisions of the Code, except for Code provision 
B.1.2 which recommends that at least half of the Board of Directors of a UK-listed company, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise independent Non-Executive Directors. Following the appointment of Vin Murria, 44 percent of the 
Board were considered to be independent at the end of the financial year. Notwithstanding the appointment of Rick 
Medlock in April 2017, the Board recognises that the Company will no longer comply with this provision following Ed Gillis’s 
retirement at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. The Board will keep this position under review, and it is their intention to 
comply in due course. Full details of independence can be found in the Board of Directors section on pages 50 and 51.
THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
The Board is responsible for the effective oversight of the Company. It also agrees the strategic direction and governance 
structure that will help achieve the long-term success of the Company and deliver shareholder value. The Board takes

47 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED
• Risk: In conjunction with the recommendations of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board’s review of the Annual 
Report included detailed consideration of:
 – the identified principle risks of the Company and the continued effective management of those risks in order to 
achieve the Company’s strategic objectives; 
 – the ongoing appropriateness of the adoption of the going concern basis of accounting; 
 – the appropriateness of the Viability Statement disclosure; and 
 –  that the Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable and it provided the information necessary to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
• Governance: The Board took account of the changing corporate governance landscape and kept under review the 
ongoing effectiveness of its governance structure in FY17 in order to keep pace. As a result, the Board considered 
and approved governance policies designed to ensure its compliance with MAR and the UK Modern Slavery Act 
2015, together with the establishment of a Disclosure Committee and the publication of the Sophos Modern 
Slavery Act Transparency Statement. 
•  P er f o r m a nc e : In FY17, the Board undertook an evaluation of its own performance, the performance of its 
committees and each individual Director with the assistance of an external facilitator, Duncan Reed of Condign 
Board Consulting Limited. As a result, a number of recommendations were made, and actions identified for the 
forthcoming year, and are set out on pages 52 to 53 of this Report.
BOARD COMMITTEES 
The Board has a number of committees that were established at the time of its IPO, and which support the effective 
discharge of its duties. During the year, the Board also established a Disclosure Committee to oversee the disclosure

BOARD COMPOSITION, QUALIFICATION AND EXPERIENCE
The composition, experience and balance of skills on the Board are periodically reviewed to ensure that there is the 
right combination on the Board and its Committees and they are working effectively. At the date of publication, there 
are currently eleven Directors on the Board, which comprises a Non-Executive Chairman (who, for the purposes of 
the Code was independent on appointment), two Executive Directors, five independent Non-Executive Directors and 
three Non-Executive Directors who are considered by the Board not to be independent for the purposes of the Code. 
The current members of the Board have a wide range of skills and experience. The Board believes that crucial to its 
ability to lead the Company successfully it requires a membership that combines detailed knowledge of: the Group’s 
operations; the technology industry in which the Group operates; leading a global business; and, being listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
KEY BOARD ROLES
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF-EXECUTIVE
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Independent Director is 
clearly defined and agreed by the Board. The Board supports the separation of the roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive and the partnership between Peter Gyenes and Kris Hagerman is based on mutual trust, facilitated by 
regular contact between the two. The separation of authority enhances independent oversight of the executive 
management by the Board and helps to ensure that no one individual on the Board has unfettered authority.

when required

sounding board and providing support
• Is available to shareholders and other Non-
Executives to address any concerns or issues they

• Have a prime role in appointing and, where necessary,

• Provide an external, diverse perspective and insight 
to consideration of management proposals.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The Board considers and reviews the independence of each Non-Executive Director on an annual basis as part of the 
Directors’ performance evaluation. In carrying out the review, consideration is given to factors such as their character, 
judgement, commitment and performance on the Board and relevant committees and their ability to provide objective 
challenge to management and an external, diverse perspective to the consideration of management proposals to 
support the Company achieve its strategic aims.
The Board considers its independent Non-Executive Directors bring strong judgement and considerable knowledge 
and experience to the Board’s deliberations. The Board considers that the appointments made during the year have 
only strengthened this position further. The Code requires a company to state its reasons if it determines that a 
Director is independent in certain circumstances, including where a Director holds cross-directorships or participates 
in the Company’s share option or performance related pay scheme. 
Paul Walker, as noted in the annual report on Directors’ Remuneration on page 87, participates in a restricted share 
arrangement. Notwithstanding this arrangement, the Board considers Paul to be independent in character and 
judgement. This continues to be evidenced by his valuable contributions at Board and committee meetings, and in 
particular, the knowledge and experience he brings to his role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Additionally, Peter Gyenes is a director of Carbonite Inc., to whose board Steve Munford was appointed Chairman 
in March 2016. The Code provides that the Chairman of a company should be independent on appointment. The 
Board considers that Peter Gyenes, the Chairman, was independent upon appointment and that he continues to be 
independent notwithstanding the cross-directorship described above. Steve Munford was also Chief Executive of the 
Group between 2006 and 2012 and accordingly is not considered to be independent. 
 
Roy Mackenzie and Salim Nathoo are shareholder appointed Directors and accordingly are not considered independent.
50 By the date of the 2017 AGM, Sandra Bergeron will have served on the Board for seven years. In accordance with the 
Code, the Board has determined that Sandra Bergeron has retained independence of character and judgement and 
had not formed associations with the Company that might compromise her independent judgement, notwithstanding 
her length of service.
APPOINTMENT AND TENURE
All Non-Executive Directors serve on the basis of letters of appointment which are available for inspection upon 
request. The letters of appointment set out the expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors who, on 
appointment, undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. This will include 
attendance at scheduled and emergency Board meetings, meetings of any committee to which they are appointed, 
site visits, board strategy away days, meetings with shareholders, meetings as part of the Board evaluation process, 
update meetings and training days and meetings of Non-Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for an initial three-year term and the continuation of their appointment is conditional on satisfactory performance and 
subject to annual re-election at the Company’s Annual General Meetings. 
Executive Directors serve on the basis of service agreements which are also available for inspection upon request. 
Further details on the Executive Directors’ service agreements are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
on page 75.
DIRECTOR INDUCTION AND TRAINING
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary, is responsible for the induction of new Directors and 
ongoing development of all Directors. New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board, 
designed to provide an understanding of the Group’s business, governance and key stakeholders. The induction 
process includes the provision of an induction pack and past Board materials, operational site visits, meetings with key 
individuals and the Company’s advisors, and briefings on key business, legal and regulatory issues facing the Group.
As the business environment changes, it is important to ensure the Directors’ skills and knowledge are refreshed and 
updated regularly. Accordingly, the Company Secretary ensures that updates on corporate governance, regulatory and 
technical matters are provided to Directors at Board meetings and by means of communications or special sessions in 
between formal Board meetings. In this way, Directors keep their skills and knowledge relevant so as to enable them to 
continue to fulfil their duties effectively. 
Following the conclusion of the recent Board evaluation process, a new selection of training and development 
opportunities will be made available to the Board to address any identified areas for focus as well as topical corporate 
governance, regulatory and technical matters.
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE TO DIRECTORS, THE COMPANY SECRETARY
The Board and each Director has unlimited access to the General Counsel and Company Secretary, who advises 
the Board and the Board Committees on relevant matters, including compliance with the Company’s policies and 
procedures, relevant legislation and regulation, including the Listing Rules and the Code and other governance 
standards. The General Counsel and Company Secretary provides guidance to the Board and individual Directors 
regarding their duties, responsibilities and powers and ensures the proper administration of the proceedings and 
matters relating to the Board. The Chief Executive Officer and the Company Secretary work together to ensure that 
Board papers are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely and secure manner to Directors, and are of sufficient quality 
to enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. As well as the support of the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, there is a procedure in place for any Director to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary or advisable.
All Directors have access to an online portal to which Board materials are published and Board resources, including 
information about the Company and helpful guidance documents for their reference as Directors of a UK listed 
company, are available.
DIRECTOR ELECTION AND RE-ELECTION
Following recommendations from the Nomination Committee and taking into account the results of the Board’s 
performance evaluation process, the Board considers that each of the Directors proposed for election or re-election is 
fully competent to carry out their responsibilities as a Director and as set out earlier, is content that each independent 
Non-Executive Director is independent in character and there are no relationships or circumstances likely to affect his 
or her character or judgement. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) and provision 
B.7.1 of the Code, all Directors will be subject to annual re-election. All Directors will seek re-election at the Company’s 
AGM in 2017 as set out in the Notice of AGM, with the exception of Edwin Gillis who has indicated his intention to retire 
at the conclusion of the AGM, and Vin Murria and Rick Medlock who will be standing for election for the first time.
51 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have, or may have, interests that conflict with those of 
the Company, unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes potential conflicts that may arise when a 
Director takes up a position with another company. The Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) and the Articles allow the Board 
to authorise such potential conflicts, and the Board has adopted a procedure to address these requirements, which 
includes the Directors completing detailed conflict of interest questionnaires. 
The matters disclosed in the questionnaires are reviewed by the Board following the Directors’ appointments and 
annually thereafter and, if considered appropriate, authorised in accordance with the Act and the Articles. The Board 
deals with each appointment on its individual merit and takes into consideration all the circumstances. The following 
appointments have been authorised by the Board and have been included in the conflicts register for the relevant period.
• Salim Nathoo is a partner at Apax Partners LLP and Roy Mackenzie is a partner at Apax Partners, LP. Apax 
Partners, LP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apax Partners LLP. Both Apax Partners, LP and Apax Partners LLP 
are advisors of the Apax Funds, which wholly own Pentagon Lock Sarl, Pentagon Lock 6-A Sarl, Pentagon Lock 7-A 
Sarl and Pentagon Lock US Sarl, and shares a common owner with Apax Global Alpha Limited (collectively “Apax”). 
Following the admission of the Company’s shares to the London Stock Exchange in 2015, Apax controlled 35.2 
percent of the voting rights in the Company and at 31 March 2017, continued to control more than 20 percent of the 
voting rights in the Company.
• Steve Munford is chairman of Carbonite, Inc. which supplies cloud and hybrid data protection solutions, and a 
company on whose board Peter Gyenes is also a director. Steve also sits on the board of Alert Logic, Inc. which 
supplies security and compliance solutions and until January 2017, sat on the board of Utimaco Inc, a subsidiary 
of Utimaco GmbH which supplies professional cybersecurity solutions. 
• Ed Gillis sits on the board of LogMeIn, Inc., a leading SaaS company.
• Sandra Bergeron sits on the boards of F5 Networks and Qualys, Inc., suppliers of application delivery networking 
and cloud security and compliance management solutions respectively.
• Vin Murria is a Non-Executive Director of Softcat plc, with whom the Company maintains an ongoing customer 
relationship, see note 32 of the Financial Statements for details of related party transactions. 
BOARD EVALUATION AND EFFECTIVENESS
In accordance with Principle B.6.2. of the Code and corporate governance best practice, it is the Board’s policy to invite 
external evaluation of the Board, its Committees and the role of individual Directors every three years. During the 
year, it was agreed that the evaluation process for the current fiscal year would be externally facilitated and following 
a robust tender process, Duncan Reed of Condign Board Consulting Limited was engaged to conduct the evaluation. 
Duncan Reed is independent. His only connection to Sophos Group plc is his work with the Board evaluation.
The results of the evaluation concluded that the Board continued to operate in a functional, collegiate way which is 
committed, effective and purposeful in seeking to deliver value to shareholders. In addition, the committee structure in 
place, together with orderly and thoughtful refreshment of the Board in the past year, has ensured that an appropriate 
level of specialist support and assurance is available to the main Board.
The Board evaluation process was led by the Chairman, in consultation with the Senior Independent Director and 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. The approach adopted included observation by Mr Reed at the February 
2017 Board Meeting and Strategy event, together with one to one discussions between Mr Reed and each Director, 
the General Counsel and Company Secretary and the Deputy Company Secretary.
During the year, the following activities were undertaken as recommendations adopted by the Board from the previous 
year’s internal evaluation:
• The Board received regular updates on corporate governance, regulatory and technical matters at Board meetings 
in order to build on their understanding of the applicable UK rules;
• With the support of the Nomination Committee and the SVP, Human Resources, the Board;
 – considered the Company’s succession plan for each role in the Senior Management Team; and
 – monitored the Board’s composition in light of Code provisions and agreed potential Board candidate profiles in 
order to secure the appointment of two new independent Non-Executive Directors during the year;
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED
52 • With the support of the Audit and Risk Committee and Head of Internal Audit, the Board placed additional 
focus on the consideration of Group risks and in particular, the identification, understanding and management 
of those risks;
• With the support of the General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Board undertook an evaluation of the Board, 
its Committees and the role of individual Directors in order to continue to assess and improve Board processes.
Following the conclusion of the current year’s evaluation, the Board agreed the following recommendations for 
improvement in the next fiscal year:
• Bring greater clarity and focus to the role of the Board, and individuals within it, by providing more directional board 
materials and through clearer allocation and management of the Board’s time in disciplined discussions;
• Further promote focused debate at the Board by operating an annual strategic agenda in which the Directors will 
input, ensuring that each meeting considers key strategic issues at the most appropriate junctures, alongside the 
normal requirements of the quarterly reporting cycle;
• Support the Nomination Committee in crystallising and planning for future Board and Committee rotation, 
including scoping and clarifying specifications for key roles, in accordance with the provisions of the Code; and
• Continue working closely with management and the Company’s advisers, to ensure that wider shareholder 
sentiment on Company matters is fully explored, understood and weighed.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Responsibility for shareholder relations rests with the Group’s Chief Financial Officer, supported principally by the 
Chief Executive, the Chairman and Senior Independent Director, as appropriate. He ensures that there is effective 
communication with shareholders and is responsible for ensuring that the Board understands the views of 
shareholders. Mr. Bray and Mr Hagerman are also supported by the Group’s VP of Investor Relations and corporate 
brokers with whom they are in regular dialogue. 
As a part of a comprehensive investor relations programme, formal meetings with investors are scheduled to discuss 
the Group’s interim and final results. In the intervening periods, the Company continues its dialogue with the investor 
community by meeting key investor representatives and holding investor roadshows. Non-Executive Directors are 
invited to attend meetings in the investor relations programme and welcome the opportunity to meet with our major 
shareholders.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Company’s next AGM will take place at 3:00 pm on Thursday, 7 September 2017 at the Company’s registered 
office. All shareholders have the opportunity to attend and vote, in person or by proxy, at the AGM. The Notice of AGM 
can be found on our website at https:/ /investors.sophos.com, and in a circular which is being mailed out at the same 
time as this Report.

resolutions are proposed in respect of each substantive issue. The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for 
communication with private shareholders.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

Company’s risk management and internal control systems on page 62.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
KPMG LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as the Company’s auditor. As outlined in the Audit and 
Risk Committee report on page 63, resolutions proposing their reappointment and to authorise the Audit and Risk

53 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER, 
I am pleased to present our second report on behalf of my fellow Nomination Committee members.  The Committee 
met three times during the year and has placed a significant amount of focus on the Company’s search for additional 
independent non-executive directors, the attendant process for Board appointments and succession planning for 
senior management, Board and Committee appointments.  Here we set out the key aspects of the Committee’s role in 
more detail, together with our main areas of consideration and the activities we have undertaken during the year. 
Since our last report to Shareholders, the Committee has also welcomed two new members, following the successful 
appointment of two new independent non-executive directors to the Board earlier this year.  Vin Murria and Rick 
Medlock joined the Company in January and April, respectively; and bring with them a wealth of experience in both the 
technology industry and globally-oriented UK listed companies.

All appointments stated are as at 31 March 2017
The composition of the Committee is in compliance with the Code, which provides that a majority of its members 
should be independent non-executive directors.  The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board.  The 
Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and attends all meetings.  Other attendees at Committee meetings 
may differ from time to time and, upon invitation from the Committee, include the Chief Executive and other members 
of the senior management team. 
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee is responsible for regularly evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of the 
Board and its Committees, as well as the size, structure and composition of each.  It is also responsible for periodically 
reviewing the Board, Committees’ and senior management structure and succession plans, and identifying with 
management, the priorities for succession planning in respect of each position.  On an annual basis, the committee 
considers the re-election of Directors prior to their recommended approval by shareholders.  The full terms of 
reference of the Committee can be found on the Company’s website at https:/ /investors.sophos.com.
MAIN ACTIVITIES
The Committee has an annual forward agenda, developed from its terms of reference, with standing items that the 
Committee considers at each meeting, in addition to any specific matters arising, and topical business or governance 
items on which the Committee has chosen to focus.  During the year, time was taken, to: 
• review the composition of the Board and its Committees, including the chairmanship of each Committee;
• consider the implications for Board composition of the results of the Board performance evaluation process;
• review the succession plans for senior management, Board and Committee appointments; 
• instigate and keep under review the search for at least one new Non-Executive Director;
• review the performance of external search consultants;
• review the annual time requirement of Non-Executive Directors;
• review the Company’s Diversity Policy and the performance of the Company when measured against it;
• review the Committee’s terms of reference; 
• review and approve the Committee’s report for inclusion in the Annual Report and Accounts; and
• review and recommend the appointment and re-appointment of directors at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
of the Company.
54 PROCESS FOR BOARD APPOINTMENTS 
The Committee is asked to lead, on behalf of the Board, the selection process for new Board appointments as and 
when they arise and to make recommendations in respect of such appointments.  Following the Committee’s review 
of the structure, size and composition of the Board and in particular, having regard to the principles of the Code and 
the results of the annual Board performance evaluation process relating to Board composition, the Company initiated 
a search for two new independent Non-Executive Directors during the year.  During May 2016, the Company engaged 
Heidrick & Struggles, independent executive search consultants, with whom the Company has no other connection, 
to assist with the search.  Heidrick & Struggles is a signatory to and abides by the voluntary Code of Conduct, on 
gender diversity and best practice.
Following a rigorous search process, the Company was delighted to appoint Vin Murria and Rick Medlock to the 
Board as independent Non-Executive Directors with effect from 3 January 2017 and 3 April 2017, respectively.  
In addition, Edwin Gillis has confirmed to the Board his intention to retire and not stand for re-election at the 
Company’s 2017 AGM.  The Committee is aware that following Edwin’s retirement, the Board will no longer be 
compliant with the provision of the Code, that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise 
independent Non-Executive Directors, and as outlined in my earlier statement the Company will continue its 
process to identify and recruit a further candidate to serve as an independent Non-Executive Director.
The process adopted for searches undertaken during the year is set out below:
• The Committee Chairman, with the consultants, submitted a short-list of candidates to members of the Committee and 
the Chief Executive Officer for them to review and, to enable them to suggest other candidates.
• The Committee Chairman, Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each 
met the short-listed candidates selected by the Committee.  Once it was determined that the Chairman wished to 
proceed with the selection process, the candidate was then invited to meet all members of the Board.
• After all Board members had met the candidate, the Committee then determined whether to recommend the 
candidate to the Board for appointment.
Where the Company decides to appoint an Executive Director, the process it will adopt is set out below:
• The Committee Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer or, if engaged, search consultants, will submit a short-list 
of one or more candidates to the Committee.
• The Committee Chairman, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will each 
meet the candidates selected for interview.  Once determined that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer wish to 
proceed with the selection process, some or all of the Committee members will then meet the candidates selected 
for interview.
• The Committee’s assessments will be reviewed with the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, 
following which a candidate may be recommended to the Board for appointment.
SUCCESSION
During the year, the Committee conducted a review of succession to SMT roles and identified individuals internally 
and externally, as appropriate who would be suited to take on each role.  Internal successors were categorised 
by their relative readiness to assume any such role and where it was not possible to identify a suitable internal 
successor, an external successor would be identified, as and when appropriate.  Management would look at the 
implementation of developmental plans to address any internal successors relative readiness to assume any such 
role.  Alongside the ongoing search process outlined above, the Committee had kept a watching brief on succession 
to Board roles during the year, and would continue to do so during the current financial year. 
DIVERSITY
The Company’s Diversity Policy acknowledges the importance of diversity in its broadest sense, including gender 
and ethnicity, for the Group.  The Board does not feel it would be appropriate to set absolute targets as it believes 
all appointments should be made on merit, although it will take in to consideration the recommendations of the 
Davies and Hampton-Alexander reviews for female representation on the Board of at least one third by 2020, and 
for recruitment and promotion to the SMT, and their direct reports, to reflect this.  Details of diversity within our 
workforce, including at Board and at the senior management level, can be found on page 38. 
55 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board also established the measurable objectives set out below for achieving diversity on the Board and the 
Committee firmly believes that in the appointments made since our last report to Shareholders, the Board has 
delivered on each of these objectives: 
• All Board appointments will be made on merit, in the context of the skills, knowledge and experience that are 
needed for the Board to be effective. 
• Ensure long lists of potential Non-Executive Directors include diverse candidates of appropriate merit. 
• Encourage the emergence of female candidates and candidates of diverse backgrounds among the senior 
management talent pool.
• Only engage executive search firms who have signed up to the voluntary Code of Conduct on gender diversity 
and best practice.
During the year, the Committee, in recognition of their role in increasing diversity throughout the Group, considered 
diversity in its broadest sense when reviewing the succession plans for roles to the Board, Committees and senior 
management, and in assessing long-lists of potential candidates for appointment to the Board.
In addition to taking in to account gender, ethnicity and other forms of diversity, the Committee seeks to achieve the optimal 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of Sophos and the industry as a whole amongst the Board and 
senior management team, in order to support the Company’s long-term objectives.  At 31 March 2017 , the proportion of 
women on the Board was 20 percent and the proportion of independent Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
was 44 percent.  Following Rick Medlock’s appointment, the proportion of women on the Board is 18 percent, and the  
proportion of independent Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) is 50 percent.  
The Committee will continue to keep these measurable objectives under review and will make recommendations to 
the Board for their future adjustment, as appropriate.  The Committee is pleased with the Company’s performance 
against these objectives to date, but acknowledges that progress is ongoing. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The Nomination Committee’s performance was assessed as part of the Board’s annual effectiveness review. It was 
concluded that the Committee operated effectively.  In response to the findings of the review, Committee members 
will consider and develop the Board rotation and succession road map taking in to account the current and desired 
balance of skills and experience, together with, tenure, independence and diversity including as to gender and 
the international background of its Directors. As referred to above, the Committee will also keep under review the 
Company’s people policies, including Diversity Policy and recommend implementation or revision, where appropriate.
The Committee also undertakes a review of its terms of reference and composition each year.  This review last took 
place in November 2016, and the full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the Company’s website, at 
https:/ /investors.sophos.com

56 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER, 
I am pleased to present our second report on behalf of my fellow Audit and Risk Committee members. The Committee 
met five times during the year and kept under close review the risk management framework put in place following the 
Company’s IPO in 2015. Here we have set out the key aspects of the Committee’s role in more detail, together with 
the main activities we have undertaken and the significant issues we have considered during the year. Following the 
year-end we have also welcomed a new member of the Committee who will become my successor as its Chairman, 
following the conclusion of the 2017 AGM later this year. In Rick Medlock, the Committee has acquired a strong 
leader with a deep understanding and knowledge of financial management in the technology industry, and extensive 
experience with globally-oriented UK-listed companies.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee has a fundamental role to play in reviewing, monitoring and challenging the integrity and effectiveness of 
the Company’s financial reporting and internal control processes. The Committee also oversees the relationship between 
the Group and its external auditors and makes recommendations to the Board on their appointment. In addition, the 
Committee monitors and reviews the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit 
process, taking into account relevant legal, professional and regulatory requirements. The full terms of reference of the 
Committee can be found on the Company’s website, at https:/ /investors.sophos.com.
MAIN ACTIVITIES
The Committee has an annual forward agenda, developed from its terms of reference, with standing items that the 
Committee considers at each meeting, in addition to any specific matters arising, and topical business or financial 
items on which the Committee has chosen to focus. During the year, the work of the Committee fell in to three main 
areas as follows: 
57 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCOUNTING, TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
• reviewed and approved the quarterly trading updates, half-year and annual financial statements and the attendant 
significant financial reporting judgements and disclosures; 
• reviewed and approved the going concern and viability assessment, and external statement issued annually;
• reviewed updates on accounting matters, including consideration of relevant accounting standards and underlying 
assumptions, and in particular:
 – the review and revision of alternative performance measures applied by the Company;
 – the impact of changing accounting standards, in particular revenue recognition;
 – the codification of accounting for exceptional items; and
• reviewed and approved the interim and full-year dividend proposals and adjudged them to be in line with the 
Company’s Dividend policy.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

established following the IPO and which has a direct reporting line to the Committee, to provide an additional level 
of assurance to the Committee.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
• met with the external auditors, KPMG, to review the annual audit plan and receive their findings and reports of the 
annual audit and interim review;

independence and objectivity, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the audit process, together with the attendant 
recommendation for reappointment. 
Key issues covered by the Committee are reported to the subsequent meeting of the Board, and the Board also 
receives copies of the minutes of each meeting.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The Audit and Risk Committee’s performance was assessed as part of the Board’s annual effectiveness review. It was 
concluded that the Committee operated effectively. In response to the findings of the review, Committee members will 
work closely with management and KPMG to address the forthcoming period of transition, including a new lead audit 
partner and a new Committee Chairman, from the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. During the year, the Committee plans 
to focus on a number of key issues and in particular, review the Group risk appetite and continue to assess the major 
risks to the business. 
The Committee also undertakes a review of its terms of reference and composition each year. This review last took 
place in November 2016, and the full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the Company’s website, 
at: investors.sophos.com. 
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
58 SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
The issues considered by the Committee that are deemed to be significant to the Group are set out below.
Revenue recognition The Group generates revenue from sales of the Group’s Network and Enduser 
products through subscriptions, hardware and the rendering of enhanced support 
or professional services. There is a risk that revenue is inappropriately recognised if 
revenue is incorrectly apportioned to a product or service.
The Group has a revenue recognition policy in place that details the application of 
relevant standards to the products and services sold by the Group. The policy includes 
rules for applying fair value to components of multiple element arrangements and 
timing of recognition dependent upon the individual nature of the goods or services 
sold. At half-year and year-end management also provide to the Committee an 
accounting paper on revenue recognition, any changes arising from updated standards, 
and a commentary on the revenue recognised. The Group’s external auditors have also 
reported to the Committee that they have reviewed the revenue recognition policy and 
processes as well as performing detailed testing of revenue recognition across the year 
and found revenue to be appropriately accounted for.
Having provided appropriate challenge to management and the external auditors, the 
Committee has concluded that the revenue recognition for the Group is appropriate.
Reporting requirements 
and presentation
The Group makes use of certain non-GAAP measures and discloses certain items 
separately within the consolidated statement of profit or loss as exceptional 
items which, in the opinion of the Directors, enables a better understanding of the 
performance of the Group. The use of these measures and disclosures is judgemental 
in nature.
The use of non-GAAP measures and the classification of certain income statement 
items as exceptional by the Group have been reviewed by the Committee during the 
year with reference to authoritative guidance and regulations as well as through 
discussions with management and external advisors. The Committee is satisfied 
that the use of such measures is appropriate and enhances the understanding of 
the Groups financial performance and its prospects. Furthermore, to ensure such 
measures remain relevant, the Group is proposing a change to the non-GAAP measures 
that it publishes, as explained further in note 6 to the financial statements.
The Committee has also reviewed the disclosures made in this annual report and has 
discussed them with the external auditors; so as to ensure that it is comfortable with 
the content and presentation made in the annual report.
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
During the year, the Committee received and reviewed reports regarding progress on risk management and the 
principal risks identified across the Group. The Committee was satisfied with the risk management process and 
with the relevance of the risks identified. It was also satisfied with the level of assurance provided by the Group’s 
Internal Audit & Risk Management function, which is supported by EY. The Committee has concluded that sound risk 
management and internal control systems have been maintained throughout the year.
During the current year, management have further enhanced the Company’s approach to risk management through 
the alignment of the risk identification and budgetary planning processes. Through this alignment management 
can ensure appropriate and targeted investment by the Company to address and, where appropriate, to control and 
mitigate the identified risks.
Whilst the Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s systems of risk management and internal control, each of 
the individual functional leaders are recognised as key drivers of the process through which risks and uncertainties are 
identified. The Board recognises that rigorous internal control systems are critical to managing risk and fundamental 
to the achievement of its strategic objectives. The Board further acknowledges that these systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk in the Group.
59 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The formal process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group is overseen by the 
RCC in association with the work performed by the Internal Audit & Risk Management function. The RCC has designed 
the risk framework in order to capture and evaluate control weaknesses and risks facing the business. Where the 
Board defines an identified risk as significant, procedures exist to ensure that necessary action is taken to rectify or 
mitigate as appropriate. 
These aforementioned functions provide additional assurance to the Audit and Risk Committee who have ultimate 
responsibility for the oversight and review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls. 
The external auditors provide a supplementary, independent and autonomous perspective on those areas of the 
internal control system which they assess in the course of their work. Their findings are regularly reported to both the 
Committee and the Board.
Key elements of the control environment are:
• Annual budgets and strategic plans performed for all business units and the Group as a whole 
• Monitoring of performance against budget and subsequent forecasts with reporting to the Board on a regular basis
• Monthly review of detailed key performance indicators 
• All contracts are reviewed at a level of detail appropriate to the size and complexity of the contract
• Timely reconciliations are performed for all significant balance sheet accounts
• Clearly defined organisational structure and authorisation lines
• The management Risk and Compliance Committee that oversees the risk management process
• The Board Audit and Risk Committee that approves audit plans and assesses the overall appropriateness of the 
Group’s internal control environment
The preparation and issue of financial reports is managed by the Group’s finance department, as delegated by 
the Board. The Group’s financial reporting process is controlled using the Group accounting policies and reporting 
systems. The Group finance department supports all reporting entities with guidance on the preparation of financial 
information. Each legal entity has a Finance Director or Controller who has responsibility and accountability for 
providing information which is in accordance with agreed policies. The financial information for each entity is subject 
to a review at reporting entity and Group level by the Chief Financial Officer alongside the Vice President of Finance. 
The Annual Report is reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee in advance of presentation to the Board for approval. 
Additionally, the Finance Director or Controller of the reporting entity completes a self-certified quarterly Financial 
Reporting Review Questionnaire which is used to identify control strengths and weaknesses across all financial areas 
with any weaknesses being subsequently addressed.
The Group also maintains a consolidated Risk Register which sets out the nature and extent of the significant risks 
facing the Group. Each of the risks are prioritised according to likelihood of occurrence and potential impact to 
the Group and the register ensures that all risks are identified, measured and either mitigated or managed by an 
appropriate owner.
The Directors, through the use of appropriate procedures, systems and the employment of competent personnel, have 
ensured that measures are in place to secure compliance with the Company’s obligation to keep adequate accounting 
records. The accounting records are kept at the registered office of the Company.
HOW WE MANAGE RISK
The Sophos Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring effective identification, assessment and management of 
risk across the Group. Central to the risk management process is the Group’s culture of openness, transparency and 
accountability.
The Internal Audit & Risk Management function manages and drives the risk management framework and operates 
on an independent basis providing further assurance to the Board around risk management. The risk management 
framework enables a robust assessment of risk appropriate to the achievement of the business strategy, as well as 
being simple and easy to follow to ensure it is embedded into the day-to-day business processes across the Group in 
order to facilitate risk awareness. This function also ensures that all relevant and significant risks identified across the 
business are mapped to the internal audit plan for the year.

On a quarterly basis, the RCC reviews the status of risk exposures and risk management throughout the business as 
managed by the Internal Audit & Risk Management function. The RCC is a committee of senior leaders authorised by 
the Board to provide an additional level of assurance to the Audit and Risk Committee in overseeing risk management 
and internal control activities. On behalf of the Board, the Committee reviews and challenges the effectiveness of the 
risk management process.
The Group takes a two-pronged approach to identifying risks:
1)  A bottom-up approach at the business function level; these risks are managed at the operational level with an 
appropriately defined escalation process in place for those risks rated as high.
2)  A top-down approach at the senior leadership team level; these are the principal risks which could have a serious 
impact on the strategic business plan of the Group and may encompass several of the risks identified in the 
bottom-up approach.
A series of risk identification approaches are used such as risk identification and horizon scanning workshops; 
interviews and inclusion of risk discussions in team meetings. Risk registers are fully owned at the business function 
level and registers are maintained and reviewed on a quarterly basis.
All identified risks are assessed against our pre-defined scoring matrix and prioritised accordingly. Any risks identified 
in the bottom-up approach deemed to be rated as higher risk are escalated in line with pre-defined escalation 
procedures for further evaluation.
Following the identification of risks, a risk management plan is developed and implemented; this is managed by the 
assigned risk owner with regular feedback to the RCC.
Regular reporting of risk management ensures each risk is re-evaluated on a timely basis to ensure that all relevant 
risks are identified and managed appropriately and that the Board is focused on the principal risks identified.
WHISTLEBLOWING
A whistleblowing policy is in place in the Group enabling employees to confidentially report matters of concern directly 
to Non-Executive Directors. The Committee receives details of any matters raised.
61 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
INTERNAL AUDIT
EY continue to support the Sophos Internal Audit & Risk Management function. The Group’s Chief Financial Officer 
provides oversight and coordination of Internal Audit with support from the RCC. In order to ensure independence, the 
Internal Audit function has a direct reporting line to the Committee and its Chairman. 
The nature and scope of the Internal Audit plan using a risk-based approach, was approved by the Committee, with 
any subsequent changes to the plan requiring further approval. The results of the audits were assessed alongside 
responses from management. Any outcomes graded as requiring improvement were considered in detail by the 
Committee along with the appropriateness of mitigation plans to resolve the issues identified.
At each meeting, the Committee received audit reports and updates from the Internal Auditors, in order to ascertain 
progress in completing the internal audit plan and to review results of the audits. The Internal Audit plan continues to 
be developed through a review of formal risk assessments, together with consideration of the Group’s key business 
processes and functions that could be subject to audit. The Committee have monitored and reviewed the scope and 
results of the Internal Auditors’ activities as well as the effectiveness of Internal Audit during the financial year.
REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS
The Board, through the Committee, has reviewed and considered the effectiveness of the risk management and 
system of internal controls in operation across the Group. 
The main objectives of the Group’s internal control systems are:
• To ensure its aims and objectives are met
• To ensure adherence to management policies
• To ensure compliance with statutory requirements
• To safeguard assets
• To ensure the relevance, reliability and integrity of information, so ensuring as far as possible the completeness 
and accuracy of records
Any system of control can only ever provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that control weaknesses or 
irregularities do not exist, or that there is no risk of material errors, losses, fraud, or breaches of laws or regulations. 
Accordingly, the Group is continually seeking to improve the effectiveness of its systems of internal control.
The Committee has concluded that the Group’s risk management and system of internal controls is deemed effective. 
This is informed by a number of sources:
• The audit work undertaken by the Internal Audit function during this financial year
• Risk management procedures managed and overseen by the Risk and Compliance Committee 
• Reports issued by the Group’s external auditors
A detailed review of the Group’s management of each principle risk or uncertainty is explained on pages 34 to 37.
62 EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations with regard to the appointment and reappointment of 
the external auditors. In making these recommendations, consideration is given to auditor effectiveness and 
independence, partner rotation and any other factors that may impact the reappointment of the external auditors. 
There are no contractual restrictions on the choice of external auditors and the Committee considers on an annual 
basis the need for a formal tender process in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Group’s auditors, KPMG LLP, were appointed for the year-ended 31 March 2001 with the audit engagement 
partner rotation last occurring for the year-ended 31 March 2011. As the Group listed during the prior financial year, 
in accordance with Ethical Standard 3, the audit engagement partner could continue to serve for not more than two 
years after the listing occurred with a maximum term of seven years in total. On that basis the audit engagement 
partner is to be rotated for the year-ending 31 March 2018.
The external auditors may perform certain non-audit services for the Group, any such non-audit services require 
pre-approval by the Audit and Risk Committee and are only permitted to the extent allowed by relevant laws 
and regulations. 
During the year-ended 31 March 2017 the non-audit services provided by KPMG related primarily to tax compliance 
activities. In the year-ended 31 March 2016, the non-audit services provided by KPMG primarily related to their role 
as reporting accountant for the Initial Public Offering of the Company’s shares and as a result their non-audit fees 
exceeded their audit fees for that year. Non-audit fees for the year ended 31 March 2017 were 33 percent of the audit 
and audit related fees, in the year-ended 31 March 2016, excluding fees associated with the Initial Public Offering, the 
non-audit fees were 47 percent of the audit and audit-related fees. Full details of auditor remuneration is shown in note 
9 to the Financial Statements.
REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS
An important role of the Committee is to assess the effectiveness of the external audit process. In performing this 
assessment the Committee:
• reviewed the annual audit plan and considered the auditors performance against that plan along with any 
variations to it;
• met with the audit engagement partner to review the audit findings and responses received to questions raised by 
the Committee;
• held regular meetings with the audit engagement partner, including with the absence of executive management;
• considered their length of tenure; 
• reviewed the nature and magnitude of non-audit services provided; and
• reviewed the external auditors own independence confirmation presented to the Committee.
Based on the assessment performed, the Committee has recommended to the Board that a resolution to reappoint 
KPMG LLP be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting.

DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE
64 DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
As Chairman of Sophos’ Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year-ended 31 March 2017 which has been prepared by the Committee and approved by the Board. In line with the UK 
reporting regulations, this report is divided into three sections:
• The Annual Statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman;
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2016 Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) and details of Sophos’ remuneration policies and their link to Group strategy, as well as projected pay 
outcomes under various performance scenarios; and
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, which focuses on our remuneration arrangements and incentive outcomes 
for the year under review and how the Committee intends to implement the Remuneration Policy in FY18.
We will be seeking shareholder approval for the Annual Report on Remuneration at the AGM on 7 September 2017.
REMUNERATION DECISIONS IN FY17
Sophos achieved strong results in the year-ended 31 March 2017, with billings of $632 million and cash EBITDA of 
$150 million. As a result, Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray will receive bonuses of 110 percent and 88 percent of salary, 
respectively. 
During the year, Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray were granted awards of 500 percent and 390 percent of salary, 
respectively, under the Sophos Group Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 (“LTIP”) in the form of performance share units 
(75 percent of the awards) vesting over three years subject to achievement of annual billings and cash EBITDA targets 
and in the form of restricted share units (25 percent of the awards) vesting over four years subject to continued 
employment only. No performance share units were due to vest in the year under review.
REMUNERATION FOR FY18
Following a review of Group performance and their personal contribution, the salaries of the Executive Directors will 
be increased by 3 percent, effective from 1 July 2017. This is in line with the average increase expected for the wider 
employee population (c.4 percent).
The Committee will operate the annual bonus on the same basis as in FY17. Billings and EBITDA targets have been set by 
the Committee and will require Executive Directors to deliver significant stretch performance to achieve full payout. The 
bonus will continue to be paid in cash.
In FY18, the Committee intends to grant long-term incentive awards to Executive Directors in line with the stated 
remuneration policy and using the same measures as were used in FY17 (billings and cash EBITDA). Awards will be 
made over performance share units (at least 75 percent of the total award) and restricted shares, within the normal 
policy limits.
SHAREHOLDER CONSULTATION
The Remuneration Committee consulted with a number of our major shareholders in advance of the 2016 AGM to 
provide additional context surrounding our remuneration arrangements, recognising that a number of features are out 
of line with typical UK market practice. We believe that this contributed to a number of the votes against both our Policy 
and implementation of that remuneration framework last year. The Committee values all of our shareholders’ feedback 
and we have provided additional rationale for our remuneration arrangements below. Sophos is also committed to 
improving the disclosure in our remuneration reporting, in particular in the disclosure of our short and long-term 
incentive targets. Details of the result on the binding vote on the remuneration policy and the advisory vote on the 2016 
Annual Report on Remuneration are set out on page 85 of this report.
The policy approved by our shareholders at the 2016 AGM was broadly unchanged from that outlined in our IPO 
prospectus, and our remuneration arrangements reflect that we compete for talent in a competitive market against 
other high-technology US West Coast companies. A number of our shareholders highlighted that the linking of some 
of our long-term incentive (25 percent of the total) to time-only vesting shares is not typical FTSE market practice. 
The Committee has been conscious of UK institutional investors’ preference for packages to be weighted towards 
performance-related pay. However we believe that an element of the long-term incentive in restricted stock was 
necessary to provide a competitive package of fixed and variable pay that will enable the Group to attract and retain 
executives in the relevant geographies with the right skills and experience to drive the long-term success of the 
Company. We believe that, in addition to the performance-based long-term incentive awards, the exposure to the 
share price in combination with shareholding guidelines (and the fact that our Executive Directors hold shares in 
excess of these guidelines) provides further alignment with shareholders’ interests.
ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE REMUNERATION  
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
65 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For FY16, FY17 and FY18, cash EBITDA and billings were considered to be the best measures of the Group’s 
performance given our current size and stage of growth. The Committee is aware of some shareholders’ concerns 
regarding using the same measures for both the short-term and long-term incentives, and will keep the selection of 
measures under review. We may make changes for future incentive cycles as the profile of the business changes.
With regards to our incentive opportunities, awards are calibrated to be competitive in the same market as other 
high-technology companies on the US West Coast, where a number of the Company’s executives, including our CEO, 
are located. The Committee has reviewed benchmarks against both US and UK companies, and believes incentive 
opportunities have been set at the appropriate level to be competitive in the relevant markets, balanced with the fact 
that we are UK-listed.
Whilst our Remuneration Policy is not due for renewal until the 2018 AGM, the Committee continues to monitor 
developments in remuneration governance, market practice and, most importantly, our shareholders views and will 
make adjustments to our remuneration arrangements, if appropriate.
The Committee is aware of recent developments in remuneration governance, including some shareholders’ 
preference for post-exit share ownership guidelines and the BEIS consultation on the CEO to employee pay ratios. The 
Committee will continue to monitor market trends and developments over the next year in order to assess ongoing 
relevance for the Company’s remuneration practices. The Committee welcomes feedback from our shareholders, as 
we remain committed to an open and transparent dialogue, and hope to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE REMUNERATION  
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CONTINUED
This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) on behalf of the Board, takes account of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the latest Investment Association, ISS and PLSA guidelines, and has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The Act requires the Auditor to report to the Company’s Shareholders on the audited information within this report and to 
state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been prepared in accordance with the Act. The Auditor’s opinion is set out on pages 
96 to 99 and those aspects of the report that have been subject to audit are clearly marked. 
66 This section describes the Group’s remuneration policy for Directors which applies for up to three years from approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 14 September 2016.
The overarching principles of the remuneration policy are to provide a competitive package of fixed and variable pay 
that will enable the Group to ensure it has executives with the right skills and experience to drive the success of the 
Company, and that their remuneration is linked to shareholder interests and the Company’s long-term success. The 
remuneration philosophy is:
• to promote the long-term success of the Company, with stretching performance targets which are rigorously applied;
• to provide appropriate alignment between the Company’s strategic goals, shareholder returns and executive 
reward; and
• to have a competitive mix of base salary and short and long-term incentives, with an appropriate proportion of the 
package determined by stretching targets linked to the Company’s performance.
Executive Directors’ fixed and variable remuneration arrangements have been determined taking into account:
• the role, experience in the role, and performance of the Executive Director;
• the location in which the Executive Director is working;
• remuneration arrangements at UK listed companies of a similar size and complexity;
• remuneration arrangements at US high-technology companies of a similar size and complexity, including 
companies with which the Company competes for talent; and
• best practice guidelines for UK listed companies set by institutional investor bodies.

Variable pay: Long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”)
Aligns the 
interests of 
executives with 
shareholders in 
growing the value 
of the business 
over the long-term.
The plan provides for annual 
awards of restricted shares, 
options and performance 
shares to eligible 
participants. Other than for 
restricted shares, vesting 
is based on three-year 
performance. 
The Committee has 
discretion to reduce 
any unvested long-term 
incentive awards, or to 
vary the opportunities 
for future awards, in 
the case of serious 
financial misstatement or 
misconduct. In extreme 
cases of misconduct, the 
Committee may claw back

awards.
Participants are eligible to 
receive cash or shares equal 
to the value of dividends that 
would have been paid over 
the vesting period on shares 
that vest.
Awards may be made up 
to a maximum of 500 
percent of salary in normal 
circumstances and up to 
750 percent in exceptional 
circumstances (including, but 
not limited to, recruiting an 
individual). The award size is 
reviewed in advance of grant.
No performance-based awards 
will vest below threshold. Up 
to 25 percent of each element 
will vest for achievement of 
threshold performance under 
each metric, then increase 
on a straight-line basis to full 
vesting for achieving stretch 
performance.
It is anticipated that no more 
than 25 percent of aggregate 
awards in any one year will 
be over restricted shares or

Performance-based 
awards will vest 
on achievement of 
financial performance 
measures, measured 
over a three-year 
performance period, 
which may include 
profit measures and 
billings.
Performance-based 
awards: profit will 
receive a weighting

years to help capture 
the strategic goals of 
the business and may

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
This policy is unchanged in substance since approval at the AGM on 14 September 2016. Other than minor text 
changes to ensure this policy remains clear for the reader, a few other minor changes have been made to provide 
additional clarity, including updated scenario charts shown below.
PERFORMANCE MEASURE SELECTION AND APPROACH TO TARGET SETTING
EBITDA and billings are considered to be the best measures of the Group’s annual performance given the current size 
and stage of growth, and will continue to determine annual bonus vesting. The Committee will keep this under review, 
and may select alternative measures as the Group evolves and strategic priorities change.
Annual bonus targets will be selected prior to, or shortly after, the start of the financial period. Financial targets will be 
calibrated with reference to the Group’s budget for the upcoming financial period and the Group’s performance over 
the prior financial period.
Threshold and stretch performance levels for performance-based awards under the LTIP will be set at the start of 
the three-year performance period. The Committee aims to set stretching but achievable targets, taking account of 
a range of reference points, including market consensus and the Group’s strategic plan.
DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY OPERATED FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES
Other employee remuneration has the same components as set out in the policy, being base salary, annual bonus, 
long-term incentive participation, pension, life assurance and benefit provision. Annual bonus and long-term incentive 
arrangements share a similar structure and pay-out arrangement, although the mix between performance-based and 
time-based awards, and the maximum award, varies by seniority and role.
OTHER
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the 
approval and implementation of the policy detailed in this report will be honoured, this includes awards made to 
Directors (both Executive and Non-Executive) prior to IPO.
PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS
The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for Executive Directors, and the 
potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios; 
‘Minimum’, ‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
72 The potential reward opportunities illustrated are based on the policy approved at the AGM on 14 September 2016, 
applied to the base salaries in force at 1 April 2017. The projected value of LTIP amounts excludes the impact of share 
price movement or dividend accrual. The assumptions made in illustrating potential reward opportunities are shown in

APPROACH TO REMUNERATION FOR NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR APPOINTMENTS
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all the 
existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum 
opportunity
Base salary
The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the 
experience and skills of the individual, relevant market data and their 
current basic salary.
n/a
Pension
Membership of pension scheme or salary supplement on a similar basis to 
other executives, as described in the policy table. Other than in exceptional 
cases (such as to replace existing arrangements for new recruits) the 
Committee does not anticipate pension benefits as being at a cost to the 
Company that would exceed 20 percent of base salary.
In line with  
Policy Table.
Benefits
New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the 
policy which may include (but are not limited to) car allowance, 
medical insurance and life insurance.
n/a
Annual bonus
The structure described in the policy table will apply to new 
appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the 
proportion of employment over the year.
200 percent of  
base salary.
LTIP
New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar 
terms as other executives, as described in the policy table.
Up to 750 percent  
of base salary.
All-employee 
schemes
New appointees may be eligible to participate in all-employee 
schemes on the same basis as other employees.
In line with 
Policy Table.
73 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In determining appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders. In addition to 
the remuneration arrangements set out above, the Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment 
to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, using Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if necessary. In 
doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these 
awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. The fair value 
of any buy out will not exceed that of the award being foregone.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the approach will be consistent with the 
policy for external appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their 
promotion to Board level, the Group will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive opportunities for below 
Board employees are no higher than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary.
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 71.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND EXIT PAYMENT POLICY
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The appointments of each of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are for a fixed term of three years and 
subject to annual re-election by the Company at the AGM. Their letters of appointment set out the terms of their 
appointment and are available for inspection upon request. They are not eligible to participate in the annual bonus, nor 
do they receive any additional pension or benefits (other than nominal travel expenses) on top of the fees disclosed on 
page 83. Non-Executive Directors appointment may be terminated at any time upon written notice or in accordance 
with the articles and receive no compensation on termination.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
74 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
On 11 June 2015, each of the Executive Directors entered into a service agreement with the Company, which are 
available for inspection upon request. 
Executive Director Role Appointment date Term of appointment
Kris Hagerman Chief Executive Officer 11 June 2015 12 months
Nick Bray Chief Financial Officer 11 June 2015 12 months
The Employer is entitled to terminate an Executive Director’s employment by payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice, 
equal to (i) the basic salary that would have been payable, and (ii) the cost that would have been incurred in providing the 
Executive Director with medical insurance benefits for any unexpired portion of the notice period (the ‘‘Payment in Lieu’’). 
The Company can alternatively choose to continue providing the medical insurance benefits under item (ii) instead of 
paying a cash sum representing their cost. The Payment in Lieu will be paid in monthly instalments over the notice period.
In specified circumstances (not involving a change of control, in which case the severance payment applicable is 
as described below), each Executive Director is entitled to terminate his employment without notice and receive a 
severance payment. The severance payment will be equal to the Payment in Lieu and paid in a single lump sum. The 
specified circumstances are where either: (a) the Employer terminates or gives notice to terminate the Executive 
Director’s employment without cause; or (b) the Executive Director terminates his employment in response to: a material 
diminution of his authority, duties, responsibilities or status in a manner inconsistent with his service agreement; a 
breach of a fundamental term of his service agreement; a material reduction in his annual basic salary or target bonus 
opportunity; or being required to relocate his place of work beyond a specified distance (each a ‘‘Good Leaver Reason’’).
Each Executive Director is entitled to a severance payment, paid in a single lump sum, in the event of a termination of his 
employment by his Employer without cause or by the Executive Director for a Good Leaver Reason at any time during a 
period ending 18 months after any change of control of the Company (whether by way of a general offer or a scheme of 
arrangement or compromise) and beginning three months prior to the announcement of such general offer or scheme 
of arrangement or compromise. The severance payment will be equal to the sum of: (i) 150 percent of the Executive 
Director’s annual basic salary; (ii) 150 percent of the Executive Director’s target bonus for the Company’s financial year 
in which the termination occurs; and (iii) the total cost of providing the Executive Director with the benefits (including 
pension contributions) to which he is entitled under his service agreement for a period of 12 months. 
The Group’s change of control provisions are standard practice in the US (where many of the Group’s executives, including 
the CEO, are located) and to renegotiate contracts would likely represent an increased cost for the Company (where this 
provision may never be triggered). For future hires, the Committee will consider the appropriateness of the contractual 
provisions at that time, taking into account prevailing market practice in the geography that the executive is located.
75 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into account the executive’s contractual terms, the circumstances of termination and any duty to mitigate. The table 
below summarises how incentives are typically treated in different circumstances: 
Reason for leaving Treatment
Bonus
Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse.
Good leaver Eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have been 
satisfied, pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served, with 
Committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Change of control Eligible for an award to the extent that performance conditions have 
been satisfied up to the change of control, pro-rated for the proportion of 
the financial year served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise. 
Executives may be eligible for an enhanced bonus payment in the case of 
termination of employment within 18 months of a change of control, as 
described above.
Long-term incentives
Summary dismissal, resignation Awards lapse.
Good leaver Outstanding awards will normally be pro-rated to the date of leaving, with 
Committee discretion to treat otherwise and with discretion to either test at 
the end of relevant performance periods, or immediately assess, whether or 
not relevant performance criteria have been met.
Change of control Outstanding awards will normally vest and be tested for performance over 
the period to change of control, and be pro-rated for time based on the 
proportion of the period served, with Committee discretion to treat otherwise. 
Executives may be eligible for additional vesting in the case of termination of 
employment within 18 months of a change of control.
All-employee schemes
Treated in line with applicable scheme rules
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Chairman, provided that 
such appointments do not prejudice the executive’s ability to fulfil their duties for the Group. Any fees for outside 
appointments would normally be retained by the Director.
CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN GROUP
The Committee takes into account the general basic salary increase being offered to employees elsewhere in the 
Group when annually reviewing the salary increases and remuneration for the Executive Directors. Employees have 
not been consulted in respect of the design of the Group’s senior executive remuneration policy.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee takes shareholder feedback into careful consideration when reviewing remuneration and regularly 
reviews the Remuneration policy in the context of key institutional shareholder guidelines and best practice. It 
is the Committee’s policy to consult with major shareholders prior to making any major changes to its executive 
remuneration structure.

All appointments stated are as at 31 March 2017
The composition of the Committee is in compliance with the Code, which provides that its members should comprise 
at least three independent non-executive directors and that the Chairman of the Group may be a member, but 
not chair, of the Committee due to his independence at the time of his appointment. The Committee is chaired by 
Paul Walker, the Senior Independent Director. The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and attends 
all meetings. Other attendees at Committee meetings may differ from time to time and, upon invitation from the 
Committee, include the Chief Executive and other members of the senior management team, but they are not present 
when their own remuneration is set.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s Remuneration policy and practices having regard for relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
associated guidance.
The key responsibilities of the Committee include, to:
• determine and monitor the remuneration policy for the Chairman, Executive Directors and the senior management 
team it is designated to consider; 
• ensure that the remuneration policy and reward decisions support the Sophos business strategy and sustainable 
long-term performance;
• set specific remuneration packages which include salary, annual bonus, share incentives, pension and benefits;
• review the Executive Directors’ service contracts;
• review remuneration trends across the Group and in the market in which Sophos operates; and
• approve employee share-based incentive plans and associated performance conditions and targets.
MAIN ACTIVITIES
The Committee has an annual forward agenda, developed from its terms of reference, with standing items that the 
Committee considers at each meeting, in addition to any specific matters arising, and topical business or governance 
items on which the Committee has chosen to focus. The work of the Committee undertaken during the year is 
summarised throughout this Report.
EXTERNAL ADVISERS
Kepler, a brand of Mercer (“Kepler”), independent remuneration consultants appointed by the Committee in FY16 after 
consultation with the Board, continued to act as the remuneration adviser to the Committee during the year. Kepler 
reports directly to the Committee Chairman and is a signatory to and abides by the Code of Conduct for Remuneration 
Consultants (which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). The fees paid to Kepler in respect of 
work carried out for the Remuneration Committee in FY17 totalled £41,621. Kepler (or any other part of the MMC Group 
of companies) does not provide other services to the Company. The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically 
to ensure that Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advice provided is impartial and objective. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Kepler is independent.
77 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The Remuneration Committee’s performance was assessed as part of the Board’s annual effectiveness review. It was 
concluded that the Committee operated effectively. In response to the findings of the review, Committee members will 
continue to give significant weight to shareholder sentiment whilst balancing this with the recruitment and retention 
needs of the business.
The Committee also undertakes a review of its terms of reference and composition each year. This review last took 
place in November 2016 and the full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the Company’s website, 
at https:/ /investors.sophos.com

BASE SALARY
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray, who were each 
awarded an increase of 3 percent, effective 1 July 2017. The salaries of the Executive Directors are as follows:
Executive Director 1 July 2017 1 July 2016 Increase %
Kris Hagerman $721,000 $700,000 3
Nick Bray £293,000 £284,000 3 
PENSION AND BENEFITS
Kris Hagerman receives medical and dental insurance, travel insurance, life and disability insurance, a reimbursement

savings plan for all US employees, is entitled to receive a matching contribution of up to three percent of his salary, 
subject to any annual maximum contribution applicable to US 401(k) savings plans from time to time. For 2017, this 
annual maximum is US$24,000.
Nick Bray is entitled to receive up to five percent of his base salary as a contribution to a group personal pension scheme. 
In FY17 he also received an annual car allowance of £10,000 (paid monthly), life insurance, private medical and critical 
illness insurance, travel insurance, personal accident insurance and employee assistance programme arrangements.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
78 ANNUAL BONUS
ANNUAL BONUS FOR FY17
The Group operates an annual performance-related bonus scheme for a number of senior executives including 
Executive Directors. Bonus opportunities for FY17 were 200 percent of salary for Kris Hagerman and 160 percent of 
salary for Nick Bray. Target bonus was 50 percent of the maximum opportunity.
The level of annual bonus earned in any one year is based on Group performance against predetermined financial 
targets for the year and personal performance. In FY17, the bonus was based 80 percent on billings and EBITDA, 
as defined by the scheme rules, with 12.5 percent of maximum vesting for threshold performance and 50 percent 
for target performance, and 20 percent on personal performance. No bonus is awarded for performance below the 
threshold. The financial element payout is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, so to 
achieve any vesting of this element, executives were required to perform on both billings and EBITDA.
Following consultation with shareholders, the Committee has worked to improve disclosure of retrospective annual 
bonus targets. The financial targets for the FY17 annual bonus are no longer considered commercially sensitive, 
and are disclosed in full, alongside performance against these targets, below.

Implied vesting 
(percent of 
maximum)
Billings $595 $642 $770 $649 53
EBITDA $142 $153 $184 $155 53
Performance was measured using constant currency exchange rates. For levels of performance between the points 
set out in the table above, bonus payout was determined on a straight-line, pro-rata basis. The overall bonus payout 
was based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and EBITDA, and was therefore 53 percent of maximum for 
the financial element. After taking into account personal performance, including strong financial delivery, supporting 
talent retention and succession planning, and delivery of key products into the marketplace in line with the product 
strategy, Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray will receive bonuses of 110 percent and 88 percent of salary, respectively. 
The entire bonus in respect of FY17 will be paid in cash. The bonus calculations for FY17 is illustrated below:

79 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL BONUS FOR FY16
For FY16, the level of annual bonus earned was based on Group performance against predetermined billings and 
EBITDA, as defined by the scheme rules, targets for the year. In last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration the 
Committee committed to disclose the targets for FY16 at the end of the 31 March 2017 financial year. The targets 
set for FY16 are no longer considered commercially sensitive and are disclosed in full below, along with performance 
against those targets:

Plan targets were adjusted for acquisitions in the year and performance was measured using constant currency 
exchange rates. For levels of performance between the points set out in the table above, bonus payout was 
determined on a straight-line, pro-rata basis. The overall bonus payout was based on the lower of the implied payouts 
for billings and EBITDA, and was therefore 58 percent of maximum. After taking into account personal performance, 
Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray received bonuses of 116 percent and 92 percent of salary, respectively. All of the bonus

2. Based on salary as at 1 July 2016.
The RSU awards are not subject to future performance conditions, and will vest over four years, subject to continued 
employment, with 25 percent of the awards vesting on 14 June 2017 and the remainder vesting on a quarterly basis 
thereafter until 14 June 2020.
The PSU awards vest subject to the vesting outcome implied by performance against annual targets over the three 
years to the financial year-ended 31 March 2019, with the award vesting (to the extent that targets are met) on the 
third anniversary of grant. Targets for the three years are set at the start of the performance period. For FY16 and FY17 
awards, vesting is based on the lower of the implied payouts for billings and cash EBITDA (i.e. the measures are equally 
weighted), with 25 percent vesting for threshold performance, 100 percent for stretch performance, with up to an 
additional 25 percent vesting for performance between a super stretch target and maximum target. The face value of 
awards in the table above are calculated after application of the potential opportunity above the super stretch target. 
No awards will vest for performance below the threshold. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
80 PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR OUTSTANDING PSU AWARDS
The Committee believes that disclosing the individual annual financial performance targets for FY18 and  
FY19 in this report would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage to its international and privately held 
competitors, which are not subject to similar disclosure requirements. In response to feedback from our shareholders 
in advance of the 2016 AGM, the Committee recognises shareholders request for improved disclosure of long-term 
incentive performance targets. Therefore, below is disclosed on a retrospective basis the annual financial targets,  
and performance against these targets, for PSU awards made in 2015 and 2016.

81 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DILUTION LIMITS
It is proposed that Sophos will continue to manage dilution within the context of maintaining award levels within a 10 
percent limit over five years, the limit that has applied since our incentive plans were approved at IPO. The Committee 
is aware that this is higher than the limit adopted by many UK companies and preferred by many institutional 
investors of 5 percent over ten years in respect of discretionary awards and 10 percent over ten years in respect of 
all schemes. The Committee believes the higher limit we operate is necessary in part because of the broad-based 
nature of our equity plans, under which shares are provided to a large proportion of our employees (including SAYE 
and ESPP schemes open to most employees) and are a key part of the Group’s employee compensation package, and 
reflects the need to be able to compete with other US and international companies for the high-calibre employees and 
executives required to secure Sophos’ future success.
Current dilution under all our incentive schemes is c.5.5 percent, and reflects the front-loaded approach to incentive 
grants following our IPO.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
82 REMUNERATION FOR FY18
BASE SALARY
Salaries for Kris Hagerman and Nick Bray, effective from 1 July 2017, will be $721,000 and £293,000, respectively. 
This equates to an increase of 3 percent, which is in line with average increase awarded to the broader employee 
population of c.4 percent.
PENSION AND BENEFITS
In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Executive Directors will receive pension contributions of 3-5 percent of salary. 
They will also receive benefits in line with the policy.
ANNUAL BONUS
For the year-ending 31 March 2018, the Committee will operate the annual bonus using the same framework and 
measures as used in FY17. Billings and EBITDA targets have been set by the Committee and will require Executive 
Directors to deliver significant stretch performance to achieve full payout. Given the close link between these targets 
and Sophos’ competitive strategy, these financial targets are considered commercially sensitive and will not be 
disclosed in advance, but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration to 
the extent that the Committee determines that the targets are no longer commercially sensitive.
100 percent of the bonus will be paid in cash. Bonus payments are subject to malus and clawback provisions.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In FY18, the Committee intends to grant long-term incentive awards to Executive Directors in line with the stated 
remuneration policy and using the same measures as were used in FY17 (see above). Awards will be made over 
performance share units (at least 75 percent of the total award) and restricted shares, within the normal policy limits. 
Full details of the awards will be set out in the Annual Report for the year-ended 31 March 2018. LTIP awards are 
subject to malus and clawback provisions.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES (INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN)
With effect from IPO, the fees payable to the Chairman of the Board and other Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) are as

Additional fees: Audit & Risk Committee Chairman $15,000

PAY FOR PERFORMANCE
Under remuneration reporting regulations, companies are required to provide a graph showing the Company’s Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance (share price plus dividends paid) compared with the performance of a 
relevant comparator group since IPO, assuming a nominal £100 investment in both the Company and the comparator 
group at the start of the timeframe. Companies are also required to show the CEO’s single figure of remuneration and 
actual variable pay outcomes over the same period. 
Sophos has chosen to compare its performance against the FTSE250 Index, as the Company became a constituent of 
the index after IPO. The table below details the Chief Executive’s single figure of remuneration and actual variable pay 
outcomes over the same period. As Sophos completed its IPO in July 2015, TSR data and pay disclosure is available

86 As outlined in the IPO prospectus, Kris Hagerman continues to hold share options granted under the Pentagon 
Holdings Management Equity Plan (“MEP”) that were issued prior to IPO. Nick Bray’s (until exercised under the JOE 
agreement in FY16) and Steve Munford’s (until exercised under the JOE agreement in FY17) MEP options (a “Linked 
Option”) were linked to a parallel award under a JOE Agreement. Awards under a JOE agreement entitle the participant 
to call for the transfer to him by the Trustee of the JOE agreement of that part of the beneficial interest in any jointly 
owned shares which vest, upon payment by the participant of a price specified in the JOE Agreement. Rights under 
a JOE Agreement may only be exercised to the extent that a Linked Option has not been exercised and vice versa.
The rules of the MEP provide that 50 percent of a MEP option is subject to time vesting and 50 percent is subject to 
performance vesting. On Admission, 66.2 percent of the awards subject to performance vested. Depending on the 
length of service of a MEP participant, the Company may require that a portion of an option which is vested as to 
performance may only be exercised at a later date.
Steve Munford additionally holds vested share options granted under an option deed with Pentagon Holdings SARL 
on 22 October 2010.
All share options over shares in Pentagon Holdings SARL were exchanged for new options over shares in Sophos Group 
plc as part of the reorganisation of the Group immediately prior to the IPO.
The interests of the Directors in pre-IPO restricted shares as at 31 March 2017 are summarised in the table below.

As outlined in the IPO prospectus certain of the Non-Executive Directors held Restricted Shares, the majority of which 
have now vested. Paul Walker entered into a restricted share agreement on 27 March 2015 (the “Acquisition Date”) 
pursuant to which he acquired 300,000 A shares in Pentagon Holdings SARL. Provided Paul Walker continues as a 
Director of Sophos, the Restricted Shares shall vest in three equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries 
of the Acquisition Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, in accordance with the provisions of the EU 
Market Abuse Regulation (596/2014). 
All Restricted Shares in Pentagon Holdings SARL were exchanged for new shares in Sophos Group plc as part of the 
reorganisation of the Group immediately prior to the IPO.

TRANSFER OF SHARES
The transfer of shares is governed by the Articles which allows any member to transfer certificated shares in any usual 
form or in any other form for which the Board may approve. The Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register a 
transfer of a certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not prevent dealings in the Company 
from taking place on an open and proper basis. The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share 
unless the instrument of transfer is (i) lodged, duly stamped (if stampable), at the office or at another place appointed by 
the Board, accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) in respect of only one class of shares; and 
(iii) in favour of not more than four transferees.

vacancy or as an additional Director.
At every AGM all the Directors at the date of the notice convening the AGM shall retire from office, if the Company does 
not fill the vacancy at the meeting the retiring Director shall, if willing to act, be deemed to have been re-appointed 
unless at the meeting it is resolved not to fill the vacancy or unless a resolution for the re-appointment of the Director 
is put to the meeting and lost.
A person ceases to be a Director as soon as:
(i)   notification is received by the Company from the Director that they are resigning or retiring from office;
(ii)    that person has been absent for more than six consecutive months without permission of the Board and the 
Board resolves that their office be vacated;
(iii)   the person has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a Director and may remain so for more than 
three months; 
(iv)   a bankruptcy order is made against that person;
(v)   a composition is made with that person’s creditors generally in satisfaction of that person’s debts;
(vi)   that person ceases to be a Director by virtue of any provision of the Act or is prohibited from being a Director by 
law; or
(vii)   that person is removed from office pursuant to the Articles.

EMPLOYEES
The Group continues to invest to drive future growth. A key objective of the Group is to achieve a shared commitment 
by all employees to the success of the business. Throughout the Group there is consultation between employees and 
management on matters of mutual interest and information is disseminated through team and Company briefings, an 
intranet and individual development reviews. Employees are encouraged to promote and participate in the progress 
and profitability of the Group through the share option plans and other incentive schemes. 
The Group provides full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements 
of the role can be adequately fulfilled by a disabled person. Where existing employees become disabled it is the Group’s 
policy, wherever practicable, to provide continuing employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide 
training and career development to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
90 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group continues to undertake research and development activity relating to its principal activities. In the year-
ended 31 March 2017, the Group spent 18.6 percent of its billings on research and development (2016: 18.6 percent). 
POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Group’s policy is not to make any political donations. Accordingly, no political donations have been made in either 
the year-ended 31 March 2017 or were made in the year-ended 31 March 2016.
SHARE OPTION PLANS
The Group operates a number of share option plans to motivate and retain staff and align their interests with 
shareholders. Details of these schemes are set out in note 30 to the Financial Statements.
BRANCHES
The Group, through various subsidiaries, has established branches in a number of different countries in which the 
business operates.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Details of the Group’s financial risk management policies and risks are set out in note 27 to the Financial Statements.
AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SHARES AND AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES
The Company did not repurchase shares during the year or make any shares the subject of a charge. At a general 
meeting held on 14 September 2016 the Company was authorised to make market purchases (within the meaning 
of section 693(4)) of the Companies Act 2006) up to 45,236,013 of its own ordinary shares and to issue shares up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £4,523,149. The Company is seeking to renew these authorities at the forthcoming 
AGM, within the limits set out in the AGM Notice.
SHARES HELD IN THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
The Trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust will abstain from voting or exercising any other rights in respect of any shares 
held by them and in which no beneficial interest is held by any beneficiary unless otherwise directed by the Company.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions (“GHG”) disclosures for the Group have been shown for the year-ended 31 March 2017, 
consistent with the Group’s financial year. The calculation of the disclosures has been performed in accordance with 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and using the UK government’s DEFRA conversion factor guidance for 
the year reported.
The Group’s operations that primarily release GHG includes usage of electricity and gas of owned and leased offices, 
business travel and usage of vehicles. The Group reported on its GHG emissions for the first time in the prior-year 
report and, as stated at the time, has been developing its GHG data gathering capabilities. The prior-year reporting 
covered all material operations and locations that included the majority of employees. In the current year the number 
of locations covered has been increased and estimates have been developed to enable reporting for sites where 
direct information was not available, including prior-year data. As a result the information shown in the table below 
for the year-ended 31 March 2016 has been restated to be on a consistent basis with the current-year approach and 
methodology. The Group will continue to build up its GHG reporting capabilities. The Group’s chosen intensity ratio is 
tonnes of CO2 equivalent per million US Dollars of billings as it reflects the impact of the growth of the business with 
emissions and with the strategy of the Group.

91 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOING CONCERN
Having made appropriate enquiries and considered the Group’s forecasts, the Directors consider that the Group has 
sufficient resources to continue for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Financial Statements. Further details regarding the adoption of the going concern basis can be found 
in the viability statement below.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period, taking into account the Group’s current 
position and the potential impacts of the principal risks documented on pages 34 to 37 of the Annual Report. Based 
on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue to operate and to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three years to 31 March 2020.
The Group prepares annually, and on a rolling basis, a strategic plan, which is predicated on a detailed year one 
budget and higher level forecasts thereafter. The output of this plan is used to perform debt and associated covenant 
headroom profile analysis, which includes sensitivity to business as usual risks such as billings and profitability 
impacts. A bottom-up operating plan is prepared on an annual basis for presentation to the Board.
Following assessment of the planning process, the Directors have determined that a three-year period is an 
appropriate period over which to assess the Group’s viability. Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe that the 
Group will not be viable over a longer period; the period of three years has been chosen to provide a greater degree of 
certainty and, in the view of the Directors, provides an appropriate long-term outlook.
In making this viability statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
Where individual principal risks did not impact the future viability of the Group, consideration was given to potential 
principal risk combinations. The process of identifying, assessing and managing our principal risks is described in the 
Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 57 to 63.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There have been no material events from 31 March 2017 to the date of this report.
AUDITORS
KPMG LLP has expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company and accordingly a 
resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors of the Company is to be proposed to the shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and each 
Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make them aware of any 
relevant audit information.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
92 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU; and
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the

RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1. OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED
2. OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (the risk related to the carrying 
value of intangible assets and goodwill noted in our prior year audit opinion has been removed as we no longer 
considered this risk to be one of those having the greatest effect on our audit given the group’s cash generation  
and trading performance in the year and forecast growth):

Report), page 108

and page 116 
(financial

Multiple Element Arrangements:
As the Group expands and product portfolios 
evolve, there can be considerable risk 
associated with recognising revenue on 
contracts containing multiple elements. A 
significant audit risk has been recognised 
with regards to such multiple element 
arrangements as judgement is required 
in allocating the consideration receivable 
to each element of the arrangement. This 
requires the fair value for each separable 
element of the arrangement to be estimated. 
In estimating the relative fair values of each 
element, management make reference 
to list prices of individual elements and 
discounts given on the total contract. This 
judgement could materially affect the 
timing and quantum of revenue and profit 
recognised in each period.
Our procedures included: 
• Fair Value Allocation Control: We evaluated the 
operating effectiveness of the revenue allocation 
control and assessed the appropriateness of the 
Group’s principles in determining the relative fair value 
of each separable element of the arrangement against 
applicable accounting standards; 
• Billings Substantive Sample: We selected a sample 
of Group billings from throughout the year and with 
reference to list prices and discounts given, we 
recalculated the relative fair values of each element 
to assess if the determination of relative fair values of 
each separable element was in in line with Group Policy; 
• Policy: We assessed the Group’s policy in respect of 
fair value allocation and revenue recognition against 
IAS 18 “Revenue”.
• Disclosure: We assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosure about estimation uncertainty regarding 
the determination of fair values of multiple element 
arrangements. 97 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Exceptional 
Expenses & Non-
GAAP Measures

Expenses: ($31.4

$41.9m)

Report), page

Classification of Exceptional Expenses 
and Presentation of Non-GAAP 
Measures:
The Group presents alternative income 
statement measures to operating loss 
for the period within the consolidated 
income statement and throughout the 
Annual Report. The Directors believe that 
the separate identification of exceptional 
items and the presentation of the 
following Non-GAAP measures of Billings 
($632.1m), Cash EBITDA ($150.1m), 
Adjusted operating profit ($38.3m) and 
Unlevered Free Cash Flow ($133.4m), 
provides clear and useful information 
on the Group’s underlying trading 
performance. However, when improperly 
used and presented, these kind of 
measures might prevent the Annual 
Report from being fair, balanced and 
understandable by focusing on only part 
of the performance. The determination 
of whether an item should be separately 
disclosed as an exceptional item requires 
judgement on its nature and incidence, 
and its use along with presentation of 
Non-GAAP measures requires judgement 
as to whether they provide a better 
understanding of the Group’s underlying 
trading performance. Therefore, these  
are key judgement areas on which our 
audit is concentrated.
Our procedures included assessing and challenging 
the judgements made by the Directors of the Group 
regarding their determination of exceptional items  
and the presentation of Non-GAAP measures.  
This included:
• Determination of Exceptional Items: We assessed 
whether, in judging what to include in exceptional 
items, the Directors took appropriate regard to 
guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
on the reporting of exceptional items. We also 
evaluated the presentation and completeness of 
material or unusual transactions for appropriate 
classification within the financial statements by 
assessing whether these items fulfil the criteria to 
require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1 
“Presentation of financial statements”, and whether 
they were consistent with the Group’s definition 
of exceptional items as set out in Note 7. We then 
assessed the application of these principles by 
assessing whether the approach taken to identify 
exceptional items was consistent between gains 
and losses; assessing whether the same category 
of material items are treated consistently each year; 
assessing whether the tax effects of exceptional 
items are explained; by agreeing amounts incurred 
in the year to underlying documentation and 
supporting information; and by using our knowledge 
of the Group’s transactions throughout the audit to 
consider the completeness of exceptional items;
• Presentation and Prominence of Non-GAAP 
Measures: We assessed whether the separate 
disclosure and related commentary of exceptional 
items and alternative Non-GAAP measures of 
Billings, Cash EBITDA, Adjusted operating profit and 
Unlevered Cash Flow throughout the Annual Report 
and Accounts placed disproportionate emphasis 
on those component of performance; whether 
such measures were given meaningful labels that 
are not GAAP terms; whether they were clearly 
described and explained; whether the alternative 
measures provided meaningful measures of 
trading performance; whether adjusted results and 
alternate measures were adequately reconciled to 
IFRS numbers with sufficient prominence given to 
that reconciliation; whether their presentation are in 
line with guidance issued by the FRC and European 
Securities and Markets Authority with respect to 
Alternative Performance Measures; and whether the 
underlying financial information is not other 
wise misleading. Independent Auditor’s Report continued

3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at $5.5m (2016: $4.78m), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group revenue, of which it 
represents 1% (2016: 1%). We consider revenue to be 
the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more 
stable measure year on year than Group Loss before 
tax. We reported to the Audit Committee all corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
$0.25m (2016: $0.235m), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
Of the Group’s 28 (2016: 28) reporting components, we 
subjected 10 (2016: 10) to audits for group reporting 
purposes and 2 (2016: 2) to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures. The latter were not individually significant 
enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, 
but did present specific individual risks that needed to be 
addressed.
The Group team instructed component auditors as 
to the significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant risks detailed above and the information to be 
reported back. The Group team approved the component 
materialities, which ranged from $1m to $3.9m (2016: 
$2.75m to $3.9m), having regard to the mix of size and 
risk profile of the Group across the components. The 
work on 6 of the 12 components (2016: 6 of the 12 
components) was performed by component auditors and 
the rest by the Group team.
The Group team visited 1 (2016: 2) component location 
in Germany (2016: Germany and India). Telephone 
conference meetings were also held with these 
component auditors and all others that were not 
physically visited. At these visits and meetings, the 
findings reported to the Group team were discussed in 
more detail, and any further work required by the Group 
team was then performed by the component auditor.

98 4. OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED 
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in 
those reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE 
DISCLOSURES OF PRINCIPAL RISKS
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the Directors’ Viability Statement on page 92, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, 
and, based on that, the directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the group’s continuing in operation 
over the 3 years to March 2020; or
• the disclosures in note 3.2 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT IN RESPECT 
OF THE MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and 
the Directors’ statement that they consider that 
the annual report and financial statements taken 
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statements, set out on page 92, in 
relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 46 to 53 relating to the company’s compliance 
with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities. 
SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
For the year-ended 31 March 2017
104 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year-ended 31 March 2017
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
REPORTING ENTITY
Sophos Group plc (“the Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company’s registered office 
is Sophos Group plc, The Pentagon, Abingdon Science Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, OX14 3YP, United Kingdom. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year-ended March 31, 2017 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”). The Group is a leading provider of cloud-enabled 
enduser and network security solutions
2 APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING  
STANDARDS (“IFRSs”)
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective. 
The Directors do not anticipate that the IFRSs will have a significant effect on the Group’s consolidated financial 
information:
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2017:
Amendments to IAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows
Amendment to IAS12 – Income Taxes
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2018:
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
Amendments to IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment Transactions
IFRS 15 – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018. The Directors have made an assessment of the impact of the standard on the Group based on the final issued 
version of the standard and the latest authoritative guidance and have concluded that there will be a material impact 
on the Group’s consolidated financial information as a result of the accelerated recognition of certain software revenue 
where the Group has no remaining vendor obligations and the deferral of commissions, including other direct costs, 
and rebates in line with the recognition of revenue. The estimate of this impact on results, had it been effective for 
the reported periods, is an increase in revenue in FY17 of $3.4 million (FY16: $3.0 million) and a decrease in operating 
expenses of $1.2 million (FY16: 0.5 million). Other receivables are estimated to increase by $27.3 million (FY16: 24.5 
million) while deferred revenue would decrease by $24.4 million (FY16: 22.6 million).
IFRS 16 – LEASES
The Directors are still evaluating the impact on the Group of IFRS 16 – Leases, which was issued in January 2016 and 
becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, which for the Group will be the year-ended 
31 March 2020. The Group’s major operating lease expenditure is incurred on property lease rentals as set out in note 
35 “Commitments and contingent liabilities”.
Following adoption of IFRS 16, the Group will recognise a right of use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding financial 
liability to the lessor based on the present value of future lease payments. In the consolidated statement of profit or 
loss, the property lease rentals expenditure will be replaced by amortisation of the ROU asset together with a finance 
expense. Alternative performance measures which exclude amortisation, will benefit from the adoption of IFRS 16 
through the removal of the leasing charge. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, “Net cash flow from operating 
activities” will see an improvement as a result of the amortisation adjustment, with a corresponding increased outflow 
in “Net cash flow from financing activities”.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (“Adopted IFRSs”) as they apply to the Group.
105 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year-ended 31 March 2017
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
3.2 GOING CONCERN
The Group has considerable financial resources together with contracts with a large number of customers and across 
different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
annual financial statements.
Further information regarding the Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 39. Further information 
regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Strategic Report and the notes to the financial statements. In addition, note 27 to the financial statements 
includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
3.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated historical financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention and is 
presented in US Dollars. All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million ($M) unless otherwise indicated. The 
functional currency of Sophos Group plc is US Dollars. The Group uses US Dollars as its presentation currency to 
aid comparability of its financial information with that of its peers and the industry; whose information is generally 
presented in US Dollars.
The accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated historical financial information for the year-ended 
31 March 2017 have been consistently applied to all years presented and are set out below. 
The historical financial information consolidates the financial information of Sophos Group plc and the entities it 
controls (its subsidiaries) at 31 March 2017. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company, using 
consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, 
and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. 
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-Group 
transactions that are recognised in the statement of financial position of the individual reporting entities, are 
eliminated in full on consolidation. 
3.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
The individual historical financial information of each Group company is prepared in the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). Each entity in the Group determines its own 
functional currency and items included in the historical financial information of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency.
In preparing the financial information of the individual companies, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at 
the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. All exchange differences are taken to the Consolidated 
Statement of profit or loss, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group’s 
net investment in a foreign operation. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at 
which time they are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable 
to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate.
106 On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency (US Dollars) 
at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into US Dollars at the 
prior month closing rate to that in which the transaction took place because they approximate the rate of exchange 
at the transaction dates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of entities whose 
functional currency is not US Dollars, together with differences arising from the translation of the net results at 
average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are taken to equity. 
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred accumulated amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign 
operation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
3.5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of historical financial information requires Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and 
expenses during the period. The nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies described in this note, Directors have made the following 
judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are discussed below:
Revenue
The Group sells software products under fixed term contracts and perpetual licences. Where there is a multi-element 
arrangement, the consideration receivable is allocated to each element of the arrangement and this is done on the 
basis of an estimate of their respective fair values. In determining the relative fair values of each element, Directors 
make reference to current prices of individual elements and adjust this by its relative share of discounts applied to the 
entire sale. See note 5
Classification of exceptional items and presentation of Non-GAAP measures
Directors exercise their judgement in the classification of certain items as exceptional and outside of the Group’s 
underlying results. The determination of whether an item should be separately disclosed as an exceptional item or 
other adjustments requires judgement on its materiality, nature and incidence, as well as whether it provides clarity on 
the Group’s underlying trading performance. In exercising this judgement, Directors take appropriate regard of IAS 1 
“Presentation of financial statements’’ as well as guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council and the European 
Securities and Market Authority on the reporting of exceptional items and alternative performance measures. The 
overall goal of the Directors is to present the Group’s underlying performance without distortion from one-off or non-
trading events regardless of whether they be favourable or unfavourable to the underlying result. Further details of the 
individual exceptional items, and the reasons for their disclosure treatment, are set out in note 7.
Share-based payment transactions 
The fair value of employee share options issued to third parties are measured using the Black-Scholes model. 
Measurement inputs include share price on the measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected 
volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available 
information), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option 
holder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. Service and non-market performance conditions 
attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.
The fair value of Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units is equal to the market price of the underlying 
shares on the day of the grant. See note 30.
Research and development costs
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in this note. Determining the amounts to 
be capitalised requires Directors to make assumptions regarding the capitalisation criteria requirements of IAS 38 – 
Intangible assets. See note 15.

For the year-ended 31 March 2017
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
3.5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED
Business combinations
Directors are required to make an assessment of the intangible assets to be recognised as a result of the business 
acquisition. Furthermore, Directors are required to make an assessment as to whether the intangible assets are 
separable and their fair values as at the time of acquisition. This is based on certain assumptions including the expected 
future cash flows arising from use of the intangibles, discount rates and estimated economic lives of the intangibles. 
See note 33
Provisions
The Group measures provisions at Directors best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date, discounted where the time value of money is considered material. These estimates take account 
of available information, historical experience and the likelihood of different possible outcomes. Both the amount and 
the maturity of these liabilities could be different from those estimated. See note 26.
3.6 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding 
discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met 
before revenue is recognised:
Revenue from software licenses and service contracts
The Group sells software products under fixed-term contracts and perpetual licenses. Where there is multi-element 
arrangement revenue is allocated to each element on a fair value basis, based on the price at which the respective 
elements are usually sold separately, regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract. The portion of the 
revenue allocated to an element is recognised when the revenue recognition criteria for that element has been met.
Fixed-term contracts
Customers who receive software products at the start of the contract under a fixed-term license, are entitled  
to receive regular updates and upgrades for the duration of the license term which runs for periods ranging from  
1 to 5 years.
Revenue for these-fixed rate contracts is recognised rateably over the period that the contractual obligation exists. 
Accrued and deferred revenue arising on long-term contracts is included in receivables as accrued income and 
payables as deferred revenue as appropriate. 
Where the Group contracts with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a service provider, rather than an end 
user, it mirrors the above policy and recognises the revenue in line with the contractual terms granted to the end user.
Perpetual licenses
Revenue is recognised immediately where customers purchase software products under a perpetual license. Revenue 
in respect of support and maintenance contracts associated with perpetual licenses is recognised rateably over the 
life of the support / maintenance contract.
Sale of goods
Where software licenses and hardware and are sold together, if the software is not essential to the functionality of the 
tangible product, then the revenue from the sale of goods is recognised immediately. However, where the software is 
essential to the functionality of the tangible product and the hardware cannot function without the software, revenue 
from the sale of goods is recognised rateably over the period of the associated software license contract.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as interest is accrued.
3.7 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and 
includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
108 Except for freehold land, depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual values of all property, 
plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings 25 years
Leasehold improvements  Over the lease period
Computer equipment 3 – 5 years
Other plant and equipment 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Fixtures and fittings  6 – 10 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their 
recoverable amount. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is 
included in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period of de-recognition.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
each financial year-end.
 3.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. This involves recognising 
identifiable assets (including previously unrecognised intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities 
and excluding future restructuring) of the acquired business at fair value.
Business combinations on or after 1 April 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3. Any excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as goodwill and is not amortised. To the extent 
that the net fair value of the acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than 
the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Goodwill 
recognised as an asset as at 31 March 2004 is recorded at its previous carrying amount under UK GAAP and is not 
amortised. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value 
being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill assets considered significant in comparison to the Company’s total carrying 
amount of such assets have been allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment 
loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it. 
3.9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part 
of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other 
legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets is taken to 
the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred to the extent that the expenditure does 
not qualify for capitalisation under research and development costs.
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is classified as 
an intangible asset. The capitalised costs of software for internal use include external direct costs of materials and 
services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and incremental payroll and payroll-related costs arising 
from the assignment of employees to implementation projects. Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the 
point at which the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended internal use. 
109 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year-ended 31 March 2017
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
3.9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised over their expected useful lives as follows:
Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries  
Intellectual property 5 – 15 years reducing balance basis
Brand names 15 – 20 years reducing balance basis
Customer base 6 – 14 years reducing balance basis
Other purchased intangible assets  
All other intangibles 3 years straight-line basis
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit 
or loss as a general finance and administration cost. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-
generating unit level. Such intangibles are not amortised. The term of their useful life is reviewed annually to determine 
whether indefinite life assessment continues to be appropriate. 
3.10 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditure on research activities is expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset when its future recoverability can reasonably be 
regarded as assured and technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated. 
During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. Following the initial recognition of the 
development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete 
and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected future sales.
Development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or other changes in software functionalities does not 
satisfy the criteria, as the product is not substantially new in its design or functional characteristics. Such expenditure 
is therefore recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss as incurred. 
3.11 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
At least annually, or when otherwise required, Directors review the carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and 
intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any 
impairment loss. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money as well as risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but not beyond the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately as income in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, although impairment losses relating to  
goodwill may not be reversed.
110 3.12 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each 
product to its present location and condition. The cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for resale is based on 
the purchase cost and is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion 
and disposal.
3.13 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. When financial instruments are recognised initially they are 
measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities not at fair 
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day payment terms, are carried at original invoice amount, including 
value added tax and other sales taxes, less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of any 
outstanding amounts at the period end and on historical performance. Provision for bad debts is made in the period in 
which they are identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits repayable in 90 days or less. For the purpose of 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and bank deposits net 
of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised at cost, which is deemed to be materially the same as the fair value.
Classification of equity instruments as debt or equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
When equity instruments are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Group is presented as a 
liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position; measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and 
thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption. The corresponding dividends relating to 
the liability component are charged as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity 
instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs. 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. 
Gains and losses arising on the re-purchase, settlement or other cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively 
in finance income and finance expense. 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts to reduce 
its exposure to exchange rate movements and interest rate caps to reduce its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the reporting 
date. Changes in the fair values are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss and this is likely to cause 
volatility in situations where the carrying value of the hedged item is either not adjusted to reflect fair value changes 
arising from the hedged risk or is so adjusted but that adjustment is not recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
profit or loss. Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 — Financial Instruments are met, hedge accounting may be 
used to mitigate this volatility. 
111 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year-ended 31 March 2017
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
3.14 LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
3.15 PROVISIONS
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using 
a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance policy, the 
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss net of any 
reimbursement.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance 
expense.
3.16 TAXATION
The income tax charge represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes. 
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit 
reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss because some items of income or expense are taxable in 
different periods or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using UK and 
foreign rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
A current tax provision is recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation. Tax liabilities are recognised when it is considered 
probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority. They are measured using the single best 
estimate of likely outcome approach. The Group’s current tax provision relates to the management’s judgement of 
the amount of tax payable on open tax computations where the liabilities remain to be agreed with authorities. The 
uncertain tax items for which provision is made, relate to the interpretation of tax legislation impacting arrangements 
entered into in the ordinary course of business. Due to the uncertainty associated with such items, it is possible that at 
a future date, on conclusion of open tax matters, the final outcome may vary. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. The rate is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
period date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt 
with in other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally 
112 enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the 
income taxes levied in the same taxation authority on either the same entity or on different taxable entities which 
intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
3.17 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions to defined contribution 
schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in which they become payable.
3.18 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments ("equity-settled 
transactions"). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given 
in note 30. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, ending on the 
date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. 
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions 
and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market 
condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
reporting date is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or 
settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. 
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any 
modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified 
award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any 
cost not yet recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the award is expensed immediately. Any 
compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, 
with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
3.19 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
Exceptional items are those that in the judgment of the Directors need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature 
or incidence, in order to draw the attention of the reader and to show the underlying business performance of the 
Group more accurately. Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate, and are 
separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of the consolidated 
income statement.
3.20 EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE
Events between the reporting date and the date the financial statements are approved, favourable and unfavourable, 
providing evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date, adjust the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements. Those that indicate conditions arising after the reporting date are disclosed but are not recognised within 
the financial statements.
4 SEGMENT INFORMATION
For internal management reporting purposes, the primary segment reporting format is determined to be geographic 
segments as the Group's risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by the different economic environments. 
This is consistent with the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has only one 
secondary business segment on the basis that the products and services offered to external customers are very 
similar and therefore do not result in different risks and rates of return for the Group.
The Group's geographical segments are based on the location of the Group's operations consisting of Europe, Middle 
East and Africa (“EMEA”), The Americas and Asia Pacific and Japan (“APJ”).

4 SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED
Billings are the value of products and services invoiced to customers after receiving a purchase order from the 
customer and delivering products and services to them, or for which there is no right to a refund. Billings does not 
equate to statutory revenue. 
Billings are classified by the geographic location of direct customers, OEMs and the distributors which purchase our 
products. The geographic location of OEMs or distributors may be different from that of the end customers. 
A disclosure of revenue by region is included in the Financial Review on page 31. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in 
note 3. Segment profits represent the profit earned by each segment without allocation of central administration 
costs including Directors’ salaries, finance costs and income tax expense. This is the measure reported to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker, the Chief Executive Officer, and Senior Management Team for the purposes of resource 
allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions 
with third parties.
Geographical segments

116 6 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (“APMs”)
The Group uses certain financial measures that are not defined or recognised under IFRS. The Directors believe that 
these non-GAAP measures enable a better understanding of the results of the Group and are used as key performance 
indicators within the business to aid in evaluating its current business performance. As the measures are not defined 
by IFRS other companies may calculate them differently or may use such measures for different purposes than the 
Group does, limiting the usefulness of such measures as a comparative. Constant currency measures have limitations, 
particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated may constitute a significant element of the Group’s revenue 
and expenses and could materially impact the Group’s performance. The Directors do not evaluate the Group’s results 
and performance on a constant currency basis without also evaluating the Group’s financial information prepared at 
actual foreign exchange rates in accordance with IFRS.
The definition of non-GAAP measures in the year-ended 31 March 2017 is consistent with those presented for the 
year-ended 31 March 2016. However, to ensure such measures remain relevant, the Group regularly reviews their 
usage and is now proposing a change to the non-GAAP measures that it publishes. The Directors have updated the 
key metrics used in the year to enable greater comparability while retaining the key aspects of measures that provide 
visibility into the fundamental underlying performance of the Group. Hence in the current year, as explained in the 
sections below, both the previous and future metrics have been presented to provide some consistency, whilst in 
future annual reports only details of the revised metrics in use in that period will be disclosed.
The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is set out below.
BILLINGS
Billings represent the value of products and services invoiced to customers after receiving a purchase order from the 
customer and delivering products and services to them, or for which there is no right to a refund. Billings does not 
equate to statutory revenue.
In previous periods the Group has also reported like-for-like billings which represent billings on a constant currency 
basis excluding disposals and including acquisitions from the point of acquisition plus the pre-acquisition billings of 
any acquired companies on a reported basis. To aid comparability with peer companies the Group will only be using 
actual rate and constant currency billings in the future. As like-for-like billings growth has been previously disclosed, 
and in accordance with best practice for a transition in metric disclosures, the figures for the current and comparative 
periods are, on this occasion, shown below.

6 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (“APMs”) CONTINUED
ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND CASH EBITDA
Adjusted operating profit provides a supplemental measure of earnings that facilitates review of operating 
performance on a period-to-period basis by excluding non-recurring and other items that are not indicative of the 
Group’s underlying operating performance.
Adjusted operating profit is a key profit measure used by the Board to assess the underlying financial performance of 
the Group. Adjusted operating profit is stated before the following items for the following reasons 
• Exceptional items, as set out in Note 7, are those items that in the Directors judgment should be disclosed 
separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, in order to show the underlying business performance of the 
Group more accurately.
• Charges for the amortisation of acquired intangibles are excluded from the calculation of adjusted operating 
profit because these charges are based on judgments about their value and economic life, are the result of the 
application of acquisition accounting rather than core operations and bear no relation to the Group’s underlying 
ongoing performance. 
• Share-based payment charges are similarly excluded from the calculation of adjusted operating profit because 
these represent a non-cash accounting charge for long term incentives to senior management rather than the 
underlying operations of the Group’s business. 
On an ongoing basis, the Group will be reporting on adjusted operating profit as it believes that it will improve 
comparability of the Group’s results, while also giving insight into the Group’s underlying trading performance. 
Cash earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“Cash EBITDA”) is defined as the Group’s 
operating profit / (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortisation charges, any gain or loss on the sale of tangible and 
intangible assets, share option charges, unrealised foreign exchange differences and exceptional items, with billings 
replacing recognised revenue and is a useful supplemental measure of earnings that provides visibility on actual cash 
earned in the year. Depreciation and unrealised foreign exchange differences are adjusted as they do not represent 
cash costs of the business.

non-operating items.

7 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are those that in the judgment of the Directors need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or 
incidence, in order to draw the attention of the reader and to show the underlying business performance of the Group 
more accurately. Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate and are separately 
disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement within general finance and administration expenses.
During the year-ended 31 March 2017, acquisition related expenses of $7.2M (2016: $1.7M), restructuring and 
integration costs of ($0.4M) (2016: $2.6M) and costs incurred in relation to the defence and settlement of certain 
intellectual property (“IP”) litigation of $24.6M (2016: $19.8M) were incurred. In the prior-year, Initial Public Offering 
(“IPO”) costs of $17.8M were incurred. The current-year Intellectual Property litigation costs include an omnibus 
agreement entered into with Finjan Inc. on 30 March 2017 resolving all the parties’ disputes.
This resulted in total exceptional items of $31.4M (2016: $41.9M).Tax relief on these exceptional items amounted to 
$4.8M (2016: $5.3M).

The Group’s taxation strategy is aligned to business strategy and operational needs. Oversight of taxation is within the 
remit of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for tax strategy supported by a global 
team of tax professionals. Sophos strives for an open and transparent relationship with all revenue authorities. A tax 
authority may seek adjustment to the filing position adopted by a Group company and it is accepted that interpretation 
of complex regulations may lead to additional tax being assessed. Uncertain tax positions are monitored regularly and 
a provision made in the accounts where appropriate.
Key influences
The Group’s tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits and reflects a combination of higher rates in certain 
jurisdictions, such as Germany, a low effective rate in the UK due to available tax losses and rates that lie in between.
The group receives incentives in certain jurisdictions. In the UK, the Research & Development Expense Credit resulted 
in a lower tax charge in the income statement and a lower net cash tax payment. There is no guarantee that these 
incentives will continue to be applicable in future years.
Expected future rate
Over the medium term the tax rate is likely to stabilise as the integration of acquisitions in higher rate jurisdictions are 
completed. However, the tax rate may fluctuate if business changes are implemented in response to legislation arising 
from the OECD’s Base Erosion & Profit Shifting Project, the UK’s exit from the EU and proposed tax reforms following 
the US presidential election. Legislative change in key territories is being monitored and acted upon.

Other timing differences – 0.5 
Total 14.4 10.1 
Losses
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of losses where current forecasts indicate profits will arise in 
the foreseeable future against which the losses recognised will be offset. At the balance sheet date the Group has 
unused tax losses of $336.6M (2016: $248.5M) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of $118.2M (2016: $54.6M) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect 
of the remaining $218.4M (2016: $193.9M unutilised) as it is not considered probable that there will be the required type 
of future trading or non-trading profits available in the correct entities necessary to permit offset and recognition.
Share-based payments
A remuneration expense for share based payments is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the 
period from the award date to the vesting date of the relevant options. Where there is a temporary difference between 
the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset may be recorded. Any deferred tax asset arising on share option 
awards is calculated as the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future. This is based on the Group’s 
share price at the reporting date so will be impacted by share price movement and is pro-rated to the extent that the 
services of the employee have been rendered over the vesting period. If this amount exceeds the cumulative amount 
of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings. 
Similarly, current tax relief in excess of the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate is 
also recorded in retained earnings. Deferred tax assets have only been recognised in jurisdictions in which future tax 
deductions are expected. 
As at 31 March 2017 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was $Nil (2016: $Nil). No liability has been recognised 
because the Group is in a position to control the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. 
124 14 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of 
shares that would be issued if all dilutive potential ordinary shares were converted into ordinary shares. In accordance 
with IAS 33, the dilutive earnings per share are without reference to adjustments in respect of outstanding shares 
when the impact would be anti-dilutive.
Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. In the prior-year, adjusted 
EPS was calculated on the basis of cash EBITDA. In the current-year, the calculation has been made on the basis of 
adjusted operating profit, with an equivalent restatement of the comparative number. This change of basis has been 
made to ensure better comparability with other UK listed companies.
In each case, the weighted average number of shares take into account the weighted average number of own shares 
held during the period.

126 16 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:
31 March 
2017  
$M
31 March 
2016  
$M
Americas 253.0 253.5 
EMEA 473.2 379.3 
APJ 83.1 83.3 
809.3 716.1
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is tested annually or more frequently where there is indication of 
impairment. The goodwill of $96.4M arising on the acquisition of Invincea Inc., on 21 March 2017 has been initially 
allocated to the EMEA CGU. Management will re-assess the allocation of goodwill within 12 months from the 
acquisition date based upon synergies provided to each CGU.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset 
or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-
generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in 
the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the 
higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. 
For the year-ended 31 March 2017, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use 
calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to 
billings and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following 
five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors expectations of the medium-term 
operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the 
market and specific regional considerations. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current 
market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2017 are as follows:
Americas  
%
EMEA  
%
APJ  
%
Long-term regional growth rate beyond 5 years 2.5% 1.5% 2.0%
Discount rate 10.5% 10.0% 11.5%
The key assumptions used in the assessments in the year-ended 31 March 2016 were as follows:
Americas  
%
EMEA  
%
APJ  
%
Long-term regional growth rate beyond 5 years 2.5% 1.5% 2.0%
Discount rate 11.0% 10.0% 12.0%
As at 31 March 2017, there were no indicators of impairment that suggested the carrying amounts of the Group’s 
long-lived assets are not recoverable.

24 DEFERRED REVENUE CONTINUED
On acquisition of Invincea, Inc. on 21 March 2017, acquired deferred revenue of $6.1 was reduced by $2.0M 
representing the fair value of original selling cost and associated profit. $4.1M (2016: Nil) remains unamortised at 
31 March 2017. 
On acquisition of SurfRight B.V. on 3 December 2015, deferred revenue was increased by $1.3M representing the fair 
value of future support costs acquired. $0.2M remains unamortised at 31 March 2017.
25 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are included at the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid 
to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the end of the reporting period. The 
following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values:
• Cash and cash equivalents  – approximates to the carrying amount
• Finance leases  – approximates to the carrying amount
• Bank loans  – approximates to the carrying amount
• Interest rate swaps, caps and floors  – based on the net present value of discounted cash flows
• Receivables and payables  – approximates to carrying amount
Where financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair values their measurement should be classified into the 
following hierarchy:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets from identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
The Group had a Level 3 financial liability of $21.7M of contingent consideration measured at fair value through 
profit and loss at 31 March 2017 (2016: $2.1M). The fair value of the contingent consideration is determined using a 
probability-weighted average of outcomes discounted back to acquisition date.

Inc. At 31 March 2017, the present value of future lease payments was $0.1M (2016: $0.2M) 
132 CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
Invincea, Inc.
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owners of Invincea, Inc., a contingent consideration has been 
agreed. The consideration is dependent on the billings of products including the intellectual property acquired with 
Invincea, Inc. for the 12 month period to 21 March 2018 with a maximum payout of $20.0M. The fair value of the 
contingent consideration at the acquisition date was estimated at $19.3M. The contingent consideration is due for 
measurement and payment to the former shareholders on 30 June 2017, 30 September 2017, 31 December 2017 
and 21 March 2018 respectively.
Silent Break LLC
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owners of the “PhishThreat” technology, a contingent 
consideration has been agreed. The consideration is dependent on the billings of the “PhishThreat” product range

27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Financial risk management is conducted at a Group level, applying treasury policies which have been approved by  
the Board. The major financial risks to which the Group is exposed relate to interest rate risk, credit risk and 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Where appropriate, cost effective and practicable, the Group uses 
various financial instruments to manage these risks. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to reduce 
the impact on the Group operations of changes in market rates. No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other 
instruments is permitted.
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below:
Liquidity risk
The Group prepares budgets annually in advance. This enables the Group's operating cash flow requirements to be 
anticipated and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs, financial obligations and to invest 
any surplus cash assets safely and profitably. Quarterly covenant tests are performed and monitored by the Directors 
at quarterly board meetings.
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding, minimising finance costs and 
maintaining flexibility through the use of short-term deposits and intra-group loan arrangements.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and 
healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholders' value.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 21, borrowings as 
disclosed in note 25 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and 
retained earnings, as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.  
The Group reviews the capital structure on a regular basis and considers the cost of capital and the risks associated 
with each class of capital. 
Credit risk
The Group's principal financial assets are cash and bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. In order to manage credit risk the Directors set 
limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are 
reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of allowance for doubtful debts. 
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is 
evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The expense recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
profit or loss in respect of doubtful debts during the period was $0.1M, as disclosed in note 21.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in trade receivables; exposure is spread over a large number of 
counterparties and customers.
With respect to cash and deposits, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from the risk of default by the 
counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these assets. To mitigate this risk, cash and 
deposits are only held with reputable banking institutions. The Group reduces the concentrations of credit risk in cash 
and deposits by holding balances with a number of separate institutions.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to the long-term debt obligations with floating rates of interest.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. Several other currencies in addition to the 
reporting currency of US Dollar are used, including Sterling and the Euro. The Group experiences currency exchange 
differences arising upon retranslation of monetary items (primarily short-term inter-company balances and long-
term borrowings), which are recognised as an expense in the period the difference occurs. The Group endeavours to 
match the cash inflows and outflows in the various currencies; the Group typically invoices its customers in their local 
currency, and pays its local expenses in local currency as a means to mitigate this risk.
The Group is also exposed to exchange differences arising from the translation of its subsidiaries' financial statements 
into the Group's reporting currency of US Dollar with the corresponding exchange differences taken directly to equity.
The following table illustrates the movement that 10% in the value of Sterling or the Euro would have had on the 
Group’s profit or loss for the period and on the Group’s equity as at the end of the period.

Sophos Group 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The ESPP plan aims to encourage wider share ownership amongst US employees of the Group by offering options 
compliant with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees are offered options to buy shares at a discount 
following a pre-set savings period.
Sophos Group International SAYE option scheme 2015 “(International SAYE”)

The cash-settled expense comprises cash-based awards together with certain social security taxes. The carrying 
value of the liability as at 31 March 2017 was $1.8M (2016: $1.1M).
SHARE OPTIONS
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table illustrates the weighted average inputs into the Black-Scholes model in the year:
Year-ended

Expected life of options (years) 3.20 2.28 
Risk free rate 0.92% 0.57%
Dividend yield 0.62% Nil
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was $ cents 51.75 (2016 $ cents 24.4)
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical share price volatility is indicative of future trends, 
which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. An increase in the expected volatility will increase the estimated  
fair value.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may occur. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on Directors best estimate, taking into 
account the effects of exercise restrictions, non-transferability and behavioural considerations. An increase in the 
expected life will increase the estimated fair value.

revenue for the year-ended 31 March 2016 would have increased over the reported revenue by approximately $2.2M. 
The impact on the operating loss would have been insignificant. 
Goodwill arose in all the above business combinations because the cost of the combination included amounts in 
relation to the benefit of expected synergies, future market development and the assembled workforce. These 
benefits are not recognised separately from Goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable 
intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

potential loss or losses. The final outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to 
have a material impact on the business.
Litigation is currently in process against an entity within the Group by RPost Holdings Inc. The company allege patent 
infringements and claim unspecified damages. In accordance with IAS 37.92, the Group does not provide further 
information on the grounds that this could seriously prejudice the outcome of the litigation. The Directors are of the 
opinion that the claim can be successfully resisted by the Group.

153 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year-ended 31 March 2017
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material 
in relation to the Company’s financial statements. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company and its trading subsidiaries have considerable financial resources and a large number of customer 
contracts across different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe the Company 
is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Company operates as an investment company for the Sophos Group, holding investments in subsidiaries financed 
by Group companies. As the Company is an intrinsic part of the Group’s structure, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that Group companies will continue to support the Company through trading and cash generated from 
trading for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (“FRS 102”) 
and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit 
and loss account. 
The company is considered to be a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102 and has applied the exemptions 
available under FRS 102 in respect of the cash flow statement and key management personnel compensation. 
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also 
taken the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of disclosures in respect of share-based payments, financial 
instruments and the requirements of Section 33 Related Party Disclosures paragraph 33.7.
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are stated at historical foreign exchange rates.
INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and 
are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and 
losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in 
finance income and finance expense.
GOING CONCERN BASIS
The Company operates as an investment company for the Sophos Group, holding investments in subsidiaries 
financed by Group companies. As the Company is an intrinsic part of the Group’s structure, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that Group companies will continue to support the Company through trading and cash 
generated from trading for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
154 2 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
The loss after tax dealt with in the books of the Company was $5.6M (2016: $21.4M). Under section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
