Business Model 
and Strategy
In some cases, this might be through the expansion 
of the Venues network in Connecticut where there 
are 16 existing sites with a licence to expand to 24 
and through the expansion of the intra-state web and 
mobile pari-mutuel betting channels in Connecticut. 
The Group seeks to broaden the product offering 
and become a betting operator able to offer the full 
suite of gaming products (as regulation develops) in 
an omni-channel environment, including at venues 
where bets can be placed watching sport, eating and 
drinking.
The Group has an international focus with the 
majority of operations in USA (Connecticut, New 
Jersey, Georgia), Canada (Toronto), Ireland and 
United Kingdom (Bristol). The majority of the Group’s 
underlying earnings are now in USD, followed by GBP. 
The Group does not hedge against its USD earnings, 
but will report translation differences.
The Group’s strategy is to 
focus on fully regulated 
sports betting opportunities. 
In the past, these have been 
primarily “pari-mutuel” in 
nature. The Group is now 
pursuing opportunities to 
leverage existing gaming 
licences, technologies, and 
customer relationships to 
achieve long-term tangible 
shareholder returns.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Racing and Digital division is the leading supplier 
of technology and services to the global betting 
industry, with systems that process approximately 
$12 billion in handle annually for customers in 37 
countries. 
The Division’s proprietary Quantum™ System 
software, which is extensively used by many of the 
world’s tote operators, and its Global Quantum™ 
Data and Operations Centre, keystone of a global 
service delivery network, together form the 
foundation from which Sportech pursues key 
initiatives including international expansion, growth 
in global commingling, and the extension of digital 
technologies crucial to long-term reduction in capital 
and operational costs.
Included within Racing and Digital is the nascent 
Bump 50:50 business. Acquired in June 2014, Bump 
supplies in-stadia and, beginning in 2017, online 
electronic lotteries to some of North America’s best-
known major league sports teams and entertainment 
venues. Bump 50:50 strategy calls for continued 
aggressive customer acquisition activities and 
leveraging of online and mobile platforms to drive 
organic growth and reach new markets of non-sports 
customers.
Sportech Venues operates all legal betting on 
horseracing, greyhound racing and jai alai under 
an exclusive and in perpetuity licence for retail, 
telephone, internet and mobile in the State of 
Connecticut. 
Having secured the rights to open a total of 24 venues 
in Connecticut, and having engaged actively with 
respect to the passage of new legislation for sports 
betting, Venues is well positioned to act quickly to 
expand should sports betting in-venue and online 
become permitted.
Venues is taking a much more aggressive competitive 
stance with regard to its web and mobile channels. 
The Division is also implementing strategies to 
maximise return on investments made in the 
new Bobby V’s location in the areas of food and 
beverage, betting, and group sales through effective 
management and more aggressive marketing 
activities.

Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement 
2017 was a year of significant 
achievement for Sportech PLC. 
Following a positive litigation 
ruling and the sale of our core 
UK business, the Group repaid 
£60 million of debt and returned 
£75 million to shareholders, whilst 
having sufficient cash to facilitate 
immediate growth prospects 
during the year. 
Your Board has also undergone some change during 
the year and I’m delighted to have welcomed Richard 
Cooper and Giles Vardey, who bring leading gaming 
and business experience, and Andrew Gaughan, now 
CEO, to the PLC Board. These appointments bring 
significant incremental expertise and skills to the 
Group.
The Board wishes to acknowledge Directors who 
departed the Board in 2017: Roger Withers (who had 
served as Chairman), Ian Penrose (Chief Executive) 
and Mickey Kalifa (CFO). 
In March 2017 the Group announced a conditional 
agreement to sell the Football Pools business, which 
was subsequently passed by shareholders in April 
2017. The Football Pools represented the mainstay 
of the Group’s EBITDA and in particular, the bulk of 
the UK earnings stream. The sale completed in June 
2017 and now the Group’s earnings are around 80% 
denominated in USD, with GBP representing around 
10%, Euro’s 8%, and CAD 2%. The Board anticipates 
further growth in USD contributions going forward 
and the Board will be evaluating whether the 
reporting currency for the Group should become the 
US dollar.
The current Board recognises stakeholder concern 
regarding previous investment venture returns 
and a track record of impairing investments, 
which unfortunately continued in 2017 as the book 
valuations of various historic investments have yet 
again had to be revalued downwards. Given an 
absence of an investment strategy in early 2017, to 
provide tangible growth opportunities, the Board 
elected to return capital to shareholders thus de-
risking investor capital.
Indeed, the Group made two significant returns of 
capital to shareholders during the year. This was the 
first time in its recent history that capital has been 
returned to shareholders. £21 million was returned 
in March 2017 via a Tender Offer and, following a 
required Court approved capital reduction, a further 
£54 million was returned by way of a special dividend 
in December 2017.
170749 Sportech Front end 27 April.indd   8 27/04/2018   20:30 9
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Following the sale of the Football Pools and 
significant capital returns to shareholders, it became 
inevitable that having a UK-based executive 
management team was not an appropriate structure 
for the Group going forward. Following the 
announced decisions by UK-based senior executives 
to leave the now US-focused Group, a cost reduction 
exercise commenced to streamline the UK cost base. I 
am pleased to report that the Board has executed on 
this plan and has reduced the UK corporate cost base 
significantly going forward.
At all times during this process, consent has been 
sought, and been given, by the regulatory authorities 
where change in management is a condition 
precedent. The Group continues to enjoy excellent 
relationships with these regulators.
Formal Sale Process
In October 2017, after a number of unsolicited 
external approaches, the Board decided that it 
would consider formal offers for the Group and 
commenced a Formal Sale Process. The Board and 
senior management invested considerable time over 
many months in diligently managing this initiative; 
meeting numerous interested parties and presenting 
the business capabilities and potential. However, the 
Board, together with its advisors, concluded that none 
of those approaches were likely to result in an offer 
for all or a material part of the Group that the Board 
would be able to recommend to shareholders, and the 
termination of this process was therefore announced 
on 14 March 2018.
Strategic Review
The Strategic Review, announced on 18 September 
2017, concluded that Sportech has significant 
potential for long-term value creation through 
a combination of: growing its core businesses; 
diversification; and benefitting from the possible 
liberalisation of sports betting in a number of US 
states.
Following the departure of the previous senior 
executives, Richard Cooper (a Non-Executive Director 
and Chair of the Audit Committee) and I commenced 
a thorough review of the financial and contractual 
affairs of the Group. The Group views “exceptional 
items” as simply that, items that are exceptional in 
nature and size (the de minimis being the materiality 
threshold applied by the auditors) and which if to 
recur, are not, therefore, exceptional, or separately 
reported items which we understand to be the 
preferred usage of the FRC.

Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
A number of provisions have been made for onerous 
contracts or potential bad debts as this process 
unfolded. Some of the significant project and 
investment cessations have been as follows:
� In January 2010, the Group announced a joint 
venture (“JV”), launching a sports gaming 
business in India. £3.1 million was invested in 
that JV up to 31 December 2016, which by that 
date had all been expensed. The JV was almost 
dormant in 2017, and by February 2018, the 
JV was terminated as minimal revenues were 
recognised, and the JV had ongoing costs with 
limited potential for returns.
� In December 2013, the Group announced plans 
to build a proposed 10,000 sq.ft. sports bar, 
restaurant and betting facility in the town of 
Norco, Southern California. This site had not been 
developed, currently lies vacant and during 2017 
a further provision of £1.2 million was made for 
the onerous lease and other associated liabilities. 
Alternative use options are currently being 
reviewed.
� In October 2015, the Group opened its first 
branded sports bar (“Striders”), restaurant and 
betting facility in downtown San Diego, California. 
This operation was a joint venture with local 
operators. The venue has not been as successful 
as the previous executive team had originally 
forecasted and the Group is in dispute with its 
partners and accordingly a provision of £1.3 
million has been made for onerous contracts.  
The Board are reviewing its options in relation  
to this investment.
� Additionally, the Group undertook a review of 
non-core assets and, in the Netherlands, following 
the award of a new five-year licence in June 2017 
to provide the exclusive right to conduct tote 
betting on horseracing, the Board decided to 
revisit the potential sale of that business. I am 
pleased to report that in March 2018 we executed 
a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain 
regulatory conditions and anticipate completing 
on this disposal in H1 2018. This business has  
been included in these accounts as an asset   
held for sale.
� The Board are further examining the value of 
surplus real-estate in North America, to assess all 
options to extract further value for shareholders. 
The Group owns two freehold sites in 
Connecticut; a nine-acre site in New Haven and a 
seven-acre site adjacent to the airport in Bradley. 
However, the Group does operate a significant 
venue onsite at each of these locations, which 
therefore restricts its flexibility.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Regulatory framework and    
US Sports Betting 
The possibility of the US market moving towards a 
broader regulation of sports gaming continues at 
pace with a number of states preparing to enact 
legislation if the US Supreme Court permits.
Furthermore, the governing bodies of certain 
significant US sports have lobbied hard for an 
opening-up of legislation. Through the Group’s 
existing regulatory, commercial and customer 
network, the Board believe there are significant 
opportunities to leverage these relationships and as 
a result of this, significant time has been invested 
in assessing the optimal platform for Sportech’s 
B2C and B2B businesses to capitalise on this 
potential momentous change. The Board anticipates 
announcing the launch of a Sportsbook utilising a 
reputable third-party vendor in H1-2018.
Shoreline Star LLC Agreement
As part of the acquisition of the US racing business 
from Scientific Games in 2010, the Group acquired 
a contract with Shoreline Star LLC (“Shoreline”). 
This contract provides a share of profits to Shoreline 
from new forms of gaming within the US state of 
Connecticut, for 25 years after the commencement of 
legalised new forms of gaming. The dominant clause 
of this contact reads:
“Under the terms of the amended contract, Shoreline 
Star shall now receive approximately 50% of profits 
after tax from these new forms of gaming for a 25-
year period (with a ratchet downwards commencing 
after five years) following commencement. Any 
payments under this revised contract will only occur 
after Sportech fully recover any capital investment 
from additional cash flows generated.”
The “downward ratchet” provides for a reduction in 
profit share paid to Shoreline Star LLC, from 50% to 
end year five, then 40% to end year ten and 30% for 
remaining fifteen years.
I raise this now purely to ensure shareholders are fully 
aware of this material contract when assessing the 
potential net returns to Sportech PLC from the advent 
of US Sports Betting, or other forms of enhanced 
gaming that benefit the Group within the State of 
Connecticut.
Sportech has significant potential for 
long-term value creation through: growing 
its core businesses; diversification; and 
benefitting from the possible liberalisation 
of sports betting in a number of US states.”

Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Outlook and Trading Update
Venues
Q1-2018 revenue growth in Venues has been higher 
than in Q1-2017, but below our expectations.
The Stamford location continues to build market 
positioning and financial momentum, but the pre-
opening business plan was overly optimistic and the 
actual and now anticipated timeline for the business 
to reach revenues and profits, commensurate with 
targeted initial investment returns, will take well 
into 2019. However, in order to address certain 
opportunities, we are at an advanced stage of 
recruiting experienced F&B and Group Sales expertise 
to build that side of the business aggressively going 
forward and to bring it in line with revenues and profit 
levels that this high quality and well-located sports 
and wagering bar/restaurant should be producing. 
The output and results of these actions is unlikely to 
have a material impact until Q3/Q4 of 2018 due to 
the management recruiting, and rebuilding of local 
awareness for the facility.
Wagering revenues softness in the Venues business is 
primarily from our digital platform and at Stamford. 
This is being addressed through a renewed digital 
focused marketing plan that is concentrated on 
combating out-of-state digital Advanced Deposit 
Wagering (“ADW”) operators that have recruited and 
taken our Connecticut resident customers into their 
own ADW digital platforms, all based in Oregon. 
This business and revenue recapture and digital 
development will be further augmented and 
supported through the anticipated gaming bill SB 
276 coming into force and effect, late this spring, 
for which the Group has led the lobby with our 
Connecticut General Assembly and Department of 
Consumer Protection regulatory offices. The gaming 
Chairman’s Statement continued
170749 Sportech Front end 27 April.indd   12 27/04/2018   20:30 13
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
bill, in essence, seeks to explicitly make illegal the 
taking of wagers from Connecticut residents within 
Connecticut unless being taken by the authorised 
pari-mutuel wagering operator; which of course is 
Sportech Venues. The Group will be aggressively 
enlisting the cease and desist actions of the 
Connecticut Attorney General’s office in upholding 
this law when it comes into force. The Group will 
combine an aggressive marketing, advertising and 
customer rebate programme that messages and 
focuses around taking back customers from the 
businesses operating illegally from outside the State 
of Connecticut.
Racing and Digital
The component revenue parts of the Racing and 
Digital businesses, including one-time sales, core 
contracted and recurring tote services across all 
regions, digital B2B services and Bump 50:50, are 
broadly trading in line with our expectations. 
Costs across all the businesses are broadly in line with 
management’s expectations and our sales pipeline 
remains a key focus for the year. It will now be the key 
variant in achieving or exceeding our internal revenue 
and profits expectations for 2018.
Cash position
Net of customer balances, the Group’s cash position 
at 31 March was £12 million. The initial net proceeds of 
the sale of the Venues business in the Netherlands are 
expected to be £2.6 million, receivable in June/July 
2018.
This is both an exciting and challenging time for the 
Group as it continues to navigate through certain 
historic issues and present a transparent and realistic 
overview of the Company.
The Board and core management, led by Andrew 
Gaughan, the new CEO, remain focused on executing 
a strategy to capitalise on the significant potential 
a US Supreme Court repeal of the Professional and 
Amateur Sports Act (“PASPA”) could deliver.
The senior management team remain resolute in its 
proactive campaign with the Connecticut General 
Assembly and associated stakeholders in positioning 
Sportech as the obvious licensee to conduct sports 
betting within that state.
The Group is well advanced in securing a Sportsbook 
partner in anticipation of regulatory easing and 
the Board assures shareholders that the core 
management team continues to provide testimony, 
evidence and insight to the political debate on this 
critical topic. In addition, the senior management 
team have commenced discussions with their 
business clients and others across the US in preparing 
them for the opportunities and challenges ahead.
Finally, I would urge you to visit our revised corporate 
website, www.sportechplc.com, which in addition 
to stock exchange regulated news, provides regular, 
non-regulatory updates to shareholders about your 
Company.

Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Operating Review of the 
Business by the CEO
Since then, there have been a number of significant 
changes in the Group: firstly, the sale of the Football 
Pools, which post completion saw two existing 
Directors move on; and secondly, the Formal Sale 
Process which followed a number of unsolicited 
approaches for the Group as a whole.
The Group emerged from this period leaner and more 
invigorated, executing strategies that include the 
continued expansion of our international footprint in 
Racing and Digital, and the ongoing development of 
the Bump 50:50 product focused on the charitable 
foundations of tier-one professional sports teams. 
We are also pursuing further deployment of online 
and mobile platforms to drive growth and reduce 
operational costs, and diversification into new forms 
of gaming, including sports wagering, as and when 
regulations permit, both in the Venues business and in 
the US Racing and Digital business.
The Group now has two operating divisions: Racing 
and Digital (including Bump 50:50), and Venues.

Andrew Gaughan, CEO
I am pleased to address the 
Sportech shareholders as the 
Group’s new Chief Executive 
Officer, having been appointed to 
that position on 14 March 2018, 
although I joined the Board in 
January 2017.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Despite missing our 2017 international sales targets, 
the Racing and Digital division’s core recurring tote 
technology service and Bump 50:50 revenues have 
progressed well, providing a clear indication of 
longer term sustained earnings growth and value 
creation emanating from the technology and business 
investments already made.
The sales anticipated in 2017 that did not come to 
fruition have not yet been closed and continue to be 
considered realistic opportunities. Some of these have 
been rolled into our 2018 pipeline, including multiple 
projects in Asia and Europe such as our recently-
announced Quantum™ System upgrade sale to Royal 
Sabah Turf Club of Malaysia. After four years of strong 
sales revenues, with annual average sales exceeding 
USD6.5million and contribution margins of 45%, 2017 
is considered an unusually low sales year. However, 
continued strong growth in recurring commingling 
service revenues helped offset this one-time relatively 
soft year in sales.
Developments
In 2017, key technology advances in the core 
Quantum™ System software were realised and the 
global commingling business grew significantly 
through high-value connections between the UK, 
Asia, Europe, and North America, facilitated by the 
global network of Quantum™ Data and Operations 
Centres. These are Sportech’s proprietary products 
and centres.
The capacity of the Quantum™ System-supported 
global pools and bet types was significantly expanded 
to include exotic complex parlays, of particular 
interest to customers in Asia, and the popular  
French pools offered by ZEturf and PMU.
The North American footprint was strengthened, 
executing 13 long-term contract extensions with 
existing customers, and we further expanded the 
global footprint to include four new customers, 
including Dansk Hestevæddeløb ApS, the joint 
operating company for horseracing and operator of all 
nine racetracks in Denmark. This is in addition to the 
long-standing contract we have with Danske Spil A/S, 
the national lottery in Denmark.
Racing and Digital also continued to enhance and 
promote its digital technologies, rolling-out key 
updates to the G4 white-label betting website 
product and deploying the Digital Link® mobile app, 
along with the self-service BetJet® SL 2.5 betting 
terminals at Ascot racecourse in the UK, under our 
contract with Betfred.
Looking forward
I see additional opportunities in both the North 
American and international markets, some of which 
have already come to fruition.
Since the start of the year, important new contracts 
and contract extensions have been signed in the tote 
services, global commingling, and digital services 
businesses.
Additional commingling agreements have already 
been completed with new customers in Europe: 
Norsk Rikstoto, the foundation that supervises pari-
mutuel betting on horseracing in Norway; and OPAP, 
the holder of exclusive rights to numerical lotteries 
and sports betting in Greece. These commingling 
contracts leverage the Quantum™ System software 
and European hosting and operations services to 
further expand the global commingling footprint and 
the menu of hosted pools and bet types.
A new ten-year, USD10 million agreement with 
Camarero Racetrack has been signed covering both 
Tote and Digital Services and including the provision 
of a new G4 wagering website and Digital Link®   
app to the exclusive operator of horseracing in  
Puerto Rico. 
Long-term Tote customer Parx® Racing once again 
selected Sportech for Tote services under a contract 
extension and also became a new Digital Services 
customer beginning in 2018 under a new five-year, 
USD4.1 million contract, using the G4 website and 
Digital Link® mobile products. Parx® Racing has a 
well-established intrastate account betting operation 
in Pennsylvania and this contract is a significant 
endorsement of Sportech’s digital technology 
platforms.
In North America, I am re-examining our Digital 
Services business with a focus on improving 
profitability and cash generation. We intend to push 
our digital technologies into racetrack and OTB 
operations in order to reduce capital and operational 
costs through the encouragement of “bring your own 
device” mobile apps and websites.
New products will be added to the Quantum™ 
System software including additional lottery products 
currently offered by LEIDSA, (a Sportech customer in 
the Dominican Republic), which would be suitable for 
deployment by other small private lottery operators, 
particularly in Latin America and Asia.

Bump 50:50
Description
The Bump 50:50 sports raffle business provides the 
technologies and services that allow the foundations 
(or charities) associated with professional and 
college sports teams and entertainment venues to 
sell and fulfil 50/50 raffles to generate funds for their 
charitable missions. Jackpots are divided equally 
between the foundation and the winner. Bump 50:50 
electronic raffle technologies and proven marketing 
strategies help foundations maximise the return 
on their charitable fundraising programs. Sportech 
acquired the business in 2014 when the company 
serviced just seven professional sports teams. Since 
then the determination and professional acumen of 
the team has seen our number of clients serviced 
grow to more than 60.
Financial performance
Revenues, currently included within the Racing and 
Digital division, were in 2017 up 46% at £1.2 million 
(2016: £0.8 million). Adjusted EBITDA £0.5 million 
(2016: £0.2 million). 
Developments
The Bump 50:50 business continued its multi-year 
growth trajectory in 2017, signing 25 new customers 
including the official charitable foundations of the 
Atlanta Braves (MLB®), Columbus Blue Jackets 
(NHL®), Houston Rockets (NBA®), Las Vegas 
Golden Knights (new franchise team of the NHL®), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (MLB®), New York Jets (NFL®), and 
the NASCAR Foundation. These additions helped 
bring the total number of Bump 50:50 customers 
to 68, representing foundations from 16 different 
professional and collegiate sports leagues. In 2017, 
Bump 50:50 helped their customer foundations raise 
just under US$11 million.
This year Bump 50:50 launched a new online and 
mobile raffle program to supplement in-stadia play 
and used this new platform to help the Tampa Bay 
Lightning Foundation reach a jackpot record of 
US$270,000 during the NHL® All-Star event.
In 2018, Bump 50:50 will continue its aggressive 
customer acquisition strategy, flexing staff up to 
accommodate additional deployments and to support 
increased sales activity. The company will target more 
non-sports customers – music and other large-scale 
community and entertainment festivals – for the 
online and mobile platforms in particular. The business 
continues to look at revenue enhancing vertical 
markets which may include internationalisation of the 
core product.

white-label betting website technology and a mobile 
app powered by Sportech’s Digital Link® mobile, along 
with a traditional phone betting service featuring 
personal teller betting services.
Developments during the year
In 2017, Venues opened the 25,000 sq.ft. Bobby V’s 
Stamford, featuring 200 high definition TV’s, multi-
functional party spaces, an indoor golf simulator, and 
a designated betting area with VIP spaces and state-
of-the-art betting and viewing carrels in the heart 
of Stamford’s downtown district. Performance to 
date has been below the original expectations set by 
previous management, and we are reviewing growth 
initiatives for this venue, on both the wagering and 
food and beverage sides, including a comprehensive 
and aggressive plan for Group sales and food 
and beverage management, and more proactive 
deployment of mobile betting with Sportech’s  
Digital Link®.
The local management team successfully lobbied the 
Connecticut legislature for permission to open an 
additional six venues over and above the 18 we were 
already permitted to open, which will allow expansion 
and to eventually diversify into sports betting, should 
the laws and regulations be adjusted to permit it.
There remains illegal competition from unlicensed 
internet betting operators who accept wagers from 
Connecticut residents despite being issued cease and 
desist letters by the State’s Attorney General’s office. 
In 2017 and into 2018 we are pursuing new remedies 
available to us, including increased legal protections 
for Connecticut’s only licensed and taxed operator.
Despite this, our brand MyWinners.com achieved an 
11% increase in 2017 from online and mobile handle 
versus prior year. Regardless of the outcome of any 
remedial actions at the state level, the Board is taking 
a much more aggressive and proactive stance with 
regard to promotion and marketing of its digital 
channels. Sportech holds a distinct advantage in 
terms of both technology and access to bricks and 
mortar cross-selling and these advantages will be 
fully exploited to drive customer acquisition and to 
increase betting by customers who may hold multiple 
accounts.
The Venues division capitalises on its operational 
expertise to offer turn-key managed venue packages 
to licensed operators. In 2017, Venues extended 
key managed venue contracts with the Mohegan 
Sun Casino in Connecticut, along with two other 
racebooks in Louisiana and the Caribbean.
Corporate Management Structuring  
and Focus
With a shift in the senior management presence 
from the UK to North America, management 
operations from the Group’s existing London base 
will be relocating to the existing operations centres 
in Toronto and the US, where both I and a new CFO 
will be located. This shift will not only allow reduced 
corporate overhead costs but will also place senior 
corporate management in closer proximity to global 
technology and operational focal points, and the 
consumer-facing business, while maintaining key 
bases of operation and secondary business offices 
at existing locations in Bristol (UK), Ireland and 
Singapore.
Further financial focus will characterise senior 
management of Sportech going forward, with a 
renewed and vigorous focus on billing, debt collection, 
and working capital improvements within the business 
and a stricter financial evaluation of new business 
opportunities, capital investments, and partnerships.
2017 was a year of material change for Sportech 
and 2018 is shaping up to be one of significant 
opportunity. Global recurring service revenues in 
our B2B businesses provide a clear indication of 
growth resulting from several years of technology 
and operational investment. New contracts and 
sales opportunities in the 2018 pipeline speak to the 
efficacy of our technology and business strategy. The 
Bump 50:50 growth trajectory of the past four years 
is on pace to continue, with new sales platforms and 
opportunities in new markets. The Venues business 
now has room for meaningful strategic expansion 
and the tools to more aggressively compete in 
Connecticut’s digital marketplace. Finally, both our 
Venues and our Racing and Digital divisions are well 
positioned to act quickly and decisively on sports 
wagering, if and when the regulations allow it.
I am pleased to be leading Sportech and enthusiastic 
about what the future holds for its shareholders, 
customers and employees. Indeed, at this juncture I 
would like to thank all staff across the Group for their 
hard work and commitment.

Adjusted EBITDA is not an IFRS measure, nevertheless it is widely used by both the analyst community to
compare with other gaming companies, and by management to assess underlying performance. ‘Reported’
revenues refers to revenues as restated (for the exclusion of the Football Pools) for the prior year. ‘Constant
Currency’ revenues refers to prior year revenues retranslated at 2017 exchange rates.

•        Service revenues from Racing and Digital (excluding Bump 50:50) were up 7.3% at £32,890k (2016:
£30,655k), although sales revenues from Racing and Digital were significantly lower at £1,389k (2016:
£6,042), for reasons explained in the Operating review.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4  28/04/2018  01:20  Page 19 •        Revenues from Bump 50:50 were up 40.3% at £1,190k (2016: £848k) and this sub-division continues to
grow healthily as more teams are signed up to the Bump shared raffle offering.
•        Revenues from Venues continue to be primarily driven by wagering. Revenues from this source were down
2.4% in the year at £27,574k (2016: £28,253k). Of this, £2,275k was generated online (2016: £2,257k).
•        Food & Beverage (‘F&B’) revenues were £4,032k (2016: £2,746k). New F&B revenues contributed by
Stamford following its delayed opening in late June 2017 were £1,471k. In line with a drop in handle, F&B
revenues outside of Stamford also fell.

Note 4 – Adjusted operating expenses
Adjusted operating expenses are those expenses largely of a cash nature which exclude:
•        share option charges
•        depreciation
•        amortisation
•        items which by nature or materiality or consistency with 2016 have been regarded by the company as
‘exceptional’. These items are discussed in further detail below.
Adjusted operating expenses, gross of capitalised software, rose by £2,949k at constant currency (7.6%) of
which an additional £739k arose from the recognition of bad debts, and the bulk of the remaining increase
arising from staff (£1,026k) and property (£663k).

Gross employment costs at £28,562k represented 68% of the aggregate of the adjusted operating expenses and
capitalised staff costs (2016: £ 27,536k, 71%). Gross employment costs include the cost of field service agents
whose time and expense is incurred in servicing terminals at customer sites. Net employment costs in this
analysis exclude share-based payments which are disclosed in note 8 below.
Of the £1,026k increase in gross staff costs (at constant currency), the divisional split of the changes is shown

The North American employees are unionised and are entitled to annual wage rises. Other staff cost increases
chiefly arose in venues where extra staff were taken on for the running of the expanded “Bobby V’s” sports bar
in Stamford, Connecticut. Significant savings were made in the corporate function with a downsizing of both
staff and office premises.
As part of the restructuring exercise undertaken by the Non-executive Directors, the cost base of the corporate
function was reduced.
The composition of the costs, gross of capitalised software across the divisions was as follows:

On 25 September 2017, the Group sold its shares in NYX for net proceeds of £2,333k. Those shares were
originally acquired as part of the Group’s disposal of Sportech-NYX Gaming, LLC in 2015, at which point the
share price was CAD $4.06. Those shares have been subsequently revalued as available for sale financial assets,
and losses realised when shares are disposed of.
This resulted in a loss of £1,603k which we have disclosed as a separate item. A mark-to-market loss of £746k
was recognised in 2016 and shown within exceptional items.
Owing to the magnitude of the loss and the fact that the asset has been disposed of, we believe it is more
instructive for the readers to show the loss this year, and the mark-to-market revaluation last year, as a separate
reported item.
Other separately reported items are listed below:
2016
£000’s 2017 Reported
Restructuring and redundancy costs (note a) 2,291 492
Costs of exit from California (note b) 2,740 180
Transaction costs from material M&A activity (note c) — 4,350
Lobbying and licencing costs (note d) 264 175
Costs of implementing new VCP (note e) 150 —
Other exceptional items (net) 158 320
5,603 5,517
Note a: On 18 September 2017, the Company announced the departure of the incumbent CEO and CFO. This was
accompanied by a strategic review and Formal Sales Process under the Takeover Code following a series of initial
approaches made to the Company. The costs of honouring the contracts of those departing executives along
with some other staff in senior positions represents the majority of the costs of restructuring and redundancy.
£680k of these costs were paid after the year end.
Note b: The Group had a number of contractual arrangements in the State of California, none of which was
profitable and included real-estate leases for a considerable duration with no benefit to the Group. These have
been provided for in full, with certain other items also written off.
Note c: Transaction costs relate to those incurred in the Group’s Football Pools disposal. This disposal was
completed in H1-17, with additional disposal costs incurred during the year of £3,248k. Those 2017 costs have
been presented as part of the loss on disposal of Football Pools as shown in note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Note d: Given the political nature of lobbying, the costs of presenting the case for liberalising sports betting and
gambling in Connecticut, along with costs incurred in obtaining a licence in New Jersey have been disclosed
separately.
Note e: A new incentive plan was introduced in the year, the Value Creation Plan (“VCP”), as approved by
shareholders on 24 May 2017. The substantial cost of designing this scheme and implementing it is disclosed as a
separate item.

The Group successfully won its VAT case in relation to the Spot the Ball product against HMRC in 2016. Further
receipts, net of costs, were recognised during the year, representing primarily recovery of legal and advisory
costs awarded by the Court to the defendants.
Note 8 – Share based payments
2016
£000’s 2017 Reported
Accelerated charge for departing executives and directors (3,765) —
Normalised charges (666) 87
(4,431) 87
Under IFRS, charges arise from events at the date of grant, whether the options ultimately lapse or not. There
was a charge accelerated by the departure of the former CEO and CFO along with one other non-Board
executive.
The modelling of the overall cost of the VCP was done by a ‘big-four’ accounting firm other than the auditors.
The option plan adopted by shareholders earlier in 2017 (the ‘VCP’) was essentially a 20% capital growth pool
over a 8% compound hurdle to the ex-div share price. The starting point was a cum-div price of 97.8 pence.
Black Scholes modelling was used.
The departing executives had between them 52% of that £7 million pool. Together with other outstanding PSP
awards an accelerated charge of £3,765k has been recognised in 2017. It is non-cash in nature.
Note 9 – Depreciation and amortisation
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are depreciated/amortised over their useful lives as disclosed in the notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Both charges have reduced from prior year primarily due to impairment
charges made to certain assets in 2016. However, in 2017 the Group incurred further costs of £5,238k in the
construction and fit-out of the new Stamford Venue (2016: £2,451k), and the depreciation of these tangible fixed
assets amounted to £200k during the year.
Note 10 – Amortisation of acquired intangibles
Intangible assets acquired on the acquisitions of eBet, Datatote and Bump relate primarily to customer
relationships, the most material of which reached the end of its useful life in 2016. All those acquired intangible
assets are fully amortised as at December 2017.
Note 11 – Asset impairments
2016
£000’s 2017 Reported
Impairment of PPE 874 5,089
Impairment of goodwill — 1,843
Impairment of intangible assets 12,040 14,220
Site preparation and construction costs in the town of Norco, California, were incurred by the Group in previous
years when a new venue build was anticipated. The Group is evaluating its involvement in California and
accordingly the capitalised costs (£874k) in respect of those sites have been impaired.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4  28/04/2018  01:20  Page 25 In 2016, goodwill relating to the eBet business (within Racing and Digital) was fully impaired. There is no
goodwill held on the balance sheet at December 2017, given that the disposal of the Football Pools during the
year (see note 16) eliminated the goodwill held for that asset.
The Group is obligated to conduct an impairment review of its business units each year based on events that
existed on the balance sheet date and not on events regarding legislation or liberalisation which might occur
after the balance sheet date. Accordingly, the softer level of betting transactions in the Venues business has led
to a downgrading of its accounting value and an impairment charge has been taken of £12,040k. Impairments
totalling £14,220k in 2016 were also recognised comprising £13,127k against Racing and Digital assets, and
£1,093k against Venues assets.
Note 12 – Loss on disposal of investments
As disclosed in note 6, the Group has recognised a loss of £1,603k in respect of a disposal of its investments in
NYX Gaming Group Limited (2016: £746k).
Note 13 – Joint ventures
Following the decision to exit from its business interests in California, the Board considers there to be insufficient
certainty around the recoverable value of the Group’s investment in its joint venture sports bar, “Striders”, in San
Diego, and a provision has been made against the entire investment, £1.2 million.

(19) (542)
Following the receipt of funds relating to Spot the Ball and the sale of the Football Pools, the Group discharged
all its bank loans and has operated in a cash surplus position in 2017.
Note 15 – Taxation
The Group has recognised a net tax credit of £230k due primarily to losses made in the US which can be
carried-forward for up to 20 years and relieved against future profits.
The gross losses provided for as a deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 were £19.5 million (2016: £11.8 million).
It is anticipated that the Group will recover those tax losses within ten years.
The approximate tax base cost of the individual divisions (and therefore the one on which any capital gain would
be assessed in the case of a partial break-up of the Group) is shown below:
Racing and Digital $10 million (approximately £7.1 million)
Venues $20 million (approximately £14.3 million)
US rates of capital gains tax range from 25% to 35%.

The Group’s Football Pools business was sold in June 2017 on which a net loss on disposal (after tax) has been
recognised of £8,467k. This includes disposal costs recognised in 2017 of £3,248k and a corporation tax charge
of £6,395k.
As disclosed further in note 20 of this financial review, the Group considered its Venues business in the
Netherlands to be held for sale, with its future economic benefit recovered principally through a sale transaction,
and an SPA signed in March 2018. Accordingly, the results from this business have been presented as a
discontinued operation. The net gain/loss on this disposal will be recognised in the 2018 financial statements.

An estimation of the consideration arising from the disposal terms of the investment in NYX Gaming LLC, but
contingent on NYX signing new customers up to their wagering platform. NYX have an obligation to inform
Sportech each time a customer is acquired to this platform, with the Group entitled to CAD $1 million for each
customer signed up, up to a maximum of CAD $3 million. The Group continue to believe that the maximum
contingent amount will be due. This is discounted and accrues over the relevant period (to May 2020). At
December 2017, £1,546k is held on the balance sheet in respect of this receivable.

As at the balance sheet date, the Group’s Venues business in the Netherlands was considered to be a held for

Note 21 – Trade receivables
Current asset trade receivables of £7,339k (2016: £7,427k) represent 40 days of revenue (2016: 42 days). Certain
provisions have been made for debtors outstanding for period significantly overdue. These amounted to £1,606k
(2016: £1,537k). In certain circumstances, arrangements have been reached with other customers to spread
significantly overdue debts over a longer period.
Current and non-current trade receivables are combined in the table below:

Current trade receivables within the Racing and Digital division total £6,469k (2016: £6,654k) representing 67
days of revenue in both current and prior year. Within the Venues division, current trade receivables total £870k
(2016: £773k), which equates to 10 days of revenue in both reporting periods.
Note 22 – Inventories
Inventory held was £2,652k (2016: £2,504k). This consists of work in progress, £99k (2016: £219k); Tote machines,
£240k (2016: £210k); and machine parts available for deployment, £2,313k (2016: £2,075k). The Group has a
significant number of terminals that are deployed on customer sites, many of which are older models. There is a
requirement therefore for the Group to hold a proportional amount of spare parts for the terminals that are
being used by customers. A review of inventory led the Board to conclude that given certain spare parts had not
been utilised for a considerable period of time, £126k should be recognised as obsolete and provided against,
increasing the total inventory provision to £310k.

Group cash, excluding Holland 15,885
Customer cash 2,872

Of the cash held by the Group, it is estimated that approximately £3 million is required at any one time to
facilitate working capital requirements, including holding cash in venue tills and vaults. Those working capital
requirements do vary throughout the year dependant on the timing of inflows and outflows, including most
notably the timing of terminal builds, major races and payment by customers for one-off sales.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4  28/04/2018  01:20  Page 30 Note 24 – Defined benefit pension liabilities
The Group retains the legacy obligation for the Football Pools pension scheme in which all 63 members are
retired. There is in an IAS19R surplus of £9k at December 2017 for this scheme. The Group is actively trying to
secure a buy-out for the scheme, not least as the actuarial and trustee fees each year of running this scheme
amount to around £80k. Payments into the scheme during the year totalled £305k (2016: £112k), with a one-off
increase in the payments being made to fully fund the scheme’s liabilities.
In addition, the Group’s US employees are enrolled in pension schemes which have a deficit of £1,546k. The US
legal obligation is to fund these schemes no less than 85% of the liability.
The payments made to the US schemes in the year was £223k (2016: £205k). US law requires that any actuarial
deficit as measured in any one year is funded to not less than 85% in the subsequent financial year. Thus there
will be an accelerated cash funding of these schemes required in 2018 of around £0.6 million.

within other receivables on the balance sheet.
Note 26 – Taxation liabilities and items subject to challenge
Following the successful Spot the Ball VAT reclaim, the Group is aware that HMRC are closely examining all the
Group’s tax affairs. The Board, after taking professional advice, believe that the liabilities recorded in these
financial statements are correct, and whilst they are open to challenge, the Group’s position will be defended
robustly.
In order to progress an appeal, the Group is making one against HMRC for VAT on head office costs going back
a number of years. The Group has made an ‘in escrow’ payment to HMRC of £1.3 million in Q1-2018. The Board,
having taken professional advice on this matter, believe this is fully recoverable.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt4  28/04/2018  01:20  Page 32 Note 27 – Contingent liabilities and litigation
The Group is engaged in certain disputes in the ordinary course of business which could potentially lead to
outflows greater than those provided for on the balance sheet. The maximum possible exposure considered to
exist, in view of advice received from the Group’s professional advisors, is up to £0.5 million. Management are of
the view that the risk of those outflows arising is not probable and accordingly they have been disclosed as
contingent items rather than recognised as liabilities in the financial statements.

Measuring risk
The Group’s risk management strategy is to consider
risks arising from each area of the business through a
top-down and bottom-up approach. This is achieved
by the communication through the Group of a risk
appetite statement.
The Board established and approved a risk appetite
statement in 2015, which has been distributed to the
management teams of the operating segments. This
statement, which has been reviewed by the Board
during the year, provides guidance on the Group’s
appetite for risk across business areas and supports
the management teams in determining the
appropriate balance of risk and return within their
businesses.
The management teams of each business units assess
risk and formally update their business-specific risk
registers. Risks are measured in relation to their
mitigated likelihood and their prospective impact
were they to arise, in accordance with the following
risks matrix:
The Board formally reviews a Group principal risk
register annually. Principal risks to the Group are
considered to be those risks identified by the
operating segments as having an overall rating of
eight or higher or an impact of four despite the low
level of mitigated likelihood.
The table below shows the Board’s assessment of the
most significant risks to Sportech PLC as a group, the
potential impact of such risks and the mitigating
activities that the Group carries out to reduce the
likelihood and impact of such risks.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Board has assessed the prospects of the Group
over a longer period than the 12 months required by
the going concern requirements of the UK Corporate
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). This longer-term
assessment process supports the Board’s statements
on both viability, as set out below, and going concern,
made on page 71. The Board conducted this review
for a period up to December 2020, which was
selected for the following reasons:
i.        The Group’s strategic review process generally
covers a three-year period.
ii.       The Group’s operations are underpinned by
largely stable businesses and medium-term
contracts, allowing for sufficient certainty to
forecast results for this length of time.
The most recent strategic review, (completed
13 March 2018) considered the Group’s cash flows,
earnings, leverage, and other key financial ratios over
the period. These metrics were subject to sensitivity
analysis which involved flexing a number of the main
assumptions underlying the forecast, both individually
and in unison. The assumptions included the impact
of the potential occurrence of the Group’s principal
risks and the effectiveness of available mitigating
actions, other than the impact of a loss of a key
licence or severe technology failure. These were not
included within the forecasts as it is the Board’s
opinion that the likelihood of those risks occurring is
minimal.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors
have a reasonable expectation that the Company will
be able to continue in operation and meet its
liabilities, as they fall due, over the period of their
assessment.
Viability Statement
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 37 The Group endeavours to act responsibly for all its
stakeholders, including not only its shareholders,
employees, and its customers but the wider public
and the environment.
The Group’s divisions hold licences to permit the
provision of business-to-business services for pari-
mutuel betting on horse and greyhound racing in
over 30 jurisdictions in the Americas and Europe.
Licences for business-to-consumer activity for the
same products are held in Connecticut, California and
The Netherlands, and for a wider range of gambling
products in the UK.
The Group General Counsel and local legal counsel
ensure the Group meets its policy of maintaining the
highest standards of compliance and integrity. The
Group also employs security and compliance staff
whose primary role is to ensure that our customers
are treated fairly, that our advertising is compliant
with advertising standards and codes, that the young
and vulnerable are prevented from accessing our
products, and that abuse and illegal behaviour are
identified and stopped. All gaming products are
subject to age restrictions and age verification
software is used by the Group where appropriate.
Whilst the Company, and a number of its subsidiaries,
are incorporated in the UK, the bulk of the operations
are based in North America where standards and
regulation are different to the EU. The Group
therefore has to balance all its obligations under all
the jurisdictions it operates in which imposes strains
on its cost base which we aim to mitigate through
efficiencies wherever possible.
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibility to achieve
good environmental practice and continues to strive
to improve its environmental impact. The nature of its
business results in the principal environmental impact
arising from energy and paper consumption.
Wherever possible, waste consumable materials are
recycled or disposed of in a manner most suitable to
reduce any impact on the natural environment. The
Group’s business practices encourage the use of
technology to facilitate information, data collection
and dissemination, which has led to reduced demand
for paper resources. All employees are encouraged to
participate in the implementation of this policy and
suppliers of consumable products are encouraged to
be environmentally friendly, wherever practical.
The Company has an obligation under the UK
Companies Act 2006 to report on greenhouse gas
emissions. In 2017, an increase in intensity of 13% is
seen as the new Stamford venue has opened and
remains in its trading infancy. As the popularity of the
venue grows, and the Group’s one-off sales move
back towards normalised levels, this intensity will
reduce.
The Group remains focused on supporting good
causes in the communities where our customers live
and our businesses operate, and identifying further
opportunities to continue this support.
Through its Bump 50:50 subsidiary, the Group has
raised just under $11m for sports foundations in the
US and Canada in 2017, including those associated
with Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Braves, and Vegas
Golden Knights.
Employees
The Board is acutely aware of the vital contribution of
employees to the future success of the business. It
recognises the importance of providing employees
with information on matters of concern to them,
enabling employees to improve their performance
and make an active contribution to the achievement
of the Group’s business objectives. This is
accomplished through formal and informal briefings
and meetings.
Employee representatives are consulted regularly on
a wide range of matters affecting their interests. The
Group launched a recent bi-monthly employee
newsletter and awards programme to reflect the
progressive training and development programmes
that are in place within the business.
The Group is committed to equality of opportunity
and dignity at work for all, irrespective of race, colour,
creed, ethnic or national origins, gender, marital
status, sexuality, disability, class or age. It ensures that
recruitment and promotion decisions are made solely
on the basis of suitability for the job. Information on
gender diversity is contained in the Corporate
governance report on page 45.

It is the policy of the Group to comply with the
requirements of the UK Disability and Equality Act
2010 in offering equality of opportunity to disabled
persons applying for employment, selection being
made on the basis of the most suitable person for the
job in respect of experience and qualifications.
Training, career development and promotion are

Every effort is made to continue to employ, in the
same or alternative employment, and where
necessary to retrain employees who become disabled
during their employment with the Group.
The Group proactively addresses health and safety
management and it has a programme of risk
identification, management and improvement in
place. The Board receives a report in respect of
health and safety across all of its businesses at each
Board meeting.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 39 Sportech is committed to a high standard of
corporate governance and, throughout the financial
year ended 31 December 2017, has complied with the
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the ‘Code’), save as described in the paragraphs
below. A copy of the Code is publicly available from
www.frc.org.uk. It is the policy of the Board to
manage the affairs of the Company in accordance
with the principles of the Code so far as the Board is
able and believes it is practical.
The Board has undergone significant changes in the
period under review largely occasioned by the
historical decision to dispose of the Football Pools,
and the subsequent decision to undertake a strategic
review which involved a Formal Sales Process – an
event that terminated on 13 March 2018.

The Company ended the year with two Independent
Directors, although did not have this throughout the
year.
For the period from 1 January 2017 until 24 May 2017,
the company was not in compliance with the Code in
its requirement to have two independent Directors as
members of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination
Committees.
The Company did not have a Senior Independent
Director throughout the period.
Notwithstanding the above, the Board is comfortable
that it has achieved, and continues to achieve, good
governance, as a result of the experience of the
Chairman and the appointment of Richard Cooper as
a new Independent Non-executive Director on 24 May
2017 and the additional appointment of Giles Vardey
as an Independent Director on 17 November 2017.
The Company confirms that Richard Cooper, former
CFO of FTSE250 company GVC Holdings PLC, has
the recent, relevant financial expertise required to
effectively challenge and review accounting
judgements and reporting. With this, and the
extensive corporate experience of Richard McGuire
and Giles Vardey in mind, the Company is
comfortable that the Committees have continued to
function to a high standard throughout, and robustly
challenge management and the preparation of the
financial statements.
The search for a further new Independent Non-
executive Director, is being undertaken and the Board
has been mindful of its responsibility to appoint an
individual who achieves the appropriate balance of
skills, experience, independence and knowledge of
the Company to enable them to discharge their
respective duties and responsibilities effectively.
Further to this, the Board anticipates announcing the
appointment of a further Independent Non-executive
Director to the Board imminently.
The Chairman is no longer a member of the Audit or
Remuneration Committees although chairs the
Nominations Committee.
As announced on Tuesday 24 April 2018, the
Company has identified a suitable CFO candidate and
is conducting final appraisals before announcing their
appointment in due course.
Conflicts of Interest
The Board has a procedure in place to deal with a
situation where a Director has a conflict of interest, as
required by the Companies Act 2006. As part of this
process, the members of the Board prepare a list of
other positions held and all other conflict situations
that may need authorising either in relation to the
Director concerned or his or her connected persons.
The Board considers each Director’s situation and
decides whether to approve any conflict situations,
taking into consideration what is in the best interests
of the Company and whether the Director’s ability to
act in accordance with his or her wider duties is
affected. Each Director is required to notify the
Company Secretary of any potential or actual conflict
situations that will need to be authorised by the
Board. Authorisations given by the Board are
reviewed annually.

Board Effectiveness
The Board of Directors is responsible for the
management of the business of the Company and its
long-term success. It may exercise all the powers of
the Company subject to the provisions of relevant
statutes and the Company’s Articles. The Articles, for
instance, contain specific provisions and restrictions
regarding the Company’s power to borrow money. A
copy of the Articles is available on the Company’s
website.
The Board has undergone a series of changes in the
year but now has in place an industry experienced
Chief Executive (Andrew Gaughan), two independent
Non-executives and has commenced a search for a
CFO to be based in the East Coast of North America
alongside the operational teams and the Group
General Counsel.
The Company maintains Directors and Officers
insurance cover.
Board Performance Evaluation
The Board is satisfied that each Director continues to
show the necessary commitment, allocates sufficient
time to discharge their duties and continues to be an
effective member of the Board due to their skills,
expertise and business acumen.
The Code provides that the Non-executive Directors
should meet without the chairman present at least
annually to appraise the Chairman’s performance and
on such other occasions as are deemed appropriate.
The performance of Richard McGuire, the current
Chairman, appointed on 24 May 2017 will be reviewed
as part of the Board Evaluation process to be
conducted on the anniversary of his appointment.
The Code also requires the performance of Non-
executive Directors to be appraised and this will be
done on the anniversary of their respective
appointments.
Board Meetings
The Board meets regularly. Certain matters are
considered at all Board meetings, including a business
update, a financial update, business development
opportunities and operational issues. Directors unable
to attend a Board meeting receive all materials to be
presented and can discuss any issue which may arise
with the Chairman or any Executive Director. The
meetings held in the year were as follows:

The Committees of the Board are:
•        Audit Committee
•        Remuneration Committee
•        Nomination Committee.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises two
independent Non-executives, Richard Cooper, as the
Chairman, and Giles Vardey. During the period before
the appointment of Giles Vardey, Richard McGuire
also was a member of the Committee.
The Committee is scheduled to meet at least three times
a year. The Committee’s main responsibilities include
reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts and Interim
Report, including considering significant financial
reporting issues and judgements that they contain. The
Committee reviews, and challenges where necessary, the
consistency and changes to accounting policies,
methods used to account for significant and unusual
transactions, whether the Company has followed
appropriate accounting standards and the clarity of
disclosure in the Company’s financial statements. Further
to this, the Committee has delegated from the Board the
responsibility for review of the effectiveness of internal
controls, the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and
the need for an internal audit function as well as the
scope, extent and effectiveness of such a function.
The Group acknowledges that DTR 7.1.1A had been
breached following the revision to the Rule for the
period beginning 1 January 2017, in relation to the
majority of members of the Audit Committee being
independent. Following the appointment of Giles
Vardey that breach was rectified.
Members of the senior finance team are invited to
attend the Committee as appropriate.
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to
financial reporting is the review with both
management and the external Auditor of the
appropriateness of the half-year and annual financial
statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
•        consistency of the Annual Report as a whole
and ensuring it presents a fair, balanced and
understandable picture of the Company as well
as providing shareholders with the information
necessary to assess the Company’s
performance, business model and strategy;
•        the quality and acceptability of accounting
policies and practices;
•        the clarity of the disclosures and compliance
with financial reporting standards and relevant
financial and governance reporting
requirements;
•        material areas in which significant judgements
have been applied or there has been discussion
with the external Auditors; and
•        any correspondence from regulators in relation
to financial reporting.
The Committee considered internal reports from the
senior finance staff together with the external
Auditors’ report in their half-year review and annual
audit, in reviewing the Group’s financial reporting
function.
The primary areas of judgement considered by the
Committee in relation to the 2017 financial statements
were:
•        the assumptions underlying impairment testing
of the Group’s intangible assets;
•        the exposure to tax liabilities; and
•        the carrying value of contingent consideration
receivable from NYX
In order to be comfortable with the consistency,
fairness and accuracy of these financial statements
the following was undertaken in relation to these key
areas of judgement:
•        detailed review and discussion of models used
for impairment testing; and
•        scenario analysis
In testing assets for impairment, the key assumptions
underpinning their value-in-use are discount rates and
growth rates applied to projected earnings. These
assumptions are inherently judgemental. The
Committee considers those judgements in light of
regular updates received on business plans and
performance against targets, and has challenged
management as to their rational for recognising
impairments in the current year. In addition, the
Committee considers findings of the work of the
Auditors in this area.
In reviewing the exposure to potential tax liabilities,
the Audit Committee review the key assumptions and
liaise with its external advisors to understand the
range of possible outcomes given change in
particular judgements. Correspondence from tax

authorities, if any, is also reviewed. The reasonableness
of management’s judgement is also considered in the
light of the work of the Auditors.
In assessing the carrying value of the contingent
consideration receivable from NYX, the Committee
receives updates from executive management on the
development of the North American online gaming
market and the pertinent regulatory and commercial
issues.
External audit
The Committee is responsible for the relationship with
the external Auditors. The Committee considers the
nature and extent of non-audit services provided by
the Auditors in order to seek to balance the
maintenance of objectivity, access to applicable
technical expertise and value for money. To help
avoid the objectivity and independence of the
external Auditors becoming compromised, the
Committee has a formal policy governing the
engagement of the external Auditor to provide
non-audit services.
This policy precludes PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
from providing certain services such as internal audit
work or accounting services and as of 1 January 2017,
tax advice and any advisory service which ultimately
has an impact, material in size, on the treatment of
items in the financial statements. The Group complies
with the new ethical standards which also require that
fees for non-audit services do not exceed 70% of the
average of the audit fee for the prior three years,
prospectively from 1 January 2017. For all other
services the Board must approve spend on discrete
projects in excess of £10k. The Committee is regularly
updated on the spend to date with the external
Auditors and also with other financial advisers.
The Auditors are also subject to professional
standards that safeguard the integrity of their
auditing role. The Committee remains confident that
the objectivity and independence of the external
Auditors are not in any way impaired by reason of the
audit and non-audit services which they provide to
the Group. Moreover, the Committee is satisfied that
such work is best handled by them, either because of
their knowledge of the Group or because they have
been awarded it through a competitive tendering
process. In addition, the independence of the
Auditors is safeguarded by the use of separate teams
for individual assignments such as acquisition due
diligence and the audit being subject to internal
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP quality control
procedures. A breakdown of non-audit fees charged
by the Auditors is disclosed in note 7 in the Notes to
the financial statements. A significant proportion of
the non-audit fees charged by the Auditors in 2017
relates to work undertaken in respect of corporate
activity. It was concluded by the Committee that it
was in the interest of the Company to purchase these
services on a single tender basis from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP due to the cumulative
historical knowledge already gained, the timing of the
work, the tie-in to the financial statements and
confidentiality.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is
dependent on appropriate audit risk identification
and at the start of the audit cycle the Company
receives from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a detailed
audit plan (‘Audit Strategy Memorandum’), identifying
their assessment of these key risks. For 2017 the
significant and elevated risks identified were in
relation to:
•        impairment of intangible assets
•        uncertain tax positions
•        carrying value of contingent consideration in
relation to NYX.
The Committee has time with the external Auditors
without management present at each meeting to
provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and
feedback. Matters typically discussed include the
Auditors’ assessment of business risks and
management activity thereon; the transparency and
openness of interactions with management;
confirmation that there has been no restriction in
scope placed on them by management;
independence of their audit; and how they have
exercised professional scepticism. The Chairman of
the Audit Committee also has regular discussions
with the external audit partner outside the formal
Committee process.
Appointment and reappointment
The Committee considers the reappointment of the
external Auditors, including the rotation of the audit
partner each year, and also assesses their
independence on an ongoing basis. The external
Auditors are required to rotate the audit partner
responsible for the Group audit every five years. The
current lead audit partner, Nigel Reynolds, has
performed the role since 2014.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the
Company’s external Auditors for more than 20 years,
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 43 although a competitive tender process was
conducted in 2006.
As part of the Committee’s review of the objectivity
and effectiveness of the audit process, an assessment
was made not to put the audit engagement out to
tender in 2017. The Committee will continue to assess
the appropriate time at which an audit tender process
should be conducted and continues to assess the
effectiveness, independence and value for money of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Transitional
arrangements in the new ethical standards allow for
the Auditor to remain in place for no longer than six
years from 16 June 2014 and as such
PricewaterhouseCoopers will be allowed to remain as
the Group’s Auditor until post signing of the
31 December 2019 financial statements, at which
point the Group will be required to rotate its Auditor.
The Audit Committee provided the Board with its
recommendation to the shareholders on the
reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
external Auditors for the year ending 31 December
2017 and as a result, in accordance with Section 489
of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution proposing
the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
as our Auditors will be put to shareholders at the
impending AGM. There are no contractual obligations
restricting the Committee’s choice of external
Auditors and we do not indemnify our external
Auditors. The Committee will keep the appointment
of the external Auditors under annual review.
Internal control and internal audit
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
This responsibility has been delegated to the Audit
Committee. On this basis, there is an ongoing process
for identifying, evaluating and managing significant
risks faced by the Group. Such a system is designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. Controls are monitored
by management review. Data consolidated into the
Group’s financial statements is reconciled to the
underlying financial systems. A review of the
consolidated data is undertaken by management to
ensure that the true position and results of the Group
are reflected through compliance with approved
accounting policies and the appropriate accounting
for non-routine transactions.
The Group performs an annual strategy and
budgeting process and the Board approves the
annual Group budget as part of its normal
responsibilities. The Group results are reported
monthly to the Board. Regular reforecasts are
undertaken and are produced for the Board whenever
significant financial trends are identified in the
periods between the quarterly assessments.
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the
internal control environment of the Group, excluding
that of the Group’s joint ventures. It receives reports
from the external Auditors, which include
recommendations for improvement. The Audit
Committee’s role in this area is confined to a high-
level review of the arrangements for internal control.
Significant risk issues are referred to the Board for
consideration. The principal risks facing the Group
and the mitigating actions taken by the Board and
management are included on pages 35 and 36 of the
Strategic report.
To manage lower-level risks, a risk management
programme is in place, supported by a business
control and risk self-assessment process and a
business continuity plan. The risk management
programme places responsibility on managers to
identify risks facing each business unit and for
implementing procedures to mitigate these risks. The
risk appraisal process is regularly reviewed by the
Board and accords with the UK Corporate
Governance Guidance. The Audit Committee and
Board have reviewed the effectiveness of the internal
controls of the Group for the year ended
31 December 2017 and up to the date of approval of
the Annual Report and Accounts. This review covered
controls in areas of finance, operations, risk
management and compliance.
The Group does not have an internal audit function.
The Audit Committee has considered the use of an
internal audit function during the year but considers
that due to the size and nature of the Group there is
not a requirement for such an internal function. The
central Group Finance function continues to
undertake certain work of an internal audit nature and
reports its findings to the Audit Committee. The
Committee will continue to assess the need for
specific internal audit reviews and an ongoing internal
audit strategy during the coming months.
Whistleblowing policy
The Company is committed to providing a safe and
confidential avenue for all employees within the
Group to raise concerns about serious wrongdoings.
The Company also acknowledges the requirements of
the UK Corporate Governance Code in this regard,

which states that the Audit Committee should review
arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in
confidence, raise concerns about possible
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other
matters. Further to this, an appropriate policy so as
to encourage and enable staff to raise any such
concerns is in place and has been throughout the
year. No instances of serious wrongdoing have been
reported to the Audit Committee during the period.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee of the Board currently
comprises the Non-executive Directors. It is Chaired
by Giles Vardey.
The purpose of the Committee is to ensure that the
remuneration of Executive Directors and senior
Executives, together with their terms and conditions
of employment, is sufficient to recruit and retain
individuals of the calibre required to ensure profitable
growth of the business. The Remuneration report is
set out on pages 47 to 69.
Nominations Committee
The Nomination Committee currently comprises the
Non-executive Directors and is Chaired by Richard
McGuire, the Chairman of the Company.
Objectives
The Committee’s main objectives are to lead the
process for any new appointments to the Board,
whether Executive or Non-executive, and make
recommendations to the Board in relation to the
same, evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and
experience on the Board, consider any matters
relating to the continuation in office of any Director
at any time, review Committee memberships, and
formulate plans for succession.
Activities
The Nomination Committee’s activities are
underpinned by the principle that all appointments
should be made on merit, against objective criteria
and with due regard to the benefits of diversity on
the Board. Accordingly, the Committee prepares a
description of the role and capabilities required for a
particular appointment. Notably, during the year
under review, the Committee recommended to the
Board:
•        the appointment of Richard Cooper as an
Independent Non-executive Director and
Chairman of the Audit Committee
•        the appointment of Giles Vardey as an
Independent Non-executive Director and
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
•        the appointment of Andrew Gaughan as CEO
with effect from 14 March 2018
The Committee, in its recommendations to the Board,
acknowledges that diversity extends beyond the
boardroom and supports management in their efforts
to build a diverse organisation throughout the Group.
Out of a workforce of approximately 560 employees,
32% are female and out of 21 members of senior
management 33% are female.
The Committee endorses the Company’s policy to
attract and develop a highly qualified and diverse
workforce; to ensure that all selection decisions are
based on merit and that all recruitment activities are
fair and non-discriminatory. Although at present there
are no female Board members, the Committee
acknowledges the importance of diversity, including
gender, to the effective functioning of the Board.
Furthermore, the Board acknowledges the
recommendations of the Davies Report, and supports
the principle of improving, in particular, gender
imbalance, both at a Board level and throughout its
businesses. Subject to securing suitable candidates,
when recruiting additional Directors and/or filling
vacancies that arise when Directors do not seek re-
election, we will seek to appoint new Directors who
fit the skills criteria and gender balance that is in line
with the Company’s policy.
We continue to focus on encouraging diversity of
business skills and experience, recognising that
Directors with diverse skill sets, capabilities and
experience gained from different geographic and
cultural backgrounds enhance the Board.
Investors
There is regular dialogue with shareholders through a
planned programme of investor relations which
includes formal presentations of the Group’s results
by members of the Board. Meetings also take place
with institutional investors and analysts on a regular
basis and there is regular communication with
shareholders through the Annual and Interim Reports
and Sportech’s corporate website
(www.sportechplc.com). They are also available at
other times, outside close periods, to enter into
dialogue with these shareholders. All shareholders
have the opportunity to question the Board at the
AGM both formally and informally. The Non-executive
Directors have taken steps to develop an
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 45 understanding of the views of the major shareholders
about the Company through face-to-face contact and
analyst and broker briefings.
All resolutions at the 2017 AGM held on 24 May 2017
were voted by way of a manual poll. This follows best
practice and allows the Company to count all votes
rather than just those of shareholders attending the
meeting.
As recommended by the Code, all resolutions were
voted separately and the voting results, which
included all votes cast for, against and those withheld,
together with all proxies lodged prior to the meeting,
were indicated at the meeting and the final results
were released to the London Stock Exchange as soon
as practicable after the meeting. The announcement
was also made available on the Company’s corporate
website. As in previous years, the proxy form and the
announcement of the voting results made it clear that
a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not be
counted in the calculation of the proportion of the
votes for or against the resolution.
The Board recognises the high level of withholding of
votes and abstentions in relation to the Auditors’
remuneration (resolution 6) and reappointment
(resolution 5) respectively at the 2017 AGM. The
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
external Auditors is subject to regular review by the
Audit Committee and it is the belief of the
Committee, as stated in the Audit Committee report,
that the effectiveness, independence and value for
money of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external
Auditors remains appropriate.

Letter from the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present, for
the first time as Sportech’s Remuneration Committee
chair, the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
This report comprises an annual report on
remuneration which describes how the shareholder
approved Directors’ remuneration policy was
implemented for the year ended 31 December 2017
and how we intend for the policy to apply for the
year ending 31 December 2018. This report, together
with this annual statement, will be put to an advisory
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
Our approach to remuneration is governed by our
directors’ remuneration policy which, along with a
new long-term incentive arrangement, the Value
Creation Plan (“VCP”), received binding shareholder
approval at the General Meeting on 24 May 2017 and
came into formal effect from that date. The current
intention is for the policy to operate over the three-
year period to 2020 and shareholders will not
therefore be asked to approve any revisions at the
2018 AGM. However, to ensure clarity and
transparency we have republished our directors’
remuneration policy report herewith (pages 49 to 58).
Performance and remuneration for
2017
Our FY2017 performance-related bonus was subject
to adjusted Group EBITDA targets alongside a
number of strategic objectives aligned with the KPIs
of the business. The threshold level of EBITDA was
not met and no bonus was therefore payable for this
element. However, as set out in detail in the Strategic
report, the Company delivered against a number of
strategically important objectives during the year
under review including, for example, concluding the
sale of the Football Pools (realising in the process
around £80 million cash net of tax for the Group). A
number of the strategic measures set for the
Executive Directors were thus achieved in full or in
part and overall bonuses earned were 40% of
maximum for Ian Penrose (former Chief Executive
Officer), 43% of maximum for Mickey Kalifa (former
Chief Financial Officer) and 4% of maximum for
Andrew Gaughan, formerly President of Sportech
Racing and Digital, and since March 2018, Group
CEO).
With regards to our longer-term performance, the
FY2015 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) awards
which were granted on 9 March 2015 were subject to
earnings per share (50% of the award) and relative
total shareholder return (50% of the award) targets
measured over a three-year performance period.
Earnings per share failed to meet the stretching
threshold target and so that part of the award lapsed.
However, total shareholder return exceeded the upper
quartile of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding
investment trusts) over the performance period and
therefore that part of the award vested in full. As a
result, 50% of the award overall will vest.
Implementation of remuneration policy
for 2018
The remuneration package for our executive directors
will continue to be made up of base salary, plus
pension contributions and benefits, and, subject to
stretching performance conditions, an annual bonus
paid in cash. The current Executive Directors received
one-off awards under the VCP in 2017 and it is not
currently intended that any further long-term
incentive plan awards will be made to them as a
result. Within this framework we will be taking the
following approach to the implementation of the
remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December
2018:
–        Salary – Andrew Gaughan was promoted to
the position of Chief Executive Officer on
14 March 2018 from his previous position as
President - Sportech Racing and Digital.
Andrew’s salary on appointment to the Board
on 25 January 2017 in his position as President
– Sportech Racing and Digital was set at
CAD$400,000 and his salary was increased
from this level on his promotion to Chief
Executive Officer by 25% to CAD$500,000.
–        Bonus – The maximum annual bonus will
remain at 100% of salary for the Chief
Executive Officer and 75% of salary for other
executive directors. The majority of the bonus
will be based on financial performance
measures and the minority on strategic
objectives aligned with the KPIs of the
business.
–        Long-term incentives – The VCP was
introduced in 2017 to replace the PSP. Awards
under the VCP were first made in 2017 and it is
intended that these awards will be one-off in
nature to cover the five-year vesting period of

Committee continued

the plan. The Committee retains the right to
make further awards, from the shareholder
approved pool and limits, to personnel
identified as key to delivering incremental value
or executing a strategy to deliver tangible
returns to shareholders. The VCP is an
uncapped arrangement and the Board is aware
that, potentially therefore, the plan could pay
out at significant levels; however, very
significant value will only accrue to participants
in the event of truly exceptional sustained long-
term performance.
–        Enhancing shareholder alignment – In addition
to ensuring that the short- and long-term
performance measures and targets we set are
closely linked to the achievement of the
Company’s key strategic and business
objectives, pay is subject to recovery and
withholding provisions, the VCP is measured
over a five-year period and significant share
ownership guidelines apply – all features
intended to enhance the alignment of interest
between executive directors and shareholders
and to contribute to an appropriate level of risk
mitigation.
The Board is satisfied that the policy continues to
provide a good balance between potential rewards to
executive directors on the one hand, and, on the
other, measures and targets which are appropriately
stretching and that are aligned with the delivery of
the overall long-term success of the Company.
Changes to the Board
Chief Executive Officer, Ian Penrose, stepped down
from the Board and left the employment of the
Company on 31 December 2017 and Chief Financial
Officer, Mickey Kalifa, also stepped down from the
Board on 18 September 2017 and left the employment
of the Company on 31 October 2017. Details of their
leaving arrangements can be found on the company
website: www.sportechplc.com. Andrew Gaughan was
promoted to Chief Executive Officer in March 2018
and his salary and incentive package on his
promotion are set out above.
Richard McGuire was appointed temporarily to the
position of Executive Chairman on 4 December 2017
from his previous position as Non-executive Chairman
in relation to significant additional work undertaken
following the announcement that Ian Penrose and
Mickey Kalifa would be leaving Sportech and to lead
the Strategic Review and Formal Sale Process.
Richard reverted to his Non-executive Chairman role
on 14 March 2018. His fixed remuneration
arrangements on becoming Executive Chairman
remained the same, i.e. an annual fee of £120,000.
On behalf of the Committee, I thank shareholders for
their support last year and hope you will be able to
support the advisory vote on our directors’
remuneration report at the 2018 AGM.

This Report has been prepared in accordance with
the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups
(Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013
(the “Regulations”) and is intended to be in full

and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 issued
by the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”).
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the

Regulations.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration report sets
out the key parts of the directors’ remuneration
policy which was approved by shareholders in a
binding vote at the General Meeting held on 24 May
2017. The policy took formal effect from the date of
approval and is currently intended to apply until the
2020 AGM.
A full version of the original shareholder approved
policy can be found in the notice of General Meeting at
http:/ /www.sportechplc.com/investors/shareholder-
information/meetings-and-voting.
The primary objective of the remuneration policy is to
promote the long-term success of the Company. In
working towards the fulfilment of this objective the
Committee aims to: (i) establish a competitive
remuneration policy for the Executive Directors; and
(ii) align Senior Executives’ remuneration with the
interests of shareholders and other stakeholders,
including customers and employees. In connection
with this, the Committee aims to ensure that the
remuneration packages offered to Executive Directors
and Senior Executives:
–        are competitive and attract, retain and
motivate Executives of the right calibre;
–        reflect their responsibility and experience
within the business;
–        incorporate a significant element of
performance-related pay linked to the
achievement of challenging performance
criteria that are aligned with the Group’s
strategy and with increasing shareholder value,
but remain appropriate given the Group’s risk
profile;
–        provide a total remuneration offering at
“target” levels of performance that is
competitive in the relevant market;
–        incentivise performance beyond “target” levels,
to be achieved by offering a significant
proportion of remuneration to be delivered
through incentive related pay;
–        create a strong alignment between the
interests of senior management and the
sustained delivery of shareholder value;
–        take due account of the principles set out in
the Code;
–        take due account of pay and employment
conditions elsewhere in the Group;
–        provide the foundation for overall reward and
remuneration structures at senior management
levels; and
–       provide an appropriate balance between non-
performance-related and performance-related
pay.
The Committee reviews the remuneration policy, and
in particular performance-related pay scheme
structures, on an annual basis to ensure that it
continues to operate within the agreed risk
framework of the Group.
The Committee ensures that an effective system of
control and risk management is in place with regards
to remuneration, which includes access to the Audit
Committee to discuss matters of operational and
financial risk. The Committee is satisfied that the
policy does not encourage, or reward for, undue risk
taking.
The Committee ensures that performance-related pay
structures will not raise environmental, social or
governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating
irresponsible behaviour. More generally, regarding the
overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction
on the Committee which prevents it from taking into
account corporate governance on ESG matters.
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main component parts of the remuneration
packages for Executive Directors are detailed in the
table on pages 50 to 54, which should be read in
conjunction with the recruitment/promotion policy on
page 57, and the “Detailed remuneration policy for
2017” section of the Annual report on remuneration,
which starts on this page.

– Maximum bonus
potential is up to 100%
of salary for the Chief
Executive and up to 75%
of salary for other
Directors. The
Committee, in its
discretion, acting fairly
and reasonably, may
alter the bonus outcome
(upwards or
downwards) if it feels
that the payout is
inconsistent with the
Company’s overall
performance and events
taking place during the
year along with any
other factors it
considers relevant. The
Committee will consult
with the Company’s

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Choice of performance measures
The choice of the performance metrics applicable to
the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committee’s
belief that any incentive compensation should be
appropriately challenging and tied to both the
delivery of targets relating to key financial measures
that support the Company’s strategic objectives and
individual and/or strategic performance measures
intended to ensure that Executive Directors are
incentivised to deliver across a range of objectives for
which they are accountable. The Committee has
retained some flexibility on the specific measures
which will be used to ensure that any measures are
fully aligned with the strategic imperatives prevailing
at the time they are set.
The performance condition applicable to the VCP
award has been selected by the Committee on the
basis that share price is the best indicator of how the
market values the efficiency with which the
management team uses the available capital, so it
implicitly recognises only those activities that are
value-enhancing. In addition, the Committee
considers the Plan provides:
–        stronger alignment between Executives and
shareholders, since the participants will share
directly in the growth of the Company, albeit
only for meeting stretching targets;
–        a simple and transparent incentive focused on
the achievement of high levels of growth in
shareholder value; and
–        a genuinely long-term (five-year performance
period) single measurement which ensures
performance is sustained.
The Committee operates the annual bonus plan and
long-term incentive plans per their respective rules
and consistent with normal market practice, the
Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant,
including flexibility in a number of regards. These
include:
–        timing of awards and payments;
–        the size of an award (within the limits noted in
the Policy Table), and when and how much
should vest;
–        who receives an award or payment;
–        dealing with a change of control or
restructuring of the Group;
–        determining whether a participant is a
good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes

vest;
–        any adjustments required to awards in certain
circumstances (for example rights issues,
corporate restructuring, events and special
dividends); and
–        the weightings, measures and targets for the
annual bonus plan and LTIP from year to year.
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust the
targets and/or set different measures and alter
weightings for the annual bonus plan and to adjust
targets for the LTIP if events occur (e.g. a major
acquisition or disposal) which cause it to determine
that the conditions are unable to fulfil their original
intended purpose and the change would not be
materially less difficult to satisfy.
Existing awards
The Committee intends to honour any commitments,
including outstanding LTIP awards other than the
awards granted in March 2017 which lapsed as a
condition of participation in the VCP during 2017, on
the terms applicable at the time each such
commitment was made.
Policy on contracts of service
It is the Committee’s policy for the notice periods of
Executive Directors to be twelve months or less.
In the event of termination, the Committee’s policy is
that payments on termination should reflect the
specific circumstances prevailing. In general, it would
be the Committee’s policy to make a payment in lieu
of notice where necessary, limited to base salary and
benefits. To the extent that an individual might
otherwise seek to bring a claim against the Company
in relation to the termination of their employment
(e.g. for breach of contract or unfair dismissal), the
Committee retains the right to make an appropriate
payment in settlement of such potential or actual
claims.

Report of the Remuneration 
Committee continued

Payments in connection with any statutory
entitlements (for example, in relation to redundancy)
may be made as required. In connection with the
foregoing, the Committee reserves the right to award
to an Executive Director a bonus in respect of the
period of the year in which notice of termination had
not been served (and, in certain exceptional
circumstances, in respect of any period following
receipt of notice of resignation) that the individual
remained in employment, subject to the appropriate
performance measures being achieved. The
determination of any share incentive vesting would
be subject to the rules of the relevant plan, but in
general where an individual is a good leaver
(e.g. death, injury or disability, retirement, redundancy,
transfer of business outside of the Group and any
other reason the Committee decides) their awards
would vest on the cessation date, unless the
Committee decides the award should continue to the
original vesting date and remain subject to the
appropriate performance measures being achieved
and time pro rating (unless the Committee decides it
is inappropriate to apply time pro rating).
The Committee would intend to apply the above
policy for any new appointment, which may include
the ability to make phased payments with mitigation.
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts
are available for inspection on request to the
Company Secretary.
The Non-executive Directors have letters of
appointment which provide for notice by either party
giving to the other not less than three months’ notice
in writing. The Company may also terminate by
making a payment in lieu of notice.
Policy on external appointments
Sportech PLC recognises that its Directors are likely
to be invited to become Non-executive Directors of
other companies and that such exposure can broaden
experience and knowledge, which will benefit the
Company. Executive Directors are therefore allowed
to accept Non-executive appointments and retain any
fees earned, with the Board’s prior permission, if
these are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
Other employees’ pay
The Committee does not consult with employees
directly on matters of Executive remuneration.
However, the Committee is aware of the disconnect
which can be created if Executive Director
remuneration is set in isolation. The Committee
therefore regularly interacts with the senior
operational executives and monitors pay trends and
conditions across the workforce. In particular, the
Committee is made aware of general salary increases,
general benefit provision and the proposed level of
annual bonuses. Salary increases will ordinarily be
(in percentage of salary terms) in line with those of
the wider workforce. The Committee is also
responsible for reviewing the participants of the
LTIPs, the VCP and participation levels in the all-
employee plans.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Policy on Executive Director recruitments/promotions
In relation to an external executive recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will follow the principles
outlined in the table below:
Element of remuneration Policy
Base salary Salary levels will be set based on:
– the particular experience, knowledge and skill of the individual;
– market rates for comparable positions in companies of a similar size and
complexity; and
– internal Company relativities.
Where considered appropriate the Committee may wish to set the initial salary
below the market rate but with the view to make a series of planned phased
increases, potentially above those of the wider workforce as a percentage of salary,
to achieve the desired market positioning over time. Any increases would be subject
to the individual’s continued development and performance in the role.
Benefits A new appointment would be offered the same benefits package (or equivalent in
line with local market practice) as that provided to current Executive Directors.
Where considered necessary, the Committee may be required to pay certain
relocation expenses, legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation
to their appointment.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement (or equivalent in line with local market
practice) at up to the level provided to current Executive Directors may be
provided.
Annual bonus The Committee would envisage the annual bonus for any new appointment
operating as set out in the Policy Table for current Executive Directors.
However, the Committee may consider it necessary (depending on timing and the
nature of the appointment) to set different tailored performance measures for the
initial bonus year.
Long-term incentives A new Executive Director may be entitled to participate in the VCP, albeit
potentially with different performance awards and depending on the timing of the
appointment. An award may be made shortly after an appointment.
For internal promotions, existing awards will continue over their original vesting
period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy out remuneration
which would be forfeited on the appointee leaving their previous employer. When
determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out awards the Committee will,
where possible, use a consistent basis, taking into account the form of remuneration
(cash or shares), timing horizons and the application of any performance criteria.
Any buy-out awards will be addition to the limits set out above.
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans to
the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes
if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.

Report of the Remuneration 
Committee continued
58
The fee structure and quantum for Non-Executive Director
appointments will be based on the prevailing Non-Executive
Director fee policy.
Shareholder engagement
The Committee is mindful of the concerns of
shareholders and stakeholders and considers an open
and constructive dialogue with investors to be vitally
important to establishing a successful remuneration
policy which is considered fair by both Executives
and shareholders.
The Committee will consult with major investors
whenever material changes to the policy are
proposed. The Committee also welcomes investor
feedback and will consider views raised at the AGM
and during regular meetings throughout the year and
this, plus any additional feedback received from time
to time, is considered as part of the Committee’s
annual review of remuneration policy. The Committee
also closely monitors developments in institutional
investors’ best practice expectations.
Annual report on remuneration
Detailed remuneration policy for 2018
Basic annual salary
The Committee has reviewed base salaries for 2018
taking into account the role, responsibilities,
performance and experience of the individual, the
overall employee salary budget and wider inflationary
indicators.
The base salaries for 2018 are as follows:
Director 2018 2017 % change
Chief Executive 
Officer
1
CAD$500,000 CAD$400,000 25%
1
Andrew Gaughan was promoted to the position of Chief Executive
Officer on 14 March 2018 from his previous position as President -
Sportech Racing and Digital. Andrew’s salary on appointment to the
Board on 25 January 2017 in his position as President – Sportech
Racing and Digital was set at CAD$400,000 (approximately
£240,000 at an exchange rate of 1.67 CAD:GBP) and his salary was
increased from this level on his promotion to Chief Executive to
CAD$500,000 (approximately £300,000 at an exchange rate of 1.67
CAD:GBP).
Performance related bonus
The maximum bonus potential for Andrew Gaughan
for 2018 is 75% of basic salary until his appointment
as Chief Executive Officer, after which his maximum
bonus potential is 100% of basic salary.
Andrew Gaughan’s performance related bonus will be
based on Group financial performance, delivering on
Group strategic objectives and meeting personal
targets. The sustainable financial based proportion of
the potential bonus, which represents a majority of
Andrew’s bonus entitlement, is operated with a range
set around an agreed budgeted objective. Strategic
and personal objectives are designed to protect and
enhance the Company’s position across key
geographical regions and enhance shareholder value.
The objectives themselves are considered
commercially sensitive and will therefore be disclosed
on a retrospective basis in next year’s annual report
on remuneration (as long as such targets are no
longer considered commercially sensitive at that
point). This bonus is wholly payable in cash. Recovery
provisions may be applied in the event of material
misconduct and/or an error in the calculation of the
bonus payable.
Pension arrangements
The Company will contribute CAD$8,000 per annum
into a defined contribution scheme for Andrew
Gaughan.
Other benefits
Andrew Gaughan is entitled to the following other
main benefits; private health and disability insurance
for himself, his spouse and children and life insurance
for himself.
Long-Term Incentive Plan and Value Creation Plan
(“LTIP” and “VCP”)
The VCP was introduced in 2017 to replace the
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). It is currently
intended that no further awards will be made to
executive directors under the PSP. Awards under the
VCP were first made in 2017 and it is intended that
these awards will be one-off in nature to cover
the five-year vesting period of the plan. The
Committee retains the right to make further awards,
from the shareholder approved pool and limits, to
personnel identified as key to delivering incremental
value or executing a strategy to deliver tangible
returns. However, the previous VCP awards made to
current Executive Directors will not increase.

– Richard McGuire was paid a basic annual salary of £120,000 per annum with effect from 4 December 2017 on becoming Executive Chairman, the
same as the fee he was paid in his previous role as Non-executive Chairman (a role to which he was appointed on 24 May 2017). Prior to
becoming Non-executive Chairman he was a Non-executive Director for which he received fees of £19,000 for the period from 1 January 2017. In
addition to the figures in the table he also received £60,000 in consultancy fees in the period to 4 December 2017 and £20,000 during the period
4 December 2017 to 31 December 2017 in relation to significant additional work undertaken following the previous Chief Executive and the Chief
Financial Officer resignation announcements and leading the Strategic Review and Formal Sale Process. Richard returned to his role as Non-
executive Chairman on 14 March 2018 following the appointment of Andrew Gaughan as Chief Executive Officer.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
The Non-executive Director fee for 2018 is £60,000
which is unchanged since May 2017. This is intended
to cover all Board duties and no separate Committee
fees are payable. All Non-executives sit on the
subsidiary Boards and no additional fees are payable
for this.
The fee was increased from £45,000 to £60,000
effective 24 May 2017 having been previously reduced
in August 2016 from £47,500 base fee plus £5,000
fee per Committee membership.
Richard McGuire was appointed temporarily to the
position of Executive Chairman on 4 December 2017
from his previous position as Non-executive
Chairman. His salary on appointment to the position
of Executive Chairman was set at £120,000
per annum (the same level as his fee as Non-
executive Chairman had been). Richard reverted to
his Non-executive Chairman role on 14 March 2018
and his fee will remain at £120,000.
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are set to
take account of the time commitment and complexity
of the role reflecting, in particular, the onerous
international regulatory environment for Sportech and
that Board meetings will be held in both the US and
the UK, necessitating additional travel and time
commitments.

Performance related bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the Chief Executive
in the year under review was 100% of basic salary,
and for the Chief Financial Officer and President -
Sportech Racing and Digital was 75% of basic salary.
For each Executive Director, their performance
related bonus was based on (i) the adjusted EBITDA
performance of the Group and (ii) strategic objectives
aligned with Group strategic goals
Adjusted EBITDA performance
The Committee considered the Group’s adjusted
EBITDA performance for these purposes and in this
respect, achievement was determined to be nil out of
a maximum of 51% of overall potential bonus. The
targets set were to achieve adjusted EBITDA of
between threshold £8.8m (0% of this element of
bonus achievement) and £9.3m (100% of this element
of bonus achievement), with target set at £9.1m
(50% of this element of bonus achievement). Actual
adjusted EBITDA performance was £6.7m.
Strategic objectives
With regards to Ian Penrose, his personal 2017 targets
related to: concluding the sale of the Football Pools
realising in excess of £80 million net cash to the PLC
– following the previous failed sale to Burlywood
Capital this was a significant objective for the Group
and accounted for 33% of potential annual bonus;
realigning the Group strategically to maximise
shareholder value; delivering enhanced revenues from
US businesses, reducing exceptional expenditure and
delivering net positive cash generation from on-going
businesses. In addition to the key performance
indicator of securing the sale of the Football Pools,
another key achievement during the year was the
successful return of £75 million to shareholders,
including the restructuring of the Group share capital.
Achievement against each of these targets was
assessed by the Committee, resulting in an award of
40% out of a maximum target of 49% of potential
bonus.
The 2017 strategic targets relating to Mickey Kalifa
were in relation to: concluding the sale of the Football
Pools realising in excess of £80 million net cash to
the PLC – following the previous failed sale to
Burlywood Capital this was a significant objective for
the Group and accounted for 33% of potential annual
bonus; realigning the Group strategically to maximise
shareholder value; reduce recurring exceptional
expenditure and ongoing operational costs and drive
enhanced cash generation from the Racing and
Digital Division; and ensure two key finance IT
projects go live in the year. In addition to the key
performance indicator of securing the sale of the
Football Pools, another key achievements during the
year was his involvement in the successful return of
£75 million to shareholders, including the
restructuring of the Group share capital and the
launch of a live accounting system. Achievement
against each of these targets was assessed by the
Committee, resulting in an award of 43% out of a
maximum target of 49% of potential bonus.
The strategic targets of Andrew Gaughan related to:
improving free cashflow generation; establish and
implement a digital development strategy; and ensure
a key finance IT project goes live in the year.
Achievements against these targets was assessed by
the Committee, resulting in an award of 4% out of a
maximum target of 49% of potential bonus,
specifically relating to engagement in the US billing
system rolled out to clients and the launch of Digital
Link® (the division’s industry leading mobile
pari-mutuel wagering product).
The table below summarises the overall bonus result.
Individual Total bonus: % Maximum (% salary payable)
Chief Executive 40.0% out of the maximum entitlement 
(Ian Penrose) (40.0% of salary payable)
Chief Financial Officer 43.0% out of the maximum 
(Mickey Kalifa) entitlement (32.25% of salary payable)
President: Sportech 4.00% out of the maximum entitlement
Racing and Digital (3.00% of salary payable), pro-rated
(Andrew Gaughan) per date of appointment to the Board
The Committee is comfortable that the level of
bonuses paid to Executive Directors reflects both the
Company and individual performance during the year.
Pension arrangements
The Company made cash in lieu of pension payments
by way of a salary supplement for the UK-based
Executive Directors at a rate of 8% of base salary. The
Company paid CAD$8,000 into a defined
contribution scheme for Andrew Gaughan, a
Canadian-based director.

The plan rules allow for a dividend adjustment to be made to awards to compensate for dividends paid during the vesting period. The
December 2017 dividend resulted in an Ex-dividend price of 105.5p and a cum-dividend price of 79p, resulting in an uplift applied to awards of a
factor of 1.335.

In connection with the awards to the Executive Directors, the primary performance metric was the Company’s
relative TSR performance, subject to the application of a general financial performance modifier to ensure that
financial performance is taken into account when determining the vesting of such awards.
The PSP awards granted during 2017 were surrendered in full in exchange for eligibility to receive awards under
the VCP as detailed below.
Long-Term Incentive Plans (“LTIPs”)
Awards vested in relation to performance ending 2017
Awards granted in March 2015 reached the end of
their performance periods or were substantially
complete in the year under review. This includes
50% of awards subject to relative TSR (performance
period measured to 9 March 2018) and 50% of
awards subject to Earnings per Share “EPS”
(performance period ended 31 December 2017).
Summary details of the full conditions applying to the
2015 awards are included as a footnote to the PSP
table on page 64.
The assessment of the TSR measure was made
independently by New Bridge Street who advised
that TSR over the three-year performance period to
9 March 2018 was 68.5% which resulted in the
Company being ranked above the upper quartile
position on a relative basis. As a result, 100% of this
part of the award will be eligible to vest.
The increase in adjusted EPS during the three-year
period to 31 December 2017 was below the threshold
target level and therefore no part of this award will be
eligible to vest.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The performance period for the 2017 Award
comprises the five years commencing on 1 January
2017. The VCP provides Participants, including the
Executive Directors, with a pool of ordinary shares
with a value equal to 20% of any cumulative
shareholder value created above a compound hurdle
rate of 8% per annum. However, in the event of a
change of control that results in accelerated vesting
in 2017 or 2018, or in the case of an Executive
Director being deemed a “Good Leaver” (as defined
in the VCP rules) in 2017 or 2018, the compound
hurdle rates for vesting will be 12% and 10%
respectively. The Chief Executive, Chief Financial
Officer and President: Sportech Racing and Digital
share 50% of this pool. This will be measured from a
base ordinary share price of 95 pence, being the base
level of the 2017 LTIP award, as at the start of the
Performance Period.
The Committee will have the discretion to settle up to
50% of Awards in cash.
A clawback provision is in place whereby the
Committee may require a Participant to transfer to
the Company all or some of the ordinary shares
acquired, or pay certain amounts to the Company, in
the period of two years following the vesting of an
Award, where the Committee determines that one or
more of the following trigger events have occurred:
(a)     the discovery of a material misstatement
resulting in an adjustment in the audited
consolidated accounts of the Company or the
audited accounts of any Group company;

Ian Penrose and Mickey Kalifa’s entitlement to the
VCP shares will reduce pro rata to maturity, following
their departure from the Company, as noted below.
Payments to departing directors including
payments for loss of office
Roger Withers stepped down as Chairman from the
Board on 24 May 2017 and received his contracted
fee of £120,000 per annum to this date. Per the terms
of his contract, he received three months’ notice of
£30,000.
Mickey Kalifa stepped down from the Board on
18 September 2017 and left the employment of the
Company on 31 October 2017. Mickey received
12 months’ salary of £254,000 and a compensation
for loss of office inclusive of entitlement to statutory
payments of £50,000. He continued to accrue his
usual employment benefits until 31 October 2017 and
remained eligible for a discretionary annual bonus on
a pro rata basis in respect of the period of his active
service up to 31 October 2017. He was determined to
be a Good Leaver for the purpose of PSP and VCP
awards.
The LTIP award granted to Mickey in 2015 will vest in
line with its original vesting date, subject to the
satisfaction of the original performance conditions,
and will be pro-rated to reflect the period from the
date of grant to 31 December 2017 as compared to
three years. The award granted to in 2016 under the
LTIP will vest in line with its original vesting date,
subject to the satisfaction of the original performance
conditions, and will be pro-rated to reflect the period
of time from 9 March 2016 to 31 December 2017 as
compared to three years save that, where this award
vests in the context of a takeover of the Company
and the Remuneration Committee exercises its
discretion to accelerate the vesting of all other
outstanding awards granted under the LTIP, the pro-
rating of this award will be calculated by reference to
the period of time from 9 March 2016 to 31 December
2017 as compared to the period of time from 9 March
2016 to the date of the takeover. All awards granted
under the LTIP will continue to be subject to malus
and clawback provisions. He will be entitled to retain
the shares issued to him pursuant to the VCP and
such shares will vest, subject to performance, on their
normal vesting date (being 1 January 2022 or, if
earlier, the date of a takeover or demerger of the
Company). The number of shares that will vest will be
reduced to reflect the period from 6 September 2018
to the vesting date as compared to the period of time
from 1 January 2017 to the vesting date. If the vesting
date falls on or before 6 September 2018 (that is, as a
result of a takeover or demerger), his VCP shares will
vest in full. The Company also settled his legal fees,
capped at £5,000.
Ian Penrose stepped down from the Board and left
the employment of the Company on 31 December
2017. Ian received £449,000 in damages for breach of
contract in respect of his notice period (which
equates to 12 months’ salary and benefits under his
contract of employment), £50,000 compensation
(inclusive of entitlement to statutory payments for
loss of office), £15,340 in lieu of holiday accrued and
he remained eligible for a discretionary annual bonus
(a minimum amount of £159,600). He was also,
following the end of his employment, entitled to
receive a payment of £1,000 in consideration of
obligations agreed with the Company in respect of
the period of six months following the end of his
employment. He was determined to be a Good
Leaver for the purpose of PSP and VCP awards and
his 2016 PSP awards were prorated to 9 March 2018
(no pro rating was applied to the 2015 award). For
the purpose of the VCP his leave date was agreed to
be 31 December 2018. He continued to accrue his
usual employment benefits until 31 December 2017.
The Company also settled his legal fees, capped at
£5,000.

The Chief Executive is expected to hold an
investment of at least 200% of base salary in
Company shares and any other Executive Directors of
at least 150% of salary. Until this requirement is met
50% of shares vesting from the LTIP must be held (on
a net of tax basis).
Total shareholding which counts towards the
measurement of the guideline is calculated on the
basis of legally owned shares plus vested LTIP
awards. The percentage of guideline met is based on
the annual base salary and the higher of the
acquisition cost of the total shareholding or the
current market value of the total shareholding. Once
an Executive Director meets the required holding, the
Executive Director is only required to purchase
additional shares equivalent to the value of any
increase in base salary.
External directorships
Andrew Gaughan does not hold any external
directorships. Ian Penrose is a Trustee of the National
Football Museum, a registered charity, and he
receives no remuneration in respect of this
appointment. Mickey Kalifa did not hold any external
directorships during his employment with the Group.

Committee activity
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available
from the Company Secretary and can be found on
the Company’s website at
www.sportechplc.com/investors/corporate-
governance.
The Committee met five times during the year and
the following key activities have been undertaken:
–        review of best practice;
–        approval and grant of annual awards under the
PSP and VCP in the year under review;
–        approval of the PSP and VCP performance
conditions and targets for the 2017 awards;
–        approval of bonus awards for achievement of
FY2016 targets, and approval of bonus
measures and targets for 2017;
–        consultation with major shareholders in relation
to the implementation of the Value Creation
Plan;
–        review of base salaries for the Executive team;
–        approval of vesting determination for the 2014
PSP awards; and
–        approval of termination terms for Ian Penrose
and Mickey Kalifa.
The Committee’s recommendations in 2017 and early
2018 were all accepted and implemented by the
Board.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Committee consisted of
(i) Richard McGuire (Chairman), (ii) Roger Withers,
Chairman of the Board (who became a temporary
member and the Chairman following Peter Williams’
stepping down from the Board in May 2016),
(iii) Richard Cooper (who became a member upon his
appointment in May 2017); and (iv) Giles Vardey who
became a member on his appointment to the Board
in December 2017. Giles became Chairman of the
Committee in March 2018. Each of Richard Cooper
and Giles Vardey are Independent Non-executive
Directors. Richard McGuire will remain a member of
the Committee given his executive role was
temporary and for a short period of time. None of the
Committee has any personal financial interest (other
than as a shareholder), conflicts of interest from
cross- directorships or day-to-day involvement in the
running of the business.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings
although he is not present when matters affecting his
own remuneration are discussed. The Company
Secretary or their nominee acts as secretary to the
Committee.
The Committee receive independent advice from New
Bridge Street (“NBS”) (a trading name of Aon PLC)
on aspects of executive remuneration. NBS also
provides Sportech with advice on Non-executive
director remuneration. NBS is a member of the
Remuneration Consultants Group and has voluntarily
signed up to its industry Code of Conduct. NBS has
no connection with Sportech other than in the
provision of advice on executive and Non-executive
director remuneration. The terms of engagement with
NBS are available from the Company Secretary on
request. The fees of the independent remuneration
consultants in relation to the services provided by
them to the Company during the financial year were
£19,000 (2016: £34,000).
The Committee also received advice from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in relation to the
structure of the Value Creation Plan and from KPMG
for its implementation. Fees paid for this independent
advice were £65,000 and £64,000 respectively.
The Committee reviews its relationships with external
advisers on a regular basis and believes that no
conflicts of interest exist and that the advice they are
provided with remains independent and objective.

Respect for Human Rights
We are committed to respecting human rights as
embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and its two corresponding covenants, The
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and The International Covenant on Economic, Social,
and Cultural Rights. We endeavour to ensure that we
70
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 70 do not infringe on human rights, avoid complicity* in
the human rights abuses of others, and comply with
the laws of the countries in which we do business.
Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
matters
Sportech is committed to conducting business in an
ethical and honest manner, and is committed to
implementing and enforcing systems that ensure
bribery is prevented. Sportech has zero-tolerance for
bribery and corrupt activities. We are committed to
acting professionally, fairly, and with integrity in all
business dealings and relationships, wherever in the
country we operate.
Sportech will constantly uphold all laws relating to
anti-bribery and corruption in all the jurisdictions in
which we operate. We are bound by the laws of the
UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, in regards to our
conduct both at home and abroad.
Sportech recognises that bribery and corruption are
punishable by up to ten years of imprisonment and a
fine. If our company is discovered to have taken part
in corrupt activities, we may be subjected to an
unlimited fine, be excluded from tendering for public
contracts, and face serious damage to our reputation.
It is with this in mind that we commit to preventing
bribery and corruption in our business, and take our
legal responsibilities seriously.
Significant agreements
There are a number of agreements that take effect,
alter or potentially terminate upon a change of
control of the Company following a takeover bid,
such as commercial contracts and employees’ share
plans. None of these are deemed to be individually
significant in terms of their potential impact on the
day-to-day running of the business of the Group as a
whole, however, the Group operates under a number
of licences in various territories awarded to it by
regulatory bodies. In the event of a change of control,
certain regulatory bodies retain the right to pre-
approve the acquirer in order for a change of control
to be permitted.
There are no clauses in any of the Directors’ contracts
that are triggered by a change of control of the
Company.
Share Capital and Authority to Issue
Shares
The Company has one class of ordinary shares and
these shares have equal voting rights. The nature of
the holdings of the Company’s individual Directors
and individually significant shareholders are disclosed
on page 70. There are no restrictions on the transfer
of shares.
As part of the resolutions approved at the 2017 AGM,
shareholders’ authority was given to the Directors for:
(i)      the allotment of up to 61,871,415 ordinary
shares of 50p each (representing 33.3% of the
issued share capital of the Company as at the
date of the 2017 AGM); and
(ii)     the allotment of up to 61,871,415 ordinary
shares of 50p each (representing 33.3% of the
issued share capital as
at the date of the 2017 AGM) in connection with a
rights issue (including within such limit, any shares
pursuant to the authority set out at (i)). As at
31 December 2017, no shares have been allotted
pursuant to such authority.
Certain of the Company’s share incentive schemes
contain provisions that permit awards or options to
vest or become exercisable on a change of control in
accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Going concern
The Group’s forecasts and projections, which have
been prepared as described on page 37 were
reviewed and approved by the Board.
On the basis of this review, the Board has a
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as
they fall due over the period to June 2019.
Accordingly, it is deemed appropriate to prepare the
financial statements on a going concern basis for the
financial year ended 31 December 2017.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of
financial risks:
•        liquidity risk;
•        credit risk; and
•        foreign exchange risk.
Where appropriate the Group uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The

Disclosure of information to Auditors
So far as each Director is aware, at the date of the
approval of the financial statements there is no
relevant audit information of which the Company’s
Auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the
steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in
order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Group and
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
The Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have
indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a
resolution that they be reappointed will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have prepared the
Group and Parent Company (the “Company”)
financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted
by the European Union. Under company law the
Directors must not approve the financial statements
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for
that period. In preparing these financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
•        select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
•        make judgements and accounting estimates
that are reasonable and prudent;
•        state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements;
•        prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Group and the Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Group and Company’s transactions and
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements
and the Remuneration report comply with the
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets
of the Group and the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report, taken
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and
provides the information necessary for shareholders
to assess the Company’s performance, business
model and strategy. The Directors are responsible for
the maintenance and integrity of the Group and
Company’s website. Legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are
listed in the Board of Directors section on page 4
confirms that, to the best of each person’s knowledge
and belief:
–        the financial statements, prepared in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit of the Group; and
–        the Strategic report and other reports
contained in the Annual Report include a fair
review of the development and performance of
the business and the position of the Group and
Company, together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The Notice convening the AGM of the Company on
24 May 2018 will be sent to shareholders by 29 April
2018. In accordance with the Articles of Association
of the Company, Richard McGuire, Andrew Gaughan
and Richard Cooper retire by rotation and offers
themselves for reappointment at the AGM. The
profiles of those Directors appear on page 4. In
addition, Giles Vardey, who was appointed to the
Board since the last AGM, will retire and offer himself
for reappointment. Resolutions will also be proposed

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Sportech PLC’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial
statements”):
•        give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017
and of the Group’s loss and the Group’s and the company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
•        have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards
the company’s financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
2006; and
•        have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and accounts 2017 (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise:
–        the group and company Balance Sheets as at 31 December 2017;
–        the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
–        the group and company statements of Cash Flows for the year then ended;
–        the group and company Statements of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and
–        the accounting policies; and the notes to the financial statements.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the
audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed
public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical
Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the
group or the parent company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 74 Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £230,000 (2016: £590,000), based on
0.35% of revenue (2016: based on 2.5% of adjusted EBITDA (being
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, as
adjusted for exceptional items, impairment of assets and share option
charges).
• Overall company materiality: £430,000 (2016: £417,000), based on
0.5% of Net assets
• Our audit focussed on the reporting packs for the key reporting
units, being: Sportech PLC (the parent company), Sportech Pools
Limited (formerly The Football Pools Limited), Sportech Racing LLC,
Sportech Venues Inc and Racing Technology Ireland Limited.
• The components where we performed audit procedures accounted
for 86% of Group revenue and 80% of Group adjusted EBITDA.
• Intangible asset impairment (Group)
• Provision for uncertain tax provisions (Group)
• Recoverability of contingent consideration (Group)
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that
are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in
which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group, which were contrary to applicable laws and
regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond
to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk
of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focussed on laws and regulations that could give rise to
a material misstatement in the group and parent company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the
Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, US Gaming Regulations and UK and US tax
legislation. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying
supporting documentation, review of correspondence with regulators, review of correspondence with legal and
tax advisors and enquiries of management. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described
above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the
Members of Sportech PLC continued
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in
the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of
the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon,
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks
identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We evaluated and challenged the Directors’ future cash
flow forecasts, together with the process by which they
were drawn up and the key assumptions made, and
tested the underlying value-in-use calculation. We
noted no material inconsistencies between the
forecasts and our understanding of the Board’s
approved future plans for the business gained from
other areas of our audit.
We evaluated the key assumptions over the net handle
generated by the land based venues in 2017 and
beyond by reference to the trend in total handle in
recent years, after removing the impact of one off
events. We have evaluated the growth assumptions
adopted by the directors in respect of online handle, via
reference to historic growth rates. We have also
assessed the reasonableness of the directors’ forecasts
for the profitability of the Bobby V’s Stamford venue,
with reference to the current performance of the venue
and other more established venues. The directors’
assumptions are supported by information currently
available.
In addition, we have evaluated the discount rate used
within the impairment review to assess whether it is
appropriate. This was done primarily by comparison to
the weighted average cost of capital of other
comparable companies within the same industry or
with a similar business model. The discount rate was
found to be supportable.
Whilst inherent uncertainty exists around many of the
key assumptions used by the directors in the
impairment review, our procedures indicated that the
key assumptions were supportable and reasonable
within the context of the evidence we obtained. We did
not identify any material inconsistencies in the
directors’ estimation techniques and forecasting in
these areas.
Intangible asset impairment
Refer to page 42 (Audit Committee Report), page 92
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 112 (notes)
Intangible assets associated with the gaming licence
held within Sportech Venues Inc. (‘Venues’) have a
carrying value of £5.6m, following the recognition of a
£12.0m impairment in the year. In arriving at the
remaining carrying value, the directors have assumed
that the level of net handle (the total value of bets
taken) generated by the land based venues will
continue its recent decline, falling by 2% per year on
average from 2018 onwards. Further, they have
assumed the level of net handle in respect of internet
gambling in Connecticut will grow on average 5%
between 2018 and 2022, then at a rate of 2% into
perpetuity. Finally, the directors have made
assumptions in respect of the growth in profitability of
the newly opened Bobby V’s Stamford venue both in
respect of the level of handle generated and the food
and beverage sales which are set out in detail within
note 13.
We focussed on these areas due to the judgments and
estimates involved.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 76 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Uncertain tax provisions
Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analysis to
assess whether reasonably possible changes to key
assumptions could result in a further impairment. We
determined that, while the directors’ assumptions are
not inappropriate, reasonably possible changes in the
key assumptions would be likely to lead to a material
further impairment. We have determined that the
directors’ disclosure (see note 13) appropriately reflects
this fact and is consistent with the requirements of
accounting standards.
We have evaluated the directors’ conclusions
surrounding whether a provision is required in respect
of these uncertain tax provisions and where applicable
the judgements adopted in determining the quantum of
the provision and related disclosures.
Football Pools disposal
In respect of the calculation of tax on disposal of the
Football Pools division we obtained management’s
intangible asset valuation model and assessed the
appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions
adopted in determining the valuation to be assigned to
each of the intangibles disposed of. We also evaluated
the judgements adopted by the directors in
determining the period in which those intangibles
arose, in the context of our understanding of the Group.
We performed sensitivity analysis to assess the
potential incremental tax liability should different
assumptions be adopted. We determined that, while
the directors’ assumptions are supportable, there were
alterative judgements which could result in a materially
different tax charge, and hence agree that the directors’
disclosures (see note 26) adequately reflect this.
Spot the ball income
In respect of the taxation of the Spot the ball income
we have understood the relevant tax legislation,
recalculated the tax payable based on the assumptions
adopted by management, reviewed correspondence
with HMRC and consulted with tax specialists to assess
the appropriateness of the position taken by
management. On balance we consider the judgement
taken to be supportable.
Refer to page 42 (Audit Committee Report), page 92
(Significant Accounting Policies) and pages 109 and 129
(notes).
Over recent years the business has experienced a
number of one off transactions that have significant tax
implications. These include the disposal of the Football
Pools division and the gain arising from the successful
Spot the Ball claim.
Football Pools disposal
The disposal of the Football Pools division was
structured as a share sale of three companies and sales
of the core business trade and assets of other
companies, which remain in the Group. The total tax
charge resulting from the sale of the Football Pools
division has been estimated by management as £6.4m
(see note 10). Where certain intangible assets are
disposed of by the Group the quantum of the tax
liability, which crystallises, is subject to management
judgement both in respect of the allocation of the
consideration to the assets disposed of, the value of
those assets and the periods in which those assets
arose.
Spot the ball income
The tax in respect of the net Spot the Ball exceptional
income recognised in the prior year was provided at
20%, being the UK tax rate enacted for the year ending
31 December 2016. It is possible that capital losses can
be offset against the gain to reduce the tax on this
gain. A judgement therefore exists as to whether a
provision is required for the £4.6m which could be
reduced to nil should the conclusion be reached that it
is appropriate to treat the gain as a capital gain. The
directors have determined that is appropriate to
provide for this amount in full on the basis of
probability.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the
Members of Sportech PLC continued
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is managed divisionally, with the three operating divisions being Football Pools (until its sale in June
2017), Racing and Digital, and Venues, with the head office function incurring certain central costs on behalf of
the Group.
The Group’s accounting structure includes a local finance function in each of these divisions. These functions
maintain their own localised accounting records and controls, distinct from those at the head office level.
HMRC VAT challenge
In respect of the VAT claim we have reviewed the
advice that the directors have received from their
external tax and legal advisors and evaluated the
supporting calculations, which have been prepared by
management in reaching their conclusion that no
provision is required. Whilst the future outcome of the
appeal against HMRC is uncertain we determined that
the director’s judgement in respect of this item is
reasonable. Further, we have confirmed that the
contingent liability in respect of this item is
appropriately disclosed (see note 26).
HMRC VAT challenge
In addition, during 2017 Sportech PLC has received a
challenge from HMRC in respect of the value of
economic activities that they provide to their trading
subsidiaries, including the exempt Football Pools
business. Assessments have been received totalling
£1.3m for the period ended 31 December 2015. The
directors have determined on the basis of legal and tax
advice that no provision is required in respect of this
assessment or for any subsequent periods.
Together these create a number of material tax
judgements and we have therefore focussed on the
assumptions adopted by management in determining
the appropriate provisions required as at the
31 December 2017.
We have evaluated the directors’ conclusions
surrounding the likelihood of this contingent amount
being received. This has focussed on the likelihood of
NYX obtaining the additional three new customers
within the remaining two and a half years for the
consideration to be payable. During our assessment we
have considered a number of factors, which are
relevant to NYX acquiring new customers in the
remaining period. These factors include: the passage of
gambling de-regulation through certain states within
the USA in the year, the number of credible
competitors to NYX in those states, and the pre-
existing relationships NYX has with a number of
potential customers, which increase the likelihood of a
new customer being acquired. We verified these factors
through external research over the regulatory and
competitive environment in the USA in this industry.
Whilst there is an inherent amount of uncertainty within
the directors’ assumptions in respect of this item, we
have concluded that, at this time, the directors’
judgement is reasonable.
Recoverability of contingent consideration receivable
Refer to page 42 (Audit Committee Report), page 92
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 127 (notes).
In May 2015 the Group disposed of its 50% investment
in Sportech – NYX Gaming LLC. Included within the
consideration receivable by the Group for the sale was
an amount, which is contingent on the buyer NYX
Gaming Group limited (“NYX”) acquiring three new
customers in the five years subsequent to the disposal.
The directors assumed, and continue to assume, that
the conditions for receipt of these amounts will be met
within the requisite period and that the consideration
will be received. As such this amount, £1.5m, continues
to be included within trade and other receivables as at
31 December 2017.
Given the judgement over the likelihood of this amount
being received, we have focussed on the directors’
assumptions in respect of this consideration.
78
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt5  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 78 The directors operate the Group divisionally and so we have scoped our audit at a reporting level. The Group
comprises 19 reporting units. We performed full scope audits over five reporting units, being Sportech PLC (the
Parent Company), Sportech Pools Limited (formerly The Football Pools Limited), Sportech Racing LLC, Sportech
Venues Inc and Racing Technology Ireland Limited, which we regarded as being financially significant
components of the Group given their contribution to the Group’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
The entities that were subject to audit work accounted for 86% of the Group’s revenue from continuing
operations and 80% of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations.
Additionally we performed work in another eight reporting units on specific balances that we regarded to be
significant to the consolidated financial statements.
We have performed sufficient testing over divisional and head office finance functions to obtain evidence over
the components in scope for our Group audit. Furthermore, we have performed procedures over the Group’s
consolidation of these entities and significant consolidation entries.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and
disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial
statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £230,000 (2016: £590,000). £430,000 (2016: £417,000).
How we determined it 0.35% of revenue. 0.5% of Net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Net assets is considered to be
appropriate as it is not a profit
oriented company. The main source
of income is dividend income
provided by other Group companies.
The company holds all investments
in subsidiaries and therefore net
assets is deemed a generally
accepted auditing benchmark.
In considering an appropriate
benchmark on which to base our
determination of materiality, we took
into account that the Group has
undergone significant changes during
the year, most notably with the sale of
the Football Pools business, which
represented a significant proportion of
the Group’s adjusted EBITDA. Given
the significant downsizing of the
Group, the Group’s cost base during
the year ending 31 December 2017 was
not representative of a Group of a
similar size. The Group has undergone
a cost reduction exercise in the year
such that the underlying cost base will
be reduced going forward. We
therefore consider revenue the most
appropriate benchmark on which to
base our materiality. Applying our
professional judgement, based on the
scale of the business we determined an
overall materiality of £230,000 which
represents 0.35% of revenue.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the
Members of Sportech PLC continued
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £68,000 and £215,000.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group
materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit
above £10,000 (Group audit) (2016: £30,000) and £21,000 (Company audit) (2016: £21,000) as well as
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements
and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion
or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent
material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether
there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require
us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise
stated).
We have nothing material to add or to
draw attention to. However, because
not all future events or conditions can
be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the group’s and
company’s ability to continue as a
going concern.
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or
draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the
financial statements about whether the directors considered it
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of
any material uncertainties to the group’s and the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months
from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing to report. We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going

committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has
not been prepared by the company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the
solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 37 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model,
future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or
mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term
viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making
inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements
are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and
company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
• The statement given by the directors, on page 72, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole
to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess
the group’s and company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially

• The section of the Annual Report on page 42 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the
auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 72, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
General information
Sportech PLC (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled and incorporated in the UK and listed on the London
Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered office is Collins House, Rutland Square, Edinburgh, Midlothian,
Scotland EH1 2AA. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended
31 December 2017 comprise the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (together referred to as
the ‘Group’). The principal activities of the Group are pari-mutuel betting, both B2B and B2C, and supply of
wagering technology solutions.
Going concern
As discussed in the Directors’ report on page 71, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 30 June 2019.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRSs’) and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations as adopted by
the European Union (‘IFRSs as adopted by the European Union’) and with those parts of the Companies Act
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities
(including derivative instruments and available for sale financial assets) to fair value in accordance with IAS 39
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement’.
The Group’s accounting policies have been set by management and approved by the Audit Committee.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those
estimates.
Amounts presented in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest £1,000.
Critical judgements and estimates
Critical judgements and estimates have been made in the following areas:
Carrying value of Sportech Venues intangible assets
To determine whether an impairment of the intangible assets held by the Sportech Venues division has occurred,
the key assumptions the Group uses in estimating future cash flows for value-in-use measures are:
–        success of newly-built venues in growing both its handle and F&B earnings;
–        rates of industry handle growth/decline impacting the retail and online product;
–        discount rates, which appropriately reflect the risks associated with those specific cash-generating units
(‘CGUs’).
These assumptions, and the judgements of management that are based on them, are subject to change as new
information becomes available. Economic conditions and government policy changes can also impact on the
assumption and discount rates applied, which are reviewed annually. Further details are disclosed within note 13
of the Annual Report.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 92 93
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Carrying value of contingent consideration receivable
An element of the consideration received on the disposal of Sportech-NYX Gaming, LLC is contingent upon NYX
Gaming Group Limited (‘NYX’) customers going live on their Real Money Wagering Platform. Judgement is
therefore applied by management as to the likelihood that customers will go-live on this platform, and the
number of customers who do so (see note 25).
Changes to market conditions, including regulatory change and competition from other online gaming suppliers,
are the key assumptions used in making these judgements. Management are confident that the assumptions
applied represent the best estimate of the amount receivable by the Group for future customer acquisitions
made by NYX.
Tax
The Group’s activities in recent periods have resulted in material tax liabilities crystallising. The ultimate tax
liability due, in all instances, is subject to a degree of judgment. The judgments which are made are done so in
good faith, with the aim of always paying the correct amount of tax at the appropriate time. Management work
diligently with the Group’s external financial advisors in quantifying the anticipated accurate and fair tax liability
which arises from material one-off events such as the Spot the Ball legal case and the disposal of the Football
Pools.
Critical judgments include the valuation of assets disposed of in the Football Pools deal, the period in which
those assets arose, and the valuation of management supplies provided by the Executive management team to
its subsidiaries. The use of capital losses to offset the Spot the Ball gain is also a critical judgment, and the
uncertainty of this results in a provision of £4.6m of corporation tax continuing to be carried in respect of this.
Further detail is provided in notes 9, 10 and 26.
A summary of more important Group accounting policies follows. These policies have been applied consistently
to all the years presented.
(a)     Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control of an entity is deemed to exist when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its power over that entity. The existence and effect
of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the
Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets given, equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Contingent
consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured at each balance sheet date until
settlement. The revaluation amount is debited/credited to the income statement in the period in which the
estimated fair value is increased/decreased. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Transactions between subsidiaries are performed on an arm’s-length basis. Inter-company transactions, balances
and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 93 (b)     Equity accounted investees
The Group equity accounts for any investees which are considered to be either a joint venture or an associate.
A joint venture is an entity which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers under a
contractual agreement. An associate is an entity in which the Group has no control nor joint control, but bears
significant influence over that entity. In both cases, the Group holds its interest in the entity on a long-term basis.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses made by the investee is recognised in the income
statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other
comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of
the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investee equals or exceeds its interest
in that entity, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Unrealised gains on transactions
between the Group and its equity accounted investees are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in that
entity. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the
asset transferred. The accounting policies of the investee have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(c)     Revenue
Revenue from external customers, net of VAT, excise duties, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating
sales within the Group, represents:
–       the value of entry fees, net of winnings paid, receivable in respect of Football Pools recognised on the
date of the event;
–        the value of stakes, net of winnings paid, received in relation to betting activities recognised on the date of
the event;
–        the value of goods and services sold to external customers is recognised when the goods and services are
consumed;
–        the sale of terminals and systems, recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred, which is when title passes to the customer, generally being at the point of customer
acceptance. Sales which involve significant customisation are recognised on a percentage of completion
basis in accordance with IAS 11; and
–        the value of services delivered under service contracts generally based on either a percentage of amounts
wagered or on a predetermined fixed amount depending on contract terms.
Although the value of entry fees net of winnings paid and the value of bets net of winnings paid is reported as
revenue, both meet the definition of a gain under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
Under multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated to the various elements based on fair value
determined by the price charged when the same element is sold separately, and revenue is recognised on the
separate components of the contract in accordance with the appropriate revenue recognition policy for that item
or service.
(d)     Deferred income
Deferred income includes the value of stakes placed prior to the end of the financial period in respect of
competitions and sporting events held subsequent to the end of the financial period and income received in
advance of a service or product being delivered.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
(e)     Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee, which makes
strategic and operational decisions.
The Group has identified its business segments as follows:
–        Sportech Racing and Digital: provision of pari-mutuel wagering services and systems worldwide principally
to the horseracing industry;
–        Sportech Venues: off-track betting venue management; and
–        Corporate costs: central costs relating to the Company in its capacity as the holding company of the
Group.
(f)      Taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis
of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However,
the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor
taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority, on either the same or different taxable entities, where there is an intention
to settle the balances on a net basis.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 95 (g)     Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated
financial statements are presented in Sterling (£), which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s
presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses, resulting from the settlement of
such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement, except where deferred in other
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within finance income or costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in
the income statement within operating profit.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows:
–        assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that
balance sheet;
–        income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this
average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
transactions); and
–        all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(h)     Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable in bringing the asset to its
working condition for its intended use and any associated borrowing costs. Assets in the course of construction
are not depreciated until the asset is completed. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of
the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement
during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised when first brought into use and depreciated from this date.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
(i)      Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment down to
residual value over their anticipated useful lives at the following annual rates:
Long leasehold and owned land Not depreciated
Long leasehold and owned buildings 4.0% to 5.0%
Short leasehold land and buildings Over the period of the lease
Plant, equipment and other fixtures and fittings 10.0% to 33.3%
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
(j)      Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the fair value
of the separately identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to
IFRSs (4 January 2005) has been frozen at the previous UK GAAP net book value at the date of transition,
subject to being tested for impairment annually at the year end date.
Goodwill is allocated to specific CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to the CGU
that is expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
(k)     Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is charged
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible fixed asset.
Software
Externally acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives or contractual
period if shorter (six to ten years).
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
–        it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
–        management intends to complete the software product;
–        it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
–        adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and
–        the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development
employee costs and an appropriate proportion of relevant overhead. Other development expenditure that does
not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an
expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed 15 years.
Licences
Licences acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Licences that
have a finite useful life are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the
straight-line method to allocate cost of licences over their estimated useful lives of 15 to 20 years. Licences with
an infinite life (licences granted in perpetuity) are held at cost or fair value at acquisition date and tested
annually for impairment.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 97 (l)      Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historic cost less any impairment. Annual impairment reviews are
performed.
(m)    Impairment reviews
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual review for
impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairments, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Any impairment losses are recognised in the
income statement in the year in which they occur. Any impairment loss recognised on goodwill is not reversed.
All other individual assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently
reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist at each reporting
date.
(n)     Pension obligation
The Group operates various pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or Trustee administered funds,
determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution
plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a
separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans
define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or
more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the fair
value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future
cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs
are recognised immediately in the income statement.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to privately administered pension insurance plans
on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are
recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
(o)     Financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate and exchange rate
movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial
assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet initially at fair value when the Group becomes
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of
the instrument in accordance with IAS 39.
Available for sale financial assets
Financial assets which do not meet the criteria of being loans and receivables, fair value through profit and loss,
or held to maturity financial assets are classified as available for sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39.
Those assets are remeasured to their fair value at the reporting date, with any gains/losses recognised within
other comprehensive income. An available for sale financial asset reserve holds all unrealised gains/losses within
equity on the balance sheet.
Gains/losses on available for sale financial assets are realised at the point that the asset is disposed of by the
Group.
(p)     Share-based payments
The fair value of employee options awarded under the Value Creation Plan is calculated using the Black-Scholes
model. The fair value of employee PSP awards is valued using a stochastic (Monte Carlo) valuation model. In
accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the
vesting period of the options/awards. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair
value of the options/awards granted including any market performance conditions, which are those that are
based on Sportech PLC’s share price, and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance
vesting conditions, being profitability and the individual remaining an employee over a specified time period. At
each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The charge in relation to employees who provide services to subsidiary companies is recharged to those
subsidiaries. Where the charge is not required to be settled in cash, the Company’s investment in that subsidiary
is increased by the value of the charge and a corresponding increase in equity is recognised in the subsidiary.
(q)     Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents shown on the balance sheet represent cash in hand, cash in vaults and cash held in
current accounts, both owned by the Group and held on behalf of customers. Any bank overdrafts used by the
Group are shown within trade and other payables. Positive cash balances and overdrafts are only offset within
cash and cash equivalents to the extent that they form part of a cash-pooling arrangement implemented by the
Group where the balances will be settled on a net basis.
(r)      Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption
value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest
method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
(s)      Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items as those items which, by their nature or size, would distort the
comparability of the Group’s results from year to year.
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 99 (t)      Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less provision for impairment, being the difference between the assets’ carrying
amounts and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest
rate. Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other
objective evidence is received that a specific customer will default or delinquency in payment will arise. Any
subsequent recovery of amounts written off is credited to the income statement.
(u)     Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
(v)     Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out
method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business.
(w)    Provisions
Provisions for onerous contracts, onerous leases, legal claims and dilapidations are recognised when the Group
has: a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not
recognised for future operating losses where the Group has no contractual obligation to deliver the service or
product. Provisions payable over a period greater than 12 months are discounted using an appropriate market
risk-free discount rate.
(x)     Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the
lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
(y)     Share capital
Ordinary shares are classed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the value of new shares or
options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds in the share premium account where the shares
were issued at a premium or, where issued at par or where the issue costs exceed the premium on the issue, to
retained earnings.
(z)     New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group
There are no new standards or amendments to standards or interpretations that are mandatory for the first time
for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017 that materially impacted the Group financial statements.
(aa)   New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not adopted by the Group
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not yet effective and have not been adopted early
by the Group.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not yet effective and have not been adopted early

changes to the above standards will make to the Group’s financial statements going forward. An update on the
impact of this will be provided in the interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2018.

1.     Adjusted Performance Measures
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted
EBITDA which excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure such as exceptional items and asset impairment
charges. The share option expense is also excluded. Interest is not allocated to segments as the Group’s cash
position is controlled by the central finance team. This measure provides the most reliable indicator of underlying
performance of each of the trading divisions. This is considered the most reliable indicator as it is the closest
approximation to cash generated by underlying trade, excluding the impact of one-off items of a material nature
and working capital movements.
Adjusted EBITDA is not an IFRS measure, nevertheless it is widely used by both the analyst community to
compare with other gaming companies and by management to assess underlying performance.
A reconciliation of the adjusted operating expenses used for statutory reporting and the adjusted performance
measures is shown below:

Adjusted profit is also an adjusted performance measure used by the Group. This uses adjusted EBITDA, as
defined above as management’s view of the closest proxy to cash generation for underlying divisional
performance, and deducting share option charges, depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets (other than
those which arise in the acquisition of businesses) and finance charges. This provides an adjusted profit before
tax measure, which is then taxed by applying an estimated adjusted tax measure. The adjusted tax charge
excludes the tax impact of income statement items not included in adjusted profit before tax.

(a)     Redundancy and restructuring costs in respect of the rationalisation and modernisation of the business
On 18 September 2017, the Company announced the departure of the incumbent CFO and CEO. This was
accompanied by a strategic review and Formal Sales Process under the Takeover Code following a series of initial
approaches made to the Company. The costs of honouring the contracts of those departing executives along
with some other staff in senior positions represents the majority of the costs of restructuring and redundancy.
(b)     California exit
The Group had a number of contractual arrangements in the State of California, none of which was profitable
and included real-estate leases for a considerable duration with no benefit to the Group. These have been
provided for in full, with certain other items also written off and provided for, as below:
£000
Onerous contracts 2,553
Provision for irrecoverable items 91
Pre-build start up costs of aborted construction sites in California 96
2,740
(c)     Transaction costs from material M&A activity
Transaction costs relate to those incurred in the Group’s Football Pools disposal. This disposal was completed in
June 2017, with additional disposal costs incurred during the year of £3,248k. Those 2017 costs have been
presented as part of the loss on disposal of Football Pools as shown in note 10.
(d)     Spot the Ball
As disclosed in the 2016 financial statements, there were certain contingent items receivable by the Group. In
2017, clarity was obtained on the quantum of the items receivable, and other income was therefore booked in
respect of those.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 108 The taxation on the Group’s profit before taxation differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the
weighted average tax rate applicable to profits and losses of the consolidated entities as follows:
2017 2016
£000 £000
Earnings before tax (23,150) 63,608
Add share of loss after tax and impairment of non-US based joint ventures and associates — 64
Earnings before tax and share of loss after tax of UK joint ventures (23,150) 63,672
Tax calculated at domestic tax rates applicable to (losses)/profits in the respective countries (7,635) 11,550
Tax effects of:
– permanent differences 1,480 1,169
– effect of changes in tax rates 3,245 9
– adjustments in respect of prior years – current tax 2,381 640
– adjustments in respect of prior years – deferred tax 13 469
– deferred tax not previously provided (97) (74)
– deferred tax not recognised 383 —
– derecognition of previously recognised deferred tax assets — 3,149
Total tax (credit)/charge (230) 16,912
Included within permanent differences are the share option charges expensed in the period.
Certain adjustments in respect of prior years are UK debt-cap adjustments that are made within the UK
corporation tax Group. This Group includes Sportech PLC and other companies whose results have been
presented as discontinued operations in the year (see note 10). The net cash impact of those adjustments on the
Group’s corporation tax liability is £nil.
US deferred tax assets have been revalued downwards to allow for the reduction in the federal US tax rate from
34% to 21%, thus impacting the future cash benefit the Group will receive from carrying its US tax losses.
Deferred tax assets of £383k have not been recognised in respect of the investment made by the Group in S&S
Venues California, LLC. Tax losses are only realisable in the event of a sale of this investment at a profit.
Management have insufficient certainty that this will occur and so those items have not been recognised as
deferred tax assets.
As the Group’s year end is after the substantive enactment date (15 September 2016) of the Finance Act 2016,
these financial statements account for the change in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 19% to 17% for financial
years beginning 1 April 2020. Therefore the rate at which UK deferred tax is calculated has changed. Deferred
tax in the UK is provided at a blended rate, depending on when the deferred tax is expected to unwind.
As disclosed in the 2016 financial statements, tax on the net Spot the Ball exceptional income was provided for
at 20%. It is possible that capital losses of £23.0m could be used to offset the gain to reduce the tax on this gain
by £4.6m. The entire tax liability, other than this £4.6m, has now been paid. The £4.6m remains provided for in
current tax liabilities in the year end financial statements as an uncertain tax position.

10.   Discontinued operations
The disposal of the Football Pools business completed in June 2017, and the Board considered its Venues
business in the Netherlands, Sportech Racing BV and subsidiaries, to be an asset held for sale, with a sale being
considered probable within 12 months from the reporting date. Accordingly both those divisions are reported as
discontinued operations in the 2017 financial statements.
A reconciliation of the net loss on discontinued operations is shown below.

The disposal of the Football Pools division was structured as a share sale for three companies, and sales of the
core business trade and assets from other companies that remain in the Sportech Group. Where certain
intangible assets are disposed of by the Group, a tax liability crystallises, the quantum of which is subject to
management judgment. That judgment includes consideration of the assets which are disposed of, the value of
those assets, and the period in which those assets arose. The total tax charge which arises in the period includes
£6,395k which is directly attributable to the sale of those assets (see note 26). This was paid in full in 2017.
Note that the net gain/(loss) on disposal in relation to the Venues business in the Netherlands is not recognised
until the sale is completed, which is anticipated to occur within 2018. Further detail on this prospective disposal
can be found in note 19. It is anticipated that a net gain on disposal will be recognised in the 2018 financial
statements for this business of approximately £0.9m, with further potential upside available as disclosed in
note 19.

Goodwill arose on three historic acquisitions made by the Group: the acquisition of Littlewoods Leisure,
(including the Littlewoods Football Pools business), in September 2000 amounting to £145.2m; the acquisition of
Vernons Football Pools in December 2007 amounting to £20.3m; and the acquisition of eBet Online, Inc. in
December 2012 of £5.5m. The goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Littlewoods Leisure and Vernons
Football Pools are together considered as the goodwill relating to Sportech’s Football Pools division.

Of the amounts capitalised in the year in continuing operations, £3,026k arose from capitalising staff costs for
development expenditure.
Amortisation and impairment charges for continuing operations have been included within operating costs.
It was identified during the period that items with a cost of £221k were presented within property, plant and
equipment but were of an intangible nature. Those items have been transferred to software.
Impairment – Licences
The Group holds a licence in perpetuity to offer pari-mutuel off-track betting in the State of Connecticut in the
US for its Venues division. This asset has a book value in USD at the reporting date, prior to any impairment that
may be considered necessary, of $23,644k. Given this licence is in perpetuity, the book value of the asset is not
amortised and the useful economic life allocated to the asset is indefinite.

170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 112 As required by IAS 36, an impairment test has been carried out as at 31 December 2017. In testing for
impairment, other assets used solely to generate cash flows in the CGU are also included, totalling $20,158k
(2016: $14,130k).
The recoverable amount of the asset has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation. In calculating
value-in- use, future opportunity value must be ignored. Therefore, although management consider there to be
upside opportunity in its Venues division, particularly in light of potential repeal of PASPA regulation to legalise
sports betting, and the appetite in the State of Connecticut to ensure this is taken advantage of locally, the
assumptions that are used in calculating value-in-use have been brought down since that performed in 2016. This
reflects the continuing underlying decline of core handle and other uncertainties. Note that in previous reporting
periods, expected sale proceeds from surplus assets within the Venues division were included. Those are now
excluded given the lack of certainty of securing a sale of this asset in the short-term despite the passage of time
and the asset being marketed locally. The key assumptions made were as follows:
–        EBITDA forecasts assume year-on-year handle decline in the core operating business of 2%, and flat
earnings on its core F&B venues (excluding new venues and online);
–        compound annual handle growth for the online channel of 5% for Y1-5;
–        compound annual handle growth at Bobby V’s venue in Stamford of 10% in Y2-3 and 5% in Y4-5;
–        growth in F&B revenues in Stamford of 20% in Y2 and 15% in Y3;
–        cash flows beyond the fifth year were extrapolated using a 2% rate of decline for the core business venues
reflecting the industry handle rates, 0% for food and beverage 2% growth in the online business, and
2% growth for earnings from its new Bobby V’s venue in Stamford;
–        capital expenditure was included in the cash flows at management’s best estimate of industry norm for
reinvestment in retail outlets of the kind under review; and
–        a post tax discount rate of 9.1% (2016: 9.1%) was used representing a market-based weighted average cost
of capital appropriate for the Sportech Venues CGU. This equates to a pre tax discount rate of 12.7%
(2016: 14.7%).
Following the impairment review, the recoverable amount of those assets was deemed to be $27,727k and
accordingly an impairment of $16,075k (£12,040k) was charged to the income statement within administrative
expenses (2016: $1,361k; £1,093k).
Management consider that the calculated recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in the following
reasonable downside assumptions. Changes to the assumptions below, all other variables held constant, would
cause further indicated impairments.

Core business handle decline of 3% rather than 2% into perpetuity, compound handle growth at

The Group has decided that it will not continue with its ventures in California and will exit this territory in 2018.
As a result, assets capitalised which relate to its Californian ventures will generate no future economic benefit to
the Group.
The Group owned certain items used to fit out its venue in San Diego, and also incurred demolition and initial
construction costs for a prospective new site at Norco in California. Those items have been impaired in full to
reflect that future profits will not be generated from their use.
The Group retained 80% control of the Norco site included within assets in the course of construction which
have been impaired, and so 20% of this write off (£142k) is therefore attributable to non-controlling interests.
The items used in fitting out the sports bar in San Diego were 100% owned by the Group.

15. Net investment in joint ventures/associates
During the year, the Group held a 50% investment in Striders sports bar in San Diego, as part of the joint venture
company S&S Venues California, LLC. Striders is a food and beverage venue with on-site wagering facilities in
California. It commenced trading in February 2016. Note that the Group maintained shareholdings in Sportshub
Private Limited (India) and DraftDay Gaming Group, Inc (Draftday). Those investments are no longer actively
managed by the Group and were impaired in full in 2016. The Group invested no cash in those businesses during
the year and has no obligations to meet any losses as they fall due. No disclosure is therefore made of those
joint ventures/associates below.

In 2016 the Group also ceased its involvement to provide future management services to Draftday which resulted
in a release of the corresponding liability totaling £254k.
b)      Capital commitments and future obligations
Sportech Venues Inc. is a guarantor for certain future obligations at Striders. As the Group has now decided to
exit California and cease trading in early 2018 those commitments have been provided for in full. See note 22 for
further details.
c)       Impairments – S&S Venues
The S&S Venues joint venture relates to one particular sports bar operated in San Diego California, branded
“Striders”. Striders commenced trading in February 2016. The venture has not been profitable, and the Group’s
share of cumulative losses to 31 December 2017 were £513k. Management reached a decision to exit from its
interests in California, with trade at Striders anticipated to cease in H1-18. Accordingly the deemed future
economic benefit to the Group from holding its investment in Striders is £nil and the net investment has been
impaired in full.
d)      Summarised financial information of joint venture investments held at the reporting date
Note that although the Group continues to hold a share in its Indian Joint Venture and Draftday at the reporting
date, this business is no longer actively managed by the Group. The Group have exited from this joint venture in
early 2018 and has no current or future obligation to fulfil working capital requirements of joint venture during
2017. The net investment in this joint venture is £nil at both 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

In addition to the deferred tax asset which has been recognised, the Group has not recognised further deferred
tax assets of £4,005k (2016: £6,746k) arising from unutilised trading losses. The Directors do not consider there
will be sufficient future profits against which these losses can be offset due to the low profit generation in these
particular business units. The reduction in the deferred tax assets not recognised from unutilised trading losses is
due predominantly to a disposal of losses within UK Lottery Management Limited during the year (which
previously formed part of the Group’s Football Pools division).
Deferred tax assets are recognised on losses and foreign tax credits carried forward when it is probable that
future taxable profits will be generated against which the losses and credits can be utilised.

£206k). The provision for obsolete inventories has increased in the year as a result of spare parts which have not
been utilised for a period of time. Those spare parts must be held by the Group for terminals that are in use at
customer sites.
19.   Asset held for sale
At 31 December 2017, the Board were of the view that the most probable route of realising future economic
benefit through its Venues business in The Netherlands, Sportech Racing BV and its subsidiaries, was through a
sale rather than continuing to operate it as part of the Sportech Group.
On 31 March 2018, the Group agreed to dispose of this business to RBP Luxembourg SA (“Ze Turf”) on a cash-
free-debt-free basis for initial consideration of €2.8m. The deal was structured as a locked box mechanism with
an effective date of 31 December 2017, and so the net cash/debt adjustments are known to the Group, being an
increase in the purchase price received of €233k.
Earn out consideration could also be earned by the Group of up to €450k, contingent upon certain activities of
this business being completed by 31 December 2018.
In accordance with IFRS 5, this business has been treated as an asset held for sale. As at the balance sheet date,
the sale was deemed to be probable, and the disposal of Sportech Racing BV will signal a departure from a
major geographic location in which the Group previously operated. Accordingly it has also been treated as a
discontinued operation in these financial statements.
The net assets of this business as at 31 December 2017, which have been presented net on the Group balance
sheet, are shown below:

start of the lease term.
As disclosed in note 4, management have decided to exit from its interest in California. In this territory, the
Group has a number of committed financial obligations which have become onerous contracts.
The amounts provided include committed costs at the leased sites in Norco and San Diego, discounted at 2.5%,
totaling $1,866k (£1,676k), plus other onerous contract costs of $132k (£98k) and further obligations estimated at
$1,000k (£740k). The Norco lease ends in October 2023, and the San Diego lease ends in August 2024. The
Group is a joint and severally liable guarantor for both leases with its JV partner. In the absence of funding
receipts from the Group’s JV partner, 100% of the future lease liability has been provided for.
As part of the Group’s annual review of its provisions, it was identified that certain provisions for onerous
contracts and dilapidations were no longer required. Those provisions, totalling £261k, did not arise during the
period of Sportech’s ownership. Accordingly the gain from releasing those provisions have been shown within
exceptional items rather than included in adjusted EBITDA. The release of those provisions is non-cash. It was
also identified that certain amounts held in “other provisions” were more reasonably classified as provisions for
doubtful debts and have been reclassified as such therefore during the year (with net £nil impact to the income
statement).

Deferred and contingent consideration outstanding at the balance sheet date represents amounts due for the
acquisition of Bump. The total amount payable is made up of two items as below:
–        an amount equivalent to the 2016 EBITDA earned by Bump; and
–        25% of the 2017 EBITDA earned by Bump.
The cost of this is treated as employment costs under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (revised) and is therefore
accrued on a time apportioned basis to 31 December 2017. This has been included within exceptional items.
Movements on this financial liability in the year are as below:

24.  Pension schemes
The Group operates defined contribution schemes, and a funded defined benefit scheme in the UK. Datatote
employees contribute to a separate defined contribution scheme to that of Sportech PLC. The Group operates a
further funded defined benefit scheme in the US, two defined contribution schemes in the US, a defined
contribution scheme in The Netherlands and a defined contribution scheme in Ireland.

£000 £000
Defined contribution scheme contributions 323 289
Defined benefit scheme contributions 528 317
Total pension contributions 851 606
Defined contribution schemes
In the UK, employer contributions for Sportech are set at a maximum of 8% of pensionable salaries. A defined
contribution scheme for non-unionised employees, including eBet, is operated in the US, into which the Group
contributes 37.5% of the first 6% of participant contributions. A further defined contribution scheme is available
for unionised employees; the Group does not make contributions into this scheme.
A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (‘RRSP’) exists for employees in Canada. The Group matches to a limit of
50% of the first 6% of participant contributions. The Group also contributes 3% of gross salary into the RRSP for
full time Canadian Union employees.
The pension scheme in The Netherlands provides benefits to employees on a percentage of salary basis.
For employees in Ireland (of which there are 15), the Group contributes between 7.5% and 12.5% of salary,
dependent on length of service, into a defined contribution scheme.
For employees in France and Turkey (of which there are one and seven respectively), all pensions cover is
provided through employer and employee social security contributions.
Defined benefit schemes
In disposing of certain business assets with the Football Pools division in 2017, the defined benefit pension
scheme was retained by Sportech.
The scheme was formed on 6 April 2001 and is governed by a Definitive Trust Deed and Rules. It is a Registered
Pension Scheme under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004. The scheme is contracted out of the State
Second Pension Scheme and is not open to new members. The assets of this scheme are held in an independent
Trustee administered fund.
The US defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company in the US and provides retirement
benefits to employees who are members of a collective bargaining unit represented by the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Benefits are based on value times credited service.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities were as follows:

There is a funding obligation in relation to the US defined benefit scheme whereby not less than 80% of the
liability must be represented by its assets. At the balance sheet date, that shortfall was £650k, and has to be
settled by the Group in 2018.

Effect of change of assumptions on liability values
For the US scheme, under the adopted mortality tables, if the future life expectancy were to be plus/minus one
year the liabilities would increase/decrease by £12,000.
For the UK, under the adopted mortality tables, if the long-term rate of mortality improvement were to be 1.25%,
the liabilities would decrease by £35,000.
For the UK, if the rate of inflation were to be reduced by 0.25% the liabilities would decrease by £80,000.
For the UK, if the discount rate were to be increased to 2.85% the liabilities would decrease by £80,000.
For the US, if the discount rate were to be increased to 4.50% the liabilities would decrease by £116,000.
Future commitments – employer contributions
The expected employer annual contributions to the schemes for the financial year ending 31 December 2018
amount to £638k (year ended 31 December 2017: £528k).

Pension risks
Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of
which are detailed below:
Asset volatility
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Both the pension schemes hold a low proportion of equities,
which reduces volatility and risk.
As the plans mature, the Group intends to continue to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in
assets that better match the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an
increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risks
Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to salary inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher
liabilities. The majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by (fixed interest bonds) or loosely correlated
with (equities) inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy
Most of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy
will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
25.  Financial instruments
Financial risk management policies and objectives
The key financial risks borne by the Group, and the policy of managing those risks, are outlined below:
Liquidity risk
The Group has been subject to a transformational period with the win on its Spot the Ball case and the disposal
of its Football Pools division. This has materially changed the liquidity risk that the Group is exposed to, which
was previously monitored with reference to covenants on borrowing facilities. The Group has now cancelled its
borrowing facilities and operates instead in a cash surplus position.
During the year, the Group distributed its surplus cash back to shareholders in two tranches: the first was a share
buyback in March of £21.2m; the second was a special dividend. In quantifying the extent of those distributions,
the Board reviewed detailed cash flow forecasts which reviewed a period consistent with the Group’s view on
long-term strategy. The forecasts included downside sensitivities, thus providing material headroom from the
Group’s strategic plan to manage the Group’s liquidity risk.
In managing short-term divisional liquidity risks, cash flow forecasting is performed on a weekly basis in the
operating entities and is aggregated by Group finance. This weekly forecasting recognises committed short-term

Consolidated Financial Statements continued
payables of the Group which are monitored and managed through regular discussions with suppliers. Group
Finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure each operating entity has
sufficient cash to meet operational needs. Cash surpluses are managed centrally by Group finance and cash
swept up/pushed down as cash surpluses/requirements arise.
Credit risk
The Group’s main exposure to credit risk is in accounts receivable in the Sportech Racing and Digital segment.
Credit risk in these entities is managed locally by assessing the creditworthiness of each new customer before
agreeing payment and delivery terms. Amounts held in cash for the Sportech Venues division are held in highly
secure environments.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro and US Dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions
undertaken in foreign currencies, the translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities and from the
translation into Sterling of the results and net assets of overseas operations.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risks and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net
exposure is kept to an acceptable level. In doing so, the Group considers whether use of foreign exchange
forward contracts would be appropriate in fixing the economic impact of forecasted profitability. As at
31 December 2017, there were no outstanding commitments on foreign exchange forward contracts (2016: none).
During the year, the Group did enter into a number of forward contracts for the settlement of US Dollars at
contracted rates, in order to hedge the earnings reported by the Group in its GBP denominated financial
statements. A net gain of £42k was recognised in respect of these forward contracts in 2017 (2016: £nil) within
operating costs.
With the disposal of the Group’s primary UK business in the year, the source of its revenues are now
predominantly US Dollars. A long-term strategy of managing its foreign exchange risk may involve a transition in
its reporting currency from GBP to US Dollars. This is under consideration by management and may result in a
change in financial statement currency presentation in future periods.
The average rate for the US Dollar and Euro in both the current and previous reporting period are as outlined
below.
2017 2016
Average Closing Average Closing
US Dollars 1.30 1.35 1.34 1.23
Euro 1.14 1.13 1.21 1.17
If the exchange rates in 2017 were comparable to those in 2016, loss after tax would have been £25,355k and the
net assets would have been £55,188k at 31 December 2017.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to achieve an efficient
capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
126
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 126 Historically the Group monitored its capital risk based on its leverage ratio, however with no debt there is a need
to revise such a metric. An appropriate metric in considering capital risk management, and the ability of the
Group to return cash to shareholders whilst operating within its means, would be its implied liquidity per share,
defined as below:
2017 2016
Implied liquidity per share £000 £000
Current assets 32,529 57,988
Current liabilities (24,442) (49,787)
Net current assets 8,087 8,201
Non-current trade and other receivables 2,443 2,577
Non-current liabilities (3,060) (2,281)
(617) 296
Net position 7,470 8,497
less inventories held (2,652) (2,504)
Implied liquidity 4,818 5,993
Implied liquidity per share 2.6p 2.9p
Management continue to monitor its implied liquidity per share in considering its most appropriate long-term
strategy for either returns to shareholders or reinvestment in capital to drive further growth and potential
returns.
Financial assets and liabilities
At each reporting date, the Group had the following categories of financial assets and liabilities:
2017 2016
£000 £000
Loans and receivables 10,309 13,504
Available for sale financial assets 1,546 2,843
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 15,945 28,525
Available for sale financial assets

Contingent consideration receivable from disposal of Sportech-NYX Gaming, LLC 1,546 1,582
Current assets – Available for sale financial assets
Shares held in NYX Gaming Group Limited — 1,261
The Group’s available for sale financial assets and hedging instruments are carried at fair value. Alternative
valuation methods used in applying the relevant fair values are summarised below:
– level 1 – quoted prices (adjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
– level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
– level 3 – inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable
inputs).
Contingent consideration receivable from disposal of Sportech-NYX Gaming, LLC
In 2015 the Group disposed of its joint venture with NYX Gaming Group, Sportech-NYX Gaming, LLC, for
consideration which is partly contingent on future events. The contingent consideration is C$1.0m for each
customer that NYX successfully sign up to its Real Money Live wagering platform before May 2020, up to a
maximum of C$3.0m.

Consolidated Financial Statements continued
The fair value of contingent consideration is included in level 3. Management observe market activity including
industry growth and pace of regulatory change in determining the probability that the contingent consideration
will be received.
It continues to be management’s belief that NYX will sign up at least three new customers to the relevant
platform and therefore the maximum amount of contingent consideration receivable has been recognised. This
has been discounted at 9%, with interest unwinding on this discount within other finance charges. The amount
recognised as at 31 December 2017 is CAD 2,618k (£1,546k) within non-current trade and other receivables
(2016: CAD 2,460k; £1,582k).
Shares held in NYX Gaming Group Limited
As part of the same 2015 disposal of Sportech-NYX Gaming, LLC, the Group also obtained shares in NYX
Gaming Group Limited. Under the terms of the disposal, the Group was restricted from selling this investment for
a period of at least twelve months post their initial receipt. The fair value of shares held in NYX were included in
level 1 prior to their disposal by the Group, using the quoted share price at the reporting date in determining the
amount receivable. Fair value movements on those shares were recognised in the available for sale reserve within
equity until the date of their disposal, at which point cumulative gains/losses were recognised in the income
statement.
On 25 September 2017, the Group sold its shares in NYX for net proceeds of £2,333k. At the point the shares
were received the share price was CAD $4.06. Those shares have been subsequently revalued as Available For
Sale financial assets, and losses realised when shares are disposed of. The 2017 disposal reduces the Group’s
holding in NYX to nil, and accordingly all unrealised losses to date of £1,603k have been recognised in the
income statement. The share price on the date of disposal was CAD $2.35
Maturity of financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are all payable within twelve months. In 2016, there were £82,000 of financial
liabilities that were payable within 1-2 years, and all other financial liabilities were payable within twelve months.
26.  Contingencies and commitments
Capital commitments
The Group had no contracts placed for capital expenditure that were not provided for in the financial statements
at the current or prior year end dates.
Operating lease commitments
The Group leases various off-track betting venues and other operating sites under non-cancellable operating
lease arrangements. The lease terms are generally between three and five years and are renewable at the end of
the lease period at market rates. The expenditure charged to the income statement was £4,333k (2016: £2,809k).
This includes costs of providing for future operating lease payments in California as outlined in note 22 of
£1,676k.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
2017 2016
£000 £000
No later than one year 1,923 2,646
Later than one year and no later than five years 6,511 7,730
Later than five years 7,704 8,499
Total 16,138 18,875
Other financial commitments
The Group continues to provide a performance guarantee bond in Turkey equating to 15% of the contract value,
being $200k at 31 December 2017. This is to facilitate provision of a customer service contract in the territory.
128
170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6_170749 Sportech Annual Report Pt6  28/04/2018  01:21  Page 128 Contingent items
Tax
The Group’s activities in recent periods have resulted in material tax liabilities crystallising. The ultimate tax
liability due, in all instances, is subject to a degree of management judgment. The judgments which are made are
done so in good faith, with the aim of always paying the correct amount of tax at the appropriate time.
Management work diligently with the Group’s external financial advisors in quantifying the anticipated accurate
and fair tax liability which arises from material one-off events such as the Spot the Ball legal case and the
disposal of the Football Pools. Management have an open, transparent and constructive relationship with tax
regulators, and engage positively when discussing any difference in legal interpretation between that of the
Group and the regulators.
Certain contingent items exist at the reporting date with respect to tax liabilities as outlined below.
Corporation tax
As disclosed in note 10, judgment has been applied by management as to the corporation tax which arises on
the sale of the Football Pools. Exposure to further liabilities as a result of differences to management judgment
exist, and a possible further tax liability could arise. However this is deemed to be a possible rather than a
probable liability and accordingly no provision has been made in the financial statements for this.
VAT
As disclosed in the 2015 interim financial statements, HMRC have previously challenged the recovery of VAT by
Sportech PLC as an active holding company providing wholly economic activities. This challenge was aligned to
European Case Law which ultimately ruled in the taxpayer’s favour.
HMRC have adjusted their challenge to Sportech in 2017 to instead focus on the value of the economic activities
that Sportech PLC provides to its trading subsidiaries, the majority of which are based overseas. Assessments
have been raised totalling £1.3m for the period to 31 December 2015, citing an under-valuation of the Group’s
management supplies which is made primarily to its exempt UK Football Pools business.
Should HMRC maintain this position then there will be further amounts assessed for 2016 and 2017 up to the
date that the Group had no exempt UK business. The Group has continued to engage its external advisors on
this issue and has entered into a formal appeals process.
To continue with the appeal, and in accordance with due process, £1.3m has been paid to HMRC in 2018.
However, management remain confident that this amount will be recovered given advice from its external tax
and legal advisors, and the likelihood of a material outflow being made to HMRC to settle this issue is considered
remote. No amounts have therefore been provided.
Other contingent items
M&A activity
Both the 2017 sale of the Football Pools division and the anticipated 2018 sale of the Group’s Venues business in
The Netherlands have customary seller warranties under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreements. Those
warranties have been provided in good faith by management in light of the probability of certain events
occurring. The possibility of material claims being made under the seller warranties in either deal is considered
by management to be remote.
Legal
The Group is engaged in certain disputes in the ordinary course of business which could potentially lead to
outflows greater than those provided for on the balance sheet. The maximum possible exposure considered to
exist, in view of advice received from the Group’s professional advisors, is up to £0.5m. Management are of the
view that the risk of those outflows arising is not probable and accordingly they are considered contingent items.

On 21 March 2017, the Company purchased 10% of its issued share capital back from shareholders. The tender
offer price for the buyback was £1.015 and was fully subscribed, resulting in payments to shareholders of
£20,933k. Associated fees of this transaction were £259k. Those shares were purchased and cancelled, thus
reducing the number of shares in issue to 185,615,244.
On 8 November 2017, the Company received Court approval for a 30p per share reduction in the nominal value
of its share capital from 50p to 20p as approved by shareholders in May 2017.
This created distributable reserves of £55,684,000 and assisted in the Group making a further distribution of
surplus cash in December 2017 by way of a special dividend of 29p per share.

The Performance Share Plan
Certain Executive Directors and senior Executives have been awarded grants to acquire shares in the Company
under the PSP, subject to performance conditions.
Movement in share awards in respect of the Performance Share Plan are shown below:

2017 grant
On 9 March 2017, the Company awarded 1,389,000 grants to acquire shares in the Company under the PSP.
Subsequent to this, shareholders approved the setup of a new incentive plan for Directors and other members of
the senior management team through a Value Creation Plan (“VCP”), the detail of which is provided later in this
note.
For reporting purposes under IFRS, as the new VCP was only available to management who had surrendered
existing PSP awards from the 2017 grant, this is treated as a beneficial modification of awards that have already
been made by the Company.
Accordingly, a valuation of the 2017 grant is required at the point in time that the VCP shares are issued. The
details of the assumption used in this valuation are provided within this note. No awards issued under the 2017
PSP grant are outstanding at 31 December 2017.
Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee can set different performance conditions from those described below for future
awards provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, the new targets are not materially less
challenging in the circumstances than those described below. The Committee determines the comparator group
for each award.
The Remuneration Committee may also vary the performance conditions applying to existing awards if an event
has occurred that causes the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance
130

materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.
The awards are at nil cost to the employee. Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of
grant subject to the participants’ continued employment within the Group and the satisfaction of the
performance conditions noted below
2016 grant
The vesting of all of the award will be dependent on the Company’s TSR over a fixed three-year period
commencing 3 March 2016 relative to that of the FTSE Small Cap index (excluding investment trusts). For the
purpose of calculating TSR, the base figure is averaged over the six weeks preceding the start of the
performance period and the end figure is averaged over the last six weeks of the performance period.
Thereafter, a vesting schedule no less demanding than the following will apply:
The Company’s TSR performance over the performance period relative to comparator index Extent of vesting
Equal to the index 25%
Between equal to the index and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile or better 100%
In addition to the primary performance condition, the award is also subject to a financial underpin condition.

The vesting of one-half of the award (‘Part A’) will be dependent on the Company’s TSR over a fixed three-year
period beginning on the date of grant relative to that of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment trusts).
For the purpose of calculating TSR, the base figure is averaged over the six weeks preceding the start of the
performance period and the end figure is averaged over the last six weeks of the performance period. No
portion of Part A will vest unless the Company’s TSR performance at least matches that of the index. Thereafter,
a vesting schedule no less demanding than the TSR condition on the 2016 grant as outlined above. The vesting
of the second half of the award is dependent on an EPS performance criterion (‘Part B’). The average annual
percentage growth in the Company’s EPS in excess of the RPI over the EPS performance period must at least
equal 4%. Vesting is determined by the following schedule:
The Company’s average annual growth in EPS in excess of RPI during the performance period Extent of vesting of Part B
Less than 4% per annum 0%
4% per annum 25%
Between 4% and 10% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100%
10% or better 100%

All PSP grants
Awards are valued using a Stochastic (Monte Carlo) valuation model. The fair value per award granted and the
assumptions used in the valuation calculation are as below:
March November March
Grant date 2017* 2016 2015
Exercise price £nil £nil £nil
Number of employees issued shares 14 19 25
Share price at date of valuation £0.988 £0.653 £0.667
Expected term (fixed) 2.67 years 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility 34.2% 43.0% 35.2%
Dividend yield 0% 0% 0%
Fair value of award £0.585 £0.433 £0.544
*The assumptions disclosed on the March 2017 award grant are those that were used when valuing the award at 21 July 2017 on creation of the
VCP. It is this valuation that triggers the financial statement impact of the awards in issue.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding awards under the PSP at 31 December 2017 was
one year (2016: one year and six months). The weighted average exercise price of awards granted during the
period was £nil (2016: £nil). PSP awards are not affected by the risk-free rate input since no payment is required
by the recipient and therefore no interest could be earned elsewhere.
The expected volatility is based on movements in the historical return index (share price with dividends
reinvested) for the three years prior to the award date. The dividend yield does not affect the fair value of the
award as the rules of the PSP entitle a participant to receive cash equal in value to the dividends that would
have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividends paid during the vesting period and is therefore
assumed to be 0%. See notes 4 and 5 for the total expense recognised in the income statement for share
options granted and PSP awards made to Directors and employees respectively
Value Creation Plan
On 24 May 2017, shareholders approved the creation of a new executive management incentive plan known as
the Value Creation Plan (VCP). Participants in the VCP were granted an Award giving them a future right to earn
ordinary shares in the Company based on the cumulative total shareholder return generated over the VCP
performance period. The VCP provides participants with a pool of ordinary shares with a value equal to 20% of
any cumulative shareholder value created above a compound hurdle rate of 8% per annum. However, in the event
of a change of control that results in accelerated vesting in 2017 or 2018, or in the case of an Executive Director
being deemed a “Good Leaver” (as defined in the VCP rules) in 2017 or 2018, the compound hurdle rates for
vesting will be 12% and 10% respectively.
Awards are expected to vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant of the Award to the extent that any
applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards are valued using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value per award granted and the
assumptions used in the valuation calculation are as below:
Valuation date (date of award issues) 21 July 2017
VCP performance period start date 01 January 2017
End of vesting period 31 December 2021

30.  Adjustment of 2016 Income Statement presentation
The 2016 income statement that has been presented is subject to two areas of amendment from that reported in
prior year:
1.        Given the discontinuance of the Football Pools division and the Venues business in The Netherlands, the
net result of those business has been shown within discontinued operations for both reporting periods and
stripped out of the underlying results of the Group’s continuing operations
2.       The classification of certain costs between cost of sales, marketing and distribution costs and operating
costs has also been adjusted, given a detailed review of the Group’s financial performance as part of its
strategic review. Items included within cost of sales (as detailed in note 3) are considered by management
to be those which vary directly with revenue generated by the Group. Management consider this
information to provide relevant and more reliable information of the underlying trading performance of the
Group.
A reconciliation of the results reported in 2016 to the 2016 results on the face of the income statement is
provided below:

30b)  Exceptional items
Certain restructuring and redundancy costs in respect of business modernization had been included in 2016
within cost of sales. On closer inspection those costs were in respect of employees whose staff costs have been
deemed to be an operating cost of the business as opposed to a cost of sale (see note 30d).
30c)  Depreciation and amortisation
In previous years, depreciation and amortisation on assets which were being utilised on racetracks, or of
property, plant and equipment in the venues business, were being presented within cost of sales. It is
management’s belief that those costs are of a fixed nature, albeit may vary over time with material capital
investment such as the new Bobby V’s in Stamford. However the charge does not vary directly with revenues
and so they have been reclassified to operating costs. The depreciation charge relating to assets which are
employed at customer racetracks in the year was £604k (2016: £492k).
30d)  Staff costs
The costs of individuals working on customer racetracks or within the operating Venues were previously held
within cost of sales. As those costs are fixed in nature they have been reclassified to operating costs. The cost of
the comparative staff costs included within operating costs this year are £10,884k in Racing and Digital (2016:
£10,121k) and £5,741k in Venues (2016: £4,694k).
30e)  Marketing costs
Marketing costs had historically been deemed to be a fixed operating cost of the business, however investment
in marketing would be expected to correlate with changes in revenue and so they have been presented as
separately identified “marketing and distribution costs” on the face of the income statement.
30f)   Other costs
Other costs which were previously deemed to be cost of sales but are now considered by management to be of
a fixed operating cost nature have been reclassified, including property costs in Venues of £4.2m, travel and
entertainment for employees working at customer racetracks in Racing and Digital of £0.5m, IT and
telecommunications charges and certain marketing and promotional expenditure within the Venues division.

31.   Post balance sheet events
Disposal of Venues business in The Netherlands
As disclosed in note 19, the Group signed an SPA with RBA Luxembourg SA on 31 March 2018 to dispose of its
Dutch Venues business in The Netherlands, for initial consideration of €2.8m, net of cash and debt adjustments.
Additional contingent consideration of up to €450k could be due to the Group subject to this business
completing certain activities by 31 December 2017. Disposal costs associated with the transaction are anticipated
to be approximately £200k.
As disclosed in note 10, it is anticipated that a net gain on disposal will arise from the transaction of
approximately £0.9m.
The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals which are anticipated to be provided no later than 30 June
2018.
The deal has been structured as a locked box with an effective date of 1 January 2018. Accordingly all 2018
profits of the business, other than commercially agreed amounts payable for Sportech’s ongoing management of
the business until completion, will accrue to the purchaser. It is anticipated therefore that, subject to the deal
completing, a net gain on disposal will be recognised in the 2018 financial statements for this business, and no
trading profits will appear in the Group’s consolidated results.
