Wilmington plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2017

Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present my report on 
Wilmington’s results for the twelve months 
ended 30 June 2017. Overall It has been 
a positive financial performance as we 
move towards our objective of becoming 
a single integrated international business. 
Wilmington has continued to meet 
the challenges that necessary change 
inevitably brings; a balance of growing 
revenue and profits whilst making material 
investments in new products, systems, 
offices, personnel and in new businesses. 
Wilmington delivered revenue growth 
of 14% (up 9% on a constant currency) 
led by excellent contributions from the 
acquisitions made during the year and 
supported by organic growth from our 
core offerings. We have seen strong 
growth from Healthcare up 28% and 
good growth from Risk & Compliance up 
9% as well as growth from Professional 
which increased its revenue by 7% albeit 
benefiting from the acquisition of SWAT. 
Adjusted profit before tax (which now 
for the first time includes share based 
payment costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m)) 
increased 5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m). 
Business strategy
Wilmington’s strategy is to further 
develop its business into a knowledge 
based model and structure focussing on 
serving the needs of chosen communities 
with an overall objective of becoming a 
single integrated international business. 
This business structure will maximise 
Wilmington’s opportunities to help its 
clients and communities meet their 
information, education and networking 
requirements as well as drive operational 
efficiencies. As part of its evolution, 
Wilmington has and is continuing to be 
more focussed on its core communities 
that provide a higher quality of earnings. 
Vision
The vision which acts as our guide and 
underpins our strategy is:
“To be the recognised knowledge leader 
and partner of choice for information, 
education and networking in Risk & 
Compliance, Professional and Healthcare.”
By achieving our vision we aim to turn 
knowledge into competitive advantage for 
our clients. 
“This year has been a positive one for Wilmington, with overall solid 
financial performance delivered in the context of accelerating change 
in our end-markets. Wilmington is well positioned to benefit from this 
change, and we continue to see significant demand for our products 
and services from our customers. 
We enter the new financial year anticipating continued momentum, 
particularly in our Risk & Compliance and Healthcare divisions. 
We are also excited about the prospects for our newly created 
Professional division, which promises to benefit in the medium 
term from the convergence in education requirements across the 
professional services.”

Strategic Report
07
www.wilmingtonplc.com Stock Code: WIL
Project Sixth Gear
On 23 February 2017, we announced 
project Sixth Gear which is the next stage 
in our strategic development. This project 
builds upon the first stage which focussed 
on the simplification of group structure 
and the selective acquisition of businesses 
to fill gaps in our product offerings. 
The prime objective of Sixth Gear is to 
accelerate the move to a single “One 
Wilmington” simplifying and integrating 
the business further, maximising client 
relationships and providing the basis for 
organic and acquisition-led growth and 
scale. The accelerated integration and 
pooling of resources will help to capitalise 
on growing economies of scale.
New Reporting Structure
As previously announced, to help simplify 
Wilmington still further we reorganised 
our business into three divisions; Risk & 
Compliance, Professional and Healthcare. 
The combination of the former divisions of 
Legal and Finance into one new division; 
Professional is a natural outcome from the 
restructuring, downsizing and refocusing 
of our Law for Lawyers business over the 
last few years. This combination which is 
facilitated by the decision to exit from the 
legal practice support market also brings 
greater clarity to this division. 
Risk & Compliance division concentrates 
on servicing the strong organic global 
demand for our offerings supported by 
selective earnings enhancing acquisitions 
in the areas of risk & compliance as well 
as investments in new products, data 
services, offices and in new territories. The 
emphasis continues to be servicing the 
needs of risk managers and compliance 
officers globally. 
Professional division provides information, 
education and networking support 
to professionals in the accountancy, 
financial services, and legal markets. 
This division focuses on supporting the 
post-qualification needs of individual 
professionals and SMEs with an increasing 
emphasis on exploiting international 
opportunities, and an accelerated move 
to expand our digital -learning solutions; 
areas where we feel the revenue growth 
opportunities are greatest. The emphasis 
in the short term will be on organic rather 
than acquisition led growth with capital 
allocated accordingly.
Healthcare division is the renamed Insight 
division recognising that well over 80% of 
its revenue following the HSJ acquisition 
comes from healthcare markets globally. 
We are replicating the successful model 
of providing information (particularly 
insight data and analytics), education and 
networking capabilities on a country by 
country basis. The emphasis will be to 
build on our existing market presence in 
the EU and in the US either organically or 
by acquisition. 
In line with our strategy all three divisions 
offer information, networking and 
education capabilities servicing key 
defined communities, supported by best-
in-class technology. The divisions will look 
to exploit international and, increasingly 
digital opportunities using and replicating 
expertise from their existing market 
positions. Each division will also act as our 
specialist knowledge expert and centre of 
excellence providing expertise and R&D to 
support the two other divisions. 
Our people
As a digital information, education 
and networking business operating in 
dynamic and competitive markets, we are 
fundamentally reliant upon the quality and 
professionalism of our people. I would 
once again like to express my own and 
my fellow Board members’ appreciation 
of the hard work and dedication of our 
Wilmington colleagues across the globe.
Financial and operational 
targets
I am pleased to report progress in all but 
one of our key financial and operational 
targets. We have seen growth in Adjusted 
Profit before Tax, Adjusted Earnings per 
Share, and Return on Equity although 
we saw a drop in the level of Adjusted 
EBITA margins from 20.8% to 19.4% 
reflecting inter alia significant investment 
expenditure during the year. As you will 
read in the Chief Executive Officer’s 
review in our compliance business alone 
we have invested an additional £1.0m 
in new initiatives which represents one 
percentage point off our overall margin. 
We see further necessary operational 
investment during 2017/18 offsetting the 
underlying improvement to margins that 
integration, previous investment projects 
and the impact of higher margin acquired 
businesses bring on our Adjusted EBITA 
margins. The four financial measures 
above form the basis of the Executive 
Directors incentive plans. 
We closely monitor cash conversion which 
we expect to exceed 100% on an annual 
basis, and in 2017 that conversion rate 
was 114% (2016: 108%). This excellent 
cash conversion illustrates the strength 
of the business as well as the efficiency 
in our stewardship of working capital. 
The positive cashflow characteristics 
of Wilmington matched with clear fiscal 
discipline in turn help us attract and 
maintain significant finance from third 
party providers.  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
We continue to generate a high proportion 
of our revenue derived from quality and 
sustainable income streams and in 2017 
revenue from subscriptions and repeatable 
revenue was 77% of group revenue (2016: 
75%). A high proportion of repeatable 
revenue provides a good degree of 
earnings visibility as well as security. 
We continue to seek to increase each 
year our proportion of revenue generated 
outside the UK where we see good 
prospects for long term sustainable 
growth. Revenue outside the UK has 
grown again and was 43% of total 
revenue compared to 42% last year with 
the underlying relative growth in non-UK 
revenue from our portfolio mitigated by 
our acquisitions this year which were both 
focussed on the UK market. 
These financial and operational 
performances are reflective of the quality 
of our portfolio of offerings which benefit 
from a significant proportion of revenues 
derived from subscriptions and from 
products which disseminate increasingly 
international content-rich, high-value 
information and, increasingly digitally 
along with certificated education and 
compliance programmes.
Acquisitions 
In support of our growth strategy, we 
continue to seek selective earnings 
enhancing acquisition opportunities 
to add additional growth, scale and 
expertise in our chosen markets. In this 
context, we were delighted to announce 
two acquisitions during the year both of 
which were consistent with our strategy 
of acquiring complementary businesses 
with high repeat revenues in our chosen 
knowledge areas and communities. The 
acquisitions of SWAT in July 2016 and 
HSJ in January 2017 enhanced and added 
further scale to our offerings by providing 
information, education and, for HSJ 
networking capability in our Professional 
and Healthcare divisions respectively. 
Cash and borrowings
Net debt, which includes cash and 
cash equivalents, bank loans (excluding 
capitalised facility fees) and bank 
overdrafts, was £40.0m (2016: £34.7m) 
an increase of £5.3m on last year during 
another period of considerable growth 
and change in which we spent £20.3m 
(including deferred consideration) on 
acquisitions offset by the proceeds of 
£7.3m from the disposal of the Underwood 
Street offices. 
The Group continues to demonstrate 
excellent cash generative characteristics 
as mentioned above with consistently 
high levels of cash conversion. These 
characteristics were recognised by the 
continued support from our principal 
bank debt providers who extended the 
multi-currency £65m debt facility on 1 
July 2015 until 1 July 2020. This facility 
was increased to £85m in support of the 
acquisition of HSJ in January 2017. The 
facility can be extended by a further £15m 
to £100m if required with majority lending 
bank consent.
Our ability to use third party debt finance 
remains a key component of our business 
development strategy and our debt 
capacity remains strong. As we increase 
our profits given the cash generative ability 
of our business this combines to provide 
increased capacity for selective earnings 
enhancing acquisitions and other capital 
investments. 
Board changes
Anthony Foye has informed the Board 
of his intention to step down from his 
position as Chief Financial Officer in due 
course. Anthony will remain in his position 
until June 2018 while a successor is 
found and to ensure a smooth and orderly 
handover. The Board will initiate a search 
for his successor and an update in relation 
to a new Chief Financial Officer will be 
made in due course.

I am proud of the Group’s record of 
maintaining its dividend over recent 
years and the resumption in 2013/14 of 
a progressive dividend policy reflecting 
our improving financial performance. Our 
dividend payment policy remains the 
same and underpins our confidence in 
the strategy and vision and the resilience 
of our business models. I am pleased 
to confirm that the final dividend for 
this year will be increased again to 4.6p 
(2016: 4.3p) per share, an increase of 
7% on last year. This together with an 
increased interim dividend makes a total 
dividend of 8.5p up 5% from 2016 (8.1p) 
reflective of confidence in our future. It 
is the Board’s intention to maintain its 
progressive dividend policy whilst ensuring 
that suitable dividend cover of at least 
two times adjusted earnings per share is 
maintained. 
The final dividend of 4.6p per share 
will be paid on 17 November 2017 to 
shareholders on the share register as at 
20 October 2017, with an associated ex-
dividend date of 19 October 2017.

Current trading  
and outlook
The first two months of the year have 
started satisfactorily albeit slowly across 
the Group with revenue up 7% against 
the same period last year supported 
by the acquisition of HSJ. In Risk & 
Compliance our compliance training 
businesses which make up the bulk of the 
compliance business have started in line 
with plan although down against a strong 
comparator period in 2016. The sales 
pipeline for compliance training remains 
strong, continuing the momentum we have 
seen over the last few years and in Risk 
we have also seen a good start from Axco 
which was up 6% on the same period in 
2016.
The Professional division has started 
in line with the same period in 2016 
with good early performance from 
Accountancy product lines offsetting 
slightly weaker performances mainly from 
the re positioned Legal product which 
currently includes Ark. Healthcare which 
has the benefit of HSJ has seen good 
growth overall as a consequence of the 
acquisition and that has more than offset a 
slower start across the division. 
Relationships with our chosen 
communities and clients continue 
to evolve at an increasing pace with 
commensurate demand for more 
sophisticated interaction and bespoke 
products and services delivered instantly 
and efficiently. We see this evolution as an 
opportunity to increase our engagement 
with our markets, making us an even 
more essential business partner as well as 
creating barriers to our competitors. We 
need therefore to ensure our businesses 
are equipped with the appropriate extra 
resources, systems and support to 
capitalise on this opportunity. 
The opportunity also comes at a cost 
and we expect to step up our operating 
expenditure in 2017/18 in addition to our 
increased annual London property costs 
of £0.9m by a further £0.75m across the 
business. The additional costs which are 
discussed in the Chief Executives report 
are in people, IT infrastructure, automated 
marketing and in the digitisation of up to 
250 of our training programmes over the 
next 18 months predominantly in the Risk 
& Compliance and Professional divisions 
as part of our digital learning investment.
We continue to see tighter regulatory 
control and more complex legislation 
implemented in most of our key markets 
and we remain confident that these 
changes will continue to drive the demand 
for our products and services globally.
Wilmington has been acquisitive in the 
past and we will continue to review 
opportunities to enhance growth and to 
add expertise through selective earnings 
enhancing acquisitions consistent with 
our strategy. Our priority areas for capital 
allocation remain compliance, risk 
(insurance) and healthcare as we focus on 
adding further scale to our existing market 
positions. 
The Board, our management team and 
our staff are excited and energised about 
the opportunities driving Wilmington in the 
next stage in its development. Wilmington 
will also benefit in 2017/18 from a full year 
of contribution from HSJ as well as the 
impact of the investments made during 
2016/17.

In the mid-1980s, HSJ enjoyed a healthy period of growth, but at 
the turn of the decade it was suddenly in danger of joining many 
other B2B print titles which were in slow decline. Fortunately, 
the last five years have seen HSJ transformed into a highly 
successful digital intelligence service, an achievement which 
resulted in it being named the best B2B media brand in two out 
of the last three years.
HSJ’s success can be attributed to a number of different factors. 
Firstly, its focus on digital delivery and engagement across a 
range of platforms. The weekly print magazine has been slowly 
phased out; July 2017 saw its last edition printed. Secondly, 
development of a range of new services, most notably the 
strategic targeting and insight tool, along with the best practice 
database – HSJ Solutions – has enabled HSJ it to serve the 
evolving needs of the healthcare suppliers. Each of these services 
won major industry launch awards in both 2015 and 2017.
Additionally, leaving behind its legacy of targeting individual 
subscribers, HSJ is now focusing on organisational deals with 
NHS trusts and the suppliers who trade with them, all along 
demonstrating unwavering commitment to excellence in editorial, 
sales and marketing. 
An interesting fact is that the HSJ content team, led by Editor 
Alastair McLellan, contains twice as many expert healthcare 
correspondents as employed by the BBC. 
The sales team, led by the Commercial Director Will Johnston, 
with a mix of specialist new business leads, senior account 
managers and customer relationship executives, has powered 
the growth in HSJ’s revenues, increasing subscription revenue by 
over 60% during the last three years.
The marketing team, led by Marketing Director Dan Gorringe, has 
been responsible for migrating subscribers from print to digital 
with the minimum impact on revenues and reach.
The HSJ events team, led by the Events Director Fiona Miller, 
holds an impressive portfolio which encompasses the 36-year-old 
HSJ Awards, the largest healthcare awards in the world, and the 
prestigious ‘invitation-only’ HSJ summits which are attended by 
the sector’s leading figures, including Health Secretary Jeremy 
Hunt and NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens.
HSJ complements the existing Wilmington Healthcare business 
by providing an intelligence service to the leaders of UK 
healthcare including the NHS itself. Its integration will enable 
Wilmington to play a wider and more valuable role solving the 
challenges facing the numerous stakeholders striving to deliver 
highest quality healthcare outcomes in the most efficient way. 
HSJ’s unparalleled brand heritage provides a level of credibility 
earned over many years of providing superlative information 
resources to customers and, together with Wilmington’s other 
healthcare solutions, it positions the division to deliver unique 
value to this multi-billion pound sector.
Born in 1892 as ‘the Poor Law Officers Journal’, and after serving 
the leaders of the UK’s health services for 125 years, the Health 
Services Journal (HSJ) was acquired by Wilmington in 2017 .

Strategic Report 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
The first three measures referred to below (adjusted EBITA, 
adjusted Profit Before Tax, and adjusted Earnings per Share) 
are alternative performance measures which are also referred 
to elsewhere in the annual report. Where adjusted measures are 
used in this annual report they are clearly presented and chosen 
to provide a balanced view of the group. These measures, in 
the opinion of the Directors, can be useful to readers when they 
provide relevant information on our future or past performance 
and equivalent information cannot be presented by using financial 
measures defined under IFRS.
1
 Adjusted EBITA
This measure presents trading profits of the Group before 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets – excluding 
computer software, impairment of goodwill, gains on disposals 
of property plant and equipment (when they are material or of a 
significant nature) and adjusting items. Amortisation of intangible 
assets excluding computer software, and impairment, are 
non-cash technical accounting adjustments and therefore do 
not necessarily reflect the inherent value of assets, which can 
and often does appreciate. This is particularly the case where 
the value of assets has been enhanced as a consequence of 
management action. The group integrates acquired businesses 
into existing companies over time, and therefore the Board does 
not deem it appropriate or practical to identify income relating 
specifically to acquired intangible assets, so no adjustment is 
made in this respect.
Each business unit in the group is assessed (and in many cases 
bonuses are calculated) on adjusted EBITA and margins. These 
adjusted performances are aggregated to produce the Group 
adjusted EBITA. We do not allocate the impairment of acquired 
goodwill or intangible assets, aborted or successful acquisition 
costs, material gains on disposals of fixed assets or the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles to our business units.
See note 1 for the group policy on adjusting items and note 
2 for the calculation of Adjusted EBITA. In the year ended 30 
June 2017, Adjusted EBITA increased by 6% to £23.4m (2016: 
£22.0m).
2 Adjusted Profit before Tax
Adjusted Profit Before Tax is a product of Adjusted EBITA 
after charging finance costs. This again reflects the underlying 
performance of the business but includes finance charges 
associated with group debt. Adjusting finance costs such as write 
off of fees in relation to a refinancing of debt are excluded as 
Adjusting items.
See note 2 for the calculation of Adjusted Profit before Tax. In the 
year ended 30 June 2017, Adjusted Profit before Tax increased by 
5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m).

Key Performance Indicators and 
Operational Measures
At a Group level, we have eight key financial and operational measures. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
3 Adjusted Earnings per Share
This key measure indicates the underlying profit attributable 
to individual shareholders. It measures not only trading 
performance, but also the impact of treasury management, 
capital structure, bank and interest charges, as well as the 
efficient structuring of the Group to appropriately manage tax. 
Our business and financial strategies are directed at delivering 
consistent adjusted earnings per share growth and our incentive 
programmes are designed to support this strategy.
For the year ended 30 June 2017, Adjusted Earnings per Share 
increased by 5% to 19.05p per share (2016:18.17p). The increase 
was due to better overall financial performance achieved by the 
businesses, the efficient use of debt finance and falling UK tax 
rates.
4
 Cash Conversion
Cash conversion represents the Operating Cash Flow for the year 
as a percentage of adjusted operating profit before interest and 
amortisation. This measure is used as an indicator of successful 
stewardship of cash resources as well as corroboration of the 
quality of the operating profits compared to the associated cash 
flow. The Group’s business is strongly cash generative; Cash 
Conversion for the year ended 30 June 2017 was 114% (2016: 
108%). 
Cash  
Conversion
114%
(2016: 108%)
 
5 Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow is an important indicator of resources available 
for payment of the equity dividend and for support of our 
acquisition strategy. Free Cash Flow, which is calculated after 
deduction from operating cash flow of capital expenditure, 
payment of corporation tax and payment of interest, increased by 
3% to £18.2m (2016: £17.7m). We seek to maintain a cover of at 
least two times the equity dividend.
6  Adjusted EBITA margin  
(‘Return on sales’)
Adjusted EBITA margin or return on sales (‘ROS’) is defined 
as Adjusted EBITA (see note 2) expressed as a percentage of 
revenue. During the year ended 30 June 2017 ROS was 19.4% 
compared to 20.8% in the prior year. This is a measure of 
efficiency, albeit also a measure reflecting the mix of revenue 
streams and business units. We aim to maintain Adjusted EBITA 
margins at over 20.0%.

operating margin 
(‘Return on Sales’)
19.4%
(2016: 20.8%)
7 Return on equity (‘ROE’)
ROE is defined as the Adjusted Profit before Tax (see note 2) 
divided by the average equity attributable to owners of the 
parent

. ROE was 46.2% for the year to 30 June 2017, compared 
to 41.5% in the prior year. ROE adjusted to remove all impairment 
of goodwill and intangible assets since 30 June 2012 from Equity 
was 31.6% for the year to 30 June 2017, compared to 33.2% 
in the prior year. This measure reflects our ability to maintain an 
efficient equity base and acts as an indicator of our stewardship 
of shareholder funds. When making investment decisions, we 
focus on the impact on our equity. One important measure is the 
ROE which we seek to maintain at over 30.0% pre tax.

(‘ROE’)
46.2%
(2016: 41.5%)
8  Consistent and Sustainable  
Revenue Streams
The disposal of non-core, predominantly advertising based trade 
magazines and media brands, over recent years has allowed the 
Group to focus on a portfolio of assets based in key professional 
markets, with the emphasis on provision of information, education 
and networking to these markets. This push towards more robust 
and sustainable revenue streams has resulted in a strong portfolio 
of offerings, often sold on annual subscription, which includes:
 z data, information, intelligence and solution sales;
 z professional education, training, events and services;
 z professional accreditation and assessment; and
 z large, industry leading annual networking events.
The Group has continued to increase the availability and variety 
of its products and services online and digitally, but remains 
conscious of the needs of markets, which continue to prefer 
some products produced in hard copy format or in person. Our 
businesses are supported by management and delivery systems 
utilising appropriate technology. We have continued to invest 
considerable resources in the improvement of our operating 
systems and online services which will deliver benefits in the 
current year and beyond. Subscriptions and repeatable revenue 
represent 77% of Group turnover compared to 75% in the prior 
year.

sustainable

(2016: 75%)
9  At Divisional level we have a number  
of measures
At Divisional level we maintain a number of Key Performance 
Indicators (‘KPI’s’) specific to the performance of each business 
within the division. Each of the operating divisions monitors, and 
is in turn assessed on, their own key performance measures. This 
year we delivered an improved performance against the majority 
of our Divisional financial and operational targets. By continuing 
to focus on these benchmarks, we have been able to concentrate 
on mitigating the adverse effects of the downturn in some global 
markets and produce good results whilst establishing a more 
resilient and efficient platform to support future growth.

I am pleased to present my report on 
Wilmington’s performance for the 12 
months to 30 June 2017. During the year 
revenue increased by 14% (£14.6m) and 
was up 9% in constant currency terms. 
Adjusted EBITA was also up increasing by 
6% to £23.4m. We achieved good revenue 
growth from our Risk & Compliance 
division up 9% overall (£3.5m) and from 
our Healthcare division which was up 
28% (£8.4m). The Professional division 
also recorded growth, up 7% (£2.8m) 
albeit supported by acquisition-led growth 
from SWAT (£4.7m). HSJ acquired on 31 
January 2017 added £3.7m to Healthcare 
revenue.
Organic revenue growth (excluding 
currency and acquisitions) remains a 
priority but this year’s overall organic 
growth was down 0.8%. Organic 
performance was impacted by the well-
publicised issues around AMT and the law 
for lawyers’ products. Adjusting for these 
two businesses, over 85% by value of the 
remainder of our businesses delivered on 
average organic growth in excess of 2%. 
This represents an improvement over the 
performance for the first half year which 
showed an organic revenue decline of 2%. 
The growth within Healthcare of 28% 
reflects excellent returns from acquisitions 
we have made since the beginning of 2016 
and supported by 9% organic growth 
from our UK healthcare business. Overall 
the Healthcare division’s organic growth 
was 3% in constant currency terms with 
overall growth in healthcare offset by the 
expected decline in our legacy non-
healthcare assets. The Risk & Compliance 
increase of 9% (4% organic constant 
currency) continued its trend of strong 
organic growth led by the compliance 
training business which was up 8% 
despite some slippage into 2017/18. 
Whilst the Professional division recorded 
revenue growth up 7% this was due to 
the acquisition of SWAT and support from 
underlying growth from Accountancy 
which more than offset the issues with our 
law for lawyers’ product lines and AMT our 
Investment bank training business.
Profit growth generally was constrained 
by the previously announced planned 
investments particularly in our compliance 
businesses, from the weaker performance 
from AMT and from our US operations; 
and some slippage of compliance training 
assignments. Recent acquisitions have 
however performed strongly in both 
revenue and profit contribution terms and 
these results have also benefited from 
favourable currency exchange effects on 
both revenue and on profits adding around 
£5.0m and £1.0m respectively. 
Finance costs before adjusting items were 
up 16% (£0.3m) compared to 2015/16 
reflecting inter alia £20.3m spent on 
acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and 
deferred consideration during the year 
which contributed to an increase in net 
debt of £5.3m to finish at £40.0m.
The growth in Adjusted EBITA offset by the 
increase in adjusted finance costs resulted 
in Adjusted Profit before Tax up £1.1m 
(5%) to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m).

Divisional revenue increased by 9%

by 3% (£0.4m) reflecting investment within 
our compliance business in new products, 
the new North American compliance 
operation, and in additional support staff 
to expand our infrastructure and to help 
in the drive to boost ICA membership. 
We had also increased resources during 
the final quarter of 2017 on the back of 
our recent success in winning two large 
international training programmes which 
are now expected to be delivered during 
2017/18. These additional resources and 
investments have impacted margins in 
the short term but are expected to benefit 
contribution in 2017/18 and indeed future 
years.
During the year, the net investment in 
our North American office amounted to 
£0.5m, and additional resources in terms 
of senior appointments, trainers, sales and 
administrative support staff together with 
digital learning capability and bespoke 
compliance programmes to expand our 
infrastructure were £0.5m. 
“This year we will sharpen our focus further still. We will continue 
the integration of our Professional division and accelerate the digital 
transition of our products. Later in the year we will also be bringing 
300, nearly one third of our global workforce, of Wilmington’s people 
under one roof, reinforcing our culture as ‘One Wilmington’, ensuring 
we can collaborate effectively and helping us to attract and retain the 
best talent in our industry.”

Compliance 
Our compliance business which accounts 
for just over 50% of the division’s revenue 
grew by 10% compared to 2015/16 (4% 
constant currency). However, within this, 
our compliance training businesses which 
are the division’s main engine of growth, 
grew by 12% (8% constant currency) 
slightly down on our expectations due 
to some slippage of assignments into 
2017/18. 
Compliance Week, our US Governance 
Risk and Compliance (GRC) events and 
information business reported revenue up 
16% and on a constant currency basis 
revenue was flat. There is an ongoing 
programme of investment in new content 
and technology to reposition the business 
as a GRC resource centre and events 
business collaborating with other parts 
of Wilmington, in particular ICT and 
ICA but also FRA on joint events. The 
flagship event in Washington held in May 
2017 enjoyed continued success and 
again attracted record delegates and 
sponsorship offsetting some decline in 
subscribers and sponsored events in 
the rest of the business. For 2017/18 
continued investment is being made to 
strengthen the content offering and more 
topic areas will be added together with 
supporting databases. 
Risk
Axco, the industry leading provider of 
insurance market intelligence, regulation 
and compliance information reported 8% 
revenue growth (3% constant currency) 
helped by the continued success of its 
digital subscription products and the 
insight products which enhance our 
analytical insurance offerings. 
The remainder of the risk part of the 
division performed well recording 9% 
growth overall (3% constant currency). In 
August 2016, we successfully opened a 
new insurance events and training office 
in Barcelona in response to increasing 
localised demand for our insurance 
offerings. 
Overall divisional contribution decreased 
by £0.4m (3%) to £12.3m (2016: £12.7m). 
Margins were down to 29% (2016:

reported had a weak first half year which 
was mainly due to the competition issues 
previously highlighted but also due to 
some softening of training assignments in 
the Asia Pacific region. The second half 
year saw stabilisation of the business and 
we are now entering the busy summer 
training period with early indications of 
slow but more stable trading. 
The division saw good underlying growth 
from accountancy training (adjusting for 
the benefit from the one off double UK 
Government fiscal budget in 2015/16) 
offset by previously reported challenging 
market conditions in the Law for Lawyers 
businesses following changes to the Legal 
CLE rules. 
Divisional contribution was down 5% 
(£0.3m) on last year at £5.9m and margins, 
as we saw at the half year were particularly 
impacted by the issues at AMT. 
The Professional division is being 
refocussed and integrated as an integral 
part of project Sixth Gear under the 
leadership of its new Divisional Director

Wilmington Healthcare business, which 
following the HSJ acquisition will 
represent over 80% of the division by 
revenue on a pro-forma basis, had a 
good year with organic revenue from 
the UK businesses up 9%. The legacy 
UK businesses and brands have been 
successfully supplemented by strategically 
relevant acquisitions and unified under the 
Wilmington Healthcare brand and a single 
management team. This performance 
was supported by good performances 
from APM and from our US healthcare 
networking events. 
HSJ which was acquired on 31 January 
2017 has had an excellent start and has 
been fully integrated with the employees 
transferred to our Underwood Street 
offices in March and all transactional 
processes and functions transferred onto 
Wilmington systems by 30 June 2017. 
The legacy data suppression and charities 
businesses were marginally down (4%) as 
expected in revenue terms compared to 
last year and the focus continues to be on 
delivering higher margins through ongoing 
reorganisation and the review of marginal 
business operations. 
Benefiting from profit contributions from 
acquisitions, overall contribution increased 
by 33% (£2.4m) to £9.7m. Contribution 
growth was 27% in constant currency 
terms.
Group overheads
Group overheads, which include board 
costs, head office salaries as well as 
unallocated central overheads, increased 
by £0.4m (11%) to £3.9m (2016: £3.5m). 
Project Sixth Gear update 
As outlined in the Chairman’s section we 
are progressing well with project Sixth 
Gear which is a project to speed up the 
integration of Wilmington. Sixth gear is 
already well advanced in the achievement 
of many of its objectives including the 
consolidation of the London offices, 
the consolidation of all UK travel and 
subsistence, marketing best practice, 
procurement, key account management 
and centralised functions. 
New London Head Office
A key objective of project Sixth Gear was 
the consolidation of the remaining London 
office locations into an appropriate single 
location bringing Wilmington businesses 
closer together. On 20 June 2017, we 
completed the sale of our Underwood 
Street lease and signed a 10-year lease 
for new premises in the Aldgate area of 
London. The Underwood Street premises 
has served Wilmington well for many years 
but given its modular structure arranged 
over 4 floors it was not consistent with 
our vision and strategic objective of 
encouraging greater collaboration, flexible 
working and the building of a “one 
Wilmington” team. 
The investment and step change in our 
working conditions will undoubtedly 
lead to many benefits both financial and 
operational over time. Initially there will be 
an annual step up in operating costs of 
around £0.9m pa starting from occupation 
in January 2018. However, given the 
disposal proceeds from Underwood 
Street the cash outflow including fit out 
costs and associated tax will be neutral 
for the first 5 years. The Underwood 
Street sale produced a net profit of £6.3m 
which is shown on the face of the income 
statement.
We expect an adjusting operating expense 
in 2017/18 of £1.4m in respect of property 
costs. Included in this item is £0.4m in 
respect of the non-cash write off of the 
remaining property plant and equipment 
in use in existing properties and £1.0m 
of the double running costs covering part 
of the rent free period of the new Aldgate 
premises. 
Exit from Legal practice 
support market 
As previously announced and resulting 
from our decision to focus Wilmington 
around three divisional knowledge areas 
we decided to exit the legal practice 
support markets. We therefore looked 
to dispose of our Ark business which 
contributed £2.8m (£2.6m constant 
currency; 2016: £3.0m) to revenue 
and £0.1m to profit before central 
overhead allocations in 2016/17. The 
five-month sale process to find a new 
home for the Ark business ultimately 
proved unsuccessful so we are closing 
all operations except the US events 
business and some parts of the UK events 
businesses which remain profitable and 
are consistent with our strategy. We have 
entered into consultation with the staff 
affected and redundancy and other related 
costs are expected to come to £0.2m. We 
have also decided to impair the remaining 
associated goodwill and intangible 
fixed assets relating to this investment. 
This impairment is shown as a £2.4m 
impairment charge.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
New learning 
management system 
(LMS)
Wilmington has already invested 
significant resource in setting up and 
developing an embryonic programme of 
next generation digital training products 
and learning support systems. During 
2016/17 we set up a dedicated e-learning 
team and we selected Totara© as our 
new learning management system. 
Totara© integrates with other key systems 
such as SalesForce© and our new 
automated marketing system Marketo© 
and provides the end to end platform for 
our all products facilitating an ambitious 
roll out of new digital training courses. 
The market for bespoke digital training 
programmes and other allied products is 
evolving rapidly and we believe it is set 
to grow strongly over the next few years. 
Wilmington, like its larger competitors is 
positioning itself to take advantage and 
is investing in blended digital learning 
solutions taking an increasingly “digital 
first” approach to new training product 
launches. We have identified up to 250 
existing training courses across the Group 
which can be repurposed and restructured 
as blended digital training products; 
learning and building from the established 
pioneering digital training programmes of 
SWAT and AMT and coordinated by the 
newly formed digital learning team. The 
cost of conversion of existing and the 
launch of new courses is likely to see an 
increase in operational costs and working 
capital as investment feeds through. We 
however expect to see many commercial 
advantages including higher adjusted 
EBITA margins in the medium term, 
greater ability to repurpose and repackage 
products across Wilmington communities 
and the exploitation of overseas market 
opportunities. As explained in the 
Chairman’s statement the costs of this 
are included in the expected £0.75m of 
additional costs for 2017/18. 
Acquisitions 
In July 2016 Wilmington acquired SWAT 
Group Limited (‘SWAT’), a leading provider 
of training, and technical compliance 
support to accountancy firms in London 
and the South West of England. SWAT 
sits inside the professional division 
offering training, and technical accounting 
services. The consideration paid was 
an initial cash payment of £2.5m and a 
deferred consideration payment of up to 
£3.0m payable in September 2018 in cash 
subject to SWAT achieving challenging 
profit targets over the two financial years 
ending 30 June 2018.
On 31 January 2017 Wilmington acquired 
HSJ for £16.9m after an adjustment for 
working capital. HSJ is one of the UK’s 
leading health information, insight and 
networking business with a highly-trusted 
brand providing unparalleled penetration 
into the NHS and private vendor space 
through subscription information and 
data products, events and awards 
and marketing solutions. HSJ has a 
growing recurring revenue stream from 
subscriptions and annual events. 
The HSJ business is integral to 
Wilmington’s market leading healthcare 
business significantly enhancing the 
Group’s presence across the UK 
healthcare market. Uniquely, Wilmington 
Healthcare now has a complete UK 
industry presence across both provider/
payer and the private sector in Pharma 
and MedTech and other healthcare 
providers. 
Executive team 
To support our exciting growth strategy, 
we have continued to strengthen our 
executive team with the appointment 
of a senior executive with particular 
experience and a successful track record 
in designing and implementing large scale 
digital learning initiatives to head up our 
Professional division. The integration 
of the Professional division is a priority 
objective and consequence of project 
Sixth Gear which will particularly benefit 
from the key account management, 
common platforms and work flow 
processes which should in turn reflect 
in improving margins over the next few 
years.

Case studies
“Lead with conviction, passion and purpose. 
Give people wings and let them fly, then 
recognise and reward success, while allowing 
room for error without blame.”
Aged 21, Nicola Hurley already managed her own graphics studio, 
working primarily for London-based print consultancies. In 2006 she 
was working for Mercia Group – a leading provider of training support 
services to the accountancy profession in the UK and Ireland – and 
when that year Mercia was acquired by Wilmington, Nicola was the 
first non-accountant to be appointed a Director.
In 2014 Nicola was promoted to Managing Director, and since has 
been instrumental in the drive to move the company firmly into the 
digital era, developing and enhancing its online presence on all 
fronts. Mercia firmly employs technology as an enabler for its clients 
– accountancy businesses ranging in size from sole practitioners to 
top-ten firms. Keeping them competitive is as important as future-
proofing Mercia itself.
Wilmington’s core values feature prominently in Nicola’s approach to 
managing her people. “They mean everything! If you lead by example 
and embed all four values within your team, your business can’t help 
but grow”, she says. “You develop an exciting environment, both 
to work within and to partner with. You become an employer and 
business partner of choice, providing products that clients need and 
which help their businesses to grow.”
Nicola is adamant that Wilmington’s values also encourage team 
members to grow and reach their potential. “Give people wings and 
let them fly” is her mantra – one that both shapes and exemplifies her 
leadership style.
In 2017, Mercia’s overriding priority was to complete the integration 
of SWAT UK Limited, one of Wilmington’s 2017 acquisitions. SWAT’s 
business largely mirrors Mercia’s, with complementary geographical 
coverage of the same target market. Nicola’s objective is to exploit 
business opportunities and to realise efficiencies through a unified set 
of business tools, best-in-class processes and a shared, innovative 
culture.
“We have to become one team, selling an extensive portfolio of 
products that supports our clients through a period of major change in 
the sector”, she insists.
Small wonder then, that her secondary objective is to improve 
Mercia’s use of technology, enlarge its portfolio of online courses 
and broaden its range of publications. These are projects that mean 
recruiting new team members, highly capable people who thrive on 
responsibility, enjoy technical challenges and exceed demanding 
targets.

“In 1993, it would have been difficult to predict 
how successful Semana del Seguro (Inese’s 
Insurance Week conference) would become. 
Today, it attracts delegates from around the 
Spanish-speaking world.”
If there’s anything you need to know about the Spanish insurance 
market, you won’t find anyone better qualified to tell you than Susana 
Pérez, Managing Director of Wilmington’s flagship insurance business 
in Spain. In 1988, after completing a law degree at one of Spain’s 
top universities, she started what was to become a single-company 
career with Inese, then a family-owned business in Madrid; grasping 
the opportunity, she advanced rapidly to become Director of Training 
and Studies.
In 2001, Inese was acquired by Reed Business Information, with 
Susana being appointed to the advisory board and subsequently 
becoming Inese’s Managing Director in 2007. Under her leadership, 
the company has moved from strength to strength, and it joined 
Wilmington’s Risk & Compliance division in 2013.
Inese provides training, information, communication and global 
marketing solutions for the insurance industry in Spanish-speaking 
countries. Refusing to conform to the industry’s reputation for being 
dry and dull, Susana has driven the company to embrace the digital 
revolution in its own operations, and pushes the boundaries with 
unrelenting persistence at Inese’s many industry events, including the 
highly successful Semana del Seguro (Insurance Week) conference.
“I have been part of every Semana del Seguro since its inception 
in 1993”, she says. “Today, it attracts delegates from around the 
Spanish-speaking world. Last year there were nearly 4,000 registered 
visitors and more than 300 speakers.”
Sometimes, it’s hard for people to accept the degree of change that 
Inese is facing; Pérez’ responses include an “innovation competition” 
for her staff, frequent in-house training on the use and benefits of new 
tools and resources, plus regular initiatives to ‘retire’ products and 
services that are no longer relevant. “If we focus only on introducing 
new offerings”, she says, “we are at risk of confusing our customers. 
Moving them away from familiar but outdated products, and 
supporting the transition to new, digital alternatives is essential.”
Alongside with growing business in Spain, Susana finds time to 
progress another of her key strategic tasks – expanding Inese’s 
business into Latin America. “It’s vital”, she says, “that Inese is ready 
to help insurers in these Spanish-speaking countries to accelerate 
digital transformation and to expand market reach.”
Susana accepts that the next decade will probably see even faster 
rates of change in the insurance sector than Inese has experienced 
in the past ten years. But it’s clear that, under her leadership, Inese is 
ready for the challenge.

“We aim to own the information, education and 
intelligence space in healthcare in France and 
a few specific areas internationally.”
Loïc Lebrun is a man for whom actions speak louder than words. 
Described by a former colleague as having “an outstanding ability to 
execute”, Loïc is a finance professional who worked in the aerospace 
and defence industries, before moving in the early 2000s to what was 
then an emerging digital-insights sector for healthcare professionals. 
For the next decade, Loïc broadened his experience in financial, 
sales and general-management roles with a leading international 
healthcare-insight company. He soon recognised the potential of 
premium niche products as a means of attracting and retaining high-
value subscribers who want to be part of special-interest communities 
– a realisation that has driven his work since then.
In 2014, he was appointed the Managing Director of Wilmington’s 
first international acquisition, Agence de Presse Médicale (APM), an 
independent press agency specialising in the healthcare sector in 
France and across Europe. “Unlike many Wilmington businesses, 
which made the transition from print-based models, APM is a digital-
native company – it embraced electronic formats from the day it was 
founded”, Loïc explains.
APM plans to launch two or three new products – typically 
subscription-based niche websites – each year. “The healthcare 
landscape is evolving rapidly and this forces us to rethink our 
approaches continually – which is sometimes difficult, but always 
interesting”, Loïc continues. 
As you would expect from a proven early adopter, there is clear 
evidence of successful innovation at APM; in 2016, it launched 
APMjob.com, an online job board – and the company’s first non-
editorial product. “APM without innovation is unthinkable,” says Loïc. 
“In fact, I’m very comfortable with all Wilmington’s core values as they 
have been guiding my career for many years. My favourite? Without 
doubt, it’s ‘Enabling’, as it’s the key to developing our people.”
APM’s subscribers can continue to rely on the company to set the 
daily news agenda for the European healthcare markets, reflecting 
Loïc‘s deep understanding of the business drivers behind APM’s 
financial outcomes. His keen sense of appreciation for his clients’ 
requirements will surely continue to drive APM’s success – or, to use 
his own words: “I’m just doing something I really enjoy and working 
very hard at it; the rest simply follows.”

“I often say that I am a doer, learning how to 
dream. Challenges give rise to opportunities 
to think differently and to provide insightful 
solutions.”
Growing up in Malaysia, Quin quickly learned that girls are not 
expected to have careers; but rather than discouraging her, this 
realisation spurred her to believe ever more strongly in her potential.
In the early 1990s, backing herself to succeed in a heavily 
male-dominated profession, Quin applied for a junior role in 
PricewaterhouseCoopers’ audit and business-advisory division. 
Selected from hundreds of candidates for one of only twenty 
positions, Quin seized her moment in the sun. “I carried as many 
hard-folder files as my male colleagues, worked at least as diligently 
and even won a gold medal in the national CPA exams”, she recalls.
Quin’s can-do attitude launched a successful accountancy career 
that saw her working in the world’s leading financial centres, including 
Hong Kong, Shanghai, London and Melbourne. She gravitated into 
senior strategic roles that went beyond a typical CFO’s remit, making 
her the ideal candidate when, in 2016, Wilmington sought a business 
leader to deliver the company’s Asia strategy. Where others see 
challenges, Quin sees opportunities: “I often say that I am a doer, 
learning how to dream. Challenges give rise to opportunities to think 
differently and provide insightful solutions, sparking the doer in me 
into action.
“The most exciting challenge we face is expanding Wilmington in 
Asia, against the swelling tide of small players with varying qualities of 
services, with some resorting to price-war tactics. The key to winning 
is to provide unique, high-quality services, setting a consistently 
professional tone; this is Wilmington’s hallmark, differentiating us from 
other players. We succeed by being innovative with our marketing 
programmes, by engaging actively with our clients and by being close 
to the heartbeat of the industry.”
Ten years ago, Quin set herself a simple, but powerful aspiration 
– to create opportunities for people to develop their potential: “At 
that time, I did not have a clear plan how to go about doing that. 
However, what I did know was that I would need to be creative 
and innovative, and I must collaborate with others. Ten years on, 
I walked into Wilmington headquarters in London, and the words 
‘Collaborate, Innovate, Enhance and Enable’ welcomed me. If felt 
like coming home.” Since then, her greatest discovery is that all of us 
can do something to help, even something small, and that lives can 
be transformed as a result. “We all have the power to make that one 
phone call that costs us nothing, to lend a helping hand, or say a kind 
word of encouragement. It may go a long, long way for that person”, 
she reminds colleagues frequently.

We seek to employ a workforce that 
reflects both the diversity of our customers 
and the communities where we have a 
presence. We do not discriminate on 
grounds of age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
religion, sexual orientation or disability. 
We strive to provide all our employees 
opportunities to grow and develop whilst 
at Wilmington. These opportunities include 
excellent working conditions, access to 
the latest technology and appropriate 
training and development to help and 
encourage our employees to fulfil their 
potential.
Our apprentice and intern programmes 
have also continued to grow over time, 
across different businesses and key 
geographical locations, developing still 
further the Group’s community and people 
investment. 
Wilmington plays an important role in 
supporting the charity community, for 
example www.charitychoice.co.uk, a 
website which supports charities and 
raises awareness of their fundraising 
activities. The online donation service 
coordinated donations during the year of 
£842,000 for various charities.
Environmental policies
The Board recognises that Wilmington’s 
business has an impact on the 
environment, principally through the use 
of energy, waste generation, paper use 
and print and production technologies. 
We are committed to reducing the 
impact wherever possible and to utilising 
sustainable materials and technology. We 
seek to ensure that Wilmington’s divisions 
are compliant with relevant environmental 
legislation and require, where possible, 
our suppliers and contractors to meet 
the same objectives. Furthermore, our 
progress towards a digitally based 
business is reducing our environmental 
impact. Accordingly, whilst environmental 
issues are important we do not believe 
that they constitute a risk for the Group.
The Head of Facilities Management is 
responsible for managing and monitoring 
environmental issues across the Group.
Our policies are to:
 z meet or exceed the requirements of 
current environmental legislation that 
relates to the Group;
 z minimise energy and water usage in 
our buildings, vehicles and processes 
and improve the efficient use of those 
resources;
 z apply the principles of continuous 
improvement in respect of air, water, 
noise and light pollution from our 
premises, and reduce any impacts from 
our operations on the environment and 
local community;
 z minimise our waste and then reuse or 
recycle as much of it as possible;
 z as far as possible, purchase products 
and services that do the least damage 
to the environment and encourage 
others to do the same;
 z ensure environmental and energy 
performance issues are considered in 
the acquisitions, refurbishment, design, 
location and use of buildings;
 z assess the environmental impact of any 
new processes of products we intend 
to introduce in advance;
 z ensure understanding of our 
environmental policy internally and 
externally and communicate its 
performance on a regular basis, and 
encourage feedback;
 z set and monitor KPIs for our 
environmental performance at least 
annually; and
 z update our environmental policy 
regularly.
Paper
Paper is sourced from a chain of 
custody certified suppliers to ensure 
only sustainable raw materials are used 
within its production. The vast majority 
of paper is produced at mills with ISO 
14001 accreditation and Environmental 
Management System (‘EMAS’) registration.
Printers
All our major print suppliers are ISO14001 
certified or encouraged to work towards 
a minimum of this standard. Many now 
also utilise Forest Stewardship Council 
or Programme for the Endorsement of 
Forest Certification. All our printers work 
in a digital environment, with the resultant 
reduction in transport, courier and energy 
utilising activities.
Packaging
For magazines we use recyclable 
polythene with a thickness of 25 microns. 
Where possible we are also converting 
to exo-biodegradable and potato starch 
forms of polythene.
Offices
The Group’s activities are primarily based 
in office accommodation and, wherever 
practicable, the Group adopts energy 
saving policies. Any new or replacement 
air conditioning units are being sourced 
from the energy efficient range and show 
a 70% saving in energy consumption. 
With regard to the office environment, 
the Group encourages the recycling of 
materials such as paper, cardboard, toners 
and cartridges wherever possible. The 
Group also ensures the correct disposal of 
electrical equipment and fluorescent tubes 
is compliant with the Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Directive.
During the year the Group has performed 
a comprehensive review of its London 
property portfolio, in order to maximise 
efficiency and reduce underutilised office 
space. One of the key outcomes of the 
review is the relocation of the head office 
from Underwood Street to new premises 
during the financial year ended 30 June 
2018, which will facilitate increased 
pooling of resources and subsequently 
reduce energy and material consumption. 
Wilmington seeks to be socially responsible, having a positive impact on the 
communities within which it operates.

Travel
The introduction of video conferencing 
technology in the Group’s offices has 
significantly reduced the requirements 
for travel, particularly when dealing with 
overseas offices and clients. The success 
of training webinars has also seen the 
additional benefit of reducing delegate 
travel to venues. Wilmington is also 
continuing its cycle incentive incorporating 
the Cycle to Work scheme which is 
within the guidelines of the Government’s 
green travel plan. As part of the scheme 
Wilmington provides employees with a 
loan for cycle and safety equipment up to 
a maximum of £1,000. To further support 
the cycle scheme, Wilmington has also 
arranged for free cycle parking facilities for 
employees based in its London offices.
Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
The release of greenhouse gases (‘GHG’), notably carbon dioxide (‘CO2’) generated by 
burning fossil fuels, has an impact on climate change which, either directly or indirectly, 
presents considerable risks both to the business and the planet. The Group is committed 
to monitoring and, where practically possible, reducing its GHG emissions.

Methodology
Wilmington’s GHG emissions were calculated with the assistance of a specialist third

(verified by third party supplier invoicing), and emission factors from Defra’s Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014 for converting energy usage to carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO

Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition). The analysis has used 
an operational control approach – this means that certain sites which have a service 
agreement for utilities have not been included in the footprint.
This assessment takes into account of all of the emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.

2017 revenue increased by 14% (£14.6m) 
to £120.3m (2016: £105.7m). On a 
constant currency basis revenue was up 
9%. Acquisitions and favourable exchange 
rates accounted for the reported revenue 
growth with organic revenue down 0.8% 
overall. 
Operating expenses 
before adjusting items 
amortisation and 
impairment
Operating expenses before amortisation 
and impairment, excluding adjusting 
items, were £97.0m (2016: £83.7m) 
up 16% reflecting inter alia significant 
investment in staff and new premises in 
the period as well as costs associated 
with operating acquired businesses. For 
the first time share based payments of 
£0.6m (2016: £0.6m) are included within 
operating expenses before adjusting 
items, amortisation and impairment.
Amortisation excluding 
computer software
Amortisation of intangible assets 
(excluding computer software) was £6.0m, 
compared to £5.5m in the previous year. 
The increase reflects acquisitions made in 
the period. 
Impairment of goodwill 
and intangible assets
A non-cash impairment of £2.4m has 
been made against the carrying values 
for goodwill and intangible assets in the 
Ark cash generating unit (CGU) following 
the failure to sell the business and the 
resultant decision to close operations. 
Ark was acquired by Wilmington plc in 
October 2005 and the original investment 
was impaired in 2015/16 by £1.0m. Further 
information is given in note 12.
The 2016 comparator figure of £15.7m 
relates to the impairment of CLT and the 
Ark CGU.

Adjusting items within 
operating expenses
Adjusting items within operating expenses 
were £3.5m (2016: £2.4m). These items 
include £1.6m relating to acquisition 
costs (2016: £1.7m), £0.5m in respect 
of project Sixth Gear, £0.3m in respect 
of the relocation of back office functions 
from London and £1.0m in respect of 
costs associated with the London move 
including the termination or disposal of 
property leases.
Other Income – gain on 
disposal of leasehold 
property
The gain of £6.3m is in respect of the 
disposal of the Underwood Street lease 
for £7.3m in cash less associated costs of 
the sale and the net book values of assets 
associated with the leasehold property.
Operating profit/(loss) 
(“EBITA”)
Operating profit was £17.8m compared to 
an operating loss of £1.5m in 2016. The 
2016 comparator loss was due inter alia to 
a non-cash impairment of £15.7m. 
Adjusted EBITA 
Adjusted EBITA was up £1.4m (6%) to 
£23.4m (2016: £22.0m). Adjusted EBITA 
margins (Adjusted EBITA expressed as a 
percentage of revenue were 19.4% (2016: 
20.8%).
Finance costs
Finance costs before adjusting items 
which consist of interest payable and 
bank charges were up 16% to £2.0m from 
£1.7m reflecting an increase in net debt 
in the period. Net debt, which includes 
cash and cash equivalents, bank loans 
(excluding loan arrangement fees) and 
bank overdrafts, was £40.0m (30 June 
2016: £34.7m) at the year-end an increase 
of £5.3m on last year. The increase in 
debt reflects £20.3m (including deferred 
consideration) spent on acquisitions 
offset by the proceeds of £7.3m from the 
disposal of the Underwood Street offices. 
Finance costs including adjusting items 
were up 2% (£0.1m) on 2016. Adjusting 
items in 2016 relate to the previous loan 
facility written off.
Profit/(loss) before 
taxation 
Profit before tax of £15.9m was up 
compared to a loss of £3.4m in 2016 
principally due to the non-cash impairment 
of £15.7m in 2016 compared to increased 
trading profits in 2017 and the gain on 
the disposal of the leasehold property. 
Adjusted Profit before Tax increased by 5% 
(£1.1m) to £21.4m from £20.3m (note 2).
Taxation
Taxation increased by £0.2m (5%) to 
£3.0m from £2.8m. The increase in the 
taxation charge is due to an increase 
in profits before tax, adding back the 
impairment provisions of £2.4m (2017) and 
£15.7m (2016) offset by a reduction to UK 
corporation tax rates. 
The effective tax rate is 16.4% (2016: 
23.2%) which is calculated after adding 
back the impairment charge of £2.4m 
(2016: £15.7m). This charge is reduced 
compared to 2015/16 due to the relatively 
low effective tax rate associated with the 
leasehold property disposal. 
The underlying tax rate which ignores the 
tax effects of adjusting items remained the 
same as 2016 at 22.4%. The underlying 
tax rate is calculated as the product of one 
minus the adjusted profit after tax per note 
9 of £16.6m (2016: £15.8m) divided by the 
adjusted profit before tax of £21.4m (2016: 
£20.3m).
Earnings/(loss) per share
Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share 
increased by 5% to 19.05p (2016: 18.17p). 
Basic earnings per share was 14.72p 
compared to a basic loss per share of 
7.39p in 2016.
Goodwill 
Goodwill increased by £15.2m from 
£70.8m to £86.0m due to additions of 
£14.9m arising from businesses acquired 
in the period, the reallocation of £1.3m of 
assets between goodwill and intangibles 
(note 12) and exchange rate movements 
of £0.5m. These were offset by an 
impairment of £1.5m.
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets increased by £2.9m from 
£29.0m to £31.9m due to acquisitions 
of £10.1m arising from businesses 
acquired in the period and exchange rate 
movements of £0.5m in the period, and 
other additions of computer software, of 
£1.6m. These were offset by amortisation 
of £7.2m, the reallocation of £1.3m of 
assets between goodwill and intangibles 
(note 13) and an impairment charge of 
£0.8m. 
Property, plant and 
equipment 
Property, plant and equipment 
decreased by £0.2m to £4.4m reflecting 
additions to tangible fixed assets of 
£1.3m (2016: £0.6m), additions from 
acquired businesses of £0.2m offset by 
depreciation of £1.1m and assets written 
off on disposal of the Underwood Street 
lease of £0.6m at net book value. 
Trade and other 
receivables
Trade and other receivables increased 
by £2.3m reflecting acquisitions which 
added £2.8m, offset by more efficient 
cash collection from our new credit control 
processing following its relocation.

Trade and other payables
Total balances increased from £43.9m to 
£52.3m.
Trade and other payables increased 
by £3.8m to £25.4m (2016: £21.6m) 
reflecting, inter alia, acquisitions in the 
period which accounted for £1.1m. Trade 
and other payables also include £1.8m 
in respect of various lease surrender 
costs following the London property 
consolidation, reorganisation costs 
under project Sixth Gear and other 
London property professional costs and 
equipment. 
Subscriptions and deferred revenue 
increased by £4.7m or 21% to £27.0m 
(2016: £22.3m). Acquisitions accounted 
for £3.9m of the increase, foreign 
exchange was £0.2m. Risk & Compliance 
division grew by £0.8m (8%), Professional 
division grew by 13% (£0.6m) of which 
acquisitions accounted for all the increase. 
Healthcare was up 43% (£3.3m) with 
acquisitions accounting for £3.2m of the 
overall increase. Within Risk & Compliance 
ICA membership deferred revenue is up 
118% and Axco was up 12%. 
Current tax liabilities 
Current tax liabilities increased from 
£1.6m to £1.9m reflecting acquisitions in 
the period and higher tax associated with 
higher overall group profits. 
Net debt
Net debt, which includes cash and 
cash equivalents, bank loans (excluding 
capitalised loan arrangement fees) and 
bank overdrafts, was £40.0m (30 June 
2016: £34.7m.) an increase of £5.3m. 
Acquisition costs (including deferred 
consideration) of £20.3m were offset by 
cash conversion of 114% (2016: 108%). 
Net debt at 30 June 2017 represented 
47% of our debt and overdraft facility 
of £85m. This facility was extended in 
January 2017 by a further £20m in support 
of the acquisition of HSJ from £65.0m and 
is repayable on 1 July 2020. 
Deferred consideration 
(cash settled)
Deferred consideration in total was £2.5m 
down on 2016 total liability of £2.6m. 
Movements during the year included an 
increase of £1.1m from the acquisition of 
SWAT offset by payments of £1.3m in the 
year in respect of Evantage (£0.3m) and 
FRA (£1.0m).
Derivative financial 
instruments 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange 
risks, liquidity and capital risks and credit 
risks. The Group has policies that mitigate 
these risks. Total estimated liabilities were 
£0.7m down £1.3m compared to £2.0m 
at 30 June 2016. The main reason for 
the decrease was there were no forward 
foreign currency contracts obligations 
at the balance sheet date (2016 loss 
provision £0.9m). 
On 3 July 2017 the Group entered into a 
number of foreign currency transactions 
to mitigate possible exchange rate 
fluctuations on its financial results. $10.0m 
US dollars were sold forward during 
2017/18 at an average rate of $1.31 and 
€5.0m were sold at an average rate of 
€1.14m. 
Share capital 
During the year 0.3m new ordinary 
shares of £0.05 were issued in settlement 
of shares vesting under the Group’s 
Performance Share Plan. This resulted in 
an increase to share capital of £13,112. 
Dividend
It is the Board’s intention to pay a 
progressive dividend whilst ensuring a 
cover of at least two times the Group’s 
adjusted earnings per share over the 
dividend per share in respect of the year. 
A final dividend of 4.6p per share (2016: 
4.3p) will be paid on 17 November 2017 
to shareholders on the register as at 20 
October 2017, with an associated ex-
dividend date of 19 October 2017.

Identifying and managing 
our risks
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal 
controls. Risk identification, assessment 
and management is one part of the 
Group’s internal control environment and 
risk management is recognised as an 
integral part of the Group’s activities. 
The Board determines the Group’s 
appetite for risk when considering 
strategic objectives, and the acceptable 
level of risk that can be taken on by the 
Group and its individual operating entities 
(‘Wilmington risk appetite’). Wilmington’s 
businesses worldwide are responsible for 
executing their activities in accordance 
with the local risk appetite set by the 
Board, complemented by the Wilmington 
Code of Conduct, Anti Bribery and 
Corruption (‘ABC’) guidelines, other Group 
policies, and values within delegated 
authority limits. The Risk Assessment 
covers a three year period consistent 
with the period of assessment used in the 
viability statement review.
Risk is assessed across the Group by the 
Wilmington Risk Committee (comprising 
members of the Executive Committee and 
the Group Company Secretary that report 
directly to the Board using a combination 
of structured formal interviews, monthly 
operational updates, site visits, ‘bottom 
up’ reporting and registers (the ‘Risk 
Assessment’). The Risk Assessment 
covers both external and internal factors 
and the potential impact and likelihood of 
those risks occurring. Twice per annum 
the Audit Committee discusses the 
report received from the external auditors 
regarding their audit; which includes 
comments on their findings on internal 
control and risks.
Risks once identified are reviewed and 
then incorporated into formal risk registers 
held at both a Group and at entity level, 
which evolve to reflect any reduction/
increase in identified risks and the 
emergence of any new risks. Where it is 
considered that a risk can be mitigated 
further to the benefit of the business, 
responsibilities are assigned and action 
plans are agreed.
The Wilmington Risk Committee 
coordinates and facilitates the risk 
assessment process on behalf of the 
Board. Group policies and delegated 
authority levels which are set by the Board 
provide the means by which risks are 
reviewed and escalated to the appropriate 
level within the Group, up to and including 
the Board, for review and confirmation.
We have a clear framework for identifying 
and managing risk, both at an operational 
and strategic level. Our risk identification 
and mitigation processes have been 
designed to be appropriate to the ever-
changing environments in which we 
operate.
The following chart summarises our

Risks and Uncertainties  
Facing the Business 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
Wilmington risk appetite
The Group’s approach is to minimise 
exposure to reputational, financial and 
operational risk, whilst accepting and 
recognising a risk/reward trade off in the 
pursuit of its strategic and commercial 
objectives.
As an information, education and 
networking provider to certain professional 
and regulated markets the integrity of the 
business and its brands is crucial and 
cannot be put at risk. Consequently, it 
has a zero tolerance for risks relating to 
non-adherence to laws and regulations 
(‘unacceptable risk’). The business, 
however, operates in a challenging and 
highly competitive market place that is 
constantly changing not just in regulation 
and legislation but also for new technology 
and process innovation. 
It is therefore part of day to day 
planning to make certain financial and 
operational investments in pursuit of 
growth objectives, accepting the risk 
that the anticipated benefits from these 
investments may not always be fully 
realised. Its acceptance of risk is subject 
to ensuring that potential benefits and 
risks are fully understood and sensible 
measures to mitigate risk are established.
Principal risks
The PLC Directors have carried out an 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group – including, in the year to 30 
June 2017, those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or reputation. The eleven key 
risks and uncertainties relating to the 
Group’s operations, along with their 
potential impact and the mitigations in 
place, are set out below. There may be 
other risks and uncertainties besides those 
listed below which may also adversely 
affect the Group and its performance. 
More detail can be found in the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 44 to 45.
In summary, our principal risks in the 
context of the strategic goals and viability 
review are mapped over a three year 
period as follows:
1 Lack of organic growth
2 Lack of changes to regulations and 
legislation
3 Recruitment and retention of  
high-calibre staff
4 Intellectual property rights infringement
5 Poorly evaluated and integrated 
acquisitions
6 Failure or significant interruption to  
IT systems causing disruption to  
client service

Summary of principal risk
Risk description Trend Mitigation
KEY RISK 1 
Lack of organic growth
Strategic objective: 1 & 2 
New products are critical to our 
organic growth and underpin our 
ability to maintain acceptable margins 
and best in class returns over the 
long term.
Failure to invest in our businesses 
or for investments to not deliver an 
acceptable rate of return jeopardises 
the ability for the Group to grow.
New product development ‘best practice’ is shared between the entities in 
the Group and return on investment of past and future innovation projects is 
tracked. This ensures that the collective experience and expertise of the Group 
can be utilised to maximum effect.
Large R&D projects, especially those which are capitalised, require Head Office 
approval, ensuring that the Group’s significant projects are aligned to overall 
strategy. Such projects are overseen by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief 
Technology Officer.
Workforce quality and retention is a central objective. This focus ensures that 
intangible resources stay and grow within the business.
Operating businesses are actively encouraged to develop and protect know-
how in local jurisdictions.
Innovation is encouraged and fostered throughout the Group via the Senior 
Leadership Team and the Wilmington Awards. Wilmington’s emphasis on 
efficient internal controls, high ethical standards, the deployment of high-quality 
management resources and the strong focus on quality control over products 
and processes in each operating business help protect us from product failure, 
litigation and contractual issues.
Our strategy of diversifying our service offering, focusing on our client 
communities and geographic spread mitigates the impact on the business of 
economic downturns and weak market conditions in specific geographies, but 
these factors cannot entirely mitigate the overall risk to earnings. To manage 
these risks, we continually focus on our cost base and seek to improve 
operational efficiencies.
KEY RISK 2 
Lack of changes to 
regulations and legislation
Strategic objective: 1 & 2
Wilmington’s clients and customer’s 
operations are subject to wide-ranging 
laws, regulations and legislation 
increasing operational complexity and 
heightening risk.
Changes to the regulatory landscape 
(i.e. Brexit) offer opportunities for 
Wilmington to leverage its knowledge 
and expertise to assist clients and 
customers with the change. A lack of 
regulatory change would reduce new 
opportunities for growth and demand 
for existing products and services.
This risk impacts on key risk 1.
We actively monitor government regulatory bodies and relevant committees to 
ensure that we understand the future landscape. This enables us to position 
both our existing and new products and services to help better deliver to our 
clients and customers.
Local plans are updated as part of the internal strateic planning process to 
enable us to respond quickly to market information and economic trends. 
Continual monitoring of market conditions and market changes against our 
Group strategy, supported by the reforecasting and reporting in all of our 
businesses, are key to our ability to respond rapidly to changes in our operating 
environment.
The strength of Wilmington’s business and brands and the focus on client 
service. Our businesses enable professionals and their organisations to perform 
better by providing quality, relevant and reliable information, education and 
networking. Regulatory change following Brexit should increase demand for our 
product and service offerings in the short to medium term.
KEY RISK 3 
Recruitment and retention of 
high calibre staff
Strategic objective: 1, 2 & 3 
As a people business we recognise 
that the future success of our 
business is dependent on attracting, 
developing, motivating, improving and 
retaining talent.
The Group operates a competitive remuneration package that is enhanced by a 
share option plan for certain Senior Management.
Just as importantly, the Group operates a meritocratic culture where everyone 
can maximise his or her potential. 
Management Development Programmes, enhance the skills of executives and 
managers needed in their current and future roles.
The Group appointed a Group HR Director in 2016 who is a member of the 
Executive Committee and will provide leadership on succession planning and 
talent management.
The continual development of the Senior Leadership Team to encourage 
motivation and engagement with the business.

Risk description Trend Mitigation
KEY RISK 4 
Intellectual property rights 
infringement
Strategic objective: 1, 2 & 3 
Protection of our intellectual property 
builds competitive advantage by 
strengthening barriers-to-entry. Our 
intangible resources include data, 
processes, technological know-how, 
branding and our workforce.
Intellectual property rights are integral 
to the Group’s success.
We take a zero tolerance approach to any intellectual property infringement and 
will take all necessary action to enforce our rights.
Wilmington’s policy is to litigate against any infringement of our intellectual 
property rights. 
KEY RISK 5 
Poorly evaluated and 
integrated acquisitions
Strategic objective: 1 & 2
The identification and purchase 
of businesses which meet our 
demanding financial and growth 
criteria are an important part of our 
strategy for developing the Group, as 
is ensuring the new businesses are 
rapidly integrated into the Group.
We acquire businesses whose technology and markets we know well. 
The Executive Committee together with individual Managing Directors are 
responsible for identifying acquisitions in their business sectors, subject to 
Board approval. We deploy detailed post-acquisition integration plans.
Thorough due diligence is performed by a combination of in-house and, where 
needed, external experts to ensure that a comprehensive appraisal of the 
commercial, legal and financial position of every target is obtained.
Incentives are aligned to encourage acquisitions which are value-enhancing 
from day one.
The Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Foye, has concluded over 76 successful 
acquisitions in the UK and overseas.
The Board receives a full investment plan and a post-acquisition integration 
plan well in advance of any transaction.
The recent appointment of Quin Thong (Asia MD) helps with international 
acquisitions in specific territories.
KEY RISK 6 
Failure or significant 
interruption to IT systems 
causing disruption to client 
service
Strategic objective: 1, 2 & 3 
Major failures in our IT systems 
may result in client service being 
interrupted or data being lost/
corrupted causing damage to our 
reputation and consequential client 
and/or revenue loss. 
There is a risk that a cyber attack 
on our infrastructure by a malicious 
individual or group could be 
successful and impact the availability 
of critical systems. 
This risk is heightened by the office 
moves described in risk 11. 
Specific back-up and resilience requirements are built into our systems and we 
are increasingly becoming more cloud based. Our critical infrastructure is set up 
so far as is reasonably practical to prevent unauthorised access and reduce the 
likelihood and impact of a successful attack.
Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are in place and are assessed 
continually to ensure that they cover the residual risks that cannot be mitigated. 
We are constantly reviewing our resilience to cyber security attacks due to the 
increasing threat.
During recent years, the Group has outsourced the hosting of all websites 
improving resiliency, efficiency and scalability. We have a central team, 
Wilmington Group Support, to provide day to day IT & Systems support for users.
We provide and assist operating entities with strategic IT needs and to ensure 
adequate IT security policies are used across the Group. We carry out regular IT 
audits and we have comprehensive IT systems monitoring in place. We have a 
comprehensive IT induction for employees to ensure they are aware of security 
risks and how to combat them.
As part of the London office move, we will be migrating our infrastructure to a 
third party’s data centre rather than build our own in the new premises. This 
gives us greater flexibility in support and use of our internal systems. Testing 
will be carried out in advance of the migration to mitigate against disruption of 
business as usual activity.

KEY RISK 7 
Competition across  
the business
Strategic objective: 1 & 2
The markets in which we operate are 
highly competitive. The competition 
constantly challenges the boundaries 
of technological advances, regulation 
and legislation in seeking to gain an 
advantage. Competition could lead to 
a reduction in market share and/or a 
decline in revenue. 
Our focus is on retaining existing clients as well as engaging with new clients.
Our service offering continuously evolves and improves to meet the changing 
needs of our clients.
To remain competitive in all markets, we continue to promote and differentiate 
our strengths whilst focusing on providing the quality of service that our clients 
require.
We continue to invest in the development of client relationships globally and 
associated systems to support our client service offering. By empowering and 
resourcing innovation in local operations to respond to changing market needs, 
the potential adverse effects of competition can be mitigated and growth can be 
maintained.
The Group operates in specialised global niche markets offering high barriers to 
entry.
KEY RISK 8 
Technology and speed  
of change
Strategic objective: 1, 2 & 3
Digital and technological 
transformation is now moving at a 
fast pace across the globe, disrupting 
value chains and transcending 
the traditional ways of conducting 
business. 
Digitalisation is compelling our 
clients and customers to revisit their 
business models increasingly shaped 
by the digital world. Although digital 
and technological transformation 
offers Wilmington boundless 
possibilities for growth and value 
creation, it comes with its own set of 
challenges and risks.
The continued development of the digital hub has helped to bring together the 
services and products offered by Wilmington so that clients can increasingly 
access these in a ‘one-stop-shop’.
Development of new products is key to our growth and investment is given in 
areas that promote high growth (i.e. compliance). 
Combining our former Finance and Legal divisions into one new division 
(Professional) with common processes and controls. This will bring greater clarity 
and refocus the offerings of the associated businesses. The Professional division 
will be led by a newly appointed divisional director.
KEY RISK 9 
Remoteness of operations and 
globalisation
Strategic objective: 2 & 3
A key operational risk emanates from 
remoteness of operations from Head 
Office and the increasing global spread  
of our businesses. 
There is a currency risk from operating in 
a large number of countries.
Control is exercised locally in accordance with the Group’s policy of autonomous 
management. We seek to employ local high quality experts.
The Group’s acquisition model ensures retention of management and staff in 
acquired businesses meaning that local expertise is maintained.
Divisional Directors ensure that overall Group strategy is fulfilled through an 
ongoing review of the businesses. The right balance between autonomy and 
adherence to the overall objectives of the Group is a key function of the Divisional 
Directors.
We manage currency risk in local operations through natural hedging, forward 
currency contracts and by matching revenue and costs in the same currency.

Impact of General Data 
Protection Regulation
Strategic objective: 3
The General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) is the most 
significant revision of data privacy 
legislation ever seen in Europe 
introducing fines of up to €20.0m (or 
5% of group revenue, whichever is 
greater). In an increasingly data-
driven world, it places the individual 
at the heart of controlling their 
information and has a far reaching 
effect on how we manage and 
document our personal or contact 
data. 
Wilmington’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) is running a GDPR compliance 
programme to ensure that all businesses are prepared. 
There are six streams to the programme: Data Audit, Policies & Training, 
Contracts, HR, Marketing and Technology.
We are engaging with legal and technology specialists on the relevant streams.
Wilmington’s Group Head of Marketing has been heavily involved with the DPO 
in an awareness and documentation project for our marketing teams. 
Progress and development of the compliance programme is reported to the 
Board on a regular basis. 
KEY RISK 11 
Disruption around the 
London Office move 
Strategic objective: 1, 2 & 3
As announced on 4 May 2017 
the head office will move from 
Underwood Street to a newly 
refurbished premises at The White 
Chapel Building near Aldgate.
The new head office space will 
accommodate Wilmington’s London 
based businesses.
The fit out of the new premises is 
underway and the new building 
is expected to be operational in 
December 2017.
There is a risk that the move will 
cause business disruption. 
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, 
Facilities Manager and Group Human Resource Director have formed a project 
team to manage the move. 
The project team have engaged with appropriate third party specialists to ensure 
that sufficient plans are in place to achieve the objective of moving on time and 
to promote a more unified business that reflects a modern working environment, 
encourages closer collaboration and emphasises our core values and culture.
The project team is liaising directly with local management in each business 
affected to ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum.

Viability statement
In accordance with C2.2. of the 2014 
revision of the Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group. The Directors 
assessment was over a three year period 
to 30 June 2020, taking account of the 
Group’s current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks documented 
in the Strategic Report on pages 28 to 31.
Each risk and associated risks have 
been quantified in terms of their potential 
cost impact and evaluated against three 
year financial forecasts. In all scenarios 
(including an aggregation of scenarios) the 
review indicates no breach of covenants or 
the need to refinance the existing revolving 
credit facility, the facility is due for renewal 
on 1 July 2020 and it is assumed this 
renewal will be successfully completed.
The Directors have determined that 
the three year period is an appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability 
statement, being consistent with the 
period covered by the Group’s strategic 
planning process.
In making this statement the Directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
Group, taking account of its current 
position, the principal risks facing the 
business, the potential financial impact on 
market conditions and the effectiveness 
of any mitigating actions. The assessment 
considered the potential impacts of these 
identified principal risks on the business 
model, future performance, solvency and 
liquidity over the period.
The Board’s assessment has been made 
with reference to the Group’s current 
position and prospects, the Group’s 
strategic plan, the Board’s risk appetite 
and the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed in the 
Strategic Report on pages 28 to 31. 
The strategy and associated principal 
risks underpin the Group’s three-year 
plan, which the Directors review at 
least annually. The three-year plan, 
including financing projections, is subject 
to sensitivity analysis which involves 
applying different assumptions to the 
underlying forecast both individually and in 
aggregate.
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the next three years.
The Directors also considered it 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk 
management, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of these systems. These 
systems are designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and to provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
In line with the Turnbull Report 
recommendations, the Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control. The Board’s 
monitoring covers all controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management. It is 
based principally on reviewing reports 
from management to consider whether 
significant risks are identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled.
Further details of principal risks are given 
on pages 28 to 31 and details of financial 
risks such as interest rate risk, liquidity risk 
and foreign currency risk are given in the 
financial statements in note 20.
The key features of the internal financial 
control system that operated throughout 
the period under review are as follows:
i) Financial reporting
The Board reviewed the Annual Report, 
together with the annual and half-year 
results announcements. The Board 
also reviews and approves the Interim 
Management Statements.
The Board considered the appropriateness 
of the Group’s accounting policies, 
critical accounting estimates and key 
judgments. It reviewed accounting papers 
prepared by management on areas 
of financial reporting judgment. This 
included a consideration of the carrying 
value of goodwill based on executive 
management’s expectations of future 
performance, the acquisition accounting 
and the accounting treatment of the office 
move.
The Board considered and is satisfied 
that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report 
is fair, balanced and understandable, and 
that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy.

Risks and Uncertainties  
Facing the Business  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
ii) Management 
information systems
Effective planning, annual budgeting and 
monthly forecasting systems are in place, 
as well as a monthly review of actual 
results compared with budget and the 
prior year. The annual budget and monthly 
forecasts are reviewed by the Board. Risk 
assessment and evaluation takes place as 
an integral part of this process. Monthly 
reports on performance are provided to 
the Board and the Group reports results to 
shareholders twice a year.
Insurance cover for the Group, as well 
as individual operating companies, has 
been procured where it is considered 
appropriate.
iii) Internal audit
The Group continues to operate a limited 
internal audit process which performs 
relevant reviews as part of a programme 
approved by the Audit Committee. The 
Committee considers any issues or risks 
arising from internal audit in order that 
appropriate actions can be undertaken for 
their satisfactory resolution. The Internal 
Audit Manager has a direct reporting line 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
iv) Acquisitions, disposals 
and treasury
The Board also discusses in detail the 
projected financial impact of proposed 
acquisitions and disposals, including their 
financing. All such proposed investments 
are considered by all Directors. The Board 
is also responsible for reviewing and 
approving the Group’s treasury strategy, 
including mitigation against changes in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Organisations
There are well-structured financial and 
administrative functions at both the Group 
and at the operating company level staffed 
by appropriately qualified staff. The key 
functions at Group level include: Group 
accounting, corporate planning, Group 
treasury, human resources, Company 
secretarial, internal audit and Group 
taxation.
Other matters
The Group has no known issues relating 
to human rights matters. The welfare of 
all the Group’s stakeholders, including 
the community, is carefully considered to 
ensure that such parties are not adversely 
affected by the Group’s actions in the 
course of its day to day business. 
The information forming the strategic 
report on pages 02 to 33 was approved 
and authorised for issue by the Board and 
signed on their behalf on 12 September 
2017.

on the register on 20 October 2017, which together with the

total dividend for the year of 8.5p (2016: 8.1p) an overall increase 
of 4.9% per ordinary share.
Research and development activities
The Group has designed and developed a range of information, 
education and networking services to professionals and 
businesses. The Group has successfully transitioned the 
vast majority of its traditional print business publications to 
feature rich, online digital information and analysis services. 
This transition has been facilitated through the novel use of 
technology. The Group looks to continue to research and 
develop in technological areas that support the Group’s strategy.

advanced banking skills. For 2017/18 the Group is expanding its

and interests in the shares of the company are shown in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 62.
Directors’ third-party indemnity 
provisions
To preclude the possibility of the Company incurring expenses 
which might arise from the need to indemnify a Director or Officer 
from claims made against him or her or the cost associated with 
their defence, the Group has effected Directors’ and Officers’ 
qualifying third party liability insurance as permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006, which has been in force throughout the 
financial year and up to the date of approval of these financial 
statements.
Wilmington’s people

employment from disabled persons, where the requirements of 
the job may be adequately covered by a disabled person. Where 
existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy 
wherever practicable to provide continuing employment under 
normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career 
development wherever appropriate.

Communicating our plans and objectives 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
The Group places a great deal of importance on communicating 
its plans and objectives to its entire staff and, where appropriate, 
consulting with them. Each of the Divisions is led by a Divisional 
Director, some of who are shareholders in the Company and 
whose remuneration is linked to revenue and profit targets.
Financial instruments
An explanation of the Group’s treasury policies and existing 
financial instruments are set out in note 20 of the financial 
statements. 
Purchase of own shares and sale of 
treasury shares
The Group has, in previous years, purchased its own shares and 
holds such shares in treasury. No shares have been purchased 
during the year to 30 June 2017. If a purchase of own shares is 
proposed by the Directors, the Company seeks authority from its 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to purchase its own 
shares.
On 19 October 2016 262,243 ordinary shares were issued 
in respect of the vesting of the 2013 PSP Share Awards to 
employees (including Executive Directors).
At 30 June 2017, 46,584 shares were held in Treasury (2016: 
46,584), which represents 0.1% (2016: 0.1%) of the Called up 
Share Capital of the Company.
Contracts of significance with 
shareholders
The Company and its subsidiary undertakings do not have 
any contractual or other arrangements with any continuing 
shareholders which are essential to the business of the Company.
Takeover directive disclosures
As at 30 June 2017, the Company had only one authorised class 
of share, namely ordinary shares of 5p each, of which there were 
in issue 87,247,974 (2016: 86,985,731). There are no special 
arrangements or restrictions relating to any of these shares, 
whether in terms of transfers, voting rights, or relating to changes 
in control of the Company. The Company does not have any 
special rules in place regarding the appointment and replacement 
of Directors, or regarding amendments to the Company’s articles 
of association.
Under the terms of the Company’s banking arrangements, in the 
event that a person or group of persons acting in concert gains 
control of the Company, the lending banks may require, by giving 
not less than 30 days’ notice, the repayment and cancellation of 
the facilities.
Except for share awards and options, there are no special 
conditions or agreements in place which would take effect, 
alter or terminate in the event of a takeover. Subject to various 
conditions, if the Company is taken over, all share awards 
and options will vest and may be exercised. Apart from the 
interests of the Directors disclosed in the Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration and the substantial interests listed on page 43, 
there are no individuals or entities with significant holdings, either 
direct or indirect, in the Company.
Annual General Meeting
A separate notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company to be held at the offices of Canaccord Genuity,  
88 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7QR on 2 November 2017 will be 
sent out with this Annual Report and financial statements.
Corporate governance
The Company’s statement on corporate governance can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 38 to 43 of 
these financial statements. The Corporate Governance Report 
forms part of this Directors’ Report and is incorporated into it by 
cross-reference.
Going concern
As highlighted in note 20 to the financial statements, the Group 
meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through 
an overdraft facility and a revolving credit facility which were 
extended on 1 July 2015 and are next due for renewal on 1 July 
2020.
The current economic conditions create uncertainty, in particular, 
over:
 z the level of demand for the Group’s products; and
 z the exchange rate between Sterling and the US Dollar and  
the Euro.
The Group’s budgets and forecasts, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
will be able to operate within the level of its current facility and 
covenants.
After reviewing the Group’s budget, forecasts and three year 
plans for the next three years, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operation for the foreseeable future. Therefore, they have adopted 
the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.

Our Governance 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
Chairman’s introduction
Responsibility for good governance lies with the Board. As a 
Board we are committed to maintaining the highest standards 
of corporate governance and understand that an effective, 
challenging and diverse Board is essential to enable the Group 
to deliver its strategy and long-term shareholder value. Further 
information on our strategy and business model can be found on 
page 10.
The Board recognises the importance of setting the right tone at 
the top in order to guide our people’s behaviour and ensure that 
we live by and demonstrate the right values which in turn enable 
entrepreneurial and prudent management to deliver long-term 
success for the Group and its stakeholders. During the year we 
have continued to promote a culture guided by four core values 
– enabling, enhancing, collaborating and innovating. We fully 
recognise that at the heart of every successful organisation is a 
strong and healthy culture supported by a robust governance 
structure. As the custodian of Wilmington’s culture, the Board 
demands openness and transparency to maintain an environment 
in which our core values are practised by our people every day. 
Our Code of Conduct is readily accessible to all staff to support 
their day to day decision making. We demand the highest 
professional standards from all of our people all of the time and 
we have a zero tolerance approach to breaches of the Code of 
Conduct.
Compliance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code
In September 2014, the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) 
published the latest edition of the Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’) which included a number of changes relating to 
risk management, internal controls and the longer term viability 
of companies. A viability statement is therefore included in this 
Annual Report and can be found within the Strategic Report on 
page 32.
The Main Principles of the Code provide the framework for the 
reporting model which we have used for the last two years. 
Our approach to: Leadership is described on pages 39 to 40; 
Effectiveness is described on pages 41 to 42; Risk management 
and internal controls is described on page 42; Remuneration 
is described on page 43 and Relations with shareholders is 
described on page 43.
Wilmington Plc has complied with all relevant provisions of the 
Code for the year ended 30 June 2017 and from that date up to 
the date of publication of this Annual Report and Accounts.
Composition and independence
The board reviews Non-Executive Director independence on an 
annual basis and takes into account the individual’s professional 
characteristics, their behaviour at board meetings and their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate. All of the 
non-executive Directors are considered by the board to be 
independent.
The board consisted of a majority of independent non-executive 
Directors throughout the year.
Biographical details of all the current Directors are set out on 
pages 34 and 35.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the

The Board may exercise all the powers of the company, 
subject to the company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’), 
the Companies Act 2006 and any directions given by the 
shareholders by special resolution. The Articles may be amended 
by a special resolution of the company’s shareholders.
The Board meets as often as necessary to discharge its duties

Board meetings were scheduled and the Directors’ attendance 
record is set out on page 41.
The Board has three formally constituted Committees, the Audit

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and that of the Chief Executive Officer 
are held by separate individuals and the Board has clearly defined 
their responsibilities. The Chairman is primarily responsible for 
the effective working of the Board, ensuring that each Director, 
particularly the Non-Executive Directors, is able to make an 
effective contribution and provide constructive comments on the 
business. The Chief Executive Officer has responsibility for all 
operational matters which includes the implementation of Group 
strategy and policies approved by the Board.
Non-Executive Directors
All the Non-Executive Directors are independent of the 
Company’s executive management and free from any business or 
other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgment. The Non-Executive Directors are 
responsible for bringing independent and objective judgment and 
scrutiny of all matters before the Board and its Committees, using 
their substantial and wide-ranging experience.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and at the Annual General 
Meeting.
Except as disclosed in note 26 in the financial statements, no 
Director has, or had at any time during the year, any interest in 
any contract with any Group company, except for their service 
arrangements.
All Directors are equally accountable for the proper stewardship 
of the Company’s affairs, and all Directors, in accordance with the 
Articles of Association, submit themselves for re-election at least 
once every three years. At Wilmington, Directors are submitted 
for re-election every year.
Senior Independent Director
Derek Carter is the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’). His role 
as SID includes:
 z Being available to shareholders if they have concerns which 
contact through the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
Financial Officer has failed to resolve (no such requests were 
received from shareholders during the year); and
 z Meeting with the other Non-Executive Directors on the 
Board once a year to assess the Chairman’s performance 
as Chairman, taking into account the views of the Executive 
Directors.

Effectiveness
Meetings
There were ten meetings of the Board in the year. The Board 
has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for 
decision which it reviews periodically. This schedule includes 
approval of acquisitions and disposals and major capital 
expenditure. The Board also reviews the Group’s Risk Register, 
wider Risk Assessment and Viability review. At each Board 
meeting the Chief Executive Officer provided a review of the 
business and how it was performing together with strategic 
issues arising. The Non-Executive Directors often meet separately 
from the Executive Directors, usually, either before or after Board 
meetings to discuss relevant matters. In the year the range of 
subjects discussed by the Board included:
 z The strategy of the Group in response to changing economic 
conditions;
 z Key business areas, including the combination of former Legal 
and Finance divisions into one new Professional division;
 z The identification, execution and integration of acquisitions;
 z The review of the scope and progress of Project Sixth Gear;
 z The London property portfolio review;
 z The Group’s debt and capital structure, including the 
extension of the debt facility;
 z The Group’s financial results;
 z Dividend policy;
 z Regulatory and governance issues;
 z The development of the Group’s people;
 z The Group’s Risk Register; and
 z Insurance Policy and Cover.
In addition to the ten meetings described above, the Board has 
two off site strategy meetings each year at which the Group’s 
strategic direction, viability plan and significant projects are 
discussed.
Where meetings are required between Board meetings and a full 
complement of Directors cannot be achieved, a Committee of 
Directors considers the necessary formalities.

Information flow
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, ensures 
that the Directors receive clear information on all relevant matters 
in a timely manner. Board papers are circulated sufficiently in 
advance of meetings for them to be thoroughly digested to 
ensure clarity of informed debate. The Board papers contain the 
Chief Executive Officer’s and the Chief Financial Officer’s written 
reports, high level papers on each business area, key metrics 
and specific papers relating to agenda items. The Board papers 
are accompanied by a management information pack containing 
detailed financial and other supporting information. The Board 
receives updates throughout the year and occasional ad hoc 
papers on matters of particular relevance or importance.
Time commitment
The Board is satisfied that the Chairman and each of the Non-
Executive Directors committed sufficient time during the year to 
enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors of the Company. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors has any conflict of interest.
Induction and professional development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that induction and 
training are provided to each Director and for organising the 
induction process and regular updating and training of Board 
members.
Training and updating in relation to the business of the Group and 
the legal and regulatory responsibilities of Directors was provided 
throughout the year by a variety of means to Board members 
including presentations by executives, visits to business 
operations and circulation of briefing material. Individual Directors 
are also expected to take responsibility for identifying their 
training needs and to ensure they are adequately informed about 
the Group and their responsibilities as a Director. The Board is 
confident that all its members have the knowledge, ability and 
experience to perform the functions required of a Director of a 
listed company.

Our Governance 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
Access to independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who ensures that Board processes 
are followed and good corporate governance standards 
are maintained. Any Director who considers it necessary or 
appropriate may take independent, professional advice at the 
company’s expense. None of the Directors sought such advice in 
the year.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of each individual Director. As part of its 
evaluation, a questionnaire was approved by the Board. Directors 
are in the process of submitting their completed questionnaires 
to the Company Secretary who will review their responses. These 
will subsequently be discussed in an open session. The exercise, 
which is undertaken on a regular basis, is viewed positively by 
the Board. No major areas are expected to be highlighted within 
this review process but the Board intend to continue to develop 
themes arising from previous reviews, specifically on:
 z strategic messaging;
 z board information; and
 z succession.
The Chairman has carried out a review of the performance of 
individual members of the Board. In all cases the performance of 
the Directors was considered to have reached a high standard.
The Board and its Committees will monitor progress and continue 
their critical review of its effectiveness during the year ahead. In 
accordance with the prevailing recommendations of the Code, it 
is the current intention of the Board that an external facilitation of 
the Board evaluation will be carried out in 2018.
Re-election of Directors
Notwithstanding that the Company’s articles of association 
require the Directors to offer themselves for re-election at least 
once every three years, in accordance with the recommendations 
of the Code the Directors will be offering themselves for 
re-election at the AGM in November 2017. In light of the 
performance evaluations summarised above and the provisions 
of the Company’s articles of association, the Board recommends 
that all of the Directors be re-elected.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee and the Board seek to maintain an 
appropriate balance between the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee is chaired by Derek Carter as SID 
and comprises all the Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, and the Chief Executive Officer. It has full responsibility 
for reviewing the Board structure and for interviewing and 
nominating candidates to serve on the Board as well as reviewing 
senior executive development. Suitable candidates, once 
nominated, meet with the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer. The candidates are then put forward for consideration 
and appointment by the Board as a whole. The Committee has 
access to external professional advice at the Company’s expense 
as and when required.
The Nomination Committee reviews on a continuing basis the 
composition of both the Board and the Executive Committee, 
making recommendations where appropriate. Further details 
of Nomination Committee’s activities can be found in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 46.
The terms and conditions of the appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors is made available at the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is composed of all the Non-Executive 
Directors including the Chairman. The Audit Committee Chairman 
is Paul Dollman. 
The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are 
set out in written terms of reference and are available on the 
Company’s website www.wilmingtonplc.com/investors/corporate-
governance/roles-board. Details of the Audit Committee’s policies 
and activities can be found in the Audit Committee Report on 
pages 44 and 45.
Risk management and internal controls
In line with the Turnbull Report recommendations, the Board 
maintains an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant risks faced by the Group. The Board 
regularly reviews this process, which has been in operation from 
the start of the year to the date of approval of this report. Further 
details on the key features of the risk management and internal 
controls can be found in the risks and uncertainties facing the 
business on pages 25 to 33.

Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Nathalie Schwarz 
and consists of all the Non-Executives and the Chairman. It is 
responsible for recommending to the Board the framework and 
policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration. Given the small size 
of the Board, the Committee recognises the potential for conflicts 
of interest, and has taken appropriate measures to minimise the 
risk. The Committee meets not less than once a year, and takes 
advice from the Chief Executive Officer as appropriate. In carrying 
out its work, the Board itself determines the remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Committee has the power to seek 
external advice, and to appoint consultants as and when required 
in respect of the remuneration of Executive Directors. Further 
details of the Group’s policies on remuneration and service 
contracts can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 47 to 62.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding 
of objectives between the Company and its institutional 
shareholders by means of a programme of meetings with 
major shareholders, fund managers and analysts each year. 
The company also makes presentations to analysts and fund 
managers following publication of its half-year and full-year 
results. A copy of the presentation slide show is available on the 
Company’s website www.wilmingtonplc.com/investors/reports-
and-presentations. As referred to earlier, the ’SID’ is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which other contacts have 
failed to resolve.
The Chairman or one of the other Non-Executive Directors is 
available on request to attend meetings with major shareholders. 
In the past year, the Chairman attended such meetings. The 
Board regularly receives copies of analysts’ and brokers’ 
briefings.
The Group’s website includes a specific and comprehensive 
investor relations section containing all RNS announcements, 
share price information, annual documents available for download 
and similar materials.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
A separate notice convening the Annual General Meeting is being 
sent out with this Report and financial statements. Separate votes 
are held for each proposed resolution. At the Annual General 
Meeting, after the formal business has been concluded, the 
Chairman will welcome questions from shareholders. All Directors 
attend the meeting at which they have the opportunity to meet 
with shareholders. Details of resolutions to be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting on 2 November 2017 and an explanation 
of the items of special business can be found in the circular that 
contains the notice convening the Annual General Meeting.

ii) Revenue recognition: 
The Committee considered the inherent risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition as defined by auditing standards and was satisfied 
that there were no issues arising.
iii) Acquisition Accounting:
The committee reviewed the accounting regarding the 
acquisitions in the year and was satisfied there were no issues 
arising.
External audit
The Group’s external auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP . The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and 
ensuring this is safeguarded notwithstanding any provision of any 
other services to the Group.
The Board recognises the importance of safeguarding auditor 
objectivity and has taken the following steps to ensure that 
auditor independence is not compromised:
 z The Audit Committee carries out each year a full evaluation 
of the external auditor as to its complete independence from 
the Group and relevant officers of the Group in all material 
respects and that it is adequately resourced and technically 
capable to deliver an objective audit to shareholders. Based 
on this review the Audit Committee recommends to the Board 
each year the continuation, or removal and replacement, of 
the external auditor;
 z The external auditors provided audit related services such 
as regulatory and statutory reporting as well as formalities 
relating to shareholders and other circulars;
 z The external auditors may undertake due diligence reviews for 
prospective acquisitions given its knowledge of the Group’s 
businesses. Such provision will however be assessed on a 
case-by-case basis so that the best placed adviser is retained. 
The Audit Committee monitors the application of policy in this 
regard and keeps the policy under review;
 z The Audit Committee reviews on a regular basis all fees paid 
for audit, and all consultancy fees, with a view to assessing 
the reasonableness of fees, value of delivery, and any 
independence issues that may have arisen or may potentially 
arise in the future;
 z The external auditors’ report to the Directors and the Audit 
Committee confirming their independence in accordance 
with Auditing Standards. In addition to the steps taken by 
the Board to safeguard auditor objectivity, the Audit Practice 
Board Ethical Standard 3 requires audit partner rotation every 
five years for listed companies; and
 z Different teams are utilised on all other assignments 
undertaken by the auditors. Before any such assignments 
can commence, teams must obtain approval of the Audit 
Committee. This approval confirms that sufficient and 
appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure that auditor 
independence is retained.
The Audit Committee give careful consideration before appointing 
the auditors to provide other services. The Group regularly use 
other providers to ensure that independence and full value for 
money are achieved. Other services are generally limited to work 
that is closely related to the annual audit or where the work is of 
such a nature that a detailed understanding of the business is 
necessary.
Following the adoption by the UK Financial Reporting Council 
of certain parts of the EU Regulation and Directive on Audit 
Reform, that govern permissible non-audit services provided by 
the auditor, the Audit Committee took the decision to discontinue 
using PwC to provide taxation advisory and compliance services 
for any work commencing after 1 July 2016 (including the 
tax services for the year to 30 June 2016). Following careful 
consideration by the Audit Committee it was agreed that these 
services shall be provided by Deloitte LLP .
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have remained in place as auditors 
for nine years following a tender process in 2009. As part of its 
review the Committee notes that the Group Audit Partner was 
rotated in 2013 and the current audit partner’s five year term 
will end in 2018. The Committee will continue to monitor the 
appropriateness of the need to tender for audit services currently 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . During this year, 
£197,000 was paid by the Group to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
for other assurance services.

Nomination Committee Report 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
To reflect the requirements of the remuneration reporting 
regulations, this report is presented in two sections: the Annual 
Report on Remuneration and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the 
amounts earned in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 
and how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be operated 
for the year commencing 1 July 2017. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration is subject to an advisory vote at the next Annual 
General Meeting due to be held on 2 November 2017. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy sets out the forward-looking 
remuneration policy. The Company’s first Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy was approved at the 2014 AGM, with over 99% of votes in 
favour of it, and took effect following the close of that meeting. 
In accordance with the applicable legislation, the Company 
is required to seek shareholder approval for a new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM. During the course of the 
2016/17 financial year the Committee has reviewed the Policy 
approved in 2014 in the context of the Company’s strategy, 
developments in best practice and the forthcoming expiration of 
the Company’s Performance Share Plan.
The Committee strongly believes that the Policy as approved at 
the 2014 AGM continues effectively to support the Company’s 
strategy. Accordingly, a radical overhaul of the Policy is not 
proposed (including that there are no changes to the overall 
structure of the remuneration package or the quantum of variable 
pay), but minor changes are proposed as follows:
 z we have formally incorporated within the Policy our 
shareholding guidelines, in accordance with which Executive 
Directors must retain 50% of shares acquired on the vesting of 
PSP awards until a holding equal to 100% of base salary has 
been achieved; 
 z reflecting changes in corporate governance, we have formally 
incorporated within the Policy malus provisions on both the 
annual bonus and PSP awards; and
 z the Policy reflects the proposal to operate a new PSP for 
awards in respect of the 2018/2019 financial year and future 
financial years. 
Other minor amendments have been made to the Policy to aid its 
administration and to reflect changes in practice since the Policy 
was first approved in 2014.
Review of 2017
As described in the Strategic Report section of this Annual 
Report, Wilmington has performed well across all key financial 
and operational measures. The Group has made progress and 
consequently an annual bonus to Executive Directors of 61.7% 
of base salary is due for performance against targets set by 
the Committee for the 2017 financial year. Further information 
in relation to the assessment of the annual bonus performance 
measures is included on page 49. In addition, given the financial 
performance in the last three years; 84.13% of the 2014 PSP has 
vested based on performance to 30 June 2017.
Outlook for 2018
For the current financial year: 
 z An increase of 2.0% in annual salary is being awarded to the 
Executive Directors for the new financial year, in line with base 
salary increases for the wider employee population.
 z The annual bonus potential for Executive Directors remains 
unchanged at up to a maximum of 100% of base salary 
dependent on key financial performance indicators. There are 
clear financial targets based on the achievement of adjusted 
profit, return on equity and return on sales. The Committee 
is satisfied that these are challenging and, for the maximum 
bonus to be earned, will demonstrate significant further 
improvement in the profit performance of the business;
 z The Committee will continue to monitor the performance 
conditions for any future PSP awards to ensure that the 
conditions continue to be appropriate for the Company and 
the prevailing market and reflect the application of a ‘pay for 
performance’ philosophy in the best interests of the Company 
and shareholders. Accordingly, and following the intention 
of Anthony Foye to step down from his position as Chief 
Financial Officer, the Committee has decided not to award 
Anthony Foye any future share awards.
 z PSP awards for Pedro Ros in 2017/18 will be made on 
a similar basis to the 2016/17 awards except that he will 
receive the equivalent of 100% of his salary (2016/17: 
75%), consistent with discretion exercised previously by the 
Committee and following a review of the reward structure. 
This change is well within the limit set out in the Directors 
Remuneration Policy of PSP awards not exceeding 150% of 
salary.

Introduction (unaudited information)
The Committee has an established policy on the remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The key principles are as 
follows:
 z Remuneration is directly aligned with the performance of the Group and the interests of shareholders. It is designed to reward, 
motivate, incentivise and retain Executives of the highest calibre, without paying more than is necessary.
 z A significant proportion of Executives’ potential remuneration is structured to link rewards to annual and long-term Group 
performance targets, which are reviewed annually. Targets are calibrated appropriately to ensure that they cannot encourage 
excessive risk.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Report on Remuneration 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
For the year ended 30 June 2017:
 z EPS growth in excess of RPI was 10.1%, ROE (for PSP)
1
 was 32.3% and the Company’s TSR was positioned 61
st
 out of 149 
comparator companies for the three year performance period ending 30 June 2017 and 84.13% of maximum LTIP award will vest 
(these amounts represent the Group’s best estimates and are subject to final confirmation from the Committee’s adviser Aon Hewitt 
Limited due to be finalised shortly after the finalisation of these financial statements);
 z The value shown for PSP includes the value of dividends that would have accrued on vested shares during the performance period 
that will subsequently be paid to the participants; and
 z The PSP awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant (vesting date), the estimated value of the vested shares 
shown above is based on the three month average share price to 30 June 2017 (£2.54).
For the year ended 30 June 2016 comparative figures:
 z EPS growth in excess of RPI was 12.6%, ROE (for PSP) was 29.1% and the Company’s TSR was positioned 32
nd
 out of 128 
comparator companies for the three year performance period ending 30 June 2016 and 100.0% of maximum LTIP award vested;
 z The value shown for PSP includes the value of dividends that would have accrued on vested shares during the performance period 
that were subsequently paid to the participants; and
 z The PSP awards vested on 19 September 2016 (the third anniversary of the date of grant). The value of the vested shares shown 
above is based on the share price on 19 September 2016 of £2.56. In the 2016 directors’ remuneration report the value included 
was an estimated value based on the three month average share price to 30 June 2016 (£2.54).
Total salary and fees 
For the year ended 30 June 2017 (audited information)
Total salary and fees are based on the need to retain the skills and knowledge that the Executive and Non-Executive Directors bring 
to the Company. Executive Directors’ salaries increased by 2% in 2016/17 compared to 2015/16. This increase was in line with base 
salary increases for the wider employee population.
For the year ended 30 June 2018 (unaudited information)
It is intended that the Executive Director salaries will be increased by 2.0% for 2017/18. This increase is in line with base salary 
increases for the wider employee population. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are expected to increase by £2,500 per annum, 
except for Mark Asplin, the Non-Executive Chairman, whose fees are expected to increase by £12,500 per annum. These increases 
reflect the increased workloads and align with those with similar roles across the market.
Annual bonus 
For the year ended 30 June 2017 (audited information)
Annual bonus payments were based on the Company’s performance against targets based on linear ranges of adjusted profit 
(excluding share based payment expense), ROE (for Annual bonus) and ROS, set at the start of the year. In relation to the bonuses 
payable, these were based on the following level of achievement against each of the three metrics:
 z Up to 60% of salary for the adjusted profit measure;
 z Up to 20% of salary for the ROE (for Annual bonus) measure; 
 z Up to 20% of salary for the ROS measure;
 z Linear scales of bonus for each metric were set at the start of the financial year;
 z Adjusted profit is profit before adjusting items, impairment of goodwill, amortisation of intangible assets excluding computer 
software, provision for the Executives’ bonuses, share based payments and after deducting the interest of non-controlling 
shareholders in such profits;
 z The profit element of ROE (for Annual bonus) is based on Adjusted Profit before Tax after adjusting items as described above; and
 z The profit element of ROS is based on Adjusted EBITA excluding share based payment expense.
1. 
ROE (for PSP) – The three year average Adjusted EBITA less impairment divided by the average Equity attributable to the owners of the parent.

Our Governance 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
In assessing the 2017 annual bonus out-turn, the Committee has assessed ROE excluding the one-off gain of £6.33m relating to the 
property disposal (referred to in note 4). This is consistent with the decision taken in 2016 to exclude an impairment of CLT (£14.6m) 
and Ark (£1.0m) as a one-off adjustment in respect of legacy businesses acquired more than 21 and 12 years ago respectively.
The Committee believes that the above approach ensures that the bonus out-turn reflects the executive directors’ contribution to the 
underlying performance of the business. 
The following provides the adjusted profit, ROE (for Annual Bonus) (assessed as referred to above) and ROS target reference points 
together with the bonus pay-outs to the Executive Directors for 2016/17:
Minimum 
target set
Maximum 
target set

ROE (for Annual bonus) 25.0% 27.0% 34.1% 20.0%
ROS 17.5% 19.5% 19.9% 20.0%
Total 61.7%
For the year ended 30 June 2018 (unaudited remuneration)
The Committee has agreed that the metrics used to determine the annual bonus for 2017/18 remain unchanged and the maximum 
bonus opportunity will remain at 100% of base salary. The bonus will be subject to stretching targets. The Committee believes that the 
targets for the financial measures for the forthcoming financial year are commercially sensitive and that to disclose them may damage 
the Company’s competitive position. Targets will be published retrospectively in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report or at such 
point that the Remuneration Committee considers that the performance targets are no longer commercially sensitive.
PSP 
Awards vesting in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 (audited information)

Awards granted during the year
In respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 the following PSP awards were granted on 15 September 2016: 
Name Type of award Number of shares
Face value at 
grant £
% of award vesting 
at minimum 
threshold
Pedro Ros PSP 110,355 270,425 25.0%
Anthony Foye PSP 50,028 122,594 25.0%
The face value is based on a price of 245.05 pence being the average share price from the five business days immediately preceding 
the award being granted on 15 September 2016. The performance conditions for these awards are the same as the performance 
conditions detailed in the table above. The number of shares awarded represents 75% of Pedro Ros’ salary and 50% of Anthony 
Foye’s salary.
The Committee determined that, all participants (including Executives) will be required to hold no less than 50% of any vested shares 
(net of taxes) for a minimum of two years.
For the year ended 30 June 2018 (unaudited remuneration)
The Committee will continue to monitor the performance conditions for any future PSP awards to ensure that the conditions continue 
to be appropriate for the Company and the prevailing market and reflect the application of a ‘pay for performance’ philosophy in the 
best interests of the Company and shareholders. Accordingly, and following the intention of Anthony Foye to step down from his 
position as Chief Financial Officer, the Committee has decided not to award Anthony Foye any future share awards. 
PSP awards for Pedro Ros in 2017/18 will be made on a similar basis to the 2016/17 awards except that he will receive the equivalent 
of 100% of his salary (2016/17: 75%), consistent with discretion exercised previously by the Committee and following a review of the 
reward structure. This change is well within the limit set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy of PSP awards not exceeding 150% 
of salary.
Shareholding guidelines and statement of Directors’ share awards (audited information)
Shareholding guidelines for Executives have been adopted, linked to the outturn from the PSP . At the time Awards vest under the PSP 
(or any other Executive plan established in the future), Executives will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of vested shares (net of 
taxes) until such time as a total personal shareholding equivalent to 100% of pre-tax base salary has been achieved. This requirement 
will not apply to participants to the scheme other than the Executives.
It should be noted that at 30 June 2017 Anthony Foye held shares worth significantly more than the shareholding guideline level. As 
at 30 June 2017 Pedro Ros held approximately the equivalent of 26.0% of his pre-tax base salary in shares, which has been acquired 
since his appointment in July 2014. In addition to his own acquisition of shares, 50% of any vested PSP shares (net of tax) will be 
retained in line with the policy above.
The holdings of the Directors and their families as at 30 June 2017 are as follows:

As at 30 June 2017 the Company’s share price was 235.00p and its highest and lowest share prices during the year ended 30 June 
2017 were 287.75p and 230.25p respectively. Interests are shown as a percentage of shares in issue at 30 June 2017.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Report on Remuneration 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
The Committee strongly believes that the company’s previous policy approved at the 2014 AGM continues effectively to support 
the Company’s strategy. Accordingly, a radical overhaul of the policy is not proposed (including that there are no changes to the 
overall structure of the remuneration package or the quantum of variable pay), but minor changes are proposed as described in the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement on page 47.
The table below sets out the Company’s Directors’ remuneration policy which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting, shall take binding effect from the close of that meeting.

individual’s role, experience and performance. 
Operation The Committee ordinarily reviews base salaries annually taking into account:
 z Performance of the Group and pay conditions elsewhere in the workforce;
 z Performance of the individual;
 z Changes in position or responsibility; and
 z Market competitiveness.
The Committee periodically takes external advice to benchmark salaries by reference 
to Executives with similar positions in comparator organisations. In considering relevant 
benchmarking the Committee is also aware of the risk of an upward pay ratchet through 
placing undue emphasis on comparator pay surveys. Base salary is the only pensionable 
element of remuneration.
Opportunity While there is no maximum salary, increases will normally be in line with the typical level of 
salary increase awarded (in percentage of salary terms) to other employees in the Group. 
Salary increases above this level may be awarded in certain circumstances, such as:
 z where an Executive Director has been promoted or has had a change in scope or 
responsibility;
 z a new Executive Director being moved to market positioning over time; 
 z where there has been a significant change in market practice;
 z where there has been a significant change in the size and/or complexity of the business.
Such increases may be implemented over such time period as the Committee deems 
appropriate.
Performance metric Although base salary is not subject to any formal performance condition, the individual’s 
performance in role and overall Group performance is taken into account in determining any 
salary increase.
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Rewards sustained contribution and commitment to the Group.
Provides market competitive post-employment benefits.
Operation Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme. 
The Committee has the discretion to pay cash supplements in lieu some or all pension 
contributions in appropriate circumstances.
Executive Directors are entitled to elect to sacrifice part of their salary and bonus into a 
personal pension scheme.
Opportunity The Company contributes an amount equal to 10% of salary to a pension scheme on behalf 
of the Executive Directors, and/or as a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions 
where appropriate. 
Performance metric Not applicable.

Taxable benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Fixed element of remuneration set at a market competitive level with the aim to recruit, 
motivate and retain Directors of the calibre required.
Operation Executive Directors receive benefits in line with market practice and principally include a 
fully expensed car or car allowance and private medical cover (for the Executive Directors 
and his or her family), and health assessment and permanent health insurance.
Other benefits may be provided based on individual circumstances and response to market 
pressures.
Opportunity Whilst the Committee has not set an absolute maximum on the level of benefits Executive 
Directors may receive, the value of the benefit is set at a level which the Committee 
considers to be appropriately positioned taking into account relevant market levels based 
on the nature and location of the role and individual circumstances.
Performance metric Not applicable.
Annual Bonus
Purpose and link to strategy Rewards the achievement of financial and strategic targets aligned with the Group strategy.
Operation Targets are reviewed annually and any pay-out is determined by the Committee after the 
year-end based on targets set for the financial period.
The Committee has discretion to amend the bonus outturn if any formulaic output does not 
reflect its assessment of overall business performance. 
Any bonus opportunity may be reduced or cancelled before payment (i.e. a malus provision) 
in the event of a material misstatement of results, serious reputational damage to the Group 
or gross misconduct on the part of the Executive Director. 
The bonus plan rules contain provisions such that appropriate means of redress may be 
sought (i.e. claw back) if it transpires that a bonus was paid for performance in a year which 
later proves to have been materially misstated.
There is no scope to make discretionary bonus payments outside of the scope of the bonus 
plan.
Opportunity The maximum bonus is 100% of base salary.
Performance metric Stretching targets are set each year reflecting the business priorities which underpin Group 
strategy and align to key performance indicators.
The annual bonus is determined based on performance against a mix of targets. The 
majority will be determined by financial measures which may include one or more of 
adjusted profit, return on equity (‘ROE’) and Return on Sale (‘ROS’) targets.
Vesting of financial metrics will apply on a sliding scale up to 100% of maximum potential 
for this element of the bonus based on the satisfaction of performance conditions.
Vesting of non-financial or individual metrics (where applicable) will apply on a scale 
between 0% and 100% based on the Committee’s assessment of the extent to which non-
financial or individual performance metrics has been met.

Performance share plan (‘PSP’)
Purpose and link to strategy Incentivises Executive Directors to achieve returns for shareholders over a longer 
timeframe.
Operation Awards in respect of the 2017/18 financial year will be made under the PSP approved in 
2007. Awards in respect of future financial years are proposed to be made under the PSP 
for which approval will be sought at the 2017 AGM. 
Executive Directors may receive awards in the form of conditional awards of shares, options 
to acquire shares for nil or nominal cost or as cash settled equivalents. Share awards may 
be settled in cash at the election of the Committee.
Vesting is dependent on the achievement of performance conditions normally over a period 
of three financial years.
The Committee will determine performance conditions prior to each award, with no 
provision to re-test.
At any time prior to its vesting, an award may be reduced or cancelled in the event of a 
material misstatement of results, serious reputational damage to the Company or gross 
misconduct on the part of the Executive Director. The Committee may operate claw back if, 
at any time before the later of (i) the second anniversary of the vesting of an award and (ii) 
the publication of the Company’s second set of audited financial accounts following such 
vesting, there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s financial accounts, an 
error occurred when assessing the number of shares over which a PSP award vests, or 
the participant has been guilty of gross misconduct. In these circumstances, there may be 
a proportionate reduction of future bonuses and/or share awards made under the PSP to 
reflect the overpayment of shares, or the participant may be required to repay the overpaid 
amounts from personal funds.
An additional payment (in the form of cash or shares) may be made in respect of shares 
which vest under the PSP to reflect the value of dividends which would have been paid 
on those shares up to the date of vesting. The Committee shall determine the basis on 
which the value of such dividends shall be calculated, and may assume the reinvestment of 
dividends in the Company’s shares on a cumulative basis.
Opportunity The maximum award limit under the PSP scheme will be 150% of base salary.
Performance metric The awards under the PSP will be based on a mix of key longer term metrics for the Group. 
These will be metrics which the Committee considers to be the most appropriate measures 
of longer term performance and could include TSR, EPS and ROE.
The threshold pay-out level under the PSP is 25% of the maximum award.
There will usually be straight line vesting between threshold and maximum performance.

Operation of the PSP
The Committee may amend the terms of awards under the PSP 
in accordance with the PSP rules in the event of a variation of 
the Company’s share capital, demerger, special dividend or other 
relevant event. The Committee may operate the PSP (including 
that it may amend the rules of the PSP and awards granted under 
the PSP) in accordance with the PSP’s rules as approved by 
shareholders.
Explanation of performance metrics 
chosen
Performance measures for the annual bonus and PSP are 
reviewed annually to ensure they continue to reflect the business 
strategy and remain sufficiently stretching.
The Committee considers that adjusted profit, Return on Equity 
(‘ROE’) and Return on Sale (‘ROS’) targets are closely aligned to 
the Group’s key performance metrics and in application to the 
annual bonus alone provide a balanced measure of performance 
that encourages sustainable growth. The application of TSR, EPS 
and ROE targets to the PSP align management’s objectives with 
those of shareholders for the following reasons:
 z The EPS target will reward significant and sustained increase 
in earnings that would be expected to flow through into 
shareholder value. For the participants, this will also deliver 
a strong ‘line of sight’ as it will be straightforward to evaluate 
and communicate;
 z The ROE performance condition will reward Executives 
for delivery of returns to shareholders but adding a further 
discipline of ensuring the most efficient use of shareholders’ 
funds; and
 z The TSR performance condition will provide a balance to 
the financial performance conditions by rewarding relative 
share price performance against the companies comprising 
the FTSE Small Cap Index and ensures that a share price-
based discipline in the package (in the absence of options) is 
retained. This will ensure that management can be rewarded 
for delivering superior market returns.
The Committee considers that this blend of measures provides 
a link to the Company’s strategy, which is to create a sustained 
improvement in underlying performance and maximise returns to 
shareholders.
When setting the performance targets, the Committee will take 
into account a number of different reference points, which may 
include the Company’s business plans and strategy and market 
environment. Full vesting will only occur for what the Committee 
considers to be stretching performance.
The Committee may vary any performance measure if an event 
occurs which causes it to determine that it would be appropriate 
to vary the measure, provided that any such variation is fair and 
reasonable and (in the opinion of the Committee) the altered 
performance measure would be not materially less difficult to 
satisfy than the unaltered performance measure would have been 
but for the event in question. If the Committee were to make such 
a variation, a full explanation would be given in the next Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Shareholding guidelines
To further align the interests of Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders, we have adopted formal shareholding guidelines, 
in accordance with which Executive Directors must retain 50% 
of the after tax shares they acquire on the vesting of PSP awards 
until such time as a total personal shareholding equal to 100% of 
base salary has been achieved. 
Illustration of the application of the 
remuneration policy
The following charts set out for each of the Executive Directors 
an illustration of the application for 2017/18 of the remuneration 
policy set out above. The charts show the split of remuneration 
between fixed pay and variable pay in the Policy for:
1.  minimum remuneration receivable — salary, fees, taxable 
benefits and pension;
2.  the remuneration receivable if the Director was, in respect of 
any performance measures or targets, performing in line with 
the Company’s expectation; and
3.  maximum remuneration receivable (not allowing for any share 
price appreciation).

Differences in policy from the wider employee population
The Company values its wider workforce and aims to provide a remuneration package that is market competitive, complies with any 
statutory requirements and is applied fairly and equitably across the wider employee population. Where remuneration is not determined 
by statutory regulation, the Company operates the same core principles as it does for Executive Directors namely:
 z We remunerate people in a manner that allows for stability of the business and the opportunity for sustainable long term growth; 
and
 z We seek to remunerate fairly and consistently for each role with due regard to the market place, internal consistency and the 
Company’s ability to pay.

Recruitment remuneration policy
The objective of this policy is to allow the Committee to offer remuneration packages which facilitate the recruitment of individuals of 
sufficient calibre to lead the business and effectively execute the strategy for shareholders. When appointing a new Executive Director, 
the Committee seeks to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and not to pay more than is appropriate.
The Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including the calibre of the individual, the candidate’s existing 
remuneration package, and the specific circumstances of the individual including the jurisdiction from which the candidate was 
recruited.
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically align the remuneration package with the above Policy. The 
Committee may include other elements of pay which it considers are appropriate, however, this discretion is capped and is subject to 
the principles and the limits referred to below.
 z Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Director being appointed. This may include 
agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and/or responsibilities, subject to good 
performance, where it is considered appropriate.
 z Retirement benefits and other benefits will only be provided in line with the above Policy; and
 z The Committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments (for example a ‘guaranteed sign-on bonus’).
 z Other elements may be included in the following circumstances:
 — an interim appointment being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short-term basis;
 — if exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-executive Director takes on an executive function on a short-
term basis;
 — if an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive 
award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance. Subject to the limit on variable remuneration set 
out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that 
reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis; and
 — if the Director will be required to relocate in order to take up the position, it is the Company’s policy to allow reasonable 
relocation, travel and subsistence payments. Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Committee.
 z The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the annual bonus or PSP , 
subject to the rules of the PSP , if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration. The 
rationale will be clearly explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
 z The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted (excluding ‘buyout’ awards as referred to below) is 250% of 
salary.
The Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to the forfeited arrangements and the time over which they would have vested. The Committee will generally seek to structure 
buy out awards or payments on a comparable basis to the remuneration arrangements forfeited. Any such payments or awards are 
excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above. Where considered appropriate, such special recruitment 
awards will be liable to forfeiture or ‘claw back’ on early departure.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Company’s existing share plans. If necessary 
and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as permitted under the Listing 
Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director. Where a 
position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue in 
accordance with their terms.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be in line with the policy in place at the time of 
appointment.

Payments for loss of office
The Company has adopted the following policy on Executives’ service contracts:
Notice period 12 months’ notice period or less shall apply.
Termination payments 
and mitigation
Termination payments are limited to payment of 12 months’ salary, contractual pension amounts and 
benefits. 
The policy is that, as is considered appropriate at the time, the departing Director may work, or be 
placed on garden leave, for all or part of his notice period, or receive a payment in lieu of notice in 
accordance with the service agreement. 
The Committee will consider mitigation to reduce the termination payment to a leaving Director when 
appropriate to do so, having regard to the circumstances.
Annual bonus The decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of 
factors including the circumstances of their departure and their contribution to the business during 
the bonus period in question. Any bonus payment would typically be pro-rated for time in service to 
termination and paid at the usual time (although the Committee retains discretion to pay the bonus 
earlier in appropriate circumstances).  
PSP Unvested awards held by the Director under the company’s PSP will lapse or vest in accordance 
with the rules of the plan, which have been approved by shareholders. In summary, the plan rules 
provide that awards can vest if employment ends by reason of redundancy, retirement, ill health or 
disability, death, sale of the Director’s employer out of the Group or any other reason determined by 
the Committee. The Committee shall determine whether the award will vest at cessation or the normal 
vesting date. In either case, the extent of vesting will be determined by the Committee taking into 
account the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, applying a pro-rate reduction based on the period from the date of grant to the date of 
cessation relative to a three year period. 
Change of control Awards under the PSP will generally vest early on a takeover or other relevant corporate event. The 
Committee will determine the level of vesting taking into account the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, a pro-rate reduction based 
on the period from the date of grant to the date of the relevant event relative to a three year period. 
Other payments In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement 
and legal fees. 
Where a ‘buyout’ or other award is made outside the Company’s PSP in connection with the 
recruitment of an Executive Director, as permitted under the Listing Rules, the leaver provisions would 
be determined at the time of the award.  
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an 
existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim 
arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment.

Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the notice periods referred to below, with compensation limited to fees for 
the duration of the notice period.
Legacy matters
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payment or payment for loss of office (including exercising discretions in 
respect of any such payment) notwithstanding that it is not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were 
agreed:
 z before the Policy came into effect (provided that in the case of any payments agreed on or after 6 November 2014 they are in line 
with the Policy approved at the Company’s 2014 AGM); or
 z at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee the payment was not 
in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes, “payment” includes the satisfaction of any award of variable remuneration and in relation to an award over shares 
the terms of the payment are “agreed” when the award is granted.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration. When considering base salary increases, the Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered 
to other employees. Employees are not actively consulted on Directors’ remuneration.
Non-executive appointments at other companies
The Committee’s policy is that Executive Directors may, by agreement with the Board, serve as Non-executives of other companies 
and retain any fees payable for their services.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on Executive and Non-
executive Directors’ remuneration.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent 
company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:
 z select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 z state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the group financial statements and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the company financial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 z make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 z prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the parent company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and parent company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 34 and 35 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 z the parent company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;
 z the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
 z the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
parent company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved:
 z so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group and parent company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
 z they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and parent company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Report on the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Wilmington plc’s group financial statements and 
parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 z give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of 
the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the 
group’s profit and the group’s and the parent company’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;
 z have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 z have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”), 
which comprise: the group and parent company Balance Sheets 
as at 30 June 2017; the Consolidated Income Statement and 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income; the group 
and parent company Cash Flow Statements, and the group and 
parent company Statements of Changes in Equity for the year 
then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which 
include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit 
Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-
audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements, 
we have provided no non-audit services to the group or the 
parent company in the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.
Our audit approach – Overview
Materiality
 z £1.1 million (2016: £1.0 million) - Group financial statements.
 z Based on 5% of Group adjusted profit before tax.
 z £900,000 (2016: £900,000) - Parent company financial 
statements.
 z Based on circa 1% of total assets.
Scope
 z Each business segment comprises a number of legal entities 
or components. PwC UK performed audits of complete 
information for each of the Group’s significant components, 
with specified and analytical procedures being performed 
over remaining material and immaterial financial statement line 
items, respectively.
 z The full scope reporting units and group functions we 
conducted our work at accounted for 87% of the Group 
Adjusted Profit before Tax, and 80% of Group revenue.
Key audit matters
 z Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment 
(Group).
 z Revenue recognition (Group).
 z Acquisition Accounting for Health Services Journal (‘HSJ’) 
(Group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of 
our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of 
internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make 
on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit.

to the members of Wilmington plc 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment assessment (Group)
Refer to pages 44 and 45 (Audit Committee Report), page 76 
(Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions) 
and pages 94 to 96 (notes 12 and 13).
The goodwill and intangible assets (excluding computer 
software) balance of £115 million, allocated across multiple 
cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), are subject to an annual 
impairment review. 
Directors used a ‘Value in Use’ model to compute the present 
value of forecast future cash flows for each CGU which was 
then compared to the carrying value of the net assets of each 
CGU (including Goodwill and Intangible assets) to determine if 
there was an impairment. These assessments involve significant 
judgement about the future results of the business as well as 
determining the discount and long term growth rates applied to 
future cash flow forecasts. 
Market conditions have remained challenging in the ‘Law for 
lawyers’ sub-division (‘Ark’ and ‘CLT’ CGUs) resulting from 
reduced advertising revenue and demand for face to face 
training, strong price competition and changes to the legal 
profession’s Continual Professional Development (CPD) rules. 
As announced in the 31 December 2016 Interim statement and 
updates disclosed in this Annual Report, Management are in the 
processes of exiting from substantial parts of the “Ark” business 
within this segment. 
Management’s impairment assessment showed a £2.3 million 
impairment of Goodwill in the ‘Ark’ CGU which has been 
recognised in the financial statements. 
Following a material impairment recorded in the 2016 
Annual report in respect of the ‘CLT’ CGU, Management 
also determined that headroom in this business was sensitive 
to movements in the key assumptions. Further, as recorded in 
the 2015 and 2016 Annual report, the Compliance Week CGU 
continues to remain sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
In light of the above we focused on the ‘Ark’, ‘CLT’ and the 
Compliance Week CGUs and the judgements applied by 
Management.
We also focused on the related disclosures and checked that 
appropriate sensitivity analysis, arising from reasonably possible 
changes to the model’s key assumptions, was provided in the 
financial statements to draw attention to the significant areas of 
judgement.
We evaluated the Directors’ future cash flow projections for 
all relevant CGUs and the process by which they were drawn 
up, including comparing them to the latest Board approved 
budgets and forecasts, and tested the underlying calculations 
in the model. We found no material misstatements in the model 
calculations and found the cash-flow projections to be consistent 
with the approved budgets. 
For the Directors’ key assumptions: 
 z we compared the growth rates in the forecasts to historical 
results and economic forecasts; and 
 z we assessed the discount rate by comparing the cost of 
capital for the Group with comparable organisations as well as 
using our own experts.
We found the Directors’ assumptions to be in line with our 
expectations.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers of 
the cash flow projections including assumed profits, short and 
longer term growth rates and discount rates. In performing these 
sensitivities we considered the level of historical budgeting 
inaccuracies and how the assumptions compared to the actual 
values achieved in prior years.
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions 
that would be required for the goodwill or intangible assets to 
be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a movement 
in those key assumptions arising. We determined that the 
sensitivities highlighted by Management in note 12 regarding the 
related assumptions in relation to the CLT and Compliance Week 
CGUs appropriately draw attention to the significant areas of 
judgement.
As the carrying value of the ‘Ark’ CGU’s intangible assets was 
fully impaired down there are no further sensitivities to be 
disclosed.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (Group)
Refer to pages 44 and 45 (Audit Committee Report), pages 76 to 
83 (note 1 Statement of accounting policies) and page 86  
(note 3).
We focused on this area because the timing of revenue 
recognition and its presentation in the Income Statement has 
inherent complexities for Wilmington, some of which are industry 
related, in particular:
 z Significant or one-off contracts entered into near the year end 
which could contain multiple elements (such as the sale of 
publications accompanied by training) or for which revenue 
should be spread over the term of the contract rather than 
recognised immediately; and
 z Subscription revenues are partly managed in electronic 
worksheets and/or other legacy customer management 
systems, meaning that there is a higher risk of error or 
manipulation of the calculation of deferred revenue.
For revenue transactions close to the year end we tested that the 
revenue was recognised in the appropriate period. We selected a 
sample of transactions, including larger transactions near the year 
end, and agreed the details of these transactions to underlying 
contractual information or other supporting documents which 
demonstrated when obligations had been fulfilled by the parties 
to the transaction. No material exceptions were noted from our 
testing. 
We also tested a sample of deferred revenue worksheets and 
revenue transactions to check that the amount of deferred 
revenue was accurately calculated and appropriately recognised. 
This involved agreeing revenue to contractual information as well 
as supporting calculations. No material exceptions were noted 
from our testing. 
Further, as part of our other evidence obtained over the revenue 
recognised during the year, we also tested journal entries posted 
to revenue accounts to identify unusual or irregular items. In order 
to identify unexpected transaction flows we also used computer 
assisted auditing techniques on the accounting records held 
within the Group’s principal accounting system. Our work did not 
identify any items that could not be substantiated.
Acquisition Accounting for Health 
Services Journal (‘HSJ’) (Group) 
Refer to pages 44 and 45 (Audit Committee Report) and page 
93 (note 11.b). During the year the Group acquired the trade 
and certain of assets and liabilities of HSJ for a consideration of 
£16.9 million. 
Accounting for the HSJ acquisition required Management 
to separately identify and fair value the acquired assets and 
liabilities, including intangible assets and goodwill. Management 
identified £7.7 million of intangible assets in respect of HSJ’s 
customer relationships and brand.
The valuation of intangibles can be a particularly subjective and 
judgemental process as it requires Management assumptions 
including acquisition specific risk adjusted discount rates, 
customer attrition and growth rates as well as notional royalty 
rates used to value brands.
We also focused on the related disclosures made by 
Management for consistency with applicable accounting 
standards.
We assessed the completeness and value of intangible assets 
identified by Management against our own expectations, formed 
from review of the reports prepared by Management during 
the acquisition, and disclosures surrounding the rationale for 
the transaction. Further, we assessed the analysis prepared by 
Management from these reports utilising our in-house expertise 
in order to evaluate the purchase price allocation. In doing so, we 
performed the following:
 z we compared assumptions made on renewal rates with 
historical patterns in the business to verify that assumptions 
were reasonable and we also tested these historical patterns;
 z we compared the ratio of goodwill to other separately 
identified intangibles arising in the acquisition against 
information publicly available from transactions in related 
markets;
 z we challenged Management on the completeness of 
separately identified intangibles and whether these existed in 
other areas of the business not included in the determined fair 
value; and
 z we sensitised the key inputs and assumptions used by 
Management to ascertain the extent of change that would be 
required for the fair value to be materially misstated. 
We discussed the results of this analysis with Management and 
the Audit Committee and ensured appropriate disclosure was 
included within the annual report which describes the nature of 
the arising goodwill.
Based on the work performed in this area, we have determined 
that the relevant material intangible assets and goodwill had been 
identified and valued appropriately.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of Wilmington plc 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
group and the parent company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured into three business segments being Risk 
& Compliance, Professional and Healthcare. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of reporting units that make up 
the three business segments, spread across four geographic 
regions, being the United Kingdom, Europe (excluding the UK), 
North America and the Rest of the World, and the centralised 
functions. In establishing the overall approach to the Group 
audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be 
performed at the reporting units by us as the Group engagement 
team. Each business segment comprises a number of legal 
entities or components. PwC UK performed audits of complete 
information for each of the Group’s significant components, 
with specified and analytical procedures being performed over 
remaining material and immaterial financial statement line items, 
respectively. The full scope reporting units and group functions 
we conducted our work at accounted for 87% of the Group 
Adjusted Profit before Tax, and 80% of Group revenue.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall materiality £1.1 million (2016: £1.0 million). £0.9 million (2016: £0.9 million).
How we determined it 5% of Group adjusted profit before tax. Circa 1% of total gross assets reduced to a 
level that is below to our group materiality.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
In arriving at this judgement we have had regard 
to the adjusted profit before tax, because, in 
our view, this represents the most appropriate 
measure of underlying performance. 
As the parent company does not have 
trading activities in our view a balance sheet 
benchmark represents the most appropriate 
measure.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £0.1 million and £0.9 million. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £50,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £50,000) and £45,000 (Parent company audit) (2016: £45,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
group’s and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements other than the financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance 
thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these 
responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
parent company and their environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the 
prospects of the group and of the 
principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 z The directors’ confirmation on pages 25 to 33 of the Annual 
Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity.
 z The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
 z The directors’ explanation on page 32 of the Annual Report as 
to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement 
in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are 
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding 
of the group and parent company and their environment obtained 
in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report 
when: 
 z The statement given by the directors, on page 63, that they 
consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the members to assess the group’s and parent 
company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of 
the group and parent company obtained in the course of 
performing our audit.
 z The section of the Annual Report on pages 44 to 45 describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
 z The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 63, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.
org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in 
writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 z we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 z adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 z certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 z the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were 
appointed by the members on 30 June 2009 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2009 and subsequent 
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 
9 years, covering the years ended 30 June 2009 to 30 June 2017.

Notes to the  
Financial Statements
General information
The Company is a public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is 6–14 
Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ.
The Company is listed on the main market on the London Stock Exchange. The company is the provider of information, education and 
networking to the professional markets.
1. Statement of accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied in preparing the financial statements are outlined below. These policies have been 
consistently applied for all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a) Basis of preparation
The Consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), including International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations 
Committee (IFRS IC) applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and as adopted in the EU, and in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006 as applicable to Companies using IFRS.
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, except for certain financial instruments 
that have been measured at fair value. The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, the functional currency 
of Wilmington plc, the Parent Company. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000s) except where otherwise 
indicated.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank facilities. The current economic conditions continue 
to create uncertainty, particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s products. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its current facilities. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its consolidated financial statements. Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given in note 19.
Pursuant to Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company’s own income statement and statement of other comprehensive 
income are not presented separately in the Company financial statements, but they have been approved by the Board.
b) Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 
reported for income and expenses during the year and that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the reporting date.
Business combinations
Management make judgments, estimates and assumptions in assessing the fair value of the net assets acquired on a business 
combination, in identifying and measuring intangible assets arising on a business combination, and in determining the fair value of 
the consideration. If the consideration includes an element of contingent consideration, the final amount of which is dependent on 
the future performance of the business, management assess the fair value of that contingent consideration based on their reasonable 
expectations of future performance. The sensitivity of the carrying amounts to the judgments, estimates and assumptions will vary 
depending on the nature and size of the acquisition.
Goodwill
Management make judgments, estimates and assumptions in measuring the carrying amount of goodwill. In considering whether 
goodwill has been impaired, the recoverable amount of cash generating units has been determined based on value in use calculations. 
These calculations require management to estimate future cash flows, a long-term growth rate and an appropriate discount rate. The 
sensitivity of the carrying amount of goodwill to these variables is considered in note 12.
c) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements incorporate the results and net assets of Wilmington plc and all its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 30 June each year. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an 
entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All inter-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation; however for the purposes of segmental reporting, internal arm’s length 
recharges are included within the appropriate segments.  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

1. Statement of accounting policies continued
d) Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is applied in accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The acquiree’s identifiable assets 
and liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and 
measured at cost, representing the excess of the aggregate of the consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the fair values of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. The consideration is measured at fair value, which is the aggregate of the 
fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred within adjusted items – investing activities.
Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of a business acquired contingent on future events, 
the Group accrues the fair value of the additional consideration payable as a liability at acquisition date. This amount is reassessed at 
each subsequent reporting date with any adjustments recognised in the Income Statement.
e) Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is assessed and its carrying amount is reduced to that amount if lower, and any impairment losses are recognised 
in the Income Statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and of the fair value less costs to sell, where the 
value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases due to a change in the estimates used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of 
amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. The reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised in the Income Statement.
Goodwill is not amortised, but it is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) 
for the purpose of impairment testing, so that the value in use is determined by reference to the discounted cash flows of the CGU. 
The cash flows considered are the expected pre-tax cash flows of the CGU, for projections over a three year period extrapolated using 
estimated long-term growth rates. The recoverable amount of the CGU, as for any asset, is the higher of the value in use and the fair 
value less costs to sell. If a CGU is impaired, the impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and then on a pro-rata basis 
against intangible and other assets. An impairment of goodwill cannot be reversed.
f) Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, 
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and the translation of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are recognised in the Income Statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into Sterling at year end exchange rates. The results of 
foreign undertakings are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange for the year (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effects of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the dates of the transactions). Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate 
component of equity, the translation reserve.
In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation 
difference in the translation reserve that is associated with the undertaking is charged or credited to the gain or loss on disposal 
recognised in the Income Statement.
Further information is provided in the financial instruments accounting policy in relation to loans and borrowings in foreign currencies 
that are designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

Financial Statements
1. Statement of accounting policies continued
g) Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services, net of discounts and 
sales taxes. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the 
Group and the amount of revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably. Subscription revenue is allocated to the relevant 
accounting periods covered by the subscription on a straight line basis or weighted in accordance with the timing of the service 
provided. Event revenue is recognised in the month that the event takes place, training revenue is recognised over the period in 
which the training is delivered, hard copy advertising revenue is recognised on publication, and online Directory advertising revenue is 
recognised over the period that the advertisement remains online. Subscriptions and fees in advance are carried forward in trade and 
other payables as ‘subscriptions and deferred revenue’ and are recognised over the period the service is provided. 
Sales of goods are recognised when the Group has despatched the goods to the customer, the customer has accepted the goods, 
and collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured.
h) Operating expenses
In accordance with IAS 1 paragraph 103, expenses are presented in the accounts based on their nature. Operating expenses comprise 
of cost of sales and administrative costs. Distribution costs are not separately identified due to the digital nature of our products 
as they are considered immaterial. Cost of sales are all direct costs, including third-party costs and staff costs, associated directly 
with the production of a product, event or service and are charged to the income statement as incurred. At each reporting date a 
prepayment is recognised for any third-party costs which are paid for in advance of the relevant event being run except in relation to 
marketing costs. Administrative costs are additional operational costs that are not directly associated with the production of a product, 
event or service. This includes expenses relating to central administrative and management functions and are expensed to the income 
statement as incurred.
i) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Company’s Board of Directors (‘The 
Board’) which is considered as the Group’s chief operating decision maker and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments. The Board considers the business from both a geographic and product perspective. 
Geographically, management considers the performance of the Group between the UK, Europe (excluding the UK), North America 
and the Rest of the World. Following a strategic review in the year, the Group now reports its results in three segments as this more 
accurately reflects the way the Group is now managed.
j) Adjusting items
The Group’s Income Statement separately identifies adjusting items. Such items are those that in the Directors’ judgment are one-off in 
nature and need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size and incidence. In determining whether an item or transaction should 
be classified as an adjusting item, the Directors consider quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency, predictability 
of occurrence, and significance. 
This focus on quantitative and qualitative factors may result in the classification of an item as adjusting, where one of apparently 
similar nature is not. The Group distinguishes between restructuring costs that are recurring and those that relate to one-off or 
transformational group programmes that impact many operations. Recurring restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course 
of business are recorded as part of the Group’s underlying trading results within profit before tax. Restructuring costs that are one-off 
and individually material or relate to programmes linked to the Group’s wider transformation and require approval at executive level are 
disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement. When these adjusting items relate to a transformational programme to the 
business, the cost may apply to multiple years. 
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board. Adjusting items 
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Disclosing adjusted items separately provides additional 
understanding of the performance of the Group.
k) Current and deferred income tax
Current and deferred income tax is recognised as income or an expense and included in the income statement for the period, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, respectively.
The tax effect of adjusting items is calculated by applying the relevant prevailing rate of taxation to the adjusting expense or income to 
the extent it is taxable or tax deductible.  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

www.wilmingtonplc.com Stock Code: WIL
Financial Statements
1. Statement of accounting policies continued
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluate positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and law) that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax 
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
l) Dividends
Dividend distributions are recognised in the consolidated financial statements when the shareholders right to receive payment is 
established. Final dividend distributions are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders, whilst interim 
dividend distributions are recognised in the period in which they are declared and paid.
m) Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortised through the income statement on a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful lives. Their estimated useful lives depend on the classification of the assets as follows:
Computer software 20–33 per cent per annum
Databases 5–20 per cent per annum
Customer relationships 10–33 per cent per annum
Brands 5–20 per cent per annum
Publishing rights and titles 5–10 per cent per annum
Computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is classified as computer equipment within property, plant and 
equipment. All other computer software and also the cost of internally developed software and databases are classified as intangible 
assets. Computer software licences purchased from third parties are initially recorded at cost. Costs associated with the production of 
internally developed software are capitalised once it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits and satisfy the other 
criteria set out in IAS 38. Computer software intangible assets (including the cost of internally developed software and databases) are 
amortised through the Income Statement on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives up to five years. Assets that are not in 
use at the reporting date (assets under construction) are recognised at cost and amortisation commences when those assets begin to 
generate economic benefit.
n) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original purchase price of 
the asset plus any costs of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is not provided on freehold 
land. On other assets it is provided at the following annual rates, on a straight-line basis, in order to write down each asset to its 
residual value over its estimated useful life. The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the 
end of each reporting period.
Land, freehold and leasehold buildings (excluding freehold land) 2–10 per cent per annum
Fixtures and fittings 10–33 per cent per annum
Computer equipment 25–33 per cent per annum
Motor vehicles 25 per cent per annum 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

Notes to the  
Financial Statements
1. Statement of accounting policies continued
Leasehold improvements are included in Land, freehold and leasehold buildings.
Gains and losses arising on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within 
the Income Statement. When the gain or loss arising on disposal is significant or material, it is disclosed separately on the income 
statement within other income or expenses.
o) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
p) Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Group classifies its non-derivative financial assets as ‘loans and receivables’ for the purposes of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. Management determines the classification at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at 
each reporting date.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, with changes in carrying value recognised in the Income Statement.
Loans and receivables are classified as current assets if they mature within 12 months of the reporting date, but are otherwise 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s ‘loans and receivables’ comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash 
equivalents’, for which further information is provided below.
Trade and other receivables
Financial assets within trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the invoiced amount. They are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (if the time value of money is significant), less provisions 
made for doubtful receivables. Provisions are made specifically, where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment taking into account 
ageing, previous losses experienced and general economic conditions.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions, and other short-term highly 
liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have original maturities of three months or less. Cash 
and cash equivalents are offset against bank overdrafts and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts. Bank overdrafts are otherwise shown as borrowings within current liabilities on the 
Balance Sheet.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or Group of financial assets is impaired. Where there is 
objective evidence that an impairment loss has arisen on an asset carried at amortised cost, the carrying amount is reduced and 
the impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement. The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying 
amount of the financial asset does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised at 
the date the impairment is reversed. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities within trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the invoiced amount. They are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (if the time value of money is significant).
If due within 12 months or less, the trade or other payable is classified as a current liability. It is otherwise classified as a non-current 
liability. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

1. Statement of accounting policies continued
Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the amounts received net of transaction costs. They are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with changes in carrying value recognised in the Income 
Statement.
Further information is provided below in relation to loans and borrowings in foreign currencies that are designated as a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation.
Loans and other borrowings are classified as current liabilities if they mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date, but are 
otherwise classified as non-current liabilities.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, and it also has 
loans and borrowings in foreign currencies that correspond to investments in foreign operations.
Financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting:
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes. However, derivative financial 
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting (e.g. certain forward currency contracts held by the Group) are classified as 
‘held for trading’ for the purposes of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, so are initially recognised and 
subsequently measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial instruments that do qualify for hedge accounting:
To qualify for hedge accounting, a financial instrument must be designated as a hedging instrument at inception, hedge documentation 
must be prepared and the hedge must be expected to be highly effective. The effectiveness of the hedge is then tested at each 
reporting date, both prospectively and retrospectively, and hedge accounting may be continued only if the hedge remains highly 
effective. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting, or if the Group chooses to end the hedge relationship.
A financial instrument designated for hedge accounting is initially recognised at fair value. For cash flow hedges (e.g. interest rate 
swaps), the gains or losses on re-measurement to fair value that correspond to the effective part of the hedge are recognised directly 
in equity; those that correspond to the ineffective part, if any, are recognised in the Income Statement. For net investment hedges 
(loans and borrowings in foreign currencies that are designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation), the translation 
differences that correspond to the effective part of the hedge are recognised directly in equity; those that correspond to the ineffective 
part, if any, are recognised in the Income Statement.
q) Provisions for future purchase of non-controlling interests
On the acquisition of less than 100% of certain subsidiary undertakings, the Group may enter into put and call options with the holders 
of the shares not owned by the Group, to purchase their interests at a later date.
These written put options are gross-settled (i.e. the entity pays cash in return for the counterparty delivering shares), and hence 
are recognised as a financial liability. The liability recognised may be subject to a cap based on the individual agreements with the 
counterparties.
Where the put option is ultimately exercised, the amount recognised as the financial liability at that date will be extinguished by the 
payment of the exercise price. Where the put option expires unexercised, the liability is reversed.
r) Retirement benefits
The Group does not operate a defined benefit pension scheme.
The Group contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for a number of employees. Contributions to these arrangements 
are charged in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group has no further payment obligation once the 
contributions have been paid. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

Notes to the  
Financial Statements
1. Statement of accounting policies continued
s) Share based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled, share based compensation plan, under which the entity receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (share awards and options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of share awards and options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the share awards and options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and remaining as an employee of the entity over a specified time period). Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards and options that are expected to vest. The total 
amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified existing conditions are to 
be satisfied. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share awards and options that are expected 
to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income 
Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payments reserve within equity.
The social security contributions and payment in lieu of dividend payable in connection with the grant of the share awards is 
considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge will be treated as an equity-settled transaction. The cumulative share 
based payment charge held in reserves is recycled into retained earnings when the share awards or options lapse or are exercised.
t) Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals incurred in respect of operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Income Statement on 
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
u) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (‘Treasury Shares’), the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until 
the shares are cancelled or reissued.
v) Assets held for sale or disposal groups
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
w) New standards and interpretations applied
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the current year: 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS/IAS)
Effective for 
accounting periods 
starting after
IFRS 5, 7
IAS 19, 34
Annual improvements 2012-2014 cycle 1 January 2016

IAS 1 Disclosure initiative (Amendments to IAS 1) 1 January 2016
IAS 16, 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016
The adoption of these new standards, amendments and interpretations has not led to any changes to the Group’s accounting policies 
or had any other material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. Other amendments to IFRSs effective for the 
year starting 1 July 2016 have no impact on the Group.
x) New standards and interpretations not applied
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have 
issued new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the year starting 1 July 2016. Those marked (*) have not been 
endorsed by the EU. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

Management is currently assessing the impact of the above new standards. During the year to 30 June 2018 the Group will put in 
place necessary processes to capture all of the adjustments and additional disclosures required for those standards taking effect 
before this date. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations, introducing a single, principles 
based approach to the recognition and measurement of revenue from all contracts with customers. The new approach requires 
identification of performance obligations in a contract and revenue to be recognised when or as those performance obligations are 
satisfied, as well as additional disclosure. The Group is currently in the process of completing its review of the potential impact of 
adopting IFRS 15. The necessary processes to capture all of the adjustments and any additional disclosures required under IFRS 15 
will be put into place during 2017/18.
y) Financial Reporting Council review
In the year, the 2016 Annual Report was subject to review by the FRC in accordance with their routine statutory responsibilities. In 
response to the queries raised in this review, management liaised with the FRC to discuss and impartially evaluate the Annual Report 
and its compliance with IFRS and ESMA guidelines. 
As a result of the review and subsequent discussions the 2017 Annual Report includes some enhanced disclosures which improve 
the quality of information presented. The main areas of enhanced disclosure are in the Strategic Review, in the definitions of Adjusting 
Items, a revised format for the Income Statement and a more detailed analysis of intangible assets together with a reallocation of the 
presentation between goodwill and intangible assets. It was also decided to include share based payment charges in our definition of 
adjusted measures. 
On 14 June 2017 the FRC confirmed that their review into the 2016 Annual Report were closed, and that all matters raised had been 
satisfactorily concluded.
The FRC notes that their review provides no assurance that the 2016 report and accounts are correct in all material respects, and that 
the FRC’s role is not to verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements. The FRC noted that 
their review is based on our report and accounts and does not benefit from detailed knowledge of our business or an understanding of 
the underlying transactions entered into. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

3. Segmental information
In accordance with IFRS 8 the Group’s operating segments are based on the operating results reviewed by the Board, which 
represents the chief operating decision maker. Following a strategic review in the year, the Group now reports its results in three 
(previously 4) segments as this more accurately reflects the way the Group is managed. The comparatives have been restated to 
provide information on a consistent basis.
The Group’s organisational structure reflects the main communities to which it provides information, education and networking. The 
three divisions (Risk & Compliance, Professional and Healthcare) are the Group’s segments and generate all of the Group’s revenue. 
The Board considers the business from both a geographic and product perspective. Geographically, management considers the 
performance of the Group between the UK, North America, Europe (excluding the UK) and the Rest of the World.

4. Profit from continuing operations continued
Successful and aborted acquisitions relate to the acquisition of SWAT Group Limited (‘SWAT’), Health Service Journal (‘HSJ’) and other 
aborted acquisitions. The increase in the liability for deferred consideration relates to the purchase of SWAT Group Limited (‘SWAT’).
Restructuring and rationalisation costs comprise primarily of £500,000 of costs relating to the implementation of project Sixth Gear, 
and £300,000 of redundancy and property costs following the Group’s decision to relocate part of the back office functions from its 
head offices in central London to our existing freehold premises in Basildon, Essex. 
Included within operating expenses before depreciation, amortisation and impairment are £224,000 (2016: £122,000) of minor 
restructuring costs not considered to be adjusting items.
Costs associated with property portfolio review relate to a review of the London property portfolio, see note 4c for further details.
c) Property portfolio review
In the year Wilmington plc performed a review of its London property portfolio, on the back of this it sold the leasehold interest in its 
current Underwood Street London head office premises for a £7.3m cash consideration. At the same time as disposing of its leasehold 
interest, Wilmington entered into a new ten-year market rate lease for a London head office premises near Aldgate. The new head 
office space will accommodate Wilmington’s London based businesses whilst retaining the training facility recently acquired with the 
acquisition of SWAT Group Limited. The new London premises will consolidate staff from a number of our current properties therefore 
in the year we have also accounted for the surrender of the leasehold of our London Old Broad Street property and the onerous lease 
of a leasehold property in Kent.
The items which have been credited/(charged) to profit or loss during the year in relation to this review are as follows:

Effect on deferred tax of change of corporation tax rate (117) (178)
Taxation 2,988 2,841
On 26 October 2015, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and a further change was 
announced on 23 November 2016 to reduce the rate from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020. These changes have been substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are included in these financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 30 June 2017 have been 
calculated using the above rates giving rise to a reduction in the net deferred tax liability of £117,000 (2016: £178,000).
The Company’s profits for this accounting year are taxed at an effective rate of 19.75%.

11. Acquisitions and disposals
All below acquisitions have been financed out of the extended £85.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility.
a) Acquisition – SWAT Group Limited – July 2016
On 19 July 2016 Mercia Group Limited, a subsidiary, acquired the entire issued share capital of SWAT Group Limited (‘SWAT’), a 
provider of training and technical compliance support to accountancy firms in London and the South West of England.
SWAT was acquired for initial consideration of £2,870,000, of which £500,000 was withheld in relation to the Net Asset adjustment. 
Subsequently, this initial consideration was reduced by £387,538 in relation to the final Net Asset adjustment.
Deferred consideration of up to £3,000,000 is payable contingent on SWAT’s future performance for the years ended 30 June 2017 
and 2018 and will be paid in cash in one instalment. Management has estimated the expected value of these future payments to 
be £1,082,000 which has been recognised in the total consideration. Any future movements of this contingent consideration will be 
charged to the income statement as an adjusting item.
Acquisition related costs of £278,000 have been expensed as an adjusting item in the income statement (see note 4b).
Details of the fair value of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill for the acquisition are as follows:

The acquired business contributed revenues of £4,659,359 and contribution of £658,559 to the Group for the period from the date of 
acquisition to 30 June 2017. Had SWAT been consolidated from 1 July 2016 the Group consolidated Income Statement would include 
pro forma revenue of £5,016,454 and contribution of £677,811.
At the year the deferred consideration due in respect of the SWAT acquisition was £1,136,000. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

11. Acquisitions and disposals continued
b) Acquisitions – Health Service Journal – January 2017
On 31 January 2017 Wilmington Healthcare Limited, a subsidiary, acquired the trading assets and liabilities of Health Service Journal 
(‘HSJ’), the UK’s leading health information, insight and networking business from EMAP Publishing Limited (the ‘Seller’). HSJ was 
acquired for initial consideration of £17,000,000 in cash with a subsequent adjustment in respect of final working capital of £250,000 
which was due to Wilmington Healthcare Limited. There is no deferred or contingent consideration in relation to the HSJ acquisition.
Acquisition related costs of £1,106,000 have been expensed as an adjusting item in the income statement (see note 4b).
The acquisition adds further strength to the existing Wilmington Healthcare businesses, and will enable the combined group to provide 
unparalleled services into the NHS and private vendor space through subscription information and analytics products, events, awards, 
education, and marketing solutions. 
Details of the fair value of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill for the acquisition are as follows:
£’000
Purchase consideration:
Initial cash paid 17,000 
Final working capital adjustment (250) 
Settlement of liability on behalf of acquiree 133 
Total consideration 16,883 
The provisional fair values of assets and liabilities recognised as a result of this acquisition are as follows:
£’000
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Subscribers 2,894 
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Sponsors 164 
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Delegates 78 
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Other 366 
Intangible assets – Brand 4,240 
Total intangible assets 7,742 
Trade and other receivables (net of allowances) 814 
Trade and other payables (428) 
Subscriptions and deferred revenue (2,723) 
Deferred tax liabilities (1,389) 
Net identifiable assets acquired 4,016 
Goodwill 12,867 
Net assets acquired 16,883 
The goodwill is attributable to the unique HSJ content, established customer base, and the solid customer relationships held by the 
experienced and stable workforce. As well as, the synergies that will arise with the existing Wilmington Healthcare businesses and the 
ability to be able to provide a wider breadth of services and products, across both provider/payer and the private sector in Pharma and 
MedTech industries.
The estimated useful economic life of the intangibles is as follows:
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Subscribers 8 years
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Sponsors 3 years
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Delegates 3 years
Intangible assets – Customer relationships – Other 3 years
Intangible assets – Brand 10 years
The acquired business contributed revenues of 3,695,000 and contribution of £794,000 to the Group for the period from the date of 
acquisition to 30 June 2017, which equates to a five months’ revenue and contribution. Had HSJ been consolidated from 1 July 2016 
the group consolidated Income Statement would include pro forma revenue of £8,868,000 and contribution of £1,906,000. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

A review by management in the year concluded that the tax amortisation benefit acquired with FRA in 2016 should be reallocated 
across Goodwill and Intangibles. This resulted in a reallocation of £1,281,000 from Intangible Assets to Goodwill, with a nil net impact 
on non-current assets. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of the goodwill is determined as the higher of the value in 
use calculation or fair value less cost of disposal for each cash generating unit (‘CGU’). The value in use calculations use pre-tax cash 
flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by the Board covering a three year period. These pre-tax cash 
flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
Key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, cash flow forecasts and long-term growth rates. 
Management has used a pre-tax discount rate of 12.3% (2016: 12.3%) across all CGUs in the UK except for the CLT CGU which had 
a pre-tax discount rate of 13.3% (2016: 13.3%) to reflect the greater market challenges and risks. A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% 
(2016: 13.5%) has been used for Compliance Week and FRA that both operate in North America. These pre-tax discount rates reflect 
current market assessments for the time value of money and the risks associated with the CGUs as the Group manages its treasury 
function on a Group-wide basis. 
The same discount rate has been used for all CGUs except CLT, Compliance Week and FRA as the Directors believe that the risks are 
the same for each other CGU. The long-term growth rates used are based on management’s expectations of future changes in the 
markets for each CGU and are 2.0% (2016: 2.0%). 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

12. Goodwill continued
Management’s impairment calculations based upon the above assumptions show ample headroom with the exception of CLT and 
Compliance Week. 
Goodwill is allocated to significant CGUs as follows. A CGU is considered to be significant if the goodwill allocated to it is greater than 
10% of the total goodwill net book value.

CLT
For CLT, the value in use exceeds the carrying value by 63% (2016: 0%). The impairment review of CLT is sensitive to a reasonably 
possible change in the key assumptions used; most notably the projected cash flows and the pre-tax discount rate. The value in use 
exceeds the carrying value unless any of the assumptions are changed as follows:
– A decrease in the projected operating cash flows of 38.6% in each of the next three years; or
– An increase in the pre-tax discount from 12.4% to 18.8%.
Compliance week
For Compliance Week, the value in use exceeds the carrying value by 27% (2016: 15%). The impairment review of Compliance Week 
is sensitive to a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used; most notably the projected cash flows and the pre-tax 
discount rate. The value in use exceeds the carrying value unless any of the assumptions are changed as follows:
– A decrease in the projected operating cash flows of 27.4% in each of the next three years; or
– An increase in the pre-tax discount from 13.5% to 19.0%.
Impairment of Ark 
A non-cash impairment of £1.54m has been made against the carrying value for goodwill in Ark following the failure to sell the business 
and the Board’s decision to close all but the events and reports businesses. This impairment further reflects the impact of structural 
changes in the legal information and training market. Ark was acquired by Wilmington plc in October 2005 and the original investment 
was impaired last year by £1.03m. It was also decided that the remaining assets held in the business should be written down to their 
recoverable value, resulting in an impairment of £0.83m against the intangible assets held in the business (see note 13). All remaining 
items on the balance sheet are held at their realisable value and are considered recoverable. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

held at Barclays Bank PLC in certain UK companies included in the offsetting agreement.
The £1,000 decrease in capitalised loan arrangement fees reflects the net impact of a £146,000 payment of fees relating to the 
extension of the Group’s £85m revolving multi-currency credit facility, and an amortisation charge of (£147,000). 
20. Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s financial instruments arise from its operations (for example, trade receivables and trade payables) from the financing of 
its operations (for example, loans and borrowings and equity) and from its risk management activities (for example, interest rate swaps 
and forward currency contracts). The risks to which the Group is exposed include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity and 
capital risk, and credit risk.
Interest rate risk
Risk
The Group financing arrangements include external debt that is subject to a variable interest rate. The Group is consequently exposed 
to cash flow volatility arising from fluctuations in market interest rates applicable to that external finance. In particular, interest is 
charged on the £50m (2016: £47m) amount drawn down on the revolving credit facility at a rate of between 1.50 and 2.25 per cent 
above LIBOR depending upon leverage. Cash flow volatility therefore arises from movements in the LIBOR interest rates. Any undrawn 
amounts are charged a commitment fee at a rate of 0.9% (2016: 0.9%). 
Group policy
The Group policy is to enter into interest rate swap contracts to maintain the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at a level that achieves 
a reasonable cost of debt whilst reducing the exposure to cash flow volatility arising from fluctuations in market interest rates. 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

Financial Statements
20. Financial instruments and risk management continued
Risk management arrangements
The Group’s interest rate swap contracts offset part of its variable interest payments and replace them with fixed payments. In 
particular, the Group has hedged its exposure to the LIBOR part of the interest rate for a £21m (2016: £21m) portion of the loan facility 
via an interest rate swap, as follows:
 z A $7.5m interest rate swap commencing on 13 July 2015 and ending on 1 July 2020, whereby the Group receives interest on $7.5m 
based on the USD LIBOR rate and pays interest on $7.5m at a fixed rate of 1.79%.
 z A £15.0m interest rate swap commencing on 22 November 2016 and ending on 1 July 2020, whereby the Group receives interest 
on £15m based on LIBOR rate and pays interest on £15m at a fixed rate of 2.00%.
These derivatives have been designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. The net settlement of interest on the interest 
rate swap, which comprises a variable rate interest receipt and a fixed rate interest payment, is recorded in finance costs in the income 
statement and so is matched against the corresponding variable rate interest payment on the revolving credit facility. The derivatives 
are re-measured at fair value at each reporting date. This gives rise to a gain or loss, the entire amount of which is recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’) following the Directors’ assessment of hedge effectiveness.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis that measures the estimated charge to the Income Statement and Other 
Comprehensive Income arising from a 100 basis points (‘bps’) increase in market interest rates applicable at 30 June 2017, with all 
other variables remaining constant. The sensitivity analysis makes the following assumptions:
 z Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense of variable financial instruments;
 z Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if 
they are recognised at fair value; and
 z Changes in market interest rates do not affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments 
and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective.

Foreign currency risk
Risk
The currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates is Sterling, and this is also the currency in which 
the Group presents its financial statements. However, the Group has significant Euro and US dollar linked cash flows arising from 
international trading and overseas operations. The Group is consequently exposed to cash flow volatility arising from fluctuations in the 
applicable exchange rates for converting Euros and US dollars to Sterling.
Group policy
The Group policy is to fix the exchange rate in relation to a periodically reassessed set percentage of expected Euro and US dollar net 
cash inflows arising from international trading, by entering into foreign currency contracts to sell a specified amount of Euros or US 
dollars on a specified future date at a specified exchange rate. This set percentage is approved by the Board as part of the budgeting 
process and upon the acquisition of foreign operations.
The Group policy is to finance investment in overseas operations from borrowings in the local currency of the relevant operation, so 
as to achieve a natural hedge of the foreign currency translation risk. This natural hedge is designated as a net investment hedge for 
accounting purposes. Debt of $18.2m (2016: $18.2m) has been designated as a net investment hedge relating to the Group’s interest 
in Compliance Week and FRA.  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

The following forward contracts were entered into in order to provide certainty in Sterling terms of 80% of the Group’s expected net US 
dollar and Euro income:
 z On 13 May 2016, the Group sold €1.2m to 24 February 2017 at a rate of 1.2609
 z On 13 May 2016, the Group sold €1.2m to 3 March 2017 at a rate of 1.2606
 z On 13 May 2016, the Group sold €1.1m to 10 March 2017 at a rate of 1.2601
 z On 20 May 2016, the Group sold $3.5m to 27 February 2017 at a rate of 1.4622
 z On 20 May 2016, the Group sold $3.5m to 27 February 2017 at a rate of 1.4637
 z On 20 May 2016, the Group sold $3.0m to 27 February 2017 at a rate of 1.4657
The above derivatives are re-measured at fair value at each reporting date. This gives rise to a gain or loss, the entire amount of which 
is recognised in the Income Statement.
The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis that measures the estimated credit/(charge) to the Income Statement and Other 
Comprehensive Income arising from a 10% difference in the US Dollar to Sterling and Euro to Sterling exchange rates applicable at  
30 June 2017, with all other variables remaining constant. The sensitivity analysis makes the assumption that changes in foreign 
currency rates only affect income, expense, assets and liabilities that are denominated in the relevant currencies.

Liquidity and capital risk
Risk
The Group has historically expanded its operations both organically and via acquisition, financed partly by retained profits but also via 
external finance. As well as financing cash outflows, the Group’s activities give rise to working capital obligations and other operational 
cash outflows. The Group is consequently exposed to the risk that it cannot meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only meet 
them at an uneconomic price.
Group policy
The Group policy is to preserve a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to safeguard 
the future development of the business, but also to balance these objectives with the efficient use of capital by using medium and 
short term debt. The Group has, in previous years, made purchases of its own shares whilst taking into account the availability of 
credit.
Risk management arrangements
The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational 
and other funding requirements. The Group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of short and long-term cash forecasts.
On 1 July 2015 the Group extended its £65m revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and The Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc through to 1 July 2020. On 17 January 2017 £20m of the accordion facility was triggered, increasing the total unsecured 
bank facility to £85m. This extension was made to fund the acquisition of HSJ (note 11). The extended facility comprised of a revolving 
credit facility of £80.0m and an overdraft facility across the Group of £5.0m.  25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4

The Company has entered into an unlimited cross guarantee with the Group’s credit facility providers.
Credit Risk
Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are receivables and bank balances. The Group is consequently exposed to the risk that its 
customers or the credit facility providers cannot meet their obligations as they fall due.
Group policy
The Group policy is that the lines of business assess the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. The Group also reviews the credit rating of the bank. Cash is held in banks with a credit rating between AA- and BB+ 
per Fitch at 12 September 2017.
Risk management arrangements
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. However, the Group has no significant exposure to credit 
risk because its trading is spread over a large number of customers. The payment terms offered to customers take into account 
the assessment of their creditworthiness and financial strength, and they are set in accordance with industry standards. The 
creditworthiness of customers is considered before trading commences. Most of the Group’s customers are large and well established 
institutions that pay on time and in accordance with the Group’s standard terms of business. 
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for bad and doubtful receivables estimated by management based 
on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic value.
Set out below is an analysis of the Group’s trade receivables by due date prior to any impairment.

Fair value measurement
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
 z The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the amounts 
receivable and payable;
 z The fair value of the Group’s borrowings are estimated on the basis of the discounted value of future cash flows using approximate 
discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date; and
 z The fair value of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and put options for non-controlling interest 
are estimated using discounted cash flow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date. 
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value via a valuation method. The different levels have been defined as:
Level 1
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
Level 3
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

b) Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
On 15 September 2016 the company awarded share options to selected key management under a CSOP . This is a discretionary 
scheme consisting of an HMRC approved schedule and an unapproved schedule which enables a company to grant share options to 
selected employees over shares with a maximum cumulative value per individual of £30,000 at the date of the grant. The exercise price 
of the granted options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of the grant. Options are conditional on the employee 
completing three years’ service (the vesting period) so act as a lock-in incentive, the options have a contractual option term of ten 
years. The options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date, subject to the Group achieving its target growth in earnings 
per share over the period of inflation plus 3%. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in 
cash. 
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise price are as follows:

These awards were valued using the Black Scholes method with the following assumptions:
 z Expected volatility (%) 25.46
 z Expected life (years) 6.5
 z Expected dividends (%) 3.28
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price. The expected life used in the 
model is the mid-point of the exercise period.
An expense of £552,000 (2016: £563,000) was recognised in the income statement of the group for share based payments. Of this
