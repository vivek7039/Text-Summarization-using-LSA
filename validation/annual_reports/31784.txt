Our markets
Travel units sell a range of products to cater for people on the 
move or in need of a convenience offer . Travel’s typical customer 
has less time to browse and is more interested in purchasing 
convenience and impulse products such as food, drink and 
confectionery , travel accessories and souvenirs, as well as 
reading materials for a journey. 
Travel units are typically located in higher footfall locations than 
High Street stores, with higher operating and occupation costs 
with rents paid as a percentage of sales (subject to minimum 
guarantees). Travel is less affected by the Christmas trading 
period than high street retailers. Increased passenger traffic 
during the summer holiday season, particularly in airports, 
contributes to a summer peak in sales.
Travel is impacted by macroeconomic trends (including any 
impact arising from the process of exiting the European Union) 
and other factors which influence the number and nationality of 
travelling customers. These include levels of employment and 
investment, the cost of travelling, as well as specific category 
trends such as the impact of digitisation on printed products and 
the growth of consumable products. 
Where we have reliable data on passenger trends, we see 
a correlation between changes in passenger numbers and 
our sales. Travel faces competition in its product categories 
primarily from other retailers in air , rail, motorways and hospitals. 
The growth of these retailers may take market share from Travel.
Travel operates in 150 air units, 124 rail units, 127 hospital units 
and in other locations in the UK, and 233 units outside of the UK.
High Street sells a wide range of products in the following 
categories: Stationery (including greetings cards, general 
stationery , art and craft, and gifting), News and Impulse 
(including newspapers, magazines, confectionery and drinks) 
and Books. High Street’s trading is seasonal, peaking at 
Christmas and in August/September for ‘back to school’.
The High Street business operates 611 stores with an 
extensive reach across the UK and a presence on nearly every 
significant UK high street and mainly in prime locations. 
High Street also includes our online business 
www.whsmith.co.uk which sells a range of Stationery , Books, 
Magazines and Gifts. Our online personalised greetings card 
sites www.funkypigeon.com and www.funkypigeon.ie are part 
of the broader greetings card market and have grown strongly.
High Street’s performance is dependent upon overall growth 
in consumer spending (including any impact arising from 
the process of exiting the European Union), growth in the 
non-food, non-clothing sector , its ability to take share in its 
product markets as well as specific category trends such as 
the impact of digitisation on printed products. Additionally , 
trends in the book market are impacted mainly by the strength 
and quality of publishing in any year . High Street’s competition 
comes primarily from other high street specialists, 
discounters, supermarkets and online retailers. The growth 
of these formats may take market share away from the High 
Street business.

Chairman’s statement
“This performance would not 
be possible without the ongoing 
commitment and hard work 
of our employees across our 
stores, distribution centres 
and head offices.” 
 
 Henry Staunton
 Chairman
It is with great pleasure in this, our 225th 
anniversary year , that I report another year of 
strong performance to 31 August 2017. We have 
seen a good sales performance across our Travel 
businesses both in the UK and internationally , 
driven by our key initiatives and growth in passenger 
numbers, some strong performances from recently 
opened stores in international locations; and a High 
Street performance equal to the particularly strong 
result from last year . 
The distinct strategies of our Travel and High Street 
businesses continue to be successful in driving 
profit and creating shareholder value. The Group has 
grown its profit again with Group profit before tax 
increasing by seven per cent to £140m. 
The Group remains highly cash generative delivering 
a free cash flow¹ of £105m. 
We remain focused on profitable growth, cash 
generation and creating value for shareholders, 
while investing for future growth.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance remains an important area of focus for 
the Board and underpins the sustainability of our business and 
the achievement of our strategy. A more detailed explanation 
of our approach to corporate governance can be found in our 
Corporate governance report on pages 30 to 56.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
During the year , we have continued our focus on managing those 
social and environmental issues which are most material to our 
business and to our stakeholders. Our workstreams cover a 
wide range of issues from ethical trade and sustainable forestry 
to mental health awareness and diversity. In this, our 225th 
anniversary year , we wanted to make a lasting difference to 
charities which our employees care about. Our teams across the 
business have been undertaking a number of activities as they 
work together to reach our £2m fundraising target. It has been a 
fantastic year so far , bringing the business together in a shared 
objective, and we hope that our three charity partners, Cancer 
Research UK, Mind and the National Literacy Trust, will see 
the benefits for many years to come. Further information on all 
aspects of our CR programmes can be found on pages 25 to 27.
PEOPLE
This performance would not be possible without the ongoing 
commitment and hard work of our employees across our stores, 
distribution centres and head offices. I would like to thank each 
and every individual for their ongoing support. 
OUTLOOK
While the economic environment remains uncertain, we believe 
we are well positioned for the year ahead and we remain focused 
on the distinct strategies of each of our businesses in order 
to maximise the contribution from both and best deliver value 
for shareholders.
Henry Staunton
Chairman

“In our 225th anniversary year, 
I am pleased to report another 
year of good performance from 
both of our businesses.”
 
 Stephen Clarke
 Group Chief Executive
In our 225th anniversary year , I am pleased to report 
another year of good performance from both of our 
businesses. Travel continues to perform well with 
strong revenue growth across all channels and, for 
the first time, revenue in Travel has overtaken High 
Street with Travel now the largest part of the Group 
in both revenue and profit. Internationally , we have 
made further good progress in growing our revenue 
and profit and have won some significant tenders in 
the year . In our High Street business, our strategy 
of optimising the return from our space and assets 
continues to produce strong cash generation and 
sustainable profits.
It is important to recognise that this performance 
would not be possible without the support of all of 
our colleagues across the entire business. Their 
hard work ensures that we are able to achieve these 
results and I am sincerely grateful for their support 
and valued contribution.
GROUP OVERVIEW
The distinct strategies of our Travel and High Street 
businesses have been successful in driving profit growth 
and creating shareholder value, underpinned by our 
disciplined approach to cash generation and capital allocation.
In Travel, we aim to deliver high levels of revenue and profit 
growth and good cash generation. We seek to achieve this 
by driving like-for-like revenue growth in existing stores 
through improved execution and service; investment in store 
environments and layouts; a forensic store by store focus on 
retail space and category management; winning new space 
and developing new formats in the UK. 
In International Travel, we aim to expand profitably by winning 
new tenders and retaining existing space; building critical mass 
in our emerging hubs; driving like-for-like sales in existing 
stores; and by executing the same retail and operational 
disciplines and insights as we do in the UK.
In High Street, we aim to deliver sustainable profit growth 
and, as we do in Travel, good cash generation in a constantly 
changing consumer environment. We seek to do this by adopting 
a forensic store by store focus on retail space management to 
optimise the returns from our core categories; driving margin 
growth through category mix management; reducing our cost 
base to reflect our changing sales profile and productivity 
initiatives; and creating value from our assets, including third 
party partnerships that enhance the customer offer .
Group profit from trading operations
1
 increased by six per cent 
on the prior year to £158m and the Group generated Group profit 
before tax of £140m (2016: £131m), an increase of seven per cent 
on the prior year . 
Total Group revenue was up two per cent at £1,234m 
(2016: £1,212m) with like-for-like
2
 revenue flat compared to last 
year . Travel revenue was up nine per cent on 2016 at £624m, of 
which three per cent relates to forex benefits, and up four per 
cent on a like-for-like basis, reflecting investment in our key 
initiatives and improved passenger numbers. Compared to last 
year , High Street revenue was down five per cent at £610m and 
down four per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Chief Executive’s review Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 09
Travel delivered a strong revenue performance across all 
channels, with trading profit
1
 increasing by ten per cent to £96m, 
including £9m (2016: £7m) from our growing International 
business. Travel now represents over 60 per cent of Group profit 
from trading operations. We continue to invest in the business 
and we opened 15 new units in the UK during the year , taking us 
to a total of 582 units in the UK. 
During the year we won a further 41 units in our International 
business, including a significant win in Changi Airport in 
Singapore in the first half of the year , and our first stores in Italy 
in the second half, making a total of 273 international units won, 
of which 233 are open. 
High Street delivered another good performance matching 
a particularly strong profit performance from last year . 
As expected, trading profit
1
 was £62m. We saw a good gross 
margin performance and costs were tightly controlled. 
Cost savings of £12m were delivered in the year . An additional 
£9m of cost savings have been identified over the next three 
years making a total of £18m, of which £9m are planned for 
2017/18.
Diluted earnings per share increased by ten per cent to 103.6p 
(2016: 93.9p). This reflects the increase in profit and a lower 
basic weighted average number of shares in issue following the 
share buyback.
The Group remains highly cash generative and has a 
strong balance sheet. Net funds were £4m at 31 August 
2017 (2016: £7m), with a Group free cash flow
3
 of £105m 
(2016: £108m). The Group has a committed revolving credit 
working capital facility of £140m through to December 2021. 
We completed £41m of the share buyback announced on 
13 October 2016 and on 12 October 2017 we announced a further 
return of cash to shareholders of up to £50m through a rolling 
on-market share buyback programme.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 33.6p per share, a 
ten per cent increase on last year , giving a total dividend per 
ordinary share of 48.2p, a ten per cent increase on the prior year . 
The proposed increase in final dividend reflects our progressive 
dividend policy , the Board’s confidence in the future prospects 
of the Group and the strong cash generative nature of the 
business. The annual dividend has now increased every year 
since demerger from 11.8p in 2007 to 48.2p for 2017.
Both the Travel and High Street businesses are cash generative 
and we allocate our capital efficiently: investing in the business 
and new opportunities where we can achieve an attractive return 
ahead of our cost of capital (capital expenditure in the year was 
£48m), and making appropriate acquisitions whilst consistently 
growing dividends and returning cash to shareholders as part of 
our long-term strategy to create value for shareholders. 
Since our 2007 financial year , including the share buyback 
announced on 12 October 2017 and the proposed final dividend, 
we will have returned over £900m of cash to shareholders, 
increased the dividend each year and reduced our issued share 
capital by 40 per cent.

Second half like-for-like revenue was up four per cent. 
We saw a strong revenue performance across all our key 
channels as a result of an improvement in passenger numbers 
and our initiatives in managing space, ranges and customer 
service. In air , total revenue was up seven per cent with like-for-
like revenue up six per cent; in rail, total revenue was up one 
per cent with like-for-like revenue also up one per cent; and in 
hospitals, total revenue was up six per cent with like-for-like 
revenue up five per cent. Gross margin increased by 100 bps 
during the year , driven by mix.
Whilst the increase in passenger numbers will be an important 
driver of growth, we are well placed to take advantage of the 
structural growth opportunities in our markets by: 
i.  focusing in our existing stores on improved execution and 
customer service; investment in store layouts; space and 
category management
ii.  developing new formats and opening new space in the UK; and
iii. expanding profitably overseas
Travel – UK
Retail space in Travel is often very constrained, it varies 
substantially by channel and location and is expensive. We seek 
to maximise the return from every square metre of this space 
through our detailed analysis of the space and category 
elasticities of each square metre of display space. This, along 
with our operational capabilities to make space changes three 
or four times a year even in our busiest stores, means we are 
able to respond to the changes in our customers’ needs, growth 
opportunities and adapt to seasonal variations. This process 
has, over the years, led to a significant evolution of our formats 
and ranges. During the year , we added to our digital ranges, 
introducing brands such as Apple, while also opening our first 
standalone ‘Tech Express’ unit in Southampton Airport. We also 
further improved our food offer by re-launching our sandwich 
and salad ranges and extended our healthy eating ranges.
We have continued to invest to drive improved customer service. 
With around 100,000 transactions in a peak week in some of our 
busiest stores, maintaining availability and customer throughput 
is critical. For peak trading this year we invested in additional 
labour for replenishment and fitted additional staffed tills as part 
of our Customer First initiative. 
During the year , we have invested in store layouts and store 
environment, as well as developing new formats that position 
us well for the future. One area of particular focus is our large 
airport format where our experience and analysis shows that 
we can deliver superior average transaction value and sales 
per passenger from larger store footprints. Larger stores 
enable improved customer circulation which drives customer 
conversion. Our first UK store showcasing a new design is due 
to open in Gatwick Airport South Terminal in November with a 
further store of a similar design due to open in Stansted Airport 
this year .

 “ During the year, we won  
41 new units including  
the significant tender  
win at Changi Airport  
in Singapore.”
“Looking ahead, we anticipate 
opening around 15 new units 
in total in the UK in each of 
the next three years.”
During the year , we won 41 new units including the significant 
tender win at Changi Airport in Singapore and, in the second 
half, seven units in Italy , including four at Rome Fiumicino 
Airport and two in Rome Ciampino Airport. Our first unit in 
Changi Airport is due to open in November 2017 with the 
remaining nine units opening during the first half of 2018. 
Four of the units in Rome are now open. In addition to the 23 
units won in the first half we won a further 18 new units in the 
second half, including the seven units in Italy and further units in 
Malta, Oman, India, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Of the units we have won approximately 50 per cent are 
franchised, 10 per cent joint venture and 40 per cent directly run. 
We will continue to use these three economic models flexibly in 
order to create value and win new business.
We are now present in 45 airports and 25 countries outside of 
the UK with 62 units open in Europe, 84 in the Middle East and 
India and 87 in Asia Pacific.
As at 31 August 2017 the Travel business operated from 
815 units, including motorway service area franchise units. 
Nine UK units were closed in the year , primarily due to landlord 
redevelopment. Excluding franchise units, Travel occupies 0.6m 
square feet.
In rail, we have created a new format for smaller regional rail 
stations which combines the traditional WHSmith format with a 
coffee offer . We have opened our first store which is trading well. 
This new format gives us opportunities to open stores in smaller 
stations in the rail network. In addition, following the successful 
opening of our standalone bookshop in Euston Station earlier in 
the year , we will open a further two new bookshops in the first 
half of the current financial year . These dedicated bookshops 
provide an enhanced customer experience with a unique look 
and feel and have been well received by customers, publishers 
and landlords. We now have 11 bookshops open in air and rail. 
Our hospital business is an important channel and we continue 
to invest here. During the second half of the financial year we 
developed and began trialling a new format within the WHSmith 
footprint that also includes an M&S Food to Go range, with 
an emphasis on healthy eating, and a WHSmith Coffee House 
counter . We are pleased with the two trial stores we have opened 
and customer feedback has been positive. During the year , we 
opened 15 units in the UK, including three in air , five in rail and 
six in hospitals, including three M&S Simply Food units. We now 
have a total of 18 M&S Simply Food units open.
Looking ahead, we anticipate opening around 15 new units in 
total in the UK in each of the next three years across all three 
of our channels, while at the same time driving sales per 
passenger in existing stores through improvements to customer 
offer and active space and margin mix management. 
International
We have built a successful Travel business based on the 
different operating models applied in each channel. Our active 
space management and our focus on providing a compelling 
offer to customers and to landlords enables us to win and 
retain business.
We continue to be successful in exporting this model overseas 
where the WHSmith brand is well received and we have 
demonstrated we can deliver improved performance and add 
value relative to the previous incumbent. 
Our International business is growing rapidly. We have now won 
273 units and opened 233. However , our share of the global 
news, books and convenience (NBC) travel market is still 
very small and we see opportunities to grow using our three 
economic models of directly-run, joint venture and franchise. 
Total revenue for the year was £108m (2016: £79m), up 37 per 
cent versus the previous year . Approximately 17 per cent of this 
increase relates to forex benefits. Like-for-like revenue was up 
six per cent on a constant currency basis. Trading profit

year was £9m, an increase of £2m on the previous year .  12 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
PERFORMANCE
Review of operations:
High Street
PERFORMANCE REVIEW 2016/17
High Street delivered a good performance in the year in line 
with our expectations, matching a particularly strong profit 
performance from last year with trading profit
1
 flat at £62m 
(2016: £62m).
High Street total revenue was down five per cent and down four 
per cent on a like-for-like basis. Gross margin improved by 
around 110 bps, through rebalancing the mix of our business, 
better buying and markdown management.
In High Street, we aim to deliver sustainable profit growth 
and good cash generation in a constantly changing 
consumer environment. 
As we do with our Travel business, we consider retail space as a 
strategic asset and we utilise our space to maximise profitability 
in the current year in ways that are sustainable for future years. 
We have extensive and detailed space and range elasticity data 
for every store, built up over many years and we utilise our 
space to maximise the return on every metre drop in every store. 
We also create value through improving margins, reducing costs 
and driving third party income opportunities. 
Nearly all our stores are located in the best retail locations 
in the catchments in which we operate. This, and the huge 
variability in the size and shape of our stores, continues to give 
us opportunities to reconfigure our space to deliver margin 
mix benefits and efficiencies in the store operating model. 
During the year space changes have included further extending 
our Stationery ranges and providing more, better quality space in 
store to this category. 
We have conducted a number of trials to explore opportunities 
to further improve Stationery in our larger stores. These trials 
have ranged from lower cost initiatives that deliver key benefits, 
to additional space with new features, such as a dedicated 
pen shop and digital area, through to a complete store 
refurbishment, as we have done in Reading. 
Our strategy to build on our market leading position in 
Stationery remains unchanged. Stationery remains an attractive 
category for us with good economics and growth potential. 
Our in-house design capabilities for product and packaging; 
the quality , breadth and depth of our ranges; our ability to 
source competitively through our Far East sourcing office; and 
our promotional offers and scale mean we can differentiate 
ourselves in this category. 
During the year , Stationery has continued to be the main 
beneficiary of space with more stores benefitting from 
additional space towards the front of store and further range 
improvements. This additional space, combined with our range 
development initiatives drove good like-for-like revenue growth 
over the Christmas period (in categories such as calendars, 
single Christmas cards, wrap, diaries and decorations), and at 
‘back to school’. 
In Books, the General Retail Market remains fairly stable 
however the quality of publishing is still the biggest driver of 
market performance. Ebooks continue to decline across the 
market. During the first half, spoof humour books were a key 
driver of revenue while revenue from ‘colour therapy’ titles 
reduced significantly versus last year . In the second half, we 
annualised good publishing from 2016 including Harry Potter and 
The Cursed Child.

We continue to focus on areas of strength and the net 
profitability from this category. For example, spoof humour titles 
over Christmas and our book clubs where we continue to drive 
good results. The Richard and Judy Book Club remains the 
UK’s biggest book club and we are now in the second year of 
our successful Zoella book club targeting young adult readers. 
In September 2017, we launched a new Kids book club fronted 
by Tom Fletcher . We also see opportunities to improve the 
efficiency of our books operating model both in store and in the 
supply chain, reducing stock levels and increasing productivity. 
The newspaper and magazine market continues to be 
challenging but we held our market share supported by the re-
launch of our bookazine ranges. 
Driving efficiencies remains a core part of our strategy and 
we focus on all areas of cost in the business. We continue 
to deliver savings as part of our cost efficiency programme 
whilst adjusting our variable costs to sales. During the year 
we achieved cost savings of £12m. These savings come from 
right across the business, including rent savings at lease 
renewal, a more efficient store operating model through greater 
use of technology and contract renegotiations. Over the next 
three years, the leases on 250 stores expire giving us further 
opportunities to renegotiate rent to reduce our occupation costs. 
An additional £9m of cost savings have been identified over 
the next three years making a total of £18m of which £9m are 
planned for 2017/18. 
Post Offices continue to be an important area of investment. 
We now have 166 Post Offices open within our High Street stores 
of which 133 are franchises and 33 are run by Post Office Ltd 
under a concession agreement. During the year , we opened 
58 Post Offices from the deal we announced in April 2016. 
Customer feedback continues to be positive with customers 
commenting on the modern layout and environment as well as 
extended opening hours. The contract for all 166 Post Offices 
runs to 2026. The Post Offices further cement our position in the 
heart of the communities in which we operate. 
Funkypigeon.com performed well over the key seasons in 
the year . Mobile continues to be the main and growing source 
of traffic to the site and our investment in web development 
reflects this. During the second half, in line with our plan, we 
successfully opened a new 36,000 square foot fulfilment centre 
having reached capacity in the original site which opened in 
2011. This future proofing gives us scope to develop our gifting 
offer further and bring the majority of our fulfilment in-house.
As at 31 August 2017, the High Street business operated 
from 611 stores
2
 (2016: 612), which occupy 2.8m square feet 
(2016: 2.8m square feet). Three stores were closed in the year .
OUTLOOK
The distinct strategies for each of our businesses continue to 
deliver a good performance. We see further opportunities for 
growth in Travel in both the UK and overseas. Most airports 
are forecasting increases in passenger numbers although 
the forecasts remain variable by location. In addition, we will 
continue to invest in our stores and service levels and open 
new space. Outside of the UK we have won 273 units and 
our International business is profitable and growing fast. 
Our High Street strategy remains unchanged. We see further 
opportunities to grow our margin and reduce our cost base and 
we will continue to focus on driving returns from our existing 
space with our forensic approach to space management. 
Looking to the year ahead, while the economic environment 
remains uncertain we are well positioned for the year ahead and 
beyond. We will continue to drive both businesses, each with 
their distinct strategies, to maximise the contribution from both 
in order to deliver value for shareholders.

GROUP REVENUE
Total Group revenue was up two per cent at £1,234m and flat on 
a like-for-like basis. In Travel, total revenue was up nine per cent 
with like-for-like revenue up four per cent reflecting investment 
in our key initiatives and improved passenger numbers. For the 
first time, revenue in Travel has overtaken High Street and Travel 
is now the largest part of the Group in both revenue and profit. 
As expected, in High Street, total revenue was down five per cent 
with like-for-like revenue down four per cent. 
In the first half, Travel like-for-like revenue was up five per cent 
and up four per cent in the second half. In High Street, first half 
like-for-like revenue was down three per cent, and down four 
per cent in the second half.

Stationery like-for-like revenue was up three per cent in the

from the prior year which included JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and

and Food to Go ranges. During the year we launched our new 
‘Munch’ range and extended the offer with healthier snacks and 
ready to eat convenience lines including fruit and protein pots.
Books and News and Impulse saw an increase in gross margin 
compared to last year and Stationery was slightly lower than last

TAXATION
The effective tax rate was 17 per cent (2016:17 per cent), 
reflecting the lower statutory rate combined with the agreement 
with the tax authorities of open items from prior years. In the 
current financial year , we expect the effective tax rate to be 
around 18 per cent. The exact tax rate achieved will depend 
on the underlying profitability of the Group and agreeing 
outstanding tax assessments with the tax authorities.
In the year ended 31 August 2017, WHSmith contributed £255m 
in taxes, both paid and collected for the UK government. The key 
taxes paid by the Group were business rates, UK corporation 
tax and employers’ national insurance incurred in employing 
our 14,000 people. Other taxes incurred include environmental 
levies and customs duties. The main taxes the Group collects for 
the government are the sales taxes charged to its customers on 
their purchases and employee payroll related taxes.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Diluted earnings per share was 103.6p (2016: 93.9p), an increase 
of ten per cent. This reflects the increase in profit and the lower 
basic weighted average number of shares in issue following the 
share buyback.
DIVIDENDS
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, 
over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings 
calculated on a normalised tax basis.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 33.6p per ordinary 
share, an increase of ten per cent on the prior year , giving a total 
dividend per ordinary share of 48.2p, a ten per cent increase on 
the prior year . This increase on the prior year , together with the 
return of cash to shareholders announced on 12 October 2017, 
reflects the continuing cash generative nature of the Group 
and the Board’s confidence in its future prospects. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the dividend will be paid on 1 February 
2018 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 
12 January 2018. The final dividend will be paid gross.
 
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW
As at 31 August 2017, the Group had net assets of £187m 
(2016: £168m). The increase in net assets reflects the cash 
generation of the business, the return of cash to shareholders 
and investments in fixed assets.
CASH FLOW
The Group generated £105m (2016: £108m) of free cash flow. 
The cash generative nature of both the Travel and High Street 
businesses is one of the strengths of the Group.

employers payroll tax resulting from the exercise of share based 
awards were £2m compared to £2m last year . Net corporation 
tax paid on trading profits was £25m, compared to £23m 
last year . 
Capital expenditure was £48m in the year and was £6m higher 
than the prior year due to the investment in Post Offices and 
the store operating model. Capex includes new stores in Travel 
in the UK and International, further investment in the store 
operating model, IT and our existing stores, and further format 
trials in Travel and High Street. 
This year , we expect capex to also be around £48m. 
Going forward after this year , we expect capex to be around 
£45m per annum although this will depend on the number of 
new stores we open.

PENSIONS 
The latest actuarial revaluation of the main defined benefit 
pension scheme, the WHSmith Pension Trust, was at 31 March 
2017 at which point the deficit was £11m (31 March 2014 
actuarial revaluation deficit of £24m). The Group has agreed 
a revised annual funding schedule with the Trustees from 
September 2017 for the next six years of just under £3m, a 
reduction of approximately £0.5m. This includes the deficit 
recovery contributions and other running costs. During the year 
ended 31 August 2017, the Group made a contribution of £3m to 
the scheme.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 1996 and 
closed to defined benefit service accrual since 2007. The Liability 
Driven Investment (LDI) policy adopted by the scheme continues 
to perform well with around 85 per cent of the inflation and 
interest rate risks hedged.
As at 31 August 2017, the Group has an IFRIC 14 minimum 
funding requirement in respect of the WHSmith Pension Trust 
of £4m (2016: £5m) and an associated deferred tax asset of 
£1m (2016: £1m) based on the latest schedule of contributions 
agreed with the Trustees. As at 31 August 2017, the scheme 
had an IAS 19(R) surplus of £269m (2016: surplus of £164m) 
which the Group has continued not to recognise. There is an 
actuarial deficit due to the different assumptions and calculation 
methodologies used compared to those under IAS 19(R).
The IAS 19(R) pension deficit on the relatively small UNS defined 
benefit pension scheme was £2m (2016: £2m).
OPERATING LEASES
The Group’s stores are held mainly under operating leases that 
are not capitalised and therefore are not included as debt for 
accounting purposes. The High Street leases are on standard 
‘institutional’ lease terms, subject to five year upwards-only rent 
reviews. The Travel stores operate mainly through turnover-
related leases, usually with minimum rent guarantees, and 
generally varying in length from five to ten years.
The business has an annual minimum net rental commitment 
of £182m (2016: £159m) (net of £1m of external rent receivable 
(2016: £2m)). The total future rental commitment at the balance 
sheet date amounted to £841m (2016: £769m) with the leases 
having an average life of five years.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group has contingent liabilities relating to reversionary 
property leases. Any such contingent liability which crystallises 
will be apportioned between the Group and Connect Group PLC 
(formerly Smiths News PLC) in the ratio 65:35 pursuant to the 
terms of the Demerger Agreement (provided that the Connect 
Group PLC liability is limited to £5m in any 12 month period). 
We have estimated the Group’s 65 per cent share of the future 
cumulative contingent rental commitment at approximately  
£3m (2016: £3m).

Principal risks and uncertainties
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Our risk management framework is designed so that material 
business risks throughout the Group can be identified, assessed 
and effectively managed. This framework incorporates the 
following core elements: 
Identify – Risk registers compiled by each business function
  – Risk mapping to identify emerging issues
Assess – Determining the likelihood of risk occurrence
  – Evaluating the potential impact
Mitigate – Agreeing actions to manage the identified risks
  –  Ensuring control measures are in place
Monitor – Reviewing the effectiveness of controls
  – Maintaining continued oversight and tracking
All principal business functions compile risk registers and 
summary risk maps to identify key risks, assess them in 
terms of their likelihood and potential impact, and determine 
appropriate control strategies to mitigate the impact of these 
risks taking account of risk appetite. The ongoing monitoring 
of this framework is overseen by the respective Business Risk 
Committees and the Group Audit Committee.
During the year , the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal controls systems. 
This review included the discussion and review of the risk 
registers and the internal controls across all business functions, 
as part of an annual exercise facilitated by the Internal Audit 
team. During the year , the Board also received presentations 
from management on specific risk areas such as cyber risk, 
international expansion, and the ongoing risk monitoring 
processes and appropriate mitigating controls.
BOARD REVIEW OF PRINCIPAL RISKS  
AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board has undertaken a robust assessment of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. Those principal risks are described on the following 
pages, along with explanations of how they are managed 
and mitigated. The Group recognises that the profile of risks 
constantly changes and additional risks not presently known, 
or that may be currently deemed immaterial, may also impact 
the Group’s business objectives and performance. Our risk 
management framework is therefore designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and, as such, can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against these principal uncertainties impacting on 
business performance.
CHANGES IN PRINCIPAL RISKS COMPARED  
TO LAST YEAR
The table on the following page summarises the principal risks 
and uncertainties agreed by the Board. The table incorporates 
further information relating to the movement in the level of 
these risk exposures during the year , to highlight whether , in 
our view, exposure to each of the principal risks is increasing, 
decreasing or remains broadly the same.

ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, COMPETITIVE AND MARKET RISKS
The Group operates in highly competitive markets 
and in the event of failing to compete effectively 
with travel, convenience and other similar product 
category retailers, this may affect revenues obtained 
through our stores. Failure to keep abreast of market 
developments, including the use of new technology , 
could threaten our competitive position. 
Factors such as the economic climate, levels of 
household disposable income, seasonality of sales, 
changing demographics and customer shopping 
patterns, and raw material costs could also impact on 
profit performance.
The Group may also be impacted by political 
developments such as exiting the European Union, 
regulatory and tax changes, increasing scrutiny by 
competition authorities and other changes in the 
general condition of the retail and travel markets. 
The Group’s performance is dependent upon effectively 
predicting and quickly responding to changing consumer 
demands. The Group conducts customer research to 
understand current demands and preferences in order to 
help translate market trends into saleable merchandise. 
The Group continues to monitor the implications arising 
from the process of exiting the European Union and is a 
member of a number of key industry bodies which provide 
insight and updates on this process.
  
There are a number of 
increasing uncertainties 
relating to the nature 
and resulting impact of 
the ongoing negotiations 
regarding the UK’s exit 
from the European 
Union. These are further 
described in the note on 
page 24.
BRAND AND REPUTATION
The WHSmith brand is an important asset and 
failure to protect it from unfavourable publicity 
could materially damage its standing and the 
wider reputation of the business, adversely 
affecting revenues.
As the Group continues to expand its convenience 
food offer in travel locations, associated risks include 
compliance with food hygiene and health and safety 
procedures, product and service quality , environmental 
or ethical sourcing, and associated legislative and 
regulatory requirements.
The Group monitors the Company’s reputation, brand 
standards and key service and compliance measures 
to ensure the maintenance of operating standards and 
regulatory compliance across all of our operations. 
We undertake regular customer engagement to understand 
and adapt our product, offer and store environment. 
We operate a framework for monitoring compliance with 
all regulatory , hygiene and safety standards, encompassing 
supplier and store audits and clearly defined sourcing 
policies and procedures. Our corporate responsibility 
programme monitors our performance in respect of our key 
themes of the Marketplace, Workplace, Environment and 
Impact on the Community.
  
KEY SUPPLIERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
The Group has agreements with key suppliers in the 
UK, Europe, the Far East and other countries in which 
it operates. The interruption or loss of supply of core 
category products from these suppliers to our stores 
may affect our ability to trade. Quality of supply issues 
may also impact the Group’s reputation and impact 
our ability to trade.
The Group conducts risk assessments of all its key 
suppliers to identify alternatives and develop contingency 
plans in the event that any of these key suppliers fail. 
Suppliers are required to comply with the conditions laid 
out in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which covers areas 
such as production methods, employee working conditions 
and quality control. The Group has contractual and other 
arrangements with numerous third parties in support of its 
business activities. None of these arrangements alone are 
individually considered to be essential to the business of 
the Group.

STORE PORTFOLIO
The quality and location of the Group’s store 
portfolio are key contributors to the Group’s strategy. 
Retailing from a portfolio of good quality real estate in 
prime retail areas and key travel hubs at commercially 
reasonable rates remains critical to the performance 
of the Group. 
All of High Street’s stores are held under operating 
leases, and consequently the Group is exposed to the 
extent that any store becomes unviable as a result 
of rental costs. Most Travel stores are held under 
concession agreements on average for five to ten 
years, although there is no guarantee that concessions 
will be renewed or that Travel will be able to bid 
successfully for new contracts. 
The Group undertakes research of key markets and 
demographics to ensure that we continue to occupy prime 
sites and identify appropriate locations to acquire new space. 
We maintain regular dialogue and good relationships with 
our landlords. The Group also conducts extensive customer 
research and analysis to gather feedback on changing 
consumer requirements which is shared with landlords as 
part of this ongoing relationship management programme. 
 
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION
An act of terrorism or war , or an outbreak of a 
pandemic disease, could reduce the number of 
customers visiting WHSmith outlets, causing a decline 
in revenue and profit. In the past, our Travel business 
has been particularly impacted by geopolitical events 
such as major terrorist attacks, which have led to 
reductions in customer traffic. Closure of travel 
routes both planned and unplanned, such as the 
disruption caused by natural disasters or weather-
related events, may also have a material effect on 
business. The Group operates from three distribution 
centres and the closure of any one of them may cause 
disruption to the business. 
In common with most retail businesses, the Group 
also relies on a number of important IT systems, 
where any system performance problems, cyber risks 
or other breaches in data security could affect our 
ability to trade.
The Group has a framework of operational procedures 
and business continuity plans that are regularly reviewed, 
updated and tested. The Group also has a comprehensive 
insurance programme covering our global assets, providing 
cover ranging from property damage and product and public 
liability , to business interruption and terrorism. Back-up 
facilities and contingency plans are in place and are reviewed 
and tested regularly to ensure that business interruptions 
are minimised.
The Group’s IT systems receive ongoing investment to 
ensure that they are able to respond to the needs of the 
business. Back-up facilities and contingency plans are in 
place and are reviewed and tested regularly to ensure that 
data is protected from corruption or unauthorised use.
 
RELIANCE ON KEY PERSONNEL
The performance of the Group depends on its ability to 
continue to attract, motivate and retain key head office 
and store staff. The retail sector is very competitive and 
the Group’s personnel are frequently targeted by other 
companies for recruitment.
The Group reviews key roles and succession plans. 
The Remuneration Committee monitors the levels 
and structure of remuneration for directors and senior 
management and seeks to ensure that they are designed 
to attract, retain and motivate the key personnel to run the 
Group successfully.

INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
The Group continues to expand internationally. In each 
country in which the Group operates, the Group may 
be impacted by political or regulatory developments, 
or changes in the economic climate or the general 
condition of the travel market.
The Group utilises three business models to manage 
risk in our overseas locations: directly run, joint venture 
and franchise. 
The Group uses external consultants to advise on 
compliance with international legislative and regulatory 
requirements, to monitor developments that may impact 
on our operations in overseas territories and to conduct 
reputational due diligence on potential new business 
partners. Our geographical spread of activity mitigates 
against the material concentration of risk in any one area.
   
This is an area of 
increasing risk, reflecting 
the growth of our 
International business.
TREASURY, FINANCIAL AND CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s exposure to and management of capital, 
liquidity , credit, interest rate and foreign currency 
risk are analysed further in Note 23 on page 90 of the 
financial statements. The Group also has credit risk 
in relation to its trade, other receivables and sale or 
return contracts with suppliers.
The Group’s Treasury function seeks to reduce exposures 
to interest rates, foreign exchange and other financial risks, 
to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable 
needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. 
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial 
instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying 
business requirements. The value of any deposit that can be 
placed with any approved counterparty is based on short-
term and long-term credit ratings. The Group’s Treasury 
policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and 
approved by the Audit Committee and are subject to Group 
Internal Audit review. The Group has a committed facility 
with a number of financial institutions which is available to 
be drawn for general corporate purposes including working 
capital. This facility matures in December 2021.
 
CYBER RISK AND DATA SECURITY
The Group is subject to the risk of systems breach 
or data loss from various sources including external 
hackers or the infiltration of computer viruses. 
Theft or loss of Company or customer data or potential 
damage to any systems from viruses, ransomware or 
other malware could result in fines and reputational 
damage to the business that could negatively impact 
our sales.
The Group employs a framework of IT controls to protect 
against unauthorised access to our systems and data, 
including monitoring developments in cyber security. 
This control framework encompasses the maintenance of 
firewalls and intruder detection, encryption of data, regular 
penetration testing conducted by our appointed external 
quality assurance providers and engagement with third party 
specialists, where appropriate. 
We have a Steering Group overseeing our approach and 
response to Cyber risk, and monitoring our programme of 
ongoing compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard and the EU GDPR. 
  
While the external threat 
level is ever changing, 
there has been a 
general increase in the 
number of externally 
reported cyber attacks 
affecting businesses. 24 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017

BREXIT
Following the UK referendum to leave the EU, there will be a period of uncertainty until an agreement on exit has been agreed 
between the UK and EU. In the circumstances, the extent to which our operations and financial performance are affected in the 
longer term will only become clear as details of this agreement emerge. We have considered the possible consequences that Brexit 
could have upon our business and have concluded that it does not raise any new principal risks, although it does have the potential to 
impact a number of our existing risks, for example, regulatory changes and economic uncertainty , including impacts from changes in 
foreign exchange rates. 
We will continue to monitor the risks and uncertainties arising from Brexit as part of the Company’s risk management and control 
processes which are described on page 20. 
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, the directors are required to issue a ‘viability 
statement’ declaring whether we believe the Company is able to continue to operate and meet its liabilities over a period greater than 
12 months, taking into account its current position and principal risks.
The directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over a three year period, taking into account its recent historical performance, 
forecasts, principal risks and mitigating factors. A three year period is considered the appropriate timeframe to assess the Group’s 
prospects as it is consistent with the Group’s strategic planning and review period, management incentive schemes and medium term 
financing considerations.
The strategic review incorporates plans at both the Group and Operating Division level. The plans consider the Group’s cash flows, 
committed funding liquidity positions, forecast future funding and key financial metrics.
Using the strategic plan as a base, we have modelled a range of severe but plausible scenarios reflecting the Group’s principal risks to 
establish their effect on the Group’s cash and bank facilities.
Taking account of the above matters, and the Group’s current position and principal risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 
31 August 2020. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 25

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMME
At WHSmith, we have a long-standing commitment to high 
standards of corporate responsibility (CR). Our programme is 
comprised of four key areas of CR: Environmental management, 
Responsibility in the marketplace, Workplace practice and 
Community impact. Accountability for each area rests with 
named members of our Board, who, in turn, are supported 
by senior executives responsible for delivering our objectives. 
In this way we ensure our CR work is embedded across our 
organisation. The Board carry out annual reviews to ensure 
the successful implementation of the CR strategy and to 
monitor performance against our CR targets. The following 
pages provide an introduction to our CR work during the year . 
More detailed information, including performance data and 
future targets, is available in our full CR report, available at 
www.whsmithplc.co.uk/cr .
CUSTOMERS
Excellent customer service is a core part of our business 
objectives and we recognise and reward staff who meet the 
highest standards. We use mystery shoppers to monitor 
customer service and reward employees who perform well. 
We also operate a gold badge recognition scheme in our High 
Street stores awarded to store staff who have delivered excellent 
customer service. In our Travel business, we continue to build 
upon and grow our Customer First initiative to drive a culture of 
excellent customer service standards throughout the business.
Our Marketing Code of Practice sets out the standards we follow 
in our promotional activity , marketing and advertising and seeks 
to ensure that the products we sell are safe, fit for purpose, 
meet legal standards and are not described in a misleading 
manner , particularly when marketing to children.
We aim to offer our customers a choice of healthy options when 
they buy food or drink from WHSmith, and our healthy ranges 
continue to grow. We launched our Munch Better chilled food 
range in October 2016 and this sub-brand now accounts for 
nearly a quarter of our chilled food sales. All of our Munch 
Better lines are under 400 Kcals and amber or green on the 
traffic light system. Our queuing system now features a range 
of protein bars, Graze products and own brand Munch lines that 
include raw nuts and fruit. Initiatives like this, together with our 
improved ranges, have contributed to healthier snacking sales 
growing by over 30 per cent within Travel last year . 
ETHICAL TRADING AND HUMAN RIGHTS
WHSmith’s Ethical Trade Code of Conduct, based on the 
ETI Base Code, underpins our ethical trade strategy and 
programmes. We will only place orders with suppliers who 
are committed to working towards compliance with this 
Code. Our objective is to work with our suppliers to bring 
about incremental change through our programme of factory 
audits and ongoing engagement. Over the last year , we have 
also completed a detailed review of our ethical trade policies 
and audit process, benchmarking WHSmith against other 
ETI members to ensure that our approach is in line with 
best practice. 
WHSmith is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative, an 
alliance of companies, trade unions and NGOs that promotes 
respect for workers’ rights around the globe.
We have an in-house ethical audit team based in China who 
conduct audits of our own-brand suppliers in Asia at least every 
two years assessing compliance with our Code of Conduct and 
grading suppliers Black, Bronze, Silver and Gold. A factory 
must be graded Bronze or above if we are to work with them. 
We use a mix of announced and unannounced audits. We are 
increasing the number of unannounced audits to ensure that we 
are seeing as true a picture as possible of the factory conditions. 
Last year , around a third of factory audits (by overall spend) 
were unannounced. We have joined the Supplier Ethical Data 
Exchange (SEDEX) to provide additional risk assessments and 
audit data, which will allow more detailed ethical risk analysis of 
UK and European suppliers.
Our team spend a significant part of their time leading our 
engagement work to support suppliers as they seek to improve 
working conditions. Engagement focuses on resolving specific 
issues identified during audits, as well as wider projects working 
with a range of suppliers on a key issue, for example, worker 
representation or health and safety.
We continue to develop our understanding of modern slavery 
risks within our business and supply chain. We have reported 
on this area in detail in a separate Modern Slavery Statement. 
This is available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk. A copy of our Ethical 
Trading Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy is available at 
www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility/our_policies/.
FOREST SOURCING
Paper-based products are a core part of WHSmith’s business 
and sustainable timber sourcing is therefore one of our key CR 
priorities. We are committed to minimising the environmental 
impact of the paper used in own-brand products, and to do 
so we work to a continuing objective that all virgin (i.e. non-
recycled) material used in our products is from known, legal, 
well-managed and credibly certified forests. As part of our 
work towards this objective and in line with the requirements 
of the EU timber regulations, we carry out an in-depth and 
rigorous assessment of supplier forest sourcing systems. 
We have set certified (FSC/PEFC) or recycled as a minimum 
standard, which gives additional assurance that pulp is from 
low risk sources. In July , WWF released the results of their 2017 
Timber Scorecard, a survey of retailer timber sourcing policies. 
WHSmith was praised for making very good progress and we 
were pleased to be one of a group of businesses that were 
awarded their top rating. More than 90 per cent of the pulp used 
in our own-brand stationery products now comes from certified 
sustainable forest sources, and we have set a target to get to at 
least 95 per cent by 2020. A copy of our Forest Sourcing Policy 
is available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility/
our_policies/. 26 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
ENVIRONMENT
We recognise that good environmental management also 
makes good business sense. We are committed to reducing 
the environmental impact of our business, and measure our 
performance each year . A copy of our Environmental Policy is 
available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility/
our_policies/.
Greenhouse gas emissions
We have been working for many years to reduce the amount of 
energy we use, recognising the opportunity both to reduce our 
overall carbon footprint and also to reduce operating costs for 
the business. We are on track to meet our objective to cut CO
2e 
emissions from stores and distribution centres by 45 per cent 
per square foot by 2020 (from a 2007 baseline). The ownership 
for energy consumption sits with our store managers who have 
direct accountability for energy costs, therefore driving high 
levels of awareness and engagement among our store teams. 
During the year , we have been working on a project to roll out 
energy efficiency best practice across the Group. The project 
involves, firstly , understanding what energy a store should 
be using, and then making changes to the settings of key 
energy using systems, and, in larger sites, the installation of 
additional control equipment and automation to ensure things 
are controlled efficiently. These improved energy efficiency 
measures have now been implemented in 220 High Street stores 
and 430 Travel units. On average we expect to see a saving of 
around five per cent in a typical store.
WHSmith’s transport delivery network is a long and complex 
one, covering well over a thousand stores across the length and 
breadth of the UK. The emissions from our fleet of lorries make 
up a significant part of our carbon footprint and we work hard 
to maximise efficiency wherever we can. Since 2007, we have 
reduced our CO
2e emissions per pallet moved by 21 per cent.
We work with our transport providers to carry out regular 
and in-depth reviews of our transport operations to help us to 
optimise routing and delivery frequency. The addition of double 
deck trailers which are suitable for both High Street and Travel 
distribution centres has helped to achieve greater efficiencies by 
creating a more integrated fleet across the Group. In addition, 
our transport management system provides real-time data to 
monitor driver behaviour .

Scope and methodology
In the above table we have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Large and Medium Companies 
and Groups (Accounts & Reports) Regulations 2008 (as 
amended), as well as Scope 3 emissions, which are reported 
on a voluntary basis. These sources fall within our consolidated 
financial statements. This data covers the continuing activities 
undertaken by our retailing operation in the UK and Ireland. 
The impacts resulting from franchise operations are excluded 
from this report as we are not responsible for the operations of 
these stores. The impacts resulting from international stores are 
also excluded from this report because it is not practicable to 
collect the base emissions data at the current time.
We have used data gathered to fulfil our requirements under the 
GHG Protocol, and recommended DEFRA conversion factors. 
We do not believe there are any material omissions.
Waste management
Waste is not only damaging to the environment but also costly 
for our business, so we are focused on reducing waste and 
maximising recycling wherever we can. In our High Street 
stores, we operate a dry mix recycling system which enables 
the stores to recycle most forms of waste, including plastics 
and metals. Waste is also carefully separated in our distribution 
centres and offices. Overall 89 per cent of our waste was 
recycled during 2016/17.
Other disclosures continued Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 27
Eliminating food waste is a priority for our Travel business. 
This is a complex area however , and we need to develop different 
strategies for chilled food versus ambient food. We have made 
good progress in improving our forecasting of chilled food sales, 
so that we only stock the chilled food that we expect to sell, and 
therefore reducing waste volumes. We have been able to deliver 
a 28 per cent reduction in sandwich waste, and we are targeting 
further reductions in the year ahead. 
In recent years, we have been working hard to reduce the 
number of single-use plastic carrier bags we hand out. 
This year , we introduced a Bag for Life which is available in 
all of our High Street and Travel stores and has resulted in a 
dramatic drop in single-use bag consumption, down by around 
90 per cent year on year . For the few single-use bags we still 
use, we donate the proceeds from the UK carrier bag levies to 
good causes. During the year , we have donated almost £220,000 
to our charity partners, with our Travel business supporting 
Shelter , the homelessness charity , and our High Street business 
giving the proceeds of the levy to our new WHSmith Community 
Fund, which makes grants to hundreds of customer-nominated 
schools and charities across the UK. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are committed to maintaining high standards of health 
and safety. The management team, supported by professional 
safety advisers, monitors key safety performance indicators 
and an annual report detailing trends, performance and 
recommendations is presented to the Board. The business also 
has a Health and Safety Committee that comprises employee 
representatives and professional health and safety advisers. 
The Group Safety team continue to provide an ongoing training 
programme for staff in stores, consisting of ‘modular’ courses 
focusing on key issues such as fire safety , manual handling 
and slips, trips and falls. A copy of our Health and Safety at 
Work Policy is available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_
responsibility/our_policies/.
SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY MATTERS
As a leading bookseller and stationer we focus our community 
investment on supporting education and life-long learning. 
Over the year we invested a total of £1,865,690 into local 
communities (2016: £1,602,675). Included in this figure are 
cash donations, staff time and gifts in kind. The full extent of 
our community investment activity , measured according to the 
London Benchmarking Group model, is outlined in the Group’s 
CR report, available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/cr .
To mark WHSmith’s 225th anniversary , we have partnered 
with three charities this year , Cancer Research UK, Mind and 
the National Literacy Trust, with all of our employees across 
the Group coming together to support our charity fundraising. 
Highlights of the year include World Cancer Day in February 
when WHSmith stores raised over £150,000 for Cancer Research 
UK. In March, our stores celebrated World Book Day for the 
National Literacy Trust, with hundreds of school children coming 
in for storytelling and behind the scenes tours. In May , stores 
marked Mental Health Awareness Week for Mind and WHSmith 
Waterloo station store was ‘wrapped’ in Mind logos to mark the 
event. Over the summer , employees across the country have 
been taking part in Race for Life events for Cancer Research 
UK and a National Three Peaks Challenge, and our fundraising 
will continue into the autumn with a gala charity ball and a wide 
range of commemorative charity Christmas products. 
Promoting literacy is a priority for us as a business. WH Smith 
PLC and the WHSmith Group Charitable Trust have supported 
the National Literacy Trust’s Young Readers Programme 
since 2005. Our partnership is now award-winning, having 
been recognised with a bronze award for Most Effective Long 
Term Programme at the Corporate Engagement Awards 2017. 
During 2016/17, we worked with the National Literacy Trust 
to develop a new three-year partnership, continuing our core 
support for the Young Readers Programme model, but also 
introducing ‘live literature’ events to bring children into direct 
contact with authors, storytellers and illustrators, with the 
objective of really bringing books to life and inspiring children to 
want to discover the world of books and reading. Over the year , 
the project has worked with 1,500 children in 24 primary schools 
across the UK, allowing them to choose more than 4,500 free 
new books to keep.
During autumn and winter 2016, WHSmith High Street 
stores worked in partnership with Save the Children to raise 
essential funds for children in need. WHSmith employees 
were proud to raise over £175,000 for Save the Children’s 
Christmas Jumper Day 2016. As well as selling Christmas 
cards, Christmas giftwrap and teddy bears, all in aid of Save 
the Children, WHSmith employees across the UK were 
champions of the charity’s Christmas Jumper Day campaign. 
A copy of our Community Engagement Policy is available at 
www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility/our_policies/.
The WHSmith Group Charitable Trust, an independent 
registered charity , actively supports employees that are involved 
with charitable organisations in their local communities, as 
well as working in partnership with the Group to support 
literacy projects. 28 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
EMPLOYEES 
The Group employs approximately 14,000 people, primarily 
in the UK, and is proud of its long history of being regarded 
as a responsible and respected employer . Information on 
our Employee policies is available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/
corporate_responsibility/our_policies/.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
The Board believes in creating throughout the Company 
a culture that is free from discrimination and harassment 
and will not permit or tolerate discrimination in any form. 
The Company gives full and fair consideration to applications 
for employment when these are received from disabled people 
and employs disabled people whenever suitable vacancies arise. 
Should an employee become disabled when working for the 
Company , we will endeavour to adapt the work environment 
and provide retraining if necessary so that they may continue 
their employment.
At WHSmith we believe that it is just as important to support our 
colleagues’ mental wellbeing as it is to look after their physical 
wellbeing. Our strategy is led from the most senior level in the 
business, with CEO Stephen Clarke signing the Time to Change 
pledge in February 2017. During the year , we have continued 
with our work to raise awareness of mental health issues and 
the associated stigma among employees, and work with Mental 
Health First Aid (MHFA) England to train our employees on how 
to support mental health in the workplace. This training is well 
underway and we are also working to ensure that our 1,100 line 
managers all receive mental health first aid training. At the 2017 
‘Worldpay Everywoman in Retail Ambassador’ Awards, we were 
delighted to see WHSmith Head of Strategic Projects, Alison 
Garbutt, receive an award for her work in driving change through 
our organisation around mental health.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Our Learning and Development (L&D) programmes are 
designed to support our employees to reach their potential 
within the business and their careers. As part of this, we focus 
on supporting and developing talented individuals within our 
business, with the objective of continuing to achieve a 90 per 
cent internal succession rate across the business. Our Retail 
Academy continues to support store staff in developing their 
skills and moving on to new roles, and targeted development 
programmes in head office helps to create a pipeline of talent to 
fill future vacancies. During the year , over 500 team leaders and 
supervisors and over 200 store managers attended our internal 
retail academy development programmes. In head office, we 
introduced a mentoring programme to support employees with 
their career development.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
Employee engagement is supported through clear 
communication of the Group’s performance and objectives. 
This information is cascaded through team briefings, employee 
events, intranet sites and e-newsletters. This approach and 
the Group’s open management style encourages employees 
to contribute to business development. We conduct annual 
employee engagement surveys and the results are shared with 
all staff and actions agreed to respond to specific points of 
feedback, with employee focus groups used to help understand 
the staff feedback in more depth.
EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP
The Company operates a HM Revenue & Customs Approved 
Save-As-you-Earn share option scheme (‘Sharesave Scheme’) 
which provides employees with the opportunity to acquire shares 
in the Company. Approximately 1,055 employees participate in 
the scheme.
DIVERSITY
WHSmith recognises that talented people are core to the 
success of our business, whatever their age, race, religion, 
gender , sexual orientation, age or physical ability. We are 
committed to promoting a culture of equality and diversity 
through our policies, procedures and working practices. 
We want to ensure that all our employees receive equal and 
fair treatment, and this applies to recruitment and selection, 
terms and conditions of employment, promotion, training and 
development opportunities and employment benefits.
During the year , we have implemented a number of initiatives to 
promote more women into senior positions. We have partnered 
with a company called ‘Everywoman’, the world’s largest 
network and learning and development platform for women 
in business. The aim of the network is to advance women in 
business and create a change in gender diversity. The network 
has been rolled out to our head office employees and a number 
of initiatives are planned for the next year to build on this and 
create an internal Everywoman network. WHSmith took part in 
the ‘Everywoman in Retail Ambassador’ awards programme and 
we were delighted to have a finalist in the category of ‘Being a 
great team leader .’

Corporate governance report 
INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIRMAN
The Board of the Company is committed to achieving the highest 
standards of corporate governance. As Chairman, my role is to 
run the Board to ensure that the Company operates effectively 
and ensure that the Board has the right balance of skills and 
experience to assess, manage and mitigate risks.
This report, which forms part of the Directors’ report, provides 
details of how the Company has applied the principles of, 
and complied with, the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 
(the ‘Code’). A copy of the Code is available publicly from 
www.frc.org.uk.
The information that is required by Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) 7.2 to be contained in the Company’s 
Corporate governance statement is included in this Corporate 
governance report, in the Directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 40 to 52 and in the Directors’ report on pages 53 to 55.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As at the date of this report, the Board comprised the Chairman, 
two executive directors and three independent non-executive 
directors. Short biographies of each of these directors, which 
illustrate their range of experience, are set out on page 39. 
There is a clear division of responsibility at the head of the 
Company; Henry Staunton (Chairman) being responsible for 
running the Board and Stephen Clarke (Group Chief Executive) 
being responsible for implementing strategy , leadership of the 
Company and managing it within the authorities delegated by 
the Board. Drummond Hall is the Senior Independent Director . 
The Board structure ensures that no individual or group 
dominates the decision-making process.
All the directors, whose biographies are on page 39, served 
during the financial year ended 31 August 2017 and up to the 
date of this report.
All of the non-executive directors who served during the year 
and up to the date of this report are considered by the Board 
to be independent. Drummond Hall was appointed as a non-
executive director in September 2008. He was appointed as the 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee in July 2009 and became 
the Senior Independent Director in September 2013. He began 
his tenth year as a director of the Company in September 2017. 
In light of the provisions of the Code, the Board has considered 
Drummond’s role and has concluded that Drummond Hall 
demonstrates independence and continues to give effective 
counsel. Drummond Hall has stood for annual re-election since 
2011 and will be standing again at the AGM in January 2018. 
Further information on the Board evaluation process can be 
found on pages 31 and 32 of this report.
Attendance at Board meetings
The Board met 10 times during the year . It is expected that all 
directors attend Board meetings, Committee meetings and 
the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) unless they are prevented 
from doing so by prior commitments. The minimum time 
commitment expected from the non-executive directors is 
one day per month attendance at meetings, together with 
attendance at the AGM, Board away days and site visits, plus 
adequate preparation time. Where directors are unable to attend 
meetings, they receive the papers for that meeting giving them 
the opportunity to raise any issues and give any comments to the 
Chairman in advance of the meeting. Following the meeting, the 
Chairman briefs any director not present on the discussions and 
any decisions taken at the meeting. The following table shows 
the number of Board meetings held during the year ended 
31 August 2017 and the attendance record of individual directors.

Stephen Clarke 10 of 10
Annemarie Durbin 10 of 10

Drummond Hall was unable to attend one meeting of the Board 
which was arranged whilst he was on holiday. He received 
the papers for the meeting and gave comments in advance of 
the meeting.
The Board has met twice since 31 August 2017 and all the 
directors attended both meetings.

Matters reserved for the Board 
The Board manages the Company through a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision, with its key focus being 
on creating long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
The significant matters reserved for its decision include: the 
overall management of the Company; approval of the business 
model and strategic plans including acquisitions and disposals; 
approval of the Company’s commercial strategy and operating 
and capital expenditure budgets; approval of the Annual report 
and financial statements, material agreements and non-
recurring projects; treasury and dividend policy; control, audit 
and risk management; executive remuneration; and corporate 
social responsibility.
The Board has a forward timetable of business to ensure 
that it allocates sufficient time to key areas. The timetable is 
flexible enough for items to be added to any particular agenda 
as necessary. The Board’s annual business includes Chief 
Executive’s reports, including business reports, financial results, 
strategy and strategy updates, including in-depth sessions 
on specific areas of the business and strategic initiatives, 
risk management, dividend policy , investor relations, health 
and safety , Board evaluation, governance and compliance, 
communications and the Annual report.
Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal control (including financial 
controls, controls in respect of the financial reporting process 
and operational and compliance controls) and has conducted a 
detailed review of its effectiveness during the year , to ensure that 
management has implemented its policies on risk and control. 
This review included receiving reports from management, 
discussion, challenge, and assessment of the principal risks. 
No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from 
this review. In addition, the Board also received presentations 
from management on higher risk areas, for example, cyber 
risk, risks arising from the process of exiting the European 
Union and growing international expansion. The Board has 
established an organisational structure with clearly defined 
lines of responsibility which identify matters requiring approval 
by the Board. Steps continue to be taken to embed internal 
control and risk management further into the operations of the 
business and to deal with areas that require improvement which 
come to the attention of management and the Board. Such a 
system is, however , designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing principal risks faced by the 
Group, including those risks relating to social, environmental 
and ethical matters. The Board confirms that the processes 
have been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of this report and that they accord with the FRC Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting (the ‘Risk Management and Internal Control 
Guidance’). The processes are regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group can be 
found in the Strategic report on pages 20 to 24.
Further information on internal controls and risk management 
can be found in the Audit Committee report on pages 33 to 36. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense in the furtherance of their 
duties. The Board receives appropriate and timely information, 
with Board and Committee papers normally being sent out 
a week before meetings take place. New directors receive 
induction training on joining the Board, which is tailored to meet 
their needs to learn about the business, its markets and risks 
and includes store visits and meetings with employees across 
the businesses and with external advisers. The need for director 
training is regularly assessed by the Board. 
Board evaluation
The performance of the Board, its Committees and its individual 
directors is a fundamental component of the Company’s 
success. The Board regularly reviews its own performance and 
carried out a formal evaluation in June 2017. The evaluation was 
conducted externally by Equity Communications Limited (‘Equity 
Communications’), which provides board evaluation services 
and has no other connection with the Company. The main areas 
considered during the evaluation were strategy , operations 
and risk; succession planning; Board composition; culture and 
Board Committees.
The findings of Equity Communications were presented to 
the Board in October 2017. The results of the assessment 
were considered by the Board, and confirmed the strength 
of the management of the Company , a sound governance 
framework and practices compliant with the Code. Additionally , 
the culture of the Board was found to be good, being very 
open and frank, whilst also supportive and collaborative. As a 
result of the review, the Board agreed an action plan that will 
be implemented in the financial year ending 31 August 2018 
and will include continuing to build relationships between 
members of the Board and key talent below Board level by , 
for example, the non-executive directors spending time with 
key management, additional measures to ensure maximum 
benefit is derived from the strategy session held each year and 
continuing to build on the Company’s succession plans for Board 
and key management. In addition to the Board and Committee 
evaluation process, the Group Chief Executive reviews the 
performance of the Chief Financial Officer/Chief Operating 
Officer (‘CFO/COO’) and other senior executives. The Chairman 
reviews the performance of the Group Chief Executive. 32 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
The Chairman also undertook a rigorous review with each of 
the non-executive directors to assess their effectiveness and 
commitment to the role. The Board has also scrutinised the 
factors relevant to the determination of the independence of 
Drummond Hall given that he has been a director for nine 
years. The Board considers his continued membership of 
the Board is in the best interests of the Company and, having 
given careful consideration to the matter , the Board is satisfied 
that Drummond continues to demonstrate the qualities of 
independence in carrying out his role as a non-executive director 
and Senior Independent Director . The Board considers that 
he continues to be independent in character and judgement 
and that there are no relationships or circumstances which 
are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, his judgement. 
Drummond has stood for re-election annually and on each 
occasion has been re-elected by shareholders. The Board will 
continue to keep his independence under review. During the 
year , the Chairman had regular meetings with the non-executive 
directors, without the executive directors present, to discuss 
Board issues and how to maintain the best possible team. 
The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors 
commits sufficient time to the business of the Company and 
contributes to its governance and operations. The Senior 
Independent Director met the other non-executive directors 
to assess the Chairman’s performance taking into account 
the views of the executive directors and they concluded that 
Henry Staunton continues to be an effective Chairman and 
demonstrates his commitment to the role. 
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, directors are 
required to retire and submit themselves for re-election 
every three years and new directors appointed by the Board 
offer themselves for election at the next AGM following their 
appointment. However , in accordance with the Code, the Board 
has agreed that all directors will stand for re-election at the AGM 
to be held on 24 January 2018. At the last AGM on 25 January 
2017, all the directors stood for re-election and were duly elected 
with a range of 93.68 per cent to 99.61 per cent of votes cast 
by shareholders. Biographies of all the directors are set out on 
page 39 of this Annual report and are also available for viewing 
on the Company’s website, www.whsmithplc.co.uk. 
The Company’s Articles of Association give a power to the 
Board to appoint directors and, where notice is given and signed 
by all the other directors, to remove a director from office. 
The Company’s Articles of Association themselves may be 
amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
The interests of the directors and their immediate families in 
the share capital of the Company , along with details of directors’ 
share awards, are contained in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 40 to 52.
At no time during the year did any of the directors have a 
material interest in any significant contract with the Company or 
any of its subsidiaries.
Board Committees
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to the Board 
Committees, being the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees. Details of the role and responsibilities of the Audit 
Committee can be found on pages 33 to 36, the Nominations 
Committee on page 37 and the Remuneration Committee 
on pages 40 to 52. The role and responsibilities of each 
Committee are set out in formal terms of reference which are 
available on the Company’s website, www.whsmithplc.co.uk. 
In addition, following the implementation of the EU Market 
Abuse Regulation (MAR) in July 2016, the Board established 
a Disclosure Committee which is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the Company’s obligations under MAR. 
Succession planning and culture
During the year ahead, the Board will continue to focus on 
succession planning to ensure the readiness of internal 
candidates for all key roles across the business. The Board 
is committed to good governance, culture and leadership, 
recognising that these are key considerations for a strong 
sustainable business and that the tone comes from the top. 
Our business model on pages 4 and 5 outlines the importance 
of having the right people and skills, and operating responsibly. 
The Company’s values, behaviours and culture will continue 
to form an important part of the Board’s discussions. 
The Nominations Committee will continue to support the 
Board by ensuring that culture is built into recruitment and 
succession considerations.
The Board recognises the importance of being visible and 
accessible to customers and employees. The non-executive 
directors are encouraged to accompany management on site 
visits to the High Street and Travel stores. The Board believes 
that site visits provide directors with valuable insights into the 
business, helping to deepen their knowledge and understanding 
of the Company.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
As Chair of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present my 
report on the activities of the Audit Committee for the financial 
year ended 31 August 2017. Our principal objectives are to

LONG-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT AND 
GOING CONCERN
The Committee reviewed the process and assessment of the 
Company’s prospects made by management, including:
• the review period and alignment with the Company’s 
internal forecasts;
• the assessment of the capacity of the Company to remain 
viable after consideration of future cash flows, borrowings 
and mitigating factors; and
• the modelling of the financial impact of certain of the 
Company’s principal risks materialising using severe but 
plausible scenarios.
The Committee reviewed management’s analysis supporting 
the going concern basis of preparation including reviewing 
the Company’s financial performance, budgets for 2017/18 
and cash flow projections. As a result of the assessment, the 
Committee reported to the Board that the going concern basis of 
preparation remained appropriate. The going concern statement 
is set out in the Directors’ report on page 55.
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL REPORTING ISSUES
In preparing the accounts, there are a number of areas 
requiring the exercise by management of particular judgement. 
The Committee’s role is to assess whether the judgements 
made by management are reasonable and appropriate. In order 
to assist in this evaluation, the CFO/COO presents an accounting 
paper to the Committee twice a year , setting out the key financial 
reporting judgements, and other papers as required. The main 
areas of judgement that have been considered by the Committee 
in the preparation of the financial statements are as follows:
Accounting for inventory
The Committee considered the judgements made by 
management and a paper from the external Auditor regarding 
the valuation of inventory , with specific consideration given to 
inventory provisioning, including provision for slow moving or 
obsolete stock. The Committee is satisfied that the process 
adopted by management for the valuation of inventory is 
sufficiently robust to establish the value of inventory held 
and is satisfied as to the appropriateness of the Company’s 
provisioning policy.
Recognition of supplier income
Supplier Income recognition remains a focus for the 
Committee. The Committee considered, and reviewed in 
detail, management’s paper which set out the nature and 
value of these arrangements and the policy for recognition 
in the financial statements. The Committee is satisfied with 
management’s conclusion that the level of complexity and 
judgement is low in relation to establishing the accounting 
entries and estimates, and the timing of recognition. 
The Committee also considered the disclosure included by 
management in the Annual report and accounts.
Pensions
The Committee assessed the accounting treatment adopted by 
management and the application of IAS 19 (revised) in relation to 
the WH Smith defined benefit pension scheme. The Committee 
considered the current guidance and requirements in respect of 
pensions accounting, reviewed the judgements made in respect 
of the assumptions used in the valuation of the Company’s 
obligations under the scheme and the recognition of future 
liabilities in respect of committed scheme contributions on the 
balance sheet. 
Impairment review of store assets
The Committee considered the judgements made by 
management in respect of the Group’s store assets given that 
sales and cost pressures may adversely impact the recoverable 
value of assets used within the store portfolio. The Committee 
noted that management had considered the trading results 
of each store for the year and noted that where a store is loss 
making and is not expected to return to profitability in the near 
future, an impairment charge is recognised over the assets that 
cannot be recycled within the store portfolio. The Committee 
was satisfied that the approach adopted by management was 
sufficiently robust to identify when an impairment charge of 
store assets needs to be recognised.
Property transactions and provisions
The Committee considered the nature of property transactions 
undertaken by the Company in the year and reviewed the 
Company’s obligations and provisions for the cost of onerous 
property leases, including lease obligations, in respect of 
discontinued operations. 
Each of the above areas of judgement has been identified 
as an area of focus and therefore the Committee has also 
reviewed detailed reporting from the external Auditor on the 
relevant issues.
FRC Corporate Reporting Review – franchise and 
concession agreements
The FRC Corporate Reporting Review team wrote to the 
Company on 31 May 2017 after reviewing the Annual report 
and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2016. The Company 
was asked to provide further information in respect of the 
accounting treatment of franchise and concession agreements 
and related disclosures in the accounts. The Committee, after 
consideration, approved the Company’s response to the FRC.
Following the Company’s response and provision of information, 
the Review team confirmed on 24 July 2017 that the matter had 
been concluded satisfactorily and that no action was required. 
The FRC review is conducted by staff of the FRC who have an 
understanding of the relevant legal and accounting framework 
in which we operate and is based on the Annual report and 
accounts. The FRC staff do not have detailed knowledge of the 
Company or an understanding of the underlying transactions 
entered into by it. Accordingly , the FRC’s role is not to verify the 
information provided but to consider compliance with reporting 
requirements. The FRC’s letters are written on the basis that 
it does not accept any liability for reliance on them by the 
Company or any third party , including but not limited to investors 
and shareholders.

Fair , balanced and understandable assessment
At the request of the Board, the Committee has considered 
whether , in its opinion, the 2017 Annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and understandable and that 
it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy. The Committee was assisted in its review by a number 
of processes, including the following:
• the Annual report and accounts is drafted by senior 
management with overall co-ordination by a member of 
the Group Finance team to ensure consistency across the 
relevant sections;
• an internal verification process is undertaken to ensure 
factual accuracy;
• an independent review is undertaken by the Director of 
Audit and Risk to assess whether the Annual report and 
accounts is fair , balanced and understandable using a set of 
pre-defined indicators (such as consistency with internally 
reported information and investor communications); 
• comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Annual report and 
accounts are undertaken by the executive directors and other 
senior management;
• an advanced draft is reviewed by the Board and the 
Company’s Legal Director and, in relation to certain sections, 
by external legal advisers; and
• the final draft of the Annual report and accounts was 
reviewed by the Committee prior to consideration by 
the Board.
Following its review, the Committee advised the Board that the 
Annual report and accounts taken as a whole was considered 
to be fair , balanced and understandable and that it provided 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Committee monitors and regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management processes and internal 
financial and non-financial controls. The key features of the risk 
management process that were in place during the year are 
as follows:
• each business conducts risk assessments based on identified 
business objectives, which are reviewed and agreed annually 
by the executive management of each business. Risks are 
considered in respect of strategy , reputation, operations, 
financial and compliance and are evaluated in respect of their 
potential impact and likelihood. These risk assessments 
are updated and reviewed quarterly and are reported to 
the Committee;
• a Group risk assessment is also undertaken by the Internal 
Audit team, which considers all areas of potential risk across 
all systems, functions and key business processes. This risk 
assessment, together with the business risk assessments, 
forms the basis for determining the Internal Audit Plan. 
Audit reports in relation to areas reviewed are discussed and 
agreed with the Committee;
• the Internal Audit team meets annually with all senior 
executives, to undertake a formal review and certification 
process in assessing the effectiveness of the internal controls 
across the Group. The results of this review are reported to 
the Committee;
• the Committee confirmed to the Board that it has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the systems of internal control, including 
financial, operational, and compliance controls and risk 
management for the period of this report, in accordance 
with the Code and the Risk Management and Internal 
Control Guidance;
• the Board is responsible for approving the annual budget 
and the three-year plan, for approving major acquisitions 
and disposals and for determining the financial structure 
of the Company , including treasury and dividend policy. 
Monthly results, variances from plan and forecasts are 
reported to the Board;
• the Committee assists the Board in the discharge of 
its duties regarding the Group’s financial statements, 
accounting policies and the maintenance of proper internal 
business, operational and financial controls. The Committee 
invites input and attendance from members of the senior 
management team of the Group at its meetings to discuss 
the design and operation of key business and internal 
controls and the assessment of risks that affect the Group. 
The Committee provides a link between the Board and the 
external Auditor through regular meetings;
• the Internal Audit team advises and assists management 
in the establishment and maintenance of adequate internal 
controls and reports to the Committee on the effectiveness of 
those controls;
• there is a comprehensive system for budgeting and planning 
and for monitoring and reporting the performance of the 
Company’s business to the Board. Monthly results are 
reported against budget and prior year , and forecasts for the 
current financial year are regularly revised in light of actual 
performance. These results and forecasts cover profits, cash 
flows, capital expenditure and balance sheets;
• routine reports are prepared to cover treasury activities and 
risks, for review by senior executives, and annual reports are 
prepared for the Board and Committee covering tax, treasury 
policies, insurance and pensions;
• a corporate responsibility strategy was approved by 
the Board, including objectives and targets to address 
the impact that our activities have on the environment, 
workplace, marketplace and community. More detailed 
information is available in our full CR report, available at 
www.whsmithplc.co.uk/cr; and
• the Board is committed to maintaining high standards 
of health and safety in all its business activities. 
These standards are set out in the Company’s Health and 
Safety Policy , which is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
A copy of our Health and Safety policy is available at 
www.whsmithplc.co.uk/cr . The Risk Management team 
works with the business to assess health and safety risks and 
introduce systems to mitigate them. All reportable accidents 
are investigated and targets are set to reduce the level 
of incidence.
The Director of Audit and Risk attends the meetings of the 
Committee to discuss the above matters. 36 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
During the year the external Auditor reported to the Committee 
on their independence from the Company. The Committee 
and the Board are satisfied that PwC has adequate policies 
and safeguards in place to ensure that auditor objectivity 
and independence are maintained. The Committee has 
recommended to the Board the re-appointment of the external 
Auditor for the 2018 financial year and the directors will 
be proposing the re-appointment of PwC at the 2018 AGM. 
PwC were first appointed as auditor at the 2015 AGM, following 
a competitive tender process completed in 2014. The Committee 
will continue to review the external Auditor’s appointment and 
the need to tender the audit in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation. 
In line with our terms of reference, the Committee undertook 
a thorough assessment of the quality , effectiveness, value and 
independence of the 2016 year-end audit provided by PwC. 
The Director of Audit and Risk prepared a questionnaire seeking 
the views and feedback of the Board, together with those of 
Group and divisional management and it formed the basis of 
further discussion with respondents. The findings of the survey 
were considered by the Committee.
The Committee has a formal policy on the Company’s 
relationship with its external Auditor in respect of non-audit 
work to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are 
maintained. The policy is reviewed annually by the Committee 
and was updated during the year following the introduction 
of the FRC Revised Ethical Standard 2016. The majority of 
non-audit work undertaken by PwC in 2016/17 related to the 
interim review, non-audit and tax advice. The Auditor may only 
provide such services if such advice does not conflict with their 
statutory responsibilities and ethical guidance. As Chair of the 
Audit Committee, my approval is required before the Company 
uses non-audit services as specifically set out in the policy , or if 
the fees exceed £25,000 per matter . The Committee is satisfied 
that the Company was compliant during the year with both the 
updated Code and the FRC’s Ethical and Auditing Standards 
in respect of the scope and maximum level of permitted fees 
incurred for non-audit services provided by PwC. For the 
financial year ended 31 August 2017 the non-audit fees paid 
to PwC were £105,655 and the audit fees payable to PwC were 
£297,291.
The Company has complied during the financial year under 
review, and up to the date of this report, with the provisions 
of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
I will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any 
questions about the work of the Committee.

discussed at the meetings were succession planning for Board

excellent, being very open and collaborative.

ANNUAL STATEMENT FROM THE REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE CHAIR
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the financial year ended 31 August 2017 which is in line 
with the Company’s approved remuneration policy. The 2016 
remuneration report was supported by 95.9 per cent of our 
shareholders at our AGM in 2017 which, we believe, indicates 
that our arrangements continue to have the support of 
our shareholders. 
The other members of the Committee are Suzanne Baxter , 
Annemarie Durbin and Henry Staunton. At the invitation of the 
Committee, the Group Chief Executive and representatives of 
the Committee’s external independent remuneration adviser 
regularly attend meetings.
The Committee met 5 times during the year . All Committee 
members are expected to attend meetings. The following table 
shows the number of meetings held during the year ended 
31 August 2017 and the attendance record of individual directors.

KEY DECISIONS AND CHANGES
The key decisions and changes made by the Committee 
during the financial year ended 31 August 2017 are highlighted 
as follows:
• The Committee decided that the CEO and CFO/COO should 
not receive a salary increase in the financial year ended 
31 August 2017. There was a general annual pay rise of two 
per cent for all other head office employees which took effect 
from 1 April 2017.
• Approving the 2016 Directors’ remuneration report.
• Approving the performance targets for the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and annual bonus plan.
• Approving the payout under the LTIP and bonus plan.
• The Committee considered the gender pay gap 
reporting requirements. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 41
OUTCOME 2016/17
The Group delivered another good performance during the 
year . The Travel and High Street businesses remain highly cash 
generative and continue to deliver good profit growth with profit 
before tax increasing by seven per cent to £140m. As a result of 
this good performance, the Company has increased diluted EPS 
by ten per cent to 103.6p per share and dividends by ten per cent 
to 48.2p per share. Further information regarding the Company’s 
performance during the year can be found in the Strategic report 
on pages 1 to 29.
The Company’s good performance and their individual 
performance has resulted in Stephen Clarke and Robert 
Moorhead receiving bonus payments of £865,700 and 
£479,042 respectively.
The 2014 LTIP vesting percentage is determined by the growth 
in the Company’s EPS, relative dividend growth and TSR over 
the three-year performance period which ended on 31 August 
2017. The Company substantially met the performance targets 
for the 2014 LTIP as the Company’s EPS increased by 33.3 per 
cent during the performance period, the Company’s relative 
dividend growth ranked between six and seven out of 23 
companies in the comparator group and the Company’s TSR 
ranked between 4 and 5 out of 26 companies in the comparator 
group. The 2014 Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) vesting percentage 
is determined by the growth in the Company’s EPS over the 
three-year performance period which ended on 31 August 2017. 
The Company partially met the performance target for the 
2014 CIP .
I will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any 
questions about the work of the Committee.

Both executive directors were members of the Company’s defined contribution scheme and received a total 
benefit equivalent to 25 per cent of base salary. During the financial year ended 31 August 2017, Stephen 
Clarke received a pension contribution equal to 1 per cent of his base salary with the balance being received 
as a salary supplement. Robert Moorhead received all of his pension contribution as a salary supplement 
after applying for fixed protection. Part of the amount otherwise paid to the Company’s defined contribution 
scheme was reduced to reflect the requirement to pay employers’ National Insurance.
Annual bonus The bonus payable for the financial year ended 31 August 2017 in respect of Stephen Clarke and Robert 
Moorhead was £865,700 and £479,042 respectively.
The bonus is primarily assessed against a sliding scale target of profit before tax and is then moderated (on a 
downwards only basis) by reference to the achievement of personal objectives.
The target range for the year ended 31 August 2017 is set out on page 45.
Long-term incentives Annual L TIP awards were set at the policy level (335 per cent for Stephen Clarke and 310 per cent for Robert 
Moorhead).
The terms of and the performance measures applicable to the L TIP awards made in the financial year ended 
31 August 2017 are described on page 46.
Vesting of L TIP awards is determined based on the following measures: 60 per cent is based on EPS growth 
and 40 per cent is based on relative TSR. The performance period is three years.
The Committee approved these performance measures as they are directly linked to the objectives set 
out in the Group’s strategy; there is a direct link with shareholder value and there is a clear line of sight for 
participants between performance and reward.
Shareholding guidelines Stephen Clarke was required to hold 300 per cent of salary in shares and Robert Moorhead was required to 
hold 250 per cent of salary in shares. The directors have met their required holding as at 31 August 2017, with 
Stephen Clarke holding 235,408 shares with a value of £4,352,694 (approximately 790 per cent of salary) and 
Robert Moorhead holding 252,676 shares with a value of £4,671,979 (approximately 1,250 per cent of salary).

2.3 IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDING 31 AUGUST 2018
The Committee is not proposing any changes to the remuneration policy , which was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM 
on 27 January 2016, during the financial year ending 31 August 2018. It is envisaged that the policy in respect of the executive directors 
will be applied as follows:
Element of pay Implementation of policy
Base salary Stephen Clarke and Robert Moorhead will be eligible, in line with other head office staff, for any increase in 
salary following the March 2018 review.
Benefits No changes are expected to be made to these elements of remuneration within the financial year ending 
31 August 2018.
Pension No changes are expected to be made to these elements of remuneration within the financial year ending 
31 August 2018.
Annual bonus The bonus opportunity remains unchanged and the bonus metrics will again be based on a matrix of 
financial and personal performance with the financial performance measure being profit before tax for the 
financial year ending 31 August 2018.
Long-term incentives Annual L TIP awards will again be set at the policy level (335 per cent of salary for Stephen Clarke and 310 per 
cent for Robert Moorhead).
Vesting of L TIP awards is determined based on the following two measures: 60 per cent is based on EPS 
growth and 40 per cent is based on relative TSR. The proportion of shares vesting for threshold performance 
is 25 per cent. The EPS performance targets will again be 25 per cent for EPS growth of 5 per cent per 
annum to 100 per cent for EPS growth of 10 per cent per annum.
Shareholding guidelines Stephen Clarke is required to hold 300 per cent of salary in shares and Robert Moorhead is required to hold 
250 per cent of salary in shares.
Non-executive directors The fees of the Chairman and non-executive directors will be subject to a review in March 2018.

2.8 ASSESSING PAY AND PERFORMANCE
Total shareholder return performance since 31 August 2009 
a)  The graph illustrates the TSR performance on a cumulative basis (with dividends reinvested) as at the end of each of the last eight financial years compared with the FTSE All Share General 
Retailers Index (the ‘Index’) over the same period.
b) The Company is a member of the Index and, as such, this sector was considered to be the most appropriate comparator group upon which a broad equity market index is calculated.
The table below summarises the CEO’s remuneration and how the Company’s variable pay plans have paid out over the past eight 
years. It can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period which indicates a TSR for the Company of 451 
per cent, compared with a TSR for the Index of 91 per cent. This demonstrates consistently superior performance in line with the 
achievements under the variable pay plans.

2.11 ANNUAL BONUS TARGETS (AUDITED)
Bonuses for the financial year ended 31 August 2017 were earned according to the following scale (as a percentage of each executive’s 
respective maximum):
Financial performance against profit 
before tax (PBT) target
Role  
Model Outstanding Strong Developing
Under  
Achiever
Max:£140.45m 100% 80% 60% 40% 0%

Threshold:£127.2m 40% 32% 24% 16% 0%
Interpolation between points in the matrix is permitted.
The Company’s PBT for the financial year ended 31 August 2017 was £140m. For Stephen Clarke, his personal rating is based on 
a range of objectives including the development of the talent and succession pipeline to meet the future needs of the business; 
employee engagement and well-being at work; new format development and international expansion. Following the successful 
achievement of all of his key personal objectives, the Committee determined that no downwards adjustment was appropriate and, 
therefore, Stephen Clarke will receive an unadjusted bonus payment reflecting the financial performance in the year of £865,700. 
For Robert Moorhead, his personal rating is based on a range of objectives including achievement of financial targets; development 
of a high performing executive team; developing Funky Pigeon; managing pensions and management of cyber risk. Following the 
successful achievement of all of his key personal objectives, the Committee also determined that no downwards adjustment was 
appropriate and, therefore, Robert Moorhead will receive an unadjusted bonus payment reflecting the financial performance in the 
year of £479,042.
For the annual bonus plan for the financial year ending 31 August 2018, the bonus metrics will also be based on a similar matrix of 
financial and personal performance with the financial performance measure again being profit before tax. The Committee will publish 
the targets for that financial year in next year’s report and, consistent with market practice, has elected not to pre-disclose them (or 
give numerical personal objectives) on the basis of commercial sensitivity. 46 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
2.12 SHARE PLANS (AUDITED)
The performance conditions for awards granted under the Company’s long-term incentive plans in the financial year ended 31 August 
2017 were as follows:
WH SMITH LTIP
As reported last year , the performance conditions, which apply over the three years, commencing with the financial year of grant (the 
‘Performance Period’), were as follows:
a) 60 per cent based on growth in the adjusted diluted EPS of the Company. Vesting will occur on the following basis:
Annual rate of growth in adjusted diluted EPS of the Company  
(compounded annually) over the Performance Period Proportion exercisable
Below 5% Zero
5% 25%
10% or more 100%
Between 5% and 10% On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
For these purposes, EPS will continue to be determined by reference to fully diluted EPS before exceptional items and will exclude IAS 
19 pension charges from the calculation, adjusted as considered appropriate by the Committee to ensure consistency. The Company 
has, as an inherent part of its corporate strategy and its rigorous capital allocation discipline, undertaken share buybacks and the 
Committee assumed a level of such buy-backs consistent with its established approach in setting the above target range.
b)  40 per cent based on the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index constituents. Vesting will 
occur on the following basis:
TSR performance ranking at end of the Performance Period Proportion exercisable
Below median Zero
Median 25%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
It is envisaged that the grants to be made in 2017 will be subject to the same performance targets. 
FIT independently carries out the relevant TSR growth calculation for the Company.

a) The CIP is a legacy plan under which no further grants will be made.
b)  The number of shares subject to awards is the maximum (100 per cent) number of shares that could be received by the executive if the performance targets are fully met except that, in 
respect of awards granted from October 2016 onwards, consistent with market practice, any part of the awards which vest will benefit from the accrual of dividend roll-up.
c) I n respect of the award granted on 17 October 2013 under the CIP held by Stephen Clarke, 79,882 shares vested. The value of the 79,882 shares on the date of vesting was £1,235,507.18 
(1546.67p per ordinary share).
d)  In respect of the award granted on 17 October 2013 under the CIP held by Robert Moorhead, 51,923 shares vested. The value of the 51,923 shares on the date of vesting was £803,075.03 
(1546.67p per ordinary share).
e)  In respect of the award granted on 17 October 2013 under the LTIP held by Stephen Clarke, 104,752 shares vested and 1,757 shares lapsed. The value of the 104,752 shares on the date of 
vesting was £1,620,162.84 (1546.67p per ordinary share).
f)  In respect of the award granted on 17 October 2013 under the LTIP held by Robert Moorhead, 78,564 shares vested and 1,318 shares lapsed. The value of the 78,564 shares on the date of 
vesting was £1,215,122.13 (1546.67p per ordinary share).
g) The aggregate value of shares which vested and were received by the executive directors under the CIP and LTIP during the financial year ended 31 August 2017 was £4,873,867.18.
h) The performance conditions for awards granted in the financial year ended 31 August 2015 under the LTIP are:
 (i)    40 per cent based on the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index constituents. Vesting will occur on the following basis: Below median - Nil; 
Median - 30%; Upper quartile - 100%; and on a straight-line basis between 30% and 100%;
 (ii)   30 per cent based on growth in the adjusted diluted EPS of the Company. Vesting will occur on the following basis: Below 7% - Nil; 7% - 30%; 12% or more - 100%; and on a straight-line 
basis between 30% and 100%. For these purposes, EPS will be determined by reference to fully diluted EPS before exceptional items and will exclude IAS 19 pension charges from the 
calculation, adjusted as considered appropriate by the Committee to ensure consistency; and
 (iii)  30 per cent based on the Company’s dividend growth against the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index and the FTSE Food and Drugs Retailers Index constituents. Vesting will occur 
on the following basis: Below median - Nil; Median - 30%; Upper quartile - 100%; and on a straight-line basis between 30% and 100%. For these purposes, the percentage increase in 
the Company’s dividends (in pence) paid in respect of the year to 31 August 2014 will be compared with the equivalent dividends paid in respect of the financial year ending three years 
later and the percentage increase compared and ranked with dividends paid by the same companies. The Committee has discretion to assess whether a company’s dividend is paid 
otherwise than out of operating profits, or otherwise than supported by its normal levels of cover, and therefore should be excluded. The Committee will report any material adjustments 
in subsequent Remuneration Reports.
  The performance conditions were substantially met with 89.7 per cent of the shares subject to the awards vesting. The Committee confirmed it was satisfied that the Company’s TSR was 
reflective of its underlying financial performance and that nothing occurred to negatively impact the performance achieved during the performance period.
i)  The performance condition for matching awards granted in the financial year ended 31 August 2015 under the CIP are based on growth in the adjusted diluted EPS of the Company. Vesting 
will occur on the following basis: Below 7% - Nil; 7% - 25%; 12% or more - 100%; and on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%. Following the 2015 remuneration review, no future 
awards will be made to executives under the CIP. The performance condition was partially met with 70 per cent of the shares subject to the awards vesting.
j) No awards have been granted to directors or have vested between 1 September 2017 and 12 October 2017.
k)  The awards granted in the financial year ended 31 August 2016 under the LTIP will only vest to the extent that the performance targets as set out in Note (h) above are satisfied. The awards 
granted in the financial year ended 31 August 2017 under the LTIP will only vest to the extent that the performance targets as set out on page 46 are satisfied. Matching awards granted in 
the financial year ended 31 August 2016 under the CIP will only vest to the extent that the performance targets as set out in Note (i) above are satisfied and related investment shares are 
held until the end of the performance period. 48 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
2.13 WH SMITH EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
The WH Smith Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Trust’) is used to facilitate the acquisition of ordinary shares in the Company to satisfy 
awards granted under the Company’s share plans. The Trust is a discretionary trust, the sole beneficiaries being employees (including 
executive directors) and former employees of the Group and their close relations. The Trustee is Computershare Trustees (C.I.) 
Limited, an independent professional trustee company based in Jersey. The Company intends that the ordinary shares in the Trust 
will be used to satisfy all outstanding awards and options made under the Company’s share plans. The Trustee may exercise all 
rights attached to the shares held in the Trust in accordance with their fiduciary duties and the relevant plan rules or other governing 
documents. The Trustee has agreed to waive its rights to all dividends payable on the ordinary shares held in the Trust.

Trust at 31 August 2017 was 673,726. The Group’s accounting policy with respect to the Trust is detailed within Note 1 of the financial 
statements and movements are detailed in the Group statement of changes in equity on page 68.
2.14 DILUTION LIMITS
Awards under the CIP and LTIP are currently satisfied using market purchase shares which may be acquired by the EBT as described 
above. WH Smith’s share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution limits, and the Company has always operated within 
these limits.
2.15 EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Each executive director may accept up to two non-executive directorships provided they are not both appointments to companies in 
the FTSE 100 or include a chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company. Non-executive directorships must not conflict with the interests of 
the Company. Executive directors may retain fees from one of their external directorships. Neither of the executive directors currently 
holds any external appointments.

2.19 REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES
Our employees are a key component of the Company’s performance and our overall reward strategy aims to support this. 
When considering remuneration arrangements for executive directors and senior management, the Committee takes into account the 
pay and conditions of employees across the Group.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees on remuneration policy but the Committee receives updates on pay and 
conditions, including the impact of flexible working conditions/family friendly policies. Employees are invited to participate in the 
annual Engagement Survey where their views on all aspects of working conditions can be collected and shared with the Committee 
and the Board. The Company is proud of its long history of being regarded as a responsible and respected employer and regularly 
reviews the overall structure of pay practices across the Group and the wider retail sector to ensure it remains competitive and is able 
to retain and attract employees.
All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits, including pension and staff discount. Eligible employees are able to participate 
in the Company’s Sharesave plan and thereby become shareholders in the Company.
Participation in a pension plan is offered to all employees on a contributory basis and following auto-enrolment, we now have over 
6,300 employees in our pension plans. 50 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
3. THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY: EXTRACT
The Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 January 2016 and applies 
from that date. The Remuneration Policy table is set out below for information only. The full Directors’ remuneration policy is set 
out on pages 37 to 44 of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts which is available in the investor relations section of the Company’s 
website: www.whsmithplc.co.uk/investors.
3.1 Remuneration Policy Table - executive directors
The following table explains the different elements of remuneration we pay to our executive directors:
Element and purpose Policy and opportunity Operation and performance measures
Base salary
This is the basic element 
of pay and reflects the 
individual’s role and 
position within the Group 
with some adjustment to 
reflect their capability and 
contribution. Base salary is 
used to attract and retain 
executives who can deliver 
our strategic objectives and 
create shareholder value.
• While base salaries are reviewed each year , 
the Company’s policy is not automatically 
to award an inflationary increase. 
When reviewing salaries, the Committee takes 
into account a range of factors including the 
Group’s performance, market conditions, the 
prevailing market rates for similar positions in 
comparable companies, the responsibilities, 
individual performance and experience of 
each executive director and the level of salary 
increases awarded to employees throughout 
the Group.
• Base salaries are benchmarked against 
both FTSE 250 companies and other leading 
retailers. While the Committee applies 
judgement rather than setting salaries by 
reference to a fixed percentile position, its 
general approach is to constrain base salaries 
to a median or lower level.
• While the Committee’s general approach is to 
keep salaries to a relatively low level, and, in 
the normal course, would not expect salary 
increases to be higher than the average for 
other head office staff, given the need for a 
formal cap, the Committee has limited the 
maximum salary which it may award to 110 
per cent of the median of salaries of CEO’s 
in the top half of FTSE 250 companies even 
though, in practice, the Committee would 
normally seek to keep it below the median of 
this benchmark.
• Base salary is paid monthly in cash.
• Base salaries are reviewed annually with any 
changes normally taking effect from 1 April. 
Following the March 2017 salary review, 
Stephen Clarke and Robert Moorhead did not 
receive any annual increase in April 2017.
Benefits
To provide other benefits 
valued by the recipient which 
assist them in carrying 
out their duties effectively. 
Competitive benefits 
assist in attracting and 
retaining executives.
• Provide market competitive benefits in kind.
• The Company may periodically amend the 
benefits available to staff. The executive 
directors would normally be eligible to receive 
such amended benefits on similar terms to all 
senior staff.
• During the policy period the value of benefits 
(other than relocation costs) paid to an executive 
director in any year will not exceed £80,000. 
In addition, the Committee reserves the right to 
pay relocation costs in any year or any ongoing 
costs incurred as a result of such relocation to 
an executive director if considered appropriate to 
secure the better performance by an executive 
director of their duties.
• Benefits received by executive directors 
comprise a car allowance, staff discount, private 
medical insurance and life assurance.
• While the Committee does not consider it to 
form part of benefits in the normal usage of 
that term, it has been advised that corporate 
hospitality (whether paid for by the Company 
or another) and business travel for directors 
may technically come within the applicable 
rules and so the Committee expressly reserves 
the right to authorise such activities within its 
agreed policies.

Element and purpose Policy and opportunity Operation and performance measures
Pension
To aid retention and remain 
competitive within the 
marketplace. The pension 
provides an income 
following retirement.
• Provide a competitive employer-sponsored 
pension plan or equivalent cash allowance 
with a total value of up to 25 per cent of 
base salary.
• All executive directors are eligible to 
participate in the Company’s defined 
contribution pension plan and/or receive a 
salary supplement in lieu (which is not taken 
into account as salary for calculation of bonus, 
LTIP/CIP or other benefits).
• Although the mix may change, currently five 
per cent of salary is paid into a registered 
pension and 20 per cent by way of a salary 
supplement. If the individual elects to receive 
the five per cent direct (e.g. to avoid breaching 
HMRC limits), employers’ NICs are deducted 
from that element.
Annual bonus
To motivate employees 
and incentivise 
delivery of annual 
performance targets.
• During the policy period the bonus potential 
is 160 per cent of base salary for Stephen 
Clarke (or any replacement) and 130 per cent 
of base salary for Robert Moorhead (or any 
other executive director), with target levels at 
48 per cent of their respective maxima and 
threshold bonus levels at 16 per cent of their 
respective maxima.
• Clawback provisions apply to the annual 
bonus plan.
• Bonuses are all currently paid in cash in 
one tranche although the Committee has 
discretion to defer part of the bonus (either in 
cash or shares).
• The performance measures applied may 
be financial or non-financial and corporate, 
divisional or individual and in such proportions 
as the Committee considers appropriate.
• The appropriateness of performance 
measures is reviewed annually to ensure they 
continue to support the Company’s strategy.
• Once set, performance measures and targets 
will generally remain unaltered unless events 
occur which, in the Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate to make adjustments to 
ensure they operate as originally intended 
and to take account of events which were not 
foreseen when the performance targets were 
originally set.
Long-term incentives
To motivate and incentivise 
delivery of sustained 
performance over the 
long-term, the Group will 
operate the new Long-
Term Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’). Awards delivered 
in shares to provide 
further alignment 
with shareholders.
• The policy is to award executive directors 
with shares with an initial face value of up to 
350 per cent of base salary each year under 
the LTIP .
• In practice awards of 335 per cent are 
envisaged for the CEO and 310 per cent for 
any other executive director .
• The LTIP will credit participants with the 
benefit of accrual for dividends paid over the 
performance and any holding period.
• Malus and Clawback provisions (in respect of 
both unvested and vested paid awards) apply 
to the LTIP .
• Awards are subject to holding periods 
preventing the delivery and sale of shares 
until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. 
For awards made in October 2017 the holding 
period will apply to 50 per cent of any shares 
which vest in order to transition the pay-out 
schedule from the current basis.
• Legacy awards under the previous LTIP 
and the Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) will be 
honoured although no further awards will be 
made after the adoption of this new policy.
• The Committee may set such performance 
conditions as it considers appropriate 
(whether financial or non-financial and 
whether corporate, divisional or individual) 
over a period of at least three financial years.
• Once set, performance measures and targets 
will generally remain unaltered unless events 
occur which, in the Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate to make adjustments to 
the performance conditions, provided that 
any adjusted performance condition is, in 
its opinion, neither materially more nor less 
difficult to satisfy than the original condition.
• Executive directors can earn a minimum 
of 25 per cent of the award for threshold 
performance. Although not currently 
envisaged, the Committee has the right to 
lengthen the performance period or to make 
similar additional changes, not to the benefit 
of participants.
• The Company will honour the vesting of all 
outstanding awards in accordance with the 
terms of such awards. 52 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Element and purpose Policy and opportunity Operation and performance measures
Shareholding guidelines
To encourage share 
ownership by the executive 
directors and ensure interests 
are aligned with shareholders
• Executive directors are expected to retain at 
least 50 per cent (net of tax) of the shares 
which vest under the LTIP/CIP (or any other 
discretionary long-term incentive arrangement 
that may be introduced in the future) until such 
time as they hold a specified value of shares.
• Shares subject to the guidelines (together 
with any unvested share awards) may not be 
hedged by the executive or used as collateral for 
any loans.
• To the extent that an executive director is 
not meeting the guidelines, he or she will be 
expected to use half of any after-tax bonus 
to buy shares and to achieve compliance 
within six years of joining the Board or any 
significant promotion.
• 300 per cent of base salary for Stephen Clarke 
and 250 per cent of base salary for Robert 
Moorhead (or any other executive director).
• Once the shareholding guidelines have been 
met, individuals are expected to maintain these 
levels as a minimum. The Committee will review 
shareholdings annually in the context of this 
policy. The Committee will review compliance 
with the policy as awards approach maturity.
• The Committee reserves the right to alter the 
shareholding guidelines during the period of this 
policy but any such alterations will not make the 
guidelines less onerous.
All-employee share plans
To encourage share 
ownership by employees, 
thereby allowing them to 
share in the long-term 
success of the Group and 
align their interests with 
those of the shareholders.
• Executive directors are able to participate in 
all-employee share plans on the same terms 
as other Group employees.
• Sharesave – individuals may save up to such 
limit as permitted by the relevant legislation 
(currently £500 each month) for a fixed period 
of three years. At the end of the savings 
period, individuals may use their savings 
to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a 
discount of up to 20 per cent of the market 
price set at the launch of each scheme.
• In line with market practice, no performance 
conditions are attached to options granted 
under the Sharesave Scheme.

payment of a final dividend for the year of 33.6p per ordinary share on 1 February 2018 to members on the Register at the close of 
business on 12 January 2018. This final dividend and the interim dividend of 14.6p per ordinary share paid on 3 August 2017 make a 
total dividend of 48.2p per ordinary share for the year ended 31 August 2017 (2016: 43.9p).
SHARE CAPITAL
WH Smith PLC is a public company limited by shares. The issued share capital of the Company , together with details of shares issued 
during the year , is shown in Note 24 to the financial statements on page 93.
The issued share capital of the Company as at 31 August 2017 was 110,538,251 ordinary shares of 22
6
⁄67p each. These shares are listed 
on the London Stock Exchange and can be held in certificated or uncertificated form.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and 
voting rights.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than certain restrictions imposed by laws and 
regulations (such as insider trading laws and market requirements relating to closed periods), including the requirements of the 
EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Listing Rules, and also the Company’s Share Dealing Code whereby directors and certain 
employees of the Company require Board approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association, a copy of which can be obtained from the Company’s website, www.whsmithplc.co.uk. 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s report and accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings 
of the Company , to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights, and to receive a dividend, if declared, subject to the deduction of any 
sums due from the holder of ordinary shares to the Company on account of calls or otherwise. Changes to the Company’s Articles of 
Association must be approved by special resolution of the Company. 54 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
The Trustee of the WH Smith Employee Benefit Trust holds ordinary shares in the Company on behalf of the beneficiaries of the Trust, 
who are the employees and former employees of the Group. If any offer is made to the holders of ordinary shares to acquire their 
shares, the Trustee will not be obliged to accept or reject the offer in respect of any shares which are at that time subject to subsisting 
options, but will have regard to the interests of the option holders and can consult them to obtain their views on the offer , and subject 
to the foregoing, the Trustee will take the action with respect to the offer it thinks fair .
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
At the 2017 AGM, authority was given for the Company to purchase, in the market, up to 11,293,415 ordinary shares of 22
6
⁄67p each, 
renewing the authority granted at the 2016 AGM. The Company used this authority to facilitate its ongoing strategy of returning 
surplus cash to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks thereby increasing total shareholder returns and the net asset 
value per share. The total return of cash to shareholders since 2007 is shown in the chart on page 9. The directors will only exercise 
the authority when satisfied that it is in the best interests of shareholders generally and that it would result in an increase in earnings 
per share. The Company purchased 2,501,949 of its own shares during the financial year , representing 2.3 per cent of the issued 
share capital as at 31 August 2017, at an average price of £16.39. The aggregate amount of consideration (including costs) paid by the 
Company for the purchases during the financial year was £41m. All shares purchased by the Company were cancelled. This authority 
is renewable annually and approval will be sought from shareholders at the AGM in 2018 to renew the authority for a further year .
ISSUE OF NEW ORDINARY SHARES
During the financial year ended 31 August 2017, 41,005 ordinary shares of the Company were issued under the Sharesave Scheme 
at prices between 580.80p and 1147.20p. The Articles of Association of the Company provide that the Board may , subject to the prior 
approval of the members of the Company , be granted authority to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares or grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares, including new ordinary shares.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS – CHANGE OF CONTROL
A change of control of the Company following a takeover bid may cause a number of agreements to which the Company or its 
trading subsidiaries, WH Smith High Street Limited and WH Smith Travel Limited, is party , such as commercial trading contracts, 
banking arrangements, property leases, licence and concession agreements to take effect, alter or terminate. In addition, the service 
agreements of some senior executives and employee share plans would be similarly affected on a change of control, including, in the 
case of some employees, in relation to compensation for loss of office.
The Company has an unsecured £140m multicurrency revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank PLC, Abbey 
National Treasury Services PLC and BNP Paribas for general corporate and working capital purposes. If there is a change of control 
of the Company , and agreeable terms cannot be negotiated between the parties, any lender may cancel the commitment under the 
facility and all outstanding utilisations for that lender , together with accrued interest, shall be immediately payable.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise situations where a director has an 
interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company (‘Situational Conflicts’). The Board has a formal 
system in place for directors to declare Situational Conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those directors who have no 
interest in the matter being considered. In deciding whether to authorise a Situational Conflict, the non-conflicted directors must act 
in the way they consider , in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company , and they may impose limits or 
conditions when giving the authorisation, or subsequently , if they think this is appropriate. Any Situational Conflicts considered by the 
Board, and any authorisations given, are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of conflicts which is reviewed regularly by 
the Board.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance which gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against 
its directors. The Company has provided and continues to provide an indemnity for its directors, which is a qualifying third party 
indemnity provision for the purposes of Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006.
COMPANY’S SHAREHOLDERS
Information provided to the Company pursuant to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules (DTRs) is published on a Regulatory Information Service and on the Company’s website. As at 31 August 2017, the following 
information had been received, in accordance with DTR5, from holders of notifiable interests in the Company’s issued share capital.

GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors that are likely to affect its future developments, performance and position, 
are set out in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 29. The Financial review on pages 14 to 17 of the Strategic report also describes 
the Group’s financial position, cash flows and borrowing facilities, further information on which is detailed in Notes 20 to 23 of the 
financial statements on pages 89 to 92. In addition, Note 23 of the financial statements on page 90 includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Strategic report on pages 20 to 24 also highlights the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group.
The directors report that they have reviewed current performance and forecasts, combined with expenditure commitments, including 
capital expenditure, proposed dividends and share buybacks, and borrowing facilities. The directors have also carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. After making enquiries the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate financial 
resources to continue its current operations, including contractual and commercial commitments for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements. The directors have also assessed the prospects of the Company over a three-year period. 
The longer term viability statement is in the Strategic report on page 24.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
PwC has expressed its willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company. A resolution to re-appoint PwC as auditors to the 
Company and a resolution to authorise the Audit Committee to determine its remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITORS
Having made the requisite enquiries, as far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined in 
Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and each of the directors has taken all steps 
he or she should have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM of the Company will be held at the offices Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, Exchange House, Primrose Street, London EC2A 2EG 
on 24 January 2018 at 11.30am. The Notice of Annual General Meeting is given, together with explanatory notes, in the booklet which

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year . Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101), 
and applicable law). In preparing the Group financial statements, the directors have also elected to comply with IFRSs, issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and Company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS101, have been followed for the Company 
financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 39, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law), give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company;  
• The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union – Dual 
IFRS (European Union and IASB), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Company , together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, WH Smith PLC’s Group financial statements (the 
‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 August 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the Annual Report and accounts 2017 (the ‘Annual Report’), 
which comprise: the Group balance sheet as at 31 August 
2017; the Group income statement, the Group statement of 
comprehensive income, the Group cash flow statement, and the 
Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; 
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by IASB
As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in 
addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by 
the IASB.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that  
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group.
Other than those disclosed in the Audit Committee Report, 
we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the year 
from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Overview
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £6.8 million (2016: £6.5 million), 
based on 5 per cent of profit before tax.
Audit scope
•  The WH Smith PLC Group operates under five components; 
High Street, Travel UK, Travel International, Central and 
the Company.
• We performed a full scope audit on the High Street and Travel 
UK components, whilst performing specified audit procedures 
over balances within the Central and Company ledgers based 
on their overall size and values of their specific financial 
statement line items.
• Our audit scoping gave us coverage of 98 per cent of profit 
before tax, with 94 per cent coverage of revenue.
Key audit matters
•  Recognition of supplier income.
• Inventory valuation.
• Impairment review of store assets.
• Property related provisions.
• Pension scheme valuation. 58 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017

The scope of our audit Key audit matters
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where 
the directors made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the current year and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of 
our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Recognition of supplier income
Refer to Note 1 (c) Accounting policies and page 34 for the 
views of the Audit Committee.
The Group earns supplier income under numerous different 
arrangements with its suppliers. The arrangements vary 
in nature and size but include volume based retrospective 
discounts and payments for space given to marketing 
campaigns. Supplier income is recognised as a deduction 
from cost of sales and is earned over the period of the 
contractual agreements with individual suppliers. The total 
income recognised is therefore based on the expected 
entitlement earned up to the balance sheet date under each 
supplier agreement.
The amount of supplier income recognised in the year 
resulted from mainly high volume, low value transactions for 
agreements such as volume based retrospective discounts 
and payments for guaranteed in store space dedicated to 
product. Therefore, limited judgement or estimation was 
required in determining the amount the Group is entitled to, 
as the majority of volume based agreements are based on 
historical sales as opposed to forecast volumes. Our focus 
for all types of supplier income was therefore whether an 
agreement for the income recognised existed, whether 
income was recognised in accordance with the agreement 
and whether it was recognised in the correct year.
 
Our audit work in respect of supplier income comprised 
substantive testing of a sample of income recognised in the 
income statement during the year and testing of accrued and 
deferred amounts in the balance sheet. The main elements of our 
work are considered in more detail below.
Income statement testing
We requested confirmations directly from a number of different 
suppliers, in respect of a sample of supplier income transactions. 
The confirmations allowed us to evaluate whether the income 
had been appropriately recognised accurately and in the year. 
Where responses were not received, we performed alternative 
procedures including agreement to contracts and cash receipts. 
We found accounting for these amounts did not require significant 
levels of judgement or estimation as income such as volume based 
discounts are calculated based on actual sales data rather than 
future forecasts. No significant issues were identified through the 
testing performed.
Furthermore, we analysed supplier income by type recognised 
each month and compared it to the previous year to identify any 
unusual trends in the amounts or timing of supplier income 
recognised in each year. No unusual trends were identified.
Balance sheet testing
In the sample of confirmations detailed above, we included 
requests for the year end receivables to be confirmed. 
We performed cut-off procedures and credit note testing to 
provide further evidence to support the timing of the recognition 
of supplier income and the value of the accrued and deferred 
balances. Our cut-off work involved testing a sample of supplier 
income amounts by reference to documentation from suppliers to 
confirm the timing of recognition was appropriate.
Our credit note testing focused on credit notes raised after the 
year end in order to identify instances of supplier income being 
subsequently reversed. We did not identify any exceptions from 
this work.
In respect of the supplier income balances (set out in Note 
15 to the financial statements) we tested the existence and 
appropriateness of recognition through direct confirmation with 
suppliers for the invoiced amounts and corroboration to contracts 
and assessment of assumptions made for the uninvoiced amounts.
We assessed the ageing of both outstanding supplier income and 
promotional funding supplier income debtors, together with our 
understanding of details of any disputes. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 59
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Inventory valuation
Refer to Note 1 (p) for the directors’ disclosure on the critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty and page 34 for the views of the Audit Committee.
Inventory consists of a number of product categories including 
books, news and magazines, impulse, stationary, travel 
essentials and digital. A large proportion of stock is supplied 
through sale or return arrangements, including the majority 
of books, newspapers and magazines and therefore these are 
considered to be lower risk than inventory acquired through 
outright purchases such as stationery.
Inventory is initially valued using a weighted average cost 
(WAC) method. Provisions are then recognised against 
inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage and slow 
moving or obsolete inventory.
We focused on the valuation of inventory due to the magnitude 
of the inventory balance, the range and age of the inventory 
considering the nature of the business and the judgements 
made by management when assessing the level of 
provision required.
Inventory is counted by the Group throughout the year. 
As such the shrinkage provision at 31 August 2017 is based on 
historical shrinkage rates and contains a degree of estimation.
We attended a number of stock counts across High Street and 
Travel stores and distribution centres. In addition to performing 
sample test counts, we validated the effectiveness of the count 
controls in operation at each site.
We also evaluated the results of other cycle counts performed by 
management and third parties throughout the year to assess the 
level of count variances.
We reviewed the shrink results from the counts performed in the 
year and compared them to historical shrink rate data to identify 
any significant unusual fluctuations which may indicate a different 
provision is required.
A substantive test was performed to ensure stock was held at the 
lower of cost versus its net realisable value.
The obsolescence provision is calculated by applying a judgemental 
percentage to the year end stock levels, based on historical 
obsolescence data, as well as management’s view of the current 
stock profile and forecast sales by product line. We performed 
an analysis of the provision applied per stock category against 
the previous year, in the light of trading results and the stock 
aging profile.
We also tested the aging of the inventory and validated the source 
inventory balances upon which the provision is based.
Furthermore, we considered write-offs in the year as an indicator 
of a requirement for further or less provision.
In performing the above assessment, we concluded the valuation of 
the stock balance is appropriate as at 31 August 2017.
Impairment review of store assets
Refer to Note 1 (p) Accounting policies for the directors’ 
disclosure on the critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty and Notes 13 and 14 (Other 
intangible assets and Property, plant & equipment).
As at 31 August 2017 management assessed the Group’s store 
assets comprising leasehold improvements and fixtures and 
fittings for indication of impairment. The economic and sector 
trends facing the Group may adversely impact the recoverable 
value of assets used within the store portfolio which is 
considered to be a triggering event for impairment review.
Management considers each store to be a cash generating 
unit (‘CGU’) and has performed a review of the trading results 
of the stores for the year. Where a store is loss making and 
is not expected to return to profitability in the near future, an 
impairment charge is recognised over the assets that cannot 
be recycled within the store portfolio as set out in Note 14 
(Property, plant and equipment).
We focused on this area because of the sales and cost 
pressure that could mean further impairment of the store 
assets is needed.
Our audit work included obtaining management’s impairment 
assessment and discussing the basis for their decision whether or 
not to impair store assets.
We agreed individual store trading performance to underlying 
records including trading data and confirmed that those that were 
loss making were appropriately impaired where an improvement 
in results could not be expected, this testing did not highlight any 
significant issues; and
We performed a review of the results for all stores to ensure that 
management’s identification of loss making stores was complete. 
This did not identify any further stores requiring impairment to 
be recognised. 60 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017

KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Property-related provisions
Refer to Note 1 (p) for the directors’ disclosure on the critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty and page 34 for the views of the Audit Committee.
Given the long history of WH Smith, the Group has an 
extensive property portfolio of both existing and former WH 
Smith properties (now sublet or vacant) held under operating 
leases, which requires the directors to make significant 
judgements and estimates relating to the need to provide 
for dilapidation costs and onerous leases when the store is 
making losses or when stores are earmarked for closure. 
These judgements include assessing; the duration of the 
lease, estimations of costs and future income potential and as 
such, remains a key audit matter for us.
We obtained management’s assessment of properties requiring 
provisions and obtained an understanding of the rationale, 
including the basis for the calculation. We agreed a sample of the 
properties to underlying documents including lease agreements 
and written communications from third parties for onerous lease 
provisions. In doing so, we agreed the lease costs incurred by the 
Group and any amounts being received as income from lessees 
where the Group is sub-letting properties at a shortfall.
For dilapidations provisions, we compared management’s 
estimates to either; correspondence of amounts to be paid 
(where stores have been vacated); or in the case of stores yet to 
be vacated, historical amounts incurred by the Group for similar 
stores previously vacated. This confirmed management’s estimates 
were in line with previous experience, or were supported by 
communication from landlords or property consultants.
We performed an independent assessment of provisions required 
through review of the schedule of leases and comparing these 
to the individual store’s current and previous year contribution. 
We also performed a sense check against loss-making stores 
within our work over store impairment.
The work we performed indicated that management have sufficient 
provisions held for property matters at 31 August 2017.
Pension scheme valuation
Refer to Note 1 (p) for the directors’ disclosure on the critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty and Note 4 Retirement benefit obligations and 
page 34 for the views of the Audit Committee.
The Group has two defined benefit pension plans which 
comprise total plan assets of £1,346m and total pension 
liabilities of £1,079m which are significant in the context of 
the overall balance sheet of the Group. The valuation of the 
schemes’ liabilities requires significant level of judgement 
and technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions. 
Changes in a number of the key assumptions can have a 
material impact on the position as disclosed in the Note 4 of 
the financial statements.
We focused on this area because of the impact of the 
judgements inherent in the actual assumptions involved in the 
valuation of the schemes’ liabilities.
We obtained the actuarial report for the WH Smith Pension Trust 
Retail Section for the scheme as at 31st August 2017.
We tested the pension assumptions, including discount rates, 
salary increases, inflation and mortality, utilising our specialist 
knowledge of pensions. We considered and challenged the 
reasonableness of the actuarial assumptions comparing the 
discount and inflation rates used against our internally developed 
benchmark ranges, finding them to be within an acceptable 
range. Other assumptions were also assessed and considered to 
be reasonable.
The most recent triennial valuation was completed in March 2017, 
therefore census data supporting the actuarial report has been 
updated during the current year. We agreed a sample of the data 
used by the actuary to supporting payroll information. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 61
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the 
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which it operates.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic 
structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the Group operates.
The WH Smith PLC Group operates under five components. 
There are three trading components; High Street, Travel UK 
and Travel International which generate revenue for the Group. 
The Central ledger mainly includes head office costs, including 
pensions and Group property provisions. The Company ledger 
mainly includes equity related balances for the purposes of 
Group operations (such as dividend issues).
We performed a full scope audit on the High Street and Travel 
UK components whilst performing specific procedures over 
balances within the Central and Company ledger in co-operation 
with the Swindon and London finance departments.
Our audit scoping enabled us to account for 98 per cent of profit 
before tax, with 94 per cent coverage of revenue.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £6.8 million (2016: £6.5 million).
How we determined it
5 per cent of profit before tax 
of £140m.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
This is a profit orientated 
business and profit is one of 
the primary measures used 
by the shareholders in order 
to assess performance and 
this is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we 
allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across 
components was between £4.7 million and £6.3 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £340k 
(2016: £325k) as well as misstatements below that amount that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we 
have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of the directors’ statement 
in the financial statements 
about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the 
directors’ identification of any 
material uncertainties to the 
Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern over a period 
of at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention 
to. However, because not all 
future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the 
directors’ statement relating to 
Going Concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report. 62 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report to the members of WH Smith PLC

REPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for 
the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or 
material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 August 2017 is consistent 
with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and 
of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 55 of the Annual Report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 24 of the Annual Report as 
to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and 
statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit. (Listing Rules).
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 35, that they 
consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the members to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 33 to 36 describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06). Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 63
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 56, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Notes to the financial statements
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated Group financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(‘IFRS IC’) as adopted by the European Union and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. These are the standards, subsequent 
amendments and related interpretations issued and adopted by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) that have 
been endorsed by the European Union at the year end.
The consolidated Group financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU 
IAS Regulation. The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis as explained on page 
55 of the Directors’ report.
New standards
The Group has adopted the following standards and 
interpretations which became mandatory during the current 
financial year. These changes have had no material impact on 
the Group’s financial statements:
Amendments to IFRS 10,  
IFRS 12 and IAS 28
Investment Entities: Applying the 
Consolidation Exception
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of 
Interests in Joint Operations
Amendments to IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate 
Financial Statements
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
Amendments to IAS 16 and 
IAS 38
Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation 
and Amortisation
Annual improvements 2012–2014
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated Group 
financial statements, the following standards and 
interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial 
statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some 
cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers
Amendments to IFRS 10 and 
IAS 28 
Sale or Contribution of Assets 
between an Investor and its 
Associate or Joint Venture
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and 
Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions
Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property
Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes: Recognition 
of deferred tax assets for 
unrealised losses
Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cash flows
IFRS 16
IFRIC 22
Leases
Foreign Currency Transactions 
and Advance Consideration
Annual improvements 2014-2016
Except as outlined below, the directors anticipate that 
the adoption of these standards and interpretations in 
future years will have no material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is effective 
from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard 
establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition 
and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for 
obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of 
goods and services is transferred. It applies to all contracts 
with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. 
The Group is in the process of completing an assessment of the 
impact of IFRS 15 and it is anticipated adoption will not have a 
material impact on the recognition and measurement of any of 
the Group’s revenue streams. 
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ is effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2019 (subject to endorsement by the EU). 
This standard replaces IAS 17, and will require entities to apply 
a single lessee accounting model, with lessees recognising 
right of use assets and lease liabilities on balance sheet for all 
applicable leases. The Group anticipates that the adoption of 
IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the Income statement 
and Balance sheet including operating profit, profit before 
tax, property plant and equipment and net debt. There is no 
cash impact of adoption of this standard. The Group is in the 
process of assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and has invested in 
additional resource and systems in order to assess the impact 
on its existing lease estate which comprises approximately 
1,300 property leases, as well as equipment leases. The Group 
has established a project group to lead the implementation 
and work performed to date includes assessing the accounting 
impacts of the change, the process of collecting the required 
data from across the business and the necessary changes to 
systems and processes. In order to quantify the impact of  
IFRS 16, management is required to make judgements on 
a lease-by-lease basis including, but not limited to:
–  the appropriate discount rate (by reference to the interest 
rate implicit in the lease, or the Group’s incremental 
borrowing rate);
–  the lease term, including consideration of options to extend; 
and
–  index or rate dependent variable payments that could be 
included in the calculation of the lease liability.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide 
a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards 
until a detailed lease-by-lease review has been completed. 
The undiscounted amount of the Group’s operating lease 
commitments at 31 August 2017 disclosed under IAS 17, the 
current leasing standard was £841 million (see Note 6). 70 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements continued
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Alternative Performance Measures
The Group has identified certain measures that it believes will 
assist the understanding of the performance of the business. 
These alternative performance measures, ‘APMs’, are not 
defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS.
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered 
to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide 
stakeholders with additional useful information on the 
underlying trends, performance and position of the Group and 
are consistent with how business performance is measured 
internally. The alternative performance measures are not 
defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable 
with other companies’ alternative performance measures.
The key APMs that the Group uses include: High Street and 
Travel trading profit, Group profit from trading operations, 
like-for-like revenue, gross margin, fixed charges cover, Net 
funds, Return on capital employed and free cash flow. Each of 
these APMs are set out in the Glossary on page 105 including 
explanations of how they are calculated and how they can be 
reconciled to a statutory measure where relevant.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are drawn up on the historical cost 
basis of accounting, except for certain financial instruments, 
share-based payments and pensions that have been measured 
at fair value. The financial information is rounded to the nearest 
million, except where otherwise indicated. The principal 
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently 
throughout both years, are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group financial statements incorporate the 
financial statements of WH Smith PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group 
has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to 
the Group.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and 
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of 
consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the fair value of 
consideration transferred, after taking into account recognised 
goodwill, the excess is immediately recognised in the income 
statement. The separable net assets, both tangible and 
intangible, of the newly acquired subsidiary undertakings are 
incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the 
fair value as at the effective date of control, if appropriate.
Results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the 
financial year are included in the financial statements up to 
the effective date of disposal. Where a business component 
representing a separate major line of business is disposed of, 
or classified as held for sale, it is classified as a discontinued 
operation. The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued 
operations is shown as a single amount on the face of the 
income statement, separate from the other results of the Group. 
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
b) Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable 
for goods and services to customers (which is the most 
significant revenue stream), sale of wholesale goods to 
franchisees, and commission and fee income on concession 
and franchise arrangements.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of the goods or services provided have transferred to the 
buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group. 
Revenue excludes discounts, estimated returns, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes. Revenue on store sales of goods and 
concession sales is recognised when goods are sold to the 
customer. Internet sales are recognised when the goods are 
delivered to the customer and title has passed. Revenue from 
gift vouchers and gift cards sold by the Group is recognised 
on the redemption of the gift voucher or gift card. Revenue on 
wholesale sale of goods to franchisees is recognised on 
delivery. Franchise and concession fees and commission 
are recognised in revenue as earned based on the terms of 
the contracts.
c) Supplier income
The Group receives income from its suppliers in the form 
of supplier incentives and discounts (collectively ‘Supplier 
incomes’). These incomes are recognised as a deduction from 
cost of sales on an accruals basis as they are earned for each 
supplier contract. The level of complexity and judgement is low 
in relation to establishing the accounting entries and estimates, 
and the timing of recognition.
Supplier incomes that have been invoiced but not received at 
the period end are recognised in Trade Receivables, or in Trade 
Payables where we have the right of offset. Incomes that have 
been earned but not yet invoiced are accrued and are recorded 
in Prepayments and accrued income.
The types of supplier income recognised by the Group, and the 
recognition policies are: 
Retrospective discounts
Income earned based on sales or purchase volume triggers set 
by the supplier for specific products over specific periods.
Income is calculated and invoiced based upon actual sales or 
purchases over the period set out in the supplier agreement, 
and is recognised in the income statement as it is earned. 
Where the period of an agreement spans accounting periods, 
income is recognised based on forecasts for expected sales or 
purchase volumes, informed by current performance, trends, 
and the terms of the supplier agreement. Income is invoiced 
throughout the year in accordance with the specific supplier 
terms. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to reflect 
unearned elements of supplier income as the product has not 
yet been sold. This income is subsequently recognised in cost of 
sales when the product has been sold. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 71
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Promotional and marketing activity
Supplier income from promotional and marketing activity 
includes income in respect of in-store marketing and point 
of sale, supplying dedicated promotional space or receiving 
margin support for products on promotion. 
Income for promotional and marketing activity is agreed 
with suppliers for specific periods and products. Income is 
recognised over the period of the agreement. Income is invoiced 
when the performance conditions in the supplier agreement 
have been achieved.
d) Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to the WHSmith Group defined contribution pension 
schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as they fall due. 
The cost of providing benefits for the main defined benefit 
scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and the United News Shops 
Retirement Benefits Scheme are determined by the Projected 
Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried out 
at the balance sheet date. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period 
in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income 
statement in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance 
sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. 
Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the plan. Where the Group 
is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the 
pension scheme above the accounting value of the liabilities, an 
onerous obligation is recognised. 
e) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of 
the Group at their fair value determined at the inception of the 
lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in 
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments 
are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of 
the lease obligations so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
recognised directly in the income statement. 
Rentals payable and receivable under operating leases are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable 
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group has a 
number of lease arrangements in which the rent payable is 
contingent on revenue. Contingent rentals payable, based on 
store revenues, are accrued in line with revenues generated.
f) Intangible assets
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The consideration transferred is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, 
of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control, 
of the acquiree. Costs directly attributable to the business 
combination are recognised in the income statement in the 
period they are incurred. The cost of a business combination is 
allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values at that date.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively 
obtains control of the acquiree. Intangible assets are recognised 
if they meet the definition of an intangible asset contained in IAS 
38 and its fair value can be measured reliably. The excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of 
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase 
consideration over the net fair value of identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated impairment. For the 
purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those 
cash-generating units (CGUs) that have benefited from the 
acquisition. The CGUs are groups of stores within the Travel and 
High Street operating segments. The carrying value of goodwill 
is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is 
an indication that goodwill may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss 
on disposal.
Other intangible assets
The costs of acquiring and developing software that 
is not integral to the related hardware is capitalised 
separately as an intangible asset. These intangibles 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged so as to write 
off the costs of assets over their estimated useful lives, using 
the straight-line method, and is recorded in Distribution 
costs. The estimated lives are usually a of up to five years. 
Software assets held under finance leases are depreciated over 
their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets 
or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Other intangible assets are valued at cost and amortised 
over their useful life, and the amortisation is recorded in 
Administrative expenses, unless the asset can be demonstrated 
to have an indefinite life.
All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance 
with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, when there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 72 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements continued
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
in value. The carrying values of tangible fixed assets 
previously revalued have been retained at their book amount. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the costs of assets, 
other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, with the annual rates applicable to the 
principal categories being:
Freehold properties – over 20 years
Short-term leasehold –  shorter of the lease period 
and the estimated remaining 
economic life
Fixtures and fittings – up to ten years
Equipment and vehicles – up to ten years
The residual values of property, plant and equipment are  
re-assessed on an annual basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
At each balance sheet date, property, plant and equipment is 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable 
amount is assessed by reference to the net present value 
of expected future pre-tax cash flows of the relevant 
cash-generating unit or fair value, less costs to sell, if higher. 
Any impairment in value is charged to the income statement 
in the period in which it occurs.
h) Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an 
interest on a long-term basis and which is jointly controlled 
by the Group and one or more other venturers under a 
contractual agreement. 
Management has assessed whether it has joint control of the 
arrangement. Joint control exists only when decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties 
that collectively control the arrangement. In assessing this joint 
control no significant judgements have been necessary. 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the 
Group consolidated income statement using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the 
Group consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any 
impairment in value. The carrying value of investments in joint 
ventures includes acquired goodwill.
If the Group’s share of losses in the joint venture equals or 
exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to 
do so, or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
i) Inventories 
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and are stated at the 
lower of cost or net realisable value. Consignment stocks are 
not included within stocks held by the Group. Inventories are 
valued using a weighted average cost method.
Cost is calculated to include, where applicable, duties, handling, 
transport and directly attributable costs (including a deduction 
for applicable supplier income) in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition. Net realisable value is 
based on estimated normal selling prices less further costs 
expected to be incurred in selling and distribution. Cost of 
inventories includes the transfer from equity of any gains or 
losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, markdown and shrinkage.
j) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are 
measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Where the effect is material, the provision is determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
which reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
Onerous contracts – property provisions
The Group’s property provisions represent the present value 
of unavoidable future net lease obligations and related costs 
of leasehold property (net of estimated sublease income 
and adjusted for certain risk factors) where the space is 
vacant, loss-making or currently not planned to be used for 
ongoing operations. The unwinding of the discount is treated 
as an imputed interest charge and is disclosed in Note 8 as 
‘Unwinding of discount on provisions’.
k) Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the 
functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in pounds sterling (GBP), which is WH Smith PLC’s 
functional and presentation currency. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded 
at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary items 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the 
retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income 
statement for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, 
the Group enters into forward contracts (see below for details 
of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative 
financial instruments). 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
overseas operations are translated into sterling at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and 
expense items are translated into sterling at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, 
if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s 
translation reserve. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 73
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
l) Taxation
The tax expense included in the income statement comprises 
current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable based on the taxable 
profit for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit 
nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax 
is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is 
also recognised directly in equity.
m) Financial instruments 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition, do not 
carry any interest and are stated at their fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement 
when there is evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash 
at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all 
of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially 
measured at fair value (being proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs), and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost, using the effective interest rate method recorded as the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemptions and 
direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and 
taken to the income statement using the effective interest rate 
method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses certain derivative financial instruments to 
reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not hold or use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows 
are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted 
transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, 
then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the 
associated gains or losses on the derivative that had 
previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial 
measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not 
result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts 
deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the 
same period in which the hedged item affects net income.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability, changes in fair value 
of the hedging instrument are recognised in profit or loss at 
the same time that the recognised asset or liability that is 
being hedged is adjusted for movements in the hedged risk 
and that adjustment is also recognised in profit or loss in the 
same period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 
is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the 
net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those 
of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at 
fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the 
income statement.
n) Share schemes 
WHSmith Employee Benefit Trust
The shares held by the WHSmith Employee Benefit Trust are 
valued at the historical cost of the shares acquired. They are 
deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds and are presented 
as an other reserve.  74 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements continued
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
Share-based payments
Employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights 
over shares (equity settled transactions).
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value is calculated using an 
appropriate option pricing model. The fair value is expensed to 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised 
at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date, 
taking into account performance conditions and the extent 
to which employees have rendered service to date, with any 
changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss for the year.
o) Dividends
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements 
in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the period in 
which they are approved and paid.
p) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items subject to 
such assumption and estimate include the useful economic life 
of assets; the measurement and recognition of provisions; the 
recognition of deferred tax assets; the liabilities for potential 
corporation tax; and valuation of retirement benefit obligations. 
Actual results could differ from these estimates and any 
subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income 
at the time such updated information becomes available.
The most critical accounting policies in determining the 
financial condition and results of the Group are those requiring 
the greatest degree of subjective or complex judgement. 
These relate to retirement benefit obligations, valuation of 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets, onerous lease costs, 
inventory valuation and taxation.
Retirement benefit obligation
The Group recognises and discloses its retirement benefit 
obligation in accordance with the measurement and 
presentational requirement of IAS 19, ‘Retirement Benefit 
Obligations’. The calculations include a number of judgements 
and estimations in respect of the expected rate of return 
on assets, the discount rate, inflation assumptions, the 
rate of increase in salaries, and life expectancy, amongst 
others. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant 
effect on the value of the retirement benefit obligation. 
Further information in respect of the Group’s retirement benefit 
obligation is included in Note 4.
Goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
impairment reviews
The Group is required to review goodwill annually to determine 
if any impairment has occurred. Value-in-use calculations 
require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows 
and suitable discount rates. Further information in respect of 
the Group’s goodwill and other intangible assets is included in 
Notes 12 and 13 respectively.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
When a review for impairment is conducted the recoverable 
amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined 
based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of 
management’s assumptions and estimates. Further information 
in respect of the Group’s property, plant and equipment is 
included in Note 14.
Inventory valuation
Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value 
which requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of 
goods to customers in the future. Any difference between the 
expected and the actual sales price achieved will be accounted 
for in the period in which the sale is made. A description of the 
Group’s accounting policy in respect of inventories is included in 
Note 1(i).
Provisions 
Provisions have been estimated for taxation, onerous leases and 
discontinued operation exit costs. These provisions represent 
the best estimate of the liability at the time of the balance sheet 
date, the actual liability being dependent on future events 
such as economic environment and marketplace demand. 
Expectations will be revised each period until the actual liability 
arises, with any difference accounted for in the period in which 
the revision is made. Further information in respect of the 
Group’s onerous lease and discontinued operations provisions 
is included in Note 18 and further information in respect of the 
Group’s tax provisions is included in Note 9. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 75
2. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
For management and financial reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two operating divisions and reportable segments - 
Travel and High Street. 
The Group’s operating segments are based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors (who are collectively considered to be 
the chief operating decision maker) to make strategic decisions, and allocate resources.
IFRS 8 requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used by the Board for assessing performance and 
allocating resources.

4. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The main pension arrangements 
for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, 
WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan. The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 4 a) i).
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the 
relevant reporting dates were:

i) The WHSmith Pension Trust
The WHSmith Pension Trust Final Salary Section is a funded final salary defined benefit scheme; it was closed to defined benefit 
service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996. Benefits are based on service and salary at the 
date of closure or leaving service, with increases currently based on CPI inflation in deferment and RPI inflation in payment.  78 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements continued
4. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)
The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee. The Trustee is responsible for the 
administration and management of the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the Trust Deed and relevant 
legislation. Responsibilities include the investment of funds, the triennial valuation and determining the deficit funding schedule. 
Under the terms of the Trust Deed there are ten Trustee directors of which three are appointed by the Sponsor, four are member-
nominated directors, and three are independent. Trustee directors are appointed for a term of six years, and are then eligible for 
re-appointment.
The WHSmith Pension Trust, has assets valued at £1,340m as at 31 August 2017 managed by third party investment managers. 
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a Liability Driven Investment (LDI) policy where the assets in the investment 
fund were invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in 
interest rates and inflation. The LDI structure that is in place has a number of inflation and interest rate hedges, with collateral 
posted daily to or from the scheme to the relevant counterparty. The risk of failure of counterparties could expose the scheme to 
loss. The scheme’s liabilities are also subject to changes in longevity.
The principal risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements are as follows:
Longevity risk 
Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with increases in life expectancy leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities.
Interest rate and Inflation risk 
Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest rates and inflation, with lower interest rates or higher inflation leading to an 
increase in the valuation of liabilities. As a result of the LDI policy outlined above, these risks are largely hedged.
An Investment Committee of the Trustees to the scheme meets regularly to review the performance of the investment managers 
and the scheme as a whole. The Company is represented on this Committee. Although investment decisions are the responsibility 
of the Trustee, the Group is an active participant of the investment sub-committee to ensure that pension plan risks are managed 
efficiently. The risk of failure of counterparties and of the investment manager is monitored regularly by the Committee. 
The Trustees have the right to determine the level of contributions and the Company has agreed with the Trustees a deficit 
funding schedule.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years. The latest 
full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2017 by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. At 31 March 2017 the deficit was £11m. The Group has agreed a revised annual funding schedule with the Trustees 
from September 2017 for the following six years, which includes the deficit recovery contributions and other running costs, of just 
under £3m. During the year ending 31 August 2017, the Group made a contribution of £3m to the WHSmith Pension Trust (2016: £3m) 
in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule, being £1m of deficit funding payable to the Trustee and £2m in 
relation to investment management costs. The Group expects the cash payments for the year ended 31 August 2018, to be £3m. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19 years. 
Amounts recognised in the financial statements
Balance Sheet
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet under IAS 19 in relation to this plan are as follows:
£m 2017 2016
Present value of the obligations (1,071) (1,260)
Fair value of plan assets 1,340 1,424
Surplus before consideration of asset ceiling 269 164
Amounts not recognised due to effect of asset ceiling (269) (164)
Additional liability recognised due to minimum funding requirements (4) (5)
Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet (4) (5)
In accordance with the requirements of IFRIC 14 we have recognised the schedule of contributions as a liability of £4m (2016: £5m). 
The defined benefit pension schemes are closed to further accrual and the present value of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 
surplus in the pension scheme of £269m (2016: £164m) available on a reduction of future contributions is £nil (2016: £nil). As a result 
the Group has not recognised this IAS 19 surplus on the balance sheet. There is an ongoing actuarial deficit primarily due to the 
different assumptions and calculation methodologies used compared to those on interpretation of IAS 19. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 79

The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of £23m (2016: gain of £297m) due to a decrease in the value of the bonds held to 
match the pension scheme liabilities. The reduction in the value of the scheme liabilities as a result of decreases in the value of 
bonds, as well as reduced longevity expectations, were greater than then the reduction in scheme assets, resulting in an increase in 
the IAS 19 surplus of £105m. 80 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017

ii) United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme
United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme (‘UNSRBS’) is closed to new entrants. The scheme provides pension benefits for 
pensioners and deferred members based on salary at the date of closure, with increases based on inflation. A full actuarial valuation 
of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years. The latest full actuarial valuation of the 
scheme was carried out at 5 April 2015 by independent actuaries. Following this valuation, the deficit was £1m.
The valuation of the UNSRBS used for the IAS 19 disclosures is based on consistent assumptions to those used for valuing the 
WHSmith Pension Trust. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date. The deficit funding 
contributions are immaterial in the context of these financial statements.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 81

The Group leases various properties under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have varying terms, escalation 
clauses and renewal rights. Contingent rents are payable on certain store leases based on store revenue. For those leases that are 
turnover-related leases, the annual net lease commitment is calculated using the minimum lease liability. The total future external 
sublease receipts are £2m (2016: £5m). The average remaining lease length across the Group is five years with both Travel at four 
years and High Street at five years. 
Potential liabilities (not included above) that could crystallise under previous assignments of leases where the liability would revert

Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’), including 
goodwill, with the recoverable amount determined from value-in-use calculations. Management has determined that no impairment 
was necessary for the current financial year (2016: £nil).  All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores (which 
are considered to be CGUs) and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions. The key assumptions on which 
forecast three-year cash flows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, 
and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash flows are extrapolated for up to an additional nine years (representing the average length of the lease for the relevant 
group of stores) based on estimated long-term growth rates of between 0 and 2.5 per cent. The rate used to discount the forecast 
cash flows was ten per cent pre-tax (2016: ten per cent).
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill. This has been based on changes in key 
assumptions considered to be possible by management. This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a 
decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to one per cent. The sensitivity analysis showed that no impairment would arise under 
each scenario.  Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 85
13. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets comprise capitalised software costs that are not deemed to be an integral part of the related hardware 
(which is classified within property, plant and equipment) and certain tenancy rights.
The amortisation period for capitalised software costs is over a maximum period of five years. Other intangible assets are either 
considered to have an indefinite life, therefore no amortisation has been charged, or are amortised over their useful economic life. 
These assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.

to have an indefinite life, £4m (2016: £4m), representing certain rights under tenancy agreements, which include the right to renew 
leases. Management has determined that the useful economic life of these assets is indefinite because the Company can continue to 
occupy and trade from certain premises for an indefinite period.

The ageing analysis of these receivables is given in the table below. This allowance reflects the application of the Group’s 
provisioning policy in respect of bad and doubtful debts and is based upon the difference between the receivable value and 
the estimated net collectible amount. The Group establishes its provision for bad and doubtful debts by reference to past 
default experience.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
The Group has in place a five-year committed multi-currency revolving credit facility of £140m with Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank 
PLC, BNP Paribas and Abbey National Treasury Services PLC. The revolving credit facility is due to mature on 9 December 2021. 
The utilisation is interest-bearing at LIBOR plus 85 basis points. As at 31 August 2017, the Group has drawn down £22m (2016: £18m) 
on this facility. 90 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017

Other potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the 
Group if the lessee defaulted. Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement with Connect Group PLC (formerly Smiths News 
PLC), any such contingent liability which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between the Group and Connect Group PLC 
in the ratio 65:35 (provided that the actual liability of Connect Group PLC in any 12-month period does not exceed £5m). The Group’s 
65 per cent share of these leases has an estimated future rental commitment at 31 August 2017 of £3m (2016: £3m). The movement 
in the future rental commitment is due to the crystallisation of lease liabilities, lease expiries and the effluxion of time.
Contracts placed for future capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in this combined financial information

Comparison of carrying values and fair values
There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their 
fair values as at the balance sheet date.
Risk management
The Group’s treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, and to ensure 
liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Group does 
not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements. 
The Group’s treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Group’s Audit Committee and are 
subject to regular Group Internal Audit review. Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 91
23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Capital risk 
The Group’s objectives with respect to managing capital (defined as net debt/funds plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, in order to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through an 
appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. Refer to Note 20 for the value of the Group’s net debt/funds and refer to the Group 
statement of changes in equity for the value of the Group’s equity.
In managing the Group’s capital levels, the Board regularly monitors the level of debt in the business, the working capital 
requirements, forecast financing and investing cash flows. Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to 
investors while ensuring sufficient capital is retained in the business to meet its strategic objectives. The Board has a progressive 
dividend policy and expects that, over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings calculated on a normalised 
tax basis.
As at 12 October 2017, the Group has in place a £140m committed multi-currency revolving credit facility, carrying certain financial 
covenants which have been met throughout the period. The covenants, tested half-yearly, are based on fixed charges cover and 
net borrowings. 
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through 
both short and long-term cash flow forecasts. The Group has a five-year committed multi-currency revolving credit facility with a 
number of financial institutions which is available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital. 
The Group has a policy of pooling cash flows in order to optimise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the Group 
to reduce the costs of external short-term funding. 
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Group’s financial liabilities:

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and 
other financial activities. The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Group has credit risk attributable to its trade and other receivables including a number of sale or return contracts with 
suppliers. The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is 
made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of 
cash flows. 
The Group has low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low-value and short maturity. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group treasury 
policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss. These limits are based on a 
short-term credit rating of P-1.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit 
risk. The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts. 
At 31 August 2017, the Group had drawn down £22m (2016: £18m) from its committed revolving credit facility. The Group draws down 
on its facility, but does not view any draw down as long-term in nature and therefore does not enter into interest rate derivatives to 
mitigate this risk.  92 WH Smith PLC  Annual report and accounts 2017
Notes to the financial statements continued
23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s foreign currency exposures are principally to the US dollar, euro and Australian dollar. 
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows denominated in 
currencies other than pounds sterling. The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise 
foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD/GBP exchange rates. These are designated as cash flow hedges. At 31 August 2017 
the Group had no material un-hedged currency exposures.
The Group’s euro and Australian dollar exposure is principally operational and arises mainly through the operation of retail stores in 
France, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Italy and Australia. The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss 
translation exposure.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been used to hedge France and Ireland retail stores purchases in GBP to minimise foreign 
exchange risk in movements of the GBP/EUR exchange rates. These are designated as cash flow hedges.
The fair value of cash flow hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets/liabilities is shown below:
£m 2017 2016
Fair value of derivative assets – 2
At 31 August 2017, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed 
is US$40m (2016: US$30m) and £6m (2016: £4m). These instruments will be used to hedge cash flows occurring within up to 
two years of the balance sheet date. Gains of £2m (2016: £nil) have been transferred to the income statement and gains of £1m 
(2016: £1m) have been transferred to inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2017. In the 
year to 31 August 2017 the fair value gain on the Group’s currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges 
amounted to £nil (2016: £2m).
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by level 2 inputs as defined by the fair 
value hierarchy of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been any 
transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 August 2017
Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The following 
analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market 
variables, being UK interest rates, and USD/GBP, EUR/GBP and AUD/GBP exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
• Exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the hedging 
reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives. 
• Year-end exchange rates applied in the analysis are USD/GBP 1.2905/1 (2016: 1.3111/1), EUR/GBP 1.0860/1 (2016: 1.1762/1) and 
AUD/GBP 1.6306/1 (2016: 1.7443/1).
• Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 August 2017 and 31 August 2016 respectively. 
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Group’s income statement and equity given reasonable 
movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax. The Group considers a reasonable interest rate 
movement in GBP LIBOR/base rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history. Similarly, sensitivity to movements in USD/
GBP, EUR/GBP and AUD/GBP exchange rates of ten per cent are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context 
of movement in those currency pairs over time.
Using these assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group income statement and equity.

REPORT ON THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, WH Smith PLC’s Company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 August 2017;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law); and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report and accounts 2017 (the ‘Annual Report’), which 
comprise: the Company balance sheet as at 31 August 2017 and 
the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include 
a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-
audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the Group and its subsidiaries 
in the year from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Overview
Materiality
•  Overall materiality: £4.3 million (2016: £4.3 million), based on 
1 per cent of total assets.
Audit scope
•  We performed a full scope audit over the Company 
ledger, providing us with 100 per cent coverage over the 
Company accounts.
Key audit matters
• We have no key audit matters to report.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the current year and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. We determined that there were no key 
audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in 
our report. 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of 
the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which it operates. 
We scoped the balances to be audited in line with the materiality 
determined for the year. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall materiality £4.3 million (2016: £4.3 million).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
As the parent entity, WH Smith 
PLC, is primarily a holding 
Company for the Group, the 
materiality benchmark has 
been determined to be based on 
total assets which is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £214k 
(2016: £216k) as well as misstatements below that amount that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we 
have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of the directors’ statement 
in the financial statements 
about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the 
directors’ identification of any 
material uncertainties to the 
Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern over a 
period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention 
to. However, because not all 
future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the 
directors’ statement relating to 
Going Concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
REPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for 
the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or 
material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 August 2017 is consistent 
with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and 
its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Company 
and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Company
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 55 of the Annual Report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 24 of the Annual Report 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Company, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company and 
statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Company. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit 
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in 
the course of the audit. (Listing Rules) Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 101
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 35, that they 
consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the members to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the Company obtained in 
the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 33 to 36 describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 56, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for 
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we 
were appointed by the members on 21 January 2015 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2015 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is 3 years, covering the years ended 31 August 2015

Alternative Performance Measures
In reporting financial information, the Group presents alternative performance measures, ‘APMs’, which are not defined or specified 
under the requirements of IFRS.
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide 
stakeholders with additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group and are consistent 
with how business performance is measured internally. The alternative performance measures are not defined by IFRS and 
therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies’ alternative performance measures. The key APMs that the Group 
uses are outlined below.

Warning to Shareholders – Boiler Room Scams
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, 
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. Information on how to avoid share fraud or report a scam can be found on our website 
at www.whsmithplc.co.uk. You can also call the Financial Conduct Authority Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or go to
