Integrated Report
We are committed to the 
concept of integrated 
reporting - continually 
enhancing our approach 
since 2014 when we 
published our first 
integrated annual report.  
We summarise our latest 
improvements across. 
Integrated reporting has become modern best practice 
for annual reporting, adopted by a growing community 
of organisations that have recognised that strategy, risk, 
performance and sustainability are inseparable and are  
integral to an organisation’s success.
The International Integrated Reporting Council (IRRC) define 
an integrated report as “a concise communication about how 
an organisation’s strategy, governance, performance and 
prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to 
the creation of value in the short, medium and long-term” . 
Find out more about integrated reporting at: www.theiirc.org 
Changes to this year’s Annual Report and 
Financial Statements
We continue to evolve our Annual Report to meet latest 
business, stakeholder and legislative requirements, to follow 
best practice, and to embed the principles of the integrated 
approach. This year we have:
•  Included more information to explain how we assure the 
contents of this publication. We make clear what assurance 
route has been used for each report included within this 
Annual Report and Financial Statements (ARFS).
•  The Strategic Report has been updated to further develop 
the summary of our strategy and business model, including 
further explanation of our resources and relationships, and 
how we perform relative to others. We have also reviewed 
our reporting of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to clarify 
those which are regulatory and to report the headlines 
of our ambition to go further, with links to further 
information on our website.
•  Expanded our explanation of risk, introducing a ‘heat map’ 
and showing risk movement in the year.
•  Expanded information on the skills of our Board 
and their activity leading the business.
•  Added an ‘At A Glance’ section in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements The purpose and audience of this report
The primary purpose of any company’s statutory annual 
report is to ensure compliance with legal duties and to  
share a range of financial and other information.  
To respond to the needs of our many stakeholders  
we provide an overview of our performance and plans, 
along with additional information for specialist groups  
and to fulfil legal requirements.
Alignment with our other publications
In parallel to this document, we also publish our Annual 
Performance Report (APR). In the APR we specifically 
describe how we are delivering our regulated investment 
plan and service commitments. The APR is designed for 
customers and to meet regulatory requirements set by 
our regulator, the Office of Water Services (Ofwat). 
You can find the APR on our website at: 
www.yorkshirewater.com/ourperformance
We also publish a wide range of other reports and 
information on our website, www.yorkshirewater.com. 
Throughout this report we provide links to specific 
webpages or other publications where more detailed 
information is available.
Trusting the information we publish
We always want to provide you with information you can 
trust. When we don’t get it right, we risk losing trust and 
confidence. Our Assurance Plan explains the process we 
have in place to give confidence that the information we 
publish is accurate, accessible and easy to understand. 
You can find our Assurance Plan on our website at this link: 
www.yorkshirewater.com/discoverwater
We operate a best practice risk-based approach known as 
‘three levels of assurance’. We apply this approach to all 
the reporting covered by the Assurance Plan. In applying 
our approach to this Annual Report and Financial 
Statements we ensure a range of internal and independent 
assurance measures, including:
•  Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) is our external 
independent financial auditor. PwC review that the 
information presented within our statutory accounts is a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company, 
and that the accounts have been prepared in accordance 
with relevant accounting standards and legislation.
•  Halcrow is our external independent technical 
assurance provider. Halcrow review the information we 
report on our Performance Commitments to confirm 
accuracy and completeness.
•  Our Internal Audit function has completed a financial 
and regulatory accounting audit on the controls in place 
for financial accounting and have reviewed the reported 
position on our Performance Commitments and our 
Strategic Business Objective (SBO) commitments.

Yorkshire Water at a Glance
We provide some of life’s 
most essential services to the 
people and businesses of the 
Yorkshire and Humberside 
region, playing a key role in 
the region’s health, wellbeing 
and prosperity.
We do this by supplying water and waste water services, 
and being custodians of essential infrastructure and the 
natural environment.
We do all of this for about £1 a day for the average  
customer, amongst the lowest water and waste water  
bills in the country.

Page 8 Chairman’s Statement
Good progress was made 
over the past year to further 
improve the operational and 
financial performance of 
the Company, as well as the 
quality of customer services 
we provide. 
Enhancing customer service
In 2016/17, we met or exceeded 24 of our 26 Performance 
Commitments – the priorities we agreed with our customers, 
stakeholders and regulators at the last Price Review. For 
example, we met our annual leakage reduction target, 
reduced the number of serious pollution incidents and 
continued to deliver excellent quality drinking water.
We achieved our highest ever score in the water industry’s 
comparative assessment for customer service, Ofwat’s Service 
Incentive Mechanism (SIM). We were also recognised as a 
leader in service by being ranked second of all the utilities in 
the renowned, cross-sector, UK Customer Service Index.
Also pleasing was the fact that we achieved the maximum five 
star rating in Business in The Community’s annual Corporate 
Responsibility Index, which externally benchmarks responsible 
business practices amongst companies across the UK.
This solid performance was delivered against the backdrop of 
transformational change as we separated Yorkshire Water into 
retail and wholesale entities to make the successful transition 
to the new non-household retail market on 1 April 2017. 
Both Yorkshire Water and our new retail arm, Yorkshire Water 
Business Services, are performing well in the new 
market place. 
Investing for the future
Excellent progress was made over the past 12 months to 
recover those assets damaged by the floods of late 2015. 
We remain on course to deliver the customer and 
environmental benefits of our £3.8 billion investment 
programme in the period 2015 to 2020.
I welcomed Board approval of significant new investment 
in the Company’s sludge treatment capabilities, with major 
new anaerobic digestion facilities to be built at two of 
the Company’s key sites in Leeds and Huddersfield. This 
will ensure the more effective, efficient and sustainable 
management of sludge in the Yorkshire region for decades to 
come, as well as making us more self-sufficient in renewable 
energy generation.
Improving health and safety
We have continued to further improve health, safety and 
wellbeing across the Company, its contractor base and supply 
chain. During 2016/17, a new Director of Health and Safety 
was appointed and a new safety improvement strategy 
approved by the Board. Working closely with Trade Unions, 
ten new Life-Saving Rules were established and a range of 
initiatives undertaken to further understand and address the 
Company’s key operational and process safety risks.
Looking ahead
In the coming months, the Board will play a significant role in 
the development of the Company’s new business plan for the 
period 2020 to 2025, and beyond. As part of the Company’s 
approach to the five-yearly regulatory Price Review in 2019, 
the Board will be challenging the business to be innovative in 
delivery, and give certainty to delivering the service benefits 
our customers say they want.
The Board has also seen changes in our independent 
non-executive director representation. We welcomed Teresa 
Robson-Capps and Julia Unwin to the Board and offered our 
sincere thanks to Martin Havenhand, who retired after nine 
years of service to the Company. We have also appointed  
Ray O’Toole as senior independent director, filling the vacancy 
I left after becoming Chairman.
Over the next 18 months, we look forward to involving 
customers, stakeholders and regulators in the development 
of our next Price Review business plan with a view to further 
transforming the region’s future relationship with water and 
the environment.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Chief Executive’s Overview
Good progress
This has been a positive year for Yorkshire Water and its 
customers as we continue to make good progress towards 
the delivery of our five-year business plan for the period 2015 
to 2020. Our focus has continued to be on the affordable, 
efficient and safe delivery of excellent customer services,  
while fulfilling our environmental and social responsibilities.
I would like to pay tribute to our colleagues who continue 
to demonstrate great skill and diligence. As well as their 
day-to-day duties, many colleagues have also been involved 
in implementation of major new change initiatives, including 
wholesale upgrades to the Company’s information technology 
and work management systems. Our colleagues have shown 
a real willingness to change to provide a more effective and 
efficient service, with colleague satisfaction remaining 
high at 78%.
Being awarded a maximum five stars in Business in The 
Community’s Corporate Responsibility Index is a positive 
indication that we are striking the right balance between  
the demands of our many stakeholders as well as the  
needs of both the short and long-term.
Demonstrating resilience
Despite our strong performance, we are not complacent. 
Our commitments and ambitions get more stretching over 
the remainder of the current Asset Management Period (AMP) 
and the resilience of our business continues to be tested 
frequently. I am proud to say the Company and colleagues 
have responded well to the challenges presented in 2016/17.
For example, following the floods of late 2015 we have 
continued to make excellent progress towards recovering 
the pipes, pumping stations and treatment works that were 
damaged by the winter deluge. The flooding contributed to 
a reduction in compliance with our waste water treatment 
works discharge permits down from 99.32% to 97.61%.
In addition, flood damage to our thermal hydrolysis plant in 
Bradford caused us to miss our Performance Commitment 
for renewable energy generation. I am pleased to report that 
the plant is now performing well and we expect to meet our 
future energy generation targets, and exceed them by 2020.
We have gone beyond the simple recovery of our assets. In 
February, we announced a new natural flood management 
plan for the Calder Valley where various flood management 
initiatives will be implemented over the next ten years, 
including the planting of 200,000 trees to ‘slow the flow’  
from moorland catchments above Gorpley Reservoir.  
This forms part of a multi-agency response to the flooding 
issues faced by local communities.
Collaboration has always been, and remains, a key part of 
the Company’s values and we are working closely with local 
councils, the Environment Agency, community groups and 
conservationists to implement this innovative work.
In July 2016, the actions of a third party led to the 
contamination of water supplies in Thorne, near Doncaster. 
Thanks to the efforts of our field team, supplies were quickly 
returned to normal, with immediate action taken to protect 
customer safety. Legal action has been undertaken against 
the third party and measures have been taken to prevent 
reoccurrence. The Drinking Water Inspectorate praised our 
‘swift’ response and willingness to share our learnings with 
other UK water companies.
While drinking water quality within Yorkshire remained 
excellent with 99.962% of hundreds of thousands of  
samples meeting stringent regulatory standards, we  
missed our stretching Performance Commitment for the 
number of customer contacts regarding water quality.
We achieved our Performance Commitment for pollution 
incidents in 2016/17, continuing the long-term trend of 
reducing the number of ‘serious’ (Category 1 and 2) pollution 
incidents caused by our assets or operations. However, we 
were also fined during the year for two pollution incidents 
that occurred in 2013. These fines served to reinforce our 
environmental responsibilities, as well as our need for constant 
vigilance and excellent asset and operational management.
We are also continuing to ensure the long-term financial 
resilience of our business. I am pleased that we have reduced 
gearing levels and continued to implement our new plans to 
manage our portfolio of index-linked swaps.
Building trust
During the remainder of this report we provide a detailed 
breakdown of all key aspects of our performance for the year 
2016/17 and how we’re performing against our longer-term 
Strategic Business Objectives.
It is important to us that our customers and stakeholders 
can trust the information we publish, which is why we were 
extremely disappointed to be placed in the lower ‘prescribed’ 
category by Ofwat in the latest assessment under their 
Company Monitoring Framework. In response, we have 
consulted with our customers on a new assurance plan which 
was published in early 2017. We have also carried out a major 
review of the governance, quality and assurance of all our 
regulatory and corporate reports, with a view to improving 
their availability and accessibility.
You’ll see improvements in this publication and our 
other reporting.
We remain committed to being an open, honest 
and transparent company.

Our performance commitments Customer outcomes Our Performance Commitments Customer Outcomes
We are a regulated water and waste water company that 
provides some of life’s most essential services and we 
are a custodian of the natural environment and critical 
infrastructure. We are regulated by three main authorities  
to act in the best interests of the society we serve: the Office  
of Water Services (Ofwat), the Environment Agency (EA),  
and, the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI).
We are part of the Kelda Group and our vision is ‘taking 
responsibility for the water environment for good’. Our vision 
captures our ambition to go beyond regulatory requirements 
and our commitment to long-term sustainability. The essence 
of our vision is doing what is right for customers, colleagues, 
partners, the environment and investors, both in the short 
and long-term. This holistic and integrated approach is critical 
to the sustainability of our essential water and waste water 
services, and of our business.
Putting our customers’ 
priorities at the heart  
of our strategy
Central to our strategy is the delivery of our customers’ 
priorities of us, defined in seven Customer Outcomes which are 
measured by 26 Performance Commitments summarised in the 
diagram below. These were shaped and agreed through our 
engagement with over 30,000 customers and our regulators.
The Performance Commitments set the levels of service we  
are working to achieve across a range of activities which 
customers and regulators confirm are a priority of us; for 
example further reducing pollution incidents and leakage. 
We explain our latest performance against these measures 
throughout this Strategic Report.
The national regulatory regime in which we operate includes 
financial and reputational Outcome Delivery Incentives (ODIs) 
if we under or over perform against some of the Performance 
Commitments. Where financial incentives have been agreed, 
they become applicable only when we reach defined levels  
of service either side of the Performance Commitment.

Performance Commitments and ODIs in our APR at:

Working towards our six 
Strategic Business Objectives
Our strategy goes beyond the regulatory Performance 
Commitments and Customer Outcomes, responding to  
the imperative to ensure the long-term affordability and 
resilience of our essential services. To ensure long-term 
sustainability, we manage a programme of activity that  
drives us towards our vision and six Strategic Business 
Objectives (SBOs). Our SBO programme includes a suite  
of annual targets on activities that drive us towards  
medium-term milestones and long-term deliverables.  
Our SBOs shape everything we do and encompass all  
our material issues as a business: environmental, financial  
and social.
Page 12
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Sustainability is an imperative 
within our strategy
Through our 25-year planning process we monitor a range 
of external influences that are shaping our business and 
services. We use this insight to shape our strategy and plans 
to ensure we are effectively preparing for the long-term to 
strengthen our resilience and ensure our ongoing ability to 
deliver the Customer Outcomes and SBOs. The latest and best 
evidence repeatedly shows increasing pressure from a range 
of factors including, for example, climate change, population 
growth and resource constraints. We observe an imperative 
for change as a company whose core business fundamentally 
relies on financial, natural and social resources.
We are embedding the concept of the Capitals, shown 
below, into our longer-term business planning, to help us 
ensure the affordability and resilience of our essential public 
services for current and future generations. The Capitals are 
the valuable assets which are critical to the success of any 
organisation. Considering positive and negative impacts, 
and dependencies, across the Capitals helps an organisation 
improve understanding of inherent risk, value and trade-offs 
so that more sustainable approaches can be targeted. 
Effective management of the Capitals helps ensure the 
resilience of our business.
We are working to apply the Capitals to enhance our resilience 
by further improving our risk management, decision making 
and investment choices. We have instigated a range of 
projects to examine our impacts and dependencies across the 
Capitals, assessing a range of economic, environmental and 
social attributes associated with our activities and considering 
both our negative and positive impacts to society.
Continually developing  
our strategy
As with any meaningful strategy, ours continues to evolve in 
response to internal and external developments. Over the last 
year we have been developing our corporate strategy beyond 
2020. Before the end of 2017/18 we will publish a report 
outlining our strategy to ensure we can maintain affordable 
and resilient services that achieve our Customer Outcomes and 
SBOs long into the future. 
This strategy will set the context for our Water Resources 
Management Plan (WRMP) and Price Review business plan. 
In turn, this will help us ensure the action we take in the next 
five-year investment cycle from 2020 to 2025, known as Asset 
Management Period 7 (AMP7), will deliver the necessary 
progress towards long-term needs and goals. Our customers 
and stakeholders help shape our plans through a range of 
ongoing participation activities, with more information on this

and waste water treatment works compliance. This approach aligns with the EA’s new reporting approach in their EPA. ^This gearing figure

SIM is the water industry regulatory measure of customer 
service, reporting a score out of a maximum 100 points 
through an independent assessment of each UK water 
company. We again improved our SIM score over the last  
12 months, from 82.6 points last year to 83.4 this year.  
This overall SIM score is made up of two elements:
•   75% of the score is determined through a qualitative 
independent survey of customer perceptions of our service. 
From a maximum score of five points we scored 4.42 points 
in 2016/17, improved from 4.39 in 2015/16.
•   25% of the score is determined through our performance 
on a range of quantitative customer service indicators, 
for example the number of repeat customer contacts. 
We scored 19.24 out of a maximum 25 points, improved 
from 19.08 in 2015/16.
Our improved overall SIM score confirms we have achieved 
our Performance Commitment and follows continued 
implementation of our ongoing service improvement plan. 
It is a business priority to continue improving our SIM score 
and relative performance, striving to be first in the water 
industry SIM by 2020. As such, SIM performance forms part 
of our remuneration incentive plan, described in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
We strive to be a leader in service across all sectors, as 
measured by the comparison by the UK Customer Services 
Institute. In January 2017, our service was ranked the best in 
the UK water sector with 80 out of 100 points, second in the 
whole utilities sector. This was an increase from 77 points the 
previous year.
We have also further reduced the number of Service 
Commitment failures in 2016/17, down to 10,356 (2015/16: 
10,567), remaining on track to achieve this Performance 
Commitment.
Our Customer Promise is to be easy to deal with, helpful and 
friendly, and get it right first time. Developing processes and 
behaviours against these promises has helped us deliver a 
16% reduction in written complaints and a 39% reduction 
in those complaints needing to be escalated. In contrast, 
the number of repeat telephone calls has risen this year and 
our focus for 2017/18 is to reduce the need for customers to 
contact us unnecessarily about the same issue. More about 
our Customer Promise can be found online at:  
www.yorkshirewater.com/codeofpractice
CCW complete an independent survey of customer 
satisfaction each year. The latest results again show high levels 
of overall customer satisfaction: 93% for water services and 
91% for waste water services. This is a slight reduction on 
the previous year when we saw 95% satisfaction with our 
water services and 92% with our waste water services. While 
we strive for continual improvement in this measure, we are 
pleased to be achieving our Performance Commitment to 
improve average satisfaction scores this AMP compared to the 
last one, for both water and waste water services. As last year, 
our scores are above the industry average.
This latest position on the Performance Commitments and 
other measures mentioned above show that we have been 
effectively delivering our Customer Outcome ‘We provide 
the level of customer service you expect and value’. Further 
improving customer service remains one of our top priorities.
As of April 2017, businesses, charities and public sector 
customers in England could choose their water and waste 
water services retailer. This national change was enabled by 
the Water Act 2014. We have prepared for the opening of the 
new water retail market to ensure high quality services and 
our compliance with the Competition Act 1998. For example, 
we have separated our retail activities from the rest of our 
Yorkshire Water business. We are working to withdraw from 
the non-household retail market as part of our strategy to 
focus on our wholesale and household retail activities. 
At the time of publication, we are in discussions with a 
potential buyer of our non-household retail business. 
While these discussions are proceeding to plan there can 
be no certainty that a sale will be agreed, although it is the 
Board’s expectation that this will be the case. 
The Water Act 2014 introduces measures beyond retail 
separation, including abstraction licence reform and water 
trading. These are discussed in the Water Efficient Regions 
SBO section.
Ensuring reliable services today and for the future
We invest to maintain and enhance our infrastructure to 
ensure stable and reliable services. We monitor and report 
our effectiveness in this area through four Stability and 
Reliability Performance Commitments. Our trend for achieving 
‘stable’ performance in all four categories has continued into 
2016/17. We report more information on each of these four 
Performance Commitments in the relevant SBO sections 
of this report.
Our services are highly reliable, for example we have one of 
the most resilient water supply services in the UK. However, 
there is a limit to the level of resilience designed into any 
system because of engineering capability and affordability. 
Extreme weather, terrorism, cyber-attack, and other significant 
events could damage our assets, interrupt services, threaten 
human safety and pollute the environment, thereby impacting 
our reputation and costs. We manage risks to all hazards 
through our management processes which have worked well 
through numerous emergency events in recent years.
Our cyclical approach to long-term planning ensures the 
action we take in the short-term is effectively contributing 
towards the region’s long-term needs, including preparations 
for strategic influences such as climate change and population 
growth. By the end of 2017/18 we will publish a report on 
our strategy to ensure the affordability and resilience of our 
essential services over the next 25 years. In parallel, we are 
developing our latest 25-year Drought Plan and WRMP, which 
will also be published by the end of 2017/18. This work is all 
informing our next Price Review business plan which, when 
finished in 2018, will set out our detailed five-year plan to 
2025, in the context of a high level 25-year plan.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Engaging with customers and stakeholders
We use a range of ongoing activities to engage with 
customers and stakeholders to raise awareness of our work, 
hear from others, and to enable participation in shaping  
our plans. We continue to evolve our approach to expand  
the quality and quantity of engagement and participation,  
for example we have:
•   Introduced our new approach to enable customers to 
participate in shaping our future services.
•   Continued to work with the Yorkshire Forum for Water 
Customers who ensure our customers have a fair say 
in the development of our plans.
•   Launched our Course It’s Better campaign, with our video 
achieving over 1.6m views on social media.
•   Developed our stakeholder contact programme to allow 
them greater input to our plans.
Working in partnership
We are building on years of partnership working to deliver 
greater benefits to society at lower overall cost. Examples of 
our latest partnership projects include:
•   Co-creation of a long-term vision for integrated water 
management in Hull and the surrounding area, working 
with Hull City Council, East Riding of Yorkshire Council, 
the EA and others.
•   Committing our land to a long-term natural flood 
management initiative in the Calder Valley with the White 
Rose Forest Partnership, and others, that will start with 
200,000 trees being planted along with other measures 
to ‘slow the flow’.
•   As part of the river Don Partnership we have provided 
financial support to a programme to install five more 
fish passes, adding to our recent programme of fish 
pass installations at other locations.
•   Introducing an innovative management approach at our 
tenanted Humberstone Bank Farm. Bringing a range of 
stakeholders together to implement a vision for managing 
the site ‘Beyond Nature’, whereby the needs of a range 
of stakeholders are considered in balance to maximise 
societal value.
•   Teaming up with Experience Community to improve paths 
around our reservoirs to better meet the needs 
of wheelchair users.
These and other examples have ensured we continue to 
achieve our Performance Commitment to deliver initiatives by 
‘working with others’. Collaboration is critical to achieving our 
Customer Outcomes and SBOs.
Supporting our community
We support a variety of organisations and with the help of  
our colleagues deliver a range of community activities through  
our community programmes:
•   Education - raising awareness of the value of water. In 2016 
we celebrated our 100,000th visitor to our water education 
centres. In Spring 2017 we re-opened our water education 
centre at Ewden water works in Sheffield, offering free visits 
for primary school children.
•   Environment - playing a key role as one of Yorkshire’s largest 
landowners. For example, in 2016/17 we built a new visitor 
centre at our Tophill Low nature reserve in North Yorkshire, 
including a new water environment education programme.
•   Empowerment - providing opportunities for colleagues  
to share skills through employee-supported volunteering. 
For example, we support Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM) development with primary and 
secondary school children, raising awareness of future  
career options through events during Women in  
Engineering Week.
In addition to our ongoing community programmes, we are 
supporting the City of Hull in its role as UK City of Culture in 
2017. This is helping us to reinforce our role providing social, 
economic and environmental benefits in Hull. Looking ahead, 
we have recently joined Yorkshire Bank and Yorkshire Building 
Society to give our combined backing to the City of Leeds’ bid 
to become European Capital of Culture in 2023.
Securing customer and stakeholder trust
We work to build stakeholder trust through everything we do, 
including all the activity we describe throughout this Trusted 
Company SBO section. As a regional monopoly provider of 
essential services, we recognise the imperative for high levels 
of trust in our approach.
We recognise the role of the media in contributing to 
stakeholder understanding of, and trust in, our business 
and services. We work with all strands of the media to raise 
awareness of our activities and respond to media interest. 
We track media coverage of our business activities and met 
our 2016/17 target for at least 65% of coverage to 
be positive in nature.
We use the Business in the Community (BiTC) Corporate 
Responsibility Index to benchmark our performance as a 
responsible business. Following internal improvements, 
particularly on diversity and inclusion, we achieved top marks 
of five stars in 2016/17, achieving our SBO commitment.  
We will strive to maintain this performance, and further 
improve, to remain a leader in responsible business.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements As we state at the outset of this report, we always want  
to provide you with information you can trust. When we  
don’t get it right, we risk losing trust and confidence.  
Ofwat assessed us to be in the Prescribed category of their 
Company Monitoring Framework, highlighting concerns about 
our ability to provide sufficient confidence and assurance 
about our delivery, monitoring and performance reporting. 
In response, we completed a thorough review of our 
approach, including external consultation. We published our 
Assurance Plan to explain the process we have in place to give 
confidence that the information we publish is accurate and 
accessible. We also continue to work closely with the Yorkshire 
Forum for Water Customers to ensure our performance 
reporting meets customers and stakeholders needs. 
You can find our Assurance Plan on our website at:

Securing colleague trust
Through our ongoing engagement activities and improvement 
programme we are working to maintain and further enhance 
our strong colleague-company relationships. In 2016/17 we 
introduced a more extensive colleague engagement survey, 
with the latest survey securing a 67% response rate and 
concluding an average overall engagement score of 78%. 
This engagement score is calculated from all colleagues 
responses to a range of engagement and perception 
questions. We will be monitoring performance over time and 
are using the new approach to better understand colleague 
perceptions and areas for further improvement. Local teams 
discuss the results and agree improvement plans, and further 
consideration is provided to cross-business needs at 
directorate and company level.
We discuss the diversity and development of our people  
in the Sustainable Resources SBO section of this report. 
Further information on colleague engagement and inclusion  
is provided in the section ‘Employees and employment 
policies’ in the Directors’ Report.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Putting people’s health, safety and wellbeing first
As part of our overall Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) 
strategy we continued to develop our OH&S management 
system in line with our long-term aim to secure external 
certification to external standards.
During 2016/17, we made significant progress in our OH&S 
performance as we continued to develop and deliver our 
OH&S improvement plan. A new Director of Health and 
Safety, and additional OH&S professionals, were recruited. 
A detailed review of high hazard site risks was completed 
across the Company, and significant investment was made in 
process safety management to understand the risks of major 
accident hazards and implement control measures. Underlying 
performance has improved, with a 20% decrease in the 
number of LTIs and further reduction in sickness absence rates. 
Looking ahead we will be focusing on the incident rate of 
LTIs per 100,000 hours worked. This is in keeping with the 
water industry approach and will enable us to compare our 
performance. We are targeting a rate of no more than 0.42 
LTIs per 100,000 hours in 2016/17. LTI Rates (or LTIR) forms 
part of our remuneration incentive plan, described in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
We developed and started to roll-out a series of ten new 
Life Saving Rules in 2016. These rules have been developed to 
protect colleagues and reinforce our health and safety values. 
Our Life Saving Rules set health and safety standards and 
expectations for the most critical activities undertaken 
by colleagues, and are fundamental in reducing our 
operational risk.
Maintaining excellent drinking water quality
Protecting public health is our primary concern. Drinking 
water quality within Yorkshire remains excellent with 99.962% 
of hundreds of thousands of samples meeting stringent 
regulatory standards. This shows improvement from last 
year and achieves our drinking water quality Performance 
Commitment. We have also maintained ‘stable’ status in the 
Performance Commitment for the stability and reliability of 
water quality. The status of this Commitment is determined 
by a basket of measures which demonstrates the effectiveness 
of our long-term planning and asset management to ensure 
the resilience and sustainability of our service.
We further reduced the number of times customers needed 
to contact us regarding drinking water quality, down to 
9,093 in 2016/17, from 10,007 in 2015/16. However, this 
was not sufficient improvement to achieve the Performance 
Commitment for drinking water quality contacts. While we 
strive to achieve this stretching Performance Commitment, our 
Price Review business plan and funding agreement with 
Ofwat was based on maintaining the level of contacts at or 
around 12,143 contacts each year between 2015 and 2020.
In July 2016, E.coli and related bacteria were found in water 
supplies to around 3,600 consumers in Thorne and Moorends 
villages near Doncaster. We immediately investigated 
to identify the cause and we took action to protect and 
communicate with consumers. The source was identified as 
a chicken processing plant that had modified its pipework 
without notifying Yorkshire Water to inspect it: something 
that it is legally obliged to do. Several physical barriers have 
since been put in place to prevent future contamination of 
the water network from this processing plant. The company 
operating the factory has been charged with offences under 
the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999, pleading 
not guilty at a hearing in March 2017. A trial is scheduled in 
September 2017.
The DWI praised the ‘swift’ and ‘appropriate’ actions we took 
to minimise the risk to public health, and the rapid steps we 
took to share our learning from the incident with other water 
companies. We provided a £30 goodwill payment to affected 
customers to help compensate for the disruption.
Despite the above incident we have again delivered good 
performance on the number of corrective actions relating to 
drinking water quality events, for example where we might 
need to inform customers to boil their water before drinking 
it. We had three events with corrective actions in 2016/17, 
achieving our Performance Commitment for no more 
than six incidents.
The Performance Commitments mentioned above 
demonstrate our ongoing effective approach to delivering the 
Customer Outcome ‘We provide you with water that is clean 
and safe to drink’. We are continually striving to maintain and 
improve drinking water quality by improving our assets and 
processes, and by engaging with others who have a key role, 
including customers and the agricultural sector. 
In response to deteriorating raw water quality in many of our 
catchments we have increased our work in those catchments, 
we discuss this in the section on the Excellent Catchments, 
Rivers and Coasts SBO.
Page 24
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Managing flood risk
We play our part in managing flood risk by providing a 
public drainage network and collaborating with other flood 
management agencies to support a joined-up approach to 
both short-term incidents and long-term plans. We continue 
to invest in the region’s drainage network and reduce the 
number of properties at risk from sewer flooding, for example 
by removing sewer blockages and maintaining sewer capacity. 
We have maintained ‘stable’ status in the Performance 
Commitment for the Stability and Reliability of our waste 
water networks. The status of this commitment is determined 
by a basket of measures which demonstrates the effectiveness 
of our long-term planning and asset management to ensure 
the resilience and sustainability of our service.
In 2016/17, we again achieved our Performance Commitments 
for internal and external sewer flooding. The number of 
internal sewer flooding incidents reduced on the previous 
year while the number of external sewer flooding incidents 
increased, but still achieving the required level of the 
Performance Commitment. While we strive for continual 
reduction, the Performance Commitments we agreed with 
customers and Ofwat allows for an annual increase in the 
number of sewer flooding incidents because of growing 
pressure from factors including climate change and 
new development.
We have continued to respond to the widespread flooding 
experienced across the region in late 2015. These floods 
impacted over 10,000 homes and businesses across Yorkshire 
and damaged many of our assets. The Government has since 
committed £200m to improve flood defences in Yorkshire. 
We have undertaken substantial operational and investment 
activities to respond to the initial emergency and the resultant 
damage to our assets. £56m of costs have been covered by an 
insurance claim.
We continually invest across the region and collaborate with 
others to reduce flood risk. Below we provide examples of 
some of our recent progress:
•   In Calderdale, we are contributing to a multi-agency 
Flood Action Plan that will see over 1,600 homes and 
businesses better protected. We are leading the natural 
flood management element of the plan to enhance 
mitigation in the upstream catchments. We have also 
committed £36.3m relating to our assets, and a further 
£50m has been committed by the EA and others.
•   In and around Hull, we have reduced flood risk to 15,000 
homes with the completion of a new £16m storm water 
pumping station in Bransholme. The new station provides 
around four times the pumping capacity of its predecessor. 
We also continue to work with relevant agencies in the area 
to develop the long-term approach.
•   In Goole, we have continued to invest at Carr Lane pumping 
station, adding a further £3.6m investment to our recent 
£3.8m. This latest investment has enhanced reliability of the 
pumps and reduced odour and noise for neighbours of the 
pumping station. There are also continuing investigations 
into other flood management measures for the Goole area.
Preventing pollution from our network
The number of pollution incidents from our sewer network 
has reduced over recent years, albeit fluctuating each year 
because sewer performance is influenced by the weather. We 
achieved our pollution incidents Performance Commitment 
in 2016/17 for both serious pollution incidents classed as 
Category 1 or 2 by the EA, and other pollution incidents 
which are classed as Category 3. We recognise the need 
to go further and we are working to achieve the ambitious 
Performance Commitment for zero serious incidents in 2019. 
However, we also recognise that consistently achieving this 
Commitment will be challenging.
During 2016/17 we were prosecuted for the following 
pollution incidents that took place in 2013. Fines for 
these offences are higher than historically typical following 
a 2014 revision to the guidelines for sentencing 
environmental offences.
•  In April 2016, we were fined a total of £1.1m for three 
offences at Naburn waste water treatment works.
•  In August 2016, we were fined £350,000 for a pollution 
incident from a combined sewer overflow in Harrogate 
caused by a plank of wood being put into the sewer 
and a delay in our response.
One of our Customer Outcomes is ‘We take care of your 
waste water and protect you and the environment from sewer 
flooding’. We show satisfactory performance on this Outcome, 
and the need for continued improvement, when examining 
latest progress towards the Performance Commitments and 
related activities which we have discussed here and in the 
above Managing flood risk section.
We explain more about our work to protect the water 
environment in the Excellent Catchments, Rivers and Coasts 
SBO section of this report.
Page 25
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Adopting private pumping stations
Ownership and maintenance responsibility for private pumping 
stations transferred to the regulated water companies on 
30 September 2016, following a national change. We took 
ownership of around 371 private sewage pumping stations 
located across our region, all of varying age, condition and 
size. We inherited a low level of understanding about these 
pumping stations and there may be further stations we take 
ownership of as more sites are identified. We have been 
preparing for this transfer over recent years, making plans to 
assess each station and ensure the necessary investment and 
maintenance arrangements.
Supporting global safe water
We have a history of supporting those in developing countries 
who do not have access to safe water and sanitation. The Big 
Wish for Ethiopia is our strategic partnership with WaterAid 
that will deliver knowledge sharing on water and sanitation, 
provide infrastructure support and much more. Our SBO 
commitment is to raise £1m for WaterAid to support projects 
that will transform lives in Ethiopia. Three years into our 
five-year campaign, we are well ahead of plan having already 
raised over £730,000 through donations from colleagues, 
customers, partners and the Company. Our Big Wish for 
Ethiopia goes beyond fundraising, including exchange visits 
to share our skills and experience, and a youth engagement 
programme to raise awareness in schools.

Page 27
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Reducing pollution and enhancing river water quality
We collect, treat and return about one billion litres of waste 
water safely back to the environment every day. We have 
delivered a range of benefits for society through a step 
change to the region’s water environment since water 
industry privatisation. We have maintained ‘stable’ status in 
the Performance Commitment for the stability and reliability 
of our waste water quality. The status of this Commitment 
is determined by a basket of measures which demonstrates 
the effectiveness of our long-term planning and asset 
management to ensure the resilience and sustainability  
of our service.
We remain on track in the delivery of our programme 
of environmental investment which contributes to our 
Performance Commitment to improve 440km of 
river by 2020.
The EA annually completes an Environmental Performance 
Assessment (EPA) of the water companies in England, 
examining performance on a range of environmental 
compliance matters such as pollution incidents and waste 
water treatment works compliance. The EA have classified 
our 2016 calendar year performance as a ‘Good Company’, 
with three out of a maximum four stars in their new rating 
system. This overall EPA classification is not comparable to 
previous years because the EA have changed how they report 
performance in this assessment. 
In their new approach to the EPA, the EA have expanded the 
metric previously examining waste water treatment works 
discharge permit compliance to also capture water treatment 
works permit compliance. The EA report our overall treatment 
works compliance in the 2016 calendar year was 97.2%.  
While this was not reported last year in the EA’s previous 
approach to the EPA, we can report that this compares to a 
2015 performance of 99.0%. 
Seven of our more than 600 waste water treatment works 
did not meet their discharge permit conditions in 2016, 
securing 97.61% compliance. This was a reduced performance 
compared to 2015 when we had only two failing waste 
water works or 99.32% compliance. Five of the seven failures 
occurred in the first half of 2016 while we diverted resources 
to respond to the impacts of the severe floods of late 2015. 
This, and other factors, contributed to this lower than normal 
performance which recovered in the latter half of 2016. It 
is our aim to achieve high levels of performance and drive 
towards 100% compliance.
Two of our 20 permitted water treatment works did not meet 
their discharge permit conditions in 2016. This compared to 
one failing water works in 2015. We have put action plans 
in place at both sites to improve performance and we have 
no failing water treatments works in 2017 at the time of this 
publication. Please note that we operate a further 29 water 
works which do not require a discharge permit. 
While delivering environmental water quality benefits, new 
waste water treatment capabilities can be financially expensive 
and carbon intensive. In 2015, we made six commitments 
to the Government’s Infrastructure Carbon Review to work 
in partnership and use innovative solutions to protect both 
the atmospheric and aquatic environments. We discuss our 
progress against these commitments in the Sustainable 
Resources SBO section.
We also invest to protect the water environment from 
pollution caused by escapes from our sewer network; 
we discuss this in the Safe Water SBO section of 
this report.
Investing in the region’s bathing waters
Our recent £110m investment to enhance Yorkshire’s coastal 
water quality ensured our assets were ready to comply with 
the tighter requirements of the revised Bathing Water Directive 
which came into effect in 2015. The table below shows the 
number of Yorkshire’s formally designated bathing waters 
which meet each of the water quality categories of the revised 
Bathing Water Directive.
Bathing water quality classification 2016 2015
Excellent 11 10
Good 6 8
Sufficient 1 1
Poor 1 1
The total number of designated bathing beaches in 
Yorkshire reduced by one in 2016 when Staithes beach was 
removed from the formal list by the Government, taking 
the total from 20 to 19.
We achieved our Performance Commitment to maintain at 
least 15 beaches at the Excellent or Good legislative standard, 
which goes beyond the minimum Sufficient standard. 
Scarborough South beach has reduced in water quality over 
the past few years and is currently classified as ‘Poor’. There 
are many factors and organisations which contribute to 
bathing water quality and the cause of the deterioration at 
Scarborough South beach is currently unknown. The EA is 
investigating to inform future action.
Of the eight resort beaches in Yorkshire, four will be able 
to apply for the coveted Blue Flag in 2017. A Blue Flag 
demonstrates that a beach complies with a range of standards 
including water quality, provision of information and other 
requirements. We have a role in ensuring some of these 
standards but a range of other organisations and factors also 
have critical influence on Blue Flag status. While we delivered 
the waste water treatment standards required to achieve Blue 
Flags at all eight resort beaches in Yorkshire, third parties have 
more to do to meet the required standards. We continue 
to work closely with the EA, local councils and other key 
stakeholders through the Yorkshire Bathing Water Partnership 
to help in achieving eight Blue Flags in Yorkshire.
Page 28
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Protecting raw water quality
The quality of the water we take from the environment 
has been deteriorating in some areas over recent decades, 
because of pollution, unsustainable land management 
practices and climate change. The more polluted raw water 
is, the more treatment is needed to make it fit for drinking. 
We respond with a twin-track approach, enhancing water 
treatment capabilities to ensure high quality drinking water at 
the customers’ tap (discussed in the Safe Water SBO section), 
and addressing problems at source through our catchment 
management programme (discussed here).
Peat moorlands are important because they are the source for 
a large proportion of drinking water in Yorkshire. The water 
sourced from degraded peatland requires extra treatment to 
remove contaminants picked up in the run-off from eroded 
soils. We work in partnership to maintain and restore parts 
of Yorkshire’s peatland by re-introducing native plants, 
managing invasive species and blocking man-made drains to 
slow the water flow and restore the water table. Through our 
collaborative working, we are increasingly active and effective 
in peatland management and are growing the amount of land 
being restored, however there is also much more to do, by us 
and others, to fully protect raw water quality.
We also collaborate with the EA, Natural England and the 
National Farmers Union to protect water catchments by 
developing Safeguard Zone Action Plans. We have agreed a 
programme of work to help address diffuse sources of water 
pollution between 2015 and 2020. This includes working with 
the agriculture sector, for example, to encourage farmers to 
follow best practice when using metaldyhyde slug control 
pellets. We are also investigating nitrate and other pollutants 
that present risks to several of our groundwater sources.
Managing our land to maximise value
With approximately 28,000 hectares of land, we are one  
of the largest land owners in Yorkshire. While managing  
our land with the primary purpose to protect water quality, 
we also seek to maximise wider benefits for society, such as 
biodiversity, recreation and climate change mitigation. To help 
us further enhance the business and societal value generated 
from our land, we are using financial, natural and social capital 
to shape our decision making.
We are on track with our programme of work to deliver 
our Performance Commitment to conserve and enhance 
11,736Ha of land by 2020, much of which we are delivering 
in partnership with others. One example of our activity here 
is the provision of financial support to the North York Moors 
National Park Authority, to enable control programmes of 
non-native invasive species. Some invasive species have spread 
rapidly along watercourses to smother native plants during 
the summer, before dying back in the winter leaving the river 
bank without stabilising vegetation, and therefore vulnerable 
to erosion. We are also contributing to a similar project, River 
2015, in partnership with the EA and Yorkshire Wildlife 
Trust to support volunteers to remove Japanese Knotweed

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Most of our land is tenanted to farmers. An example of 
our developing Capitals thinking is our implementation of 
an innovative, partnership approach to managing our farm 
tenancies ‘Beyond Nature’. This is our vision for the delivery 
of multiple outcomes from our land, tailored to each local 
site to improve water quality, biodiversity and carbon storage 
while supporting agricultural production. In Summer 2016 
we started towards this approach at Humberstone Bank 
Farm, welcoming a local farmer to take over the tenancy. 
More recently we have identified our next sites to add to this 
new management regime and we have held positive early 
discussions with the current farm tenants.
We provide a range of recreational opportunities by 
providing open access to much of our rural estate. 
One of our Performance Commitments is to survey 
recreational visitors to our sites and publish the results. 
Our surveys show that users consistently report high levels 
of visitor satisfaction, most recently reporting 97% visitor 
satisfaction. Following consultation in 2015 we have been 
enhancing the number and diversity of those able to take 
recreational value from our land. For example, during 2016/17 
we worked in partnership with Experience Community to 
improve paths for wheelchair using visitors to our reservoir 
recreation sites. Find out more about our recreational offering 
on our website at: www.yorkshirewater.com/run
All the activity we discuss above in this SBO Chapter on 
Excellent Catchments, Rivers and Coasts demonstrates strong 
performance in working towards our Customer Outcome 
‘We protect and improve the water environment’. 
We recognise there is more to do and we continue 
to escalate our efforts.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Securing water supplies
We treat and supply around 1.3 billion litres of drinking water 
each day, delivered by operating and maintaining our water 
treatment works and distribution network. Following our 
investments, Yorkshire has had no service restrictions, such 
as hosepipe bans, since the drought in 1995/96. We have 
maintained ‘stable’ status in the Performance Commitment for 
the stability and reliability of our water networks. The status of 
this commitment is determined by a basket of measures which 
demonstrates the effectiveness of our long-term planning and 
asset management to ensure the resilience and sustainability 
of our service.
The risk of water shortages or supply interruptions is a 
constant priority for us because of the consequences to 
our customers, operations and finances. Our operational 
and investment programme includes a range of activity to 
maintain and enhance services, for example increasing storage 
in the water distribution network, managing pressure in the 
network, and installing further data loggers to enhance our 
visibility of the network. Water efficiency is also central to our 
plans and we describe this below.
We sometimes need to temporarily interrupt customers 
water supplies to undertake emergency and planned 
maintenance. We have further reduced the time we interrupt 
our customers’ water service, measured by monitoring the 
average interruption per property served. At under ten 
minutes in 2016/17, we have performed well ahead of the 
Performance Commitment of nearly 13 minutes. We recognise 
the inconvenience any interruption to water supplies can cause 
to customers, so we continue to optimise existing approaches 
and innovate further to help us bring this figure even lower.
Our investments have greatly enhanced the resilience of our 
water service, but droughts could still impact customers’ water 
supplies in extreme circumstances. Our Drought Plan contains 
a framework of options to tailor a management response 
to the exact conditions of any drought as it develops. Our 
planning enables us to act quickly because preferred options 
have been assessed for their potential environmental impact, 
and mitigation strategies developed.
Our WRMP describes how we will maintain the balance 
between water supply and demand over the next 25 years. 
Our assessments for our current WRMP show that climate 
change presents a growing threat to our ability to maintain 
the balance between supply and demand. We are well placed 
to manage this threat because water resource management 
is our most mature area of resilience and planning. We have 
enhanced the resilience of our water service by developing a 
grid to connect the mix of water supply options in Yorkshire 
so that we can move water to where it is needed.
Our Drought Plan and WRMP can be found at: 
www.yorkshirewater.com/resources
We are currently updating our Drought Plan and WRMP, 
which we do every five years. We will publish our latest 
plans for consultation before the end of 2017.
Reducing the Company’s own water use
We seek to demonstrate our leadership in the efficiency of 
our operational use of water, especially potable water. Over 
recent years we have undertaken a range of activities to better 
understand our operational water consumption and to identify 
opportunities to save more water in our operational activities. 
We aspire to achieve the Carbon Trust Standard for Water 
to externally verify our leadership in this area. To deliver this 
ambition we have identified the need to enhance the level at 
which we monitor our operational water consumption. We 
are developing a programme of operational water efficiency 
opportunities, including increased monitoring, that we will 
consider for prioritisation alongside all our investment needs as 
we optimise our Price Review business plan for AMP7.
Sustainably minimising leakage
We measure, report and reduce leakage as the dominant 
source of water waste. Approximately two thirds of total 
leakage is from our distribution network and one third is from 
customers’ supply pipes. We have almost halved leakage since 
1995 and this year we have again achieved our Performance 
Commitment to ensure leakage is no higher than 297.1Ml/d. 
This target figure is the Sustainable Economic Level of Leakage 
(SELL), an industry methodology that defines the optimum 
level of leakage based on a suite of economic, environmental 
and social considerations. We typically work to keep leakage 
levels slightly below the SELL to provide extra security in our 
ability to meet the supply demand balance.
In 2016/17, we lost 295.2Ml/d through leakage: this is an 
increase on the previous year, which is in keeping with our aim 
to return leakage to a level just below the SELL. By 2020 we 
will further reduce our leakage target in line with the SELL, to 
no more than 287.1Ml/d.
Page 32
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Working with customers to save water
We support and encourage our domestic and business 
customers to save water. Our goal is to deliver tangible water 
efficiencies and sustainable behavioural change. In 2016/17, 
we helped our customers save over 7Ml/d by providing free 
water saving devices and a range of advice and support 
services. This has helped us achieve our Performance 
Commitment for Water Use, with per capita consumption 
reduced from 141.7l/h/d in 2015/16 to 137.4 l/h/d in 2016/17. 
We also use this data (represented as total demand) as one 
of the measures in our remuneration incentive package, with 
further details available in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
later in this ARFS. 
More information can be found on the water efficiency 
section of our website at: www.yorkshirewater.com/save
Reforming abstraction licences and 
encouraging water trading
The Water Act 2014 introduced new provisions to further 
improve the country’s water efficiency and resilience, for 
example by making it easier for organisations to buy and 
sell water from each other. We have traded water with our 
neighbouring water companies for many years and we are 
assessing the costs and benefits of a broad range of options as 
we update our WRMP to determine the optimal approach to 
meet the supply demand balance in our region over the next 
five and 25 years. Currently, we have an import agreement 
with Severn Trent Water to use water from the Derwent Valley 
to support demand in the Sheffield area. We also export a 
small amount of treated water from the Finningley area to 
Anglian Water to support their needs.
The Government is working to reform the abstraction licence 
regime and we are engaged with Defra, UK Water Industry 
Research (UKWIR) and Water UK to monitor and inform the 
evolving national approach.
One of our Customer Outcomes is ‘We make sure that you 
always have enough water’. The latest report on Performance 
Commitments and our other activities in the Water Efficient 
Regions SBO show effective performance towards this 
Outcome. We remain focussed on this area to ensure 
resilience and efficiency in the face of the changing climate 
and growing population.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Attracting great people and maintaining  
the skills we need 
Our people are critical to the success of our business and 
services. We recognise the need to ensure sustainable 
human resources, for example by managing our ageing 
workforce and developing our people with the skills needed 
in our increasingly technical operations. We have continued 
to develop and train our people, and ensure a fair reward 
package, through a wide range of activities. For example in 
2016/17 we:
•   Joined others to form the Energy and Utilities Skills 
Partnership, launching the Workforce Renewal and 
Skills Strategy for the utilities sector to help address the  
skills gap.
•   Continued to develop and extend our apprentice 
programme, hiring nine more apprentices and launching our 
first apprenticeship involving a degree course. We will use 
the Government’s new incentive, the Apprentice Levy, to 
further increase our numbers of apprentice recruits over  
the coming years.
•  Maintained our certification as a Living Wage employer.
Championing diversity
We strive to be as diverse as the society we serve, inclusive 
of all. D&I provides business benefit and supports social 
cohesion. While we recognise we have much more to do, 
we have a growing portfolio of activity and we see increasing 
evidence that our activity is delivering results. For example, 
in 2016/17 we have:
•   Become the first water company to achieve the NES 
following an independent assessment. We have also been 
placed among The Times Top 50 Employers for Women.
•   Improved the diversity of our Board and Management Team 
following the appointment of two female independent  
non-executive directors and an ethnic minority director  
(non-statutory) - find out more about our Board members  
in the Governance Report.
•   Further developed our partnership with the Lighthouse 
Futures Trust, who support children on the autistic 
spectrum, by developing an internship programme to give 
students work experience. We’re now working with the 
Trust to develop this model to roll out across the region.
•   Hosted approximately 250 young female students during 
Women in Engineering Week to raise awareness of STEM 
subjects and career opportunities. We are working to host 
around 300 students this year.
•   Developed, and shared with colleagues, a diversity calendar 
to recognise and support a range of events important to 
different religions and cultures.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements We started reporting information on the ‘gender pay gap’ in 
2015. The average difference between all male and female 
Kelda Group employees was 13.5% when we last assessed 
our position on 31 August 2016. This gap is less than the 
national average and reduced on the previous year. There are 
a number of reasons for this difference between male and 
female average pay, and we will continue to focus on this 
matter. Further information can be found on our website: 
www.keldagroup.com/corporate-responsibility/our-people/
equality,-diversity-and-inclusion.aspx
We discuss how we manage relations with colleagues in the 
Trusted Company SBO section of this report. We also provide 
further detail in the section ‘Employees and Employment 
Policies’ in the Directors’ Report later in this document.
Reducing operational greenhouse gas emissions 
Operational emissions are those produced through the 
activities we undertake to provide our services. We have 
reduced our operational emissions by nearly 30% since 
2008/09, primarily by reducing the amount of electricity 
we use and increasing the amount of renewable electricity 
we generate. Our ongoing ability to maintain the CTS 
demonstrates our performance through an independent 
verification process.
We have seen a fall in our emissions over the last year. 
This is for various reasons, including: 
•   A drop in the carbon intensity of the national grid as 
the UK decarbonises its energy supplies. This accounts 
for nearly two thirds of our emissions’ reduction 
compared to the previous year.
•   Our cessation in the use of fuel oil as we closed 
our incinerators.
•   A reduction in our consumption of natural gas used in  
our waste water treatment processes.
Below we provide diversity statistics relating to those directly employed by Yorkshire Water on 31 March of 
each year shown. The total number of Yorkshire Water employees shows an increase from approximately 2,400 
to 2,700. This change is primarily a result of inter-company transfers within the Kelda Group.

 Reducing embedded greenhouse gas emissions
Embedded emissions are those that result from the purchase 
of goods and the construction of new assets. One of our six 
commitments to the Government’s Infrastructure Carbon 
Review is to reduce the emissions embedded in our capital 
investments. This can be good for the environment and drives 
innovative and partnership solutions that deliver new ways  
to save costs. In 2016/17 we continued to develop our 
approach, for example further improving our carbon models 
by capturing as-built carbon data from our capital investment 
schemes. We have also been working to enhance how we 
incorporate carbon emissions in our new asset management 
optimisation system.
During 2016/17, we became certified to the ISO 55001 
Asset Management Standard. This helps us ensure we follow 
leading best practice approaches will support us in delivering 
further innovation and working towards our ambitious 
carbon commitments.
Managing electricity consumption and costs
Electricity accounts for about 75% of our operational 
emissions and is one of our largest operating costs. 
We work to minimise our electricity consumption and 
maximise our self-generation of renewable energy.
We reduced the amount of electricity we consumed in 
2016/17, down to 569GWh from 578GWh in 2015/16. 
We supplied 10.4% (59GWh) of our electricity needs from 
our own self-generated renewable energy in 2016/17. 
This is down from 11.3% (65GWh) in 2015/16 and does not 
achieve our Performance Commitment to generate 12% of 
our energy needs from renewables. The main reason for this 
performance was that our new thermal hydrolysis energy 
generation plant at Esholt works in Bradford was damaged in 
the 2015/16 floods – this being our largest generation plant. 
It took most of 2016 to get the Esholt energy plant back 
to full working order, during which time we also took the 
opportunity to repair a number of defects in the plant. 
Despite our performance improving at the end of the 
financial year as Esholt came back on line, the poor start 
to the year impacted our overall performance.
Scope 1 emissions are those we directly release to the atmosphere, for example from burning fossil fuels on our sites, driving company vehicles, and releasing gasses 
during treatment processes.
 Scope 2 emissions are those indirectly released to the atmosphere through our purchase of National Grid electricity to pump and treat water and waste water.
 Scope 3 emissions are other indirect emissions. We include business travel on public transport and in private vehicles, activities from outsourced operators and 
emissions from the transmission and distribution of the grid electricity that we purchase.
The difference between total gross and net emissions is the deduction of the small amount of our self-generated electricity that we export for use by others.
Page 38
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements At the time of publication, performance is exceeding the 12% 
level of the Performance Commitment. We expect to achieve 
the Performance Commitment in 2017/18, although we are 
monitoring and managing increased energy consumption 
as we act to mitigate the impact of the very low rainfall 
experienced in our region during parts of 2017.
Despite this temporary dip in performance, we continue 
to invest in our generation capacity to go beyond our 
Performance Commitment, aiming to generate 18% of our 
own electricity needs by 2020. In summer 2016, we finished 
commissioning of our new wind turbine at Old, Whittington 
treatment works in Chesterfield. We have commenced the 
delivery of our £71.9m investment in a sludge treatment and 
anaerobic digestion facility at our Knostrop works in Leeds, 
which will be complete in 2019. Our Board has also recently 
approved further substantial investment in a new anaerobic 
digestion facility at our Huddersfield treatment works, 
enabling the permanent closure of our remaining 
sludge incinerators.
Turning waste into resource
We recognise the need to reduce waste in all its forms: 
monetary, physical and time. Minimising waste is essential 
to help us reduce our environmental impact while remaining 
efficient to keep bills low for customers and provide a 
return to shareholders.
Sewage sludge is a large and renewable resource from 
which we generate renewable energy and create products 
for application to land as a sustainable substitute for 
petrochemical fertilisers and peat composts. We have also 
increased the rates of recycling from our offices, construction 
projects and operational sites. In 2016/17, we continued to 
enhance our waste data and increase recycling rates to 99.3%, 
exceeding our Performance Commitment to divert at least 
94% of our waste from landfill.
We continue to develop our approach because we want 
to maximise resource efficiency, going further than simply 
diverting waste from landfill. We are working on a range of 
projects with resource efficiency principles at their core. We 
have continued to develop our ambition to make Esholt waste 
water treatment works in Bradford a leading demonstration 
of the ‘circular economy’ in practice. The circular economy 
is a concept where society no longer defaults to the linear 
‘take-make-waste’ cycle of modern society, but instead works 
collaboratively and innovatively towards the aspiration for the 
endless reuse of resources. Having invested to make the Esholt 
site almost entirely self-sufficient for its energy needs, we are 
now recovering a large volume of redundant waste water 
filter media as a commercial aggregate. Our sister company, 
KeyLand Developments, is leading this latest phase of work. 
Once the filter material has been recovered, the large footprint 
of redundant filter beds will be redeveloped for sustainable 
economic growth which takes value from currently under-
utilised energy, land and water resources on the site.
Achieving our SBO ambitions throughout 
our supply chain
Our ambition is for our global supply chain to share our 
commitment to the continuous improvement of the 
water environment and wider sustainable development. 
Our sustainable supply chain policy applies across all our 
supply chain activities and seeks to articulate a consistent 
approach with straight forward expectations. Our policy can 
be found at: www.yorkshirewater.com/sites/default/files/
thekeldagroupsustainablesupplychainpolicy.pdf
We work with our supply chain to ensure security of essential 
supplies, reduce demand for depleting natural resources 
and to enable a cycle of social, economic and environmental 
improvements. We encourage a similar message to be passed 
through the supply chain by everyone we work with. We 
have further matured the framework we introduced in 2015 
following our commitment to consistently incorporate a 
holistic set of sustainability criteria in the risk assessment 
for all new contracts.
Our environmental governance and policy 
Our environmental policy recognises that a sustainable water 
and waste water business is dependent on environmentally 
sustainable operations. We are therefore committed to 
integrating environmental best practice and continuous 
improvement through the efficient and effective conduct of 
our business. Central to our environmental governance and 
risk management is our ISO 14001 accredited Environmental 
Management System (EMS). We have been continually 
accredited to the ISO 14001 standard since 2004 and we are 
now preparing for the upcoming changes to the ISO 14001

The activity and plans we describe throughout this Sustainable 
Resources SBO show that we are progressing well towards 
our Customer Outcome ‘We understand our impact on the 
wider environment and act responsibly’. We have ambitions 
to go much further in this area because we recognise the 
importance of these activities for long-term sustainability.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Ensuring affordable water services and 
managing customer debt
We recognise that many customers struggle with the cost of 
living. Our average customer bill is one of the lowest in the UK 
and in 2016/17 was £366, the second lowest. We increased 
average bills by less than the rate of inflation in 2016/17 and 
will cap any rises in our average bill to no more than the value 
of the Retail Price Index (RPI) every year until at least 2019/20.
Non-recovery of customer debt threatens profitability in the 
short-term and may increase bills for paying customers in the 
medium to long-term. The Price Review process incorporates 
an allowance in prices for the cost of debt considered to be 
irrecoverable. To help minimise this cost we operate a range of 
schemes designed to help customers who genuinely struggle 
to pay their bill while having strong processes in place for 
overall debt collection. One of our Performance Commitments 
is to ensure the cost to customers of our bad debt is kept 
at no more than 3.16% of the average bill. We maintained 
and advanced our leading approach to debt management, 
reducing this cost to 2.94% of the average bill in 2016/17.
We offer customers a range of support packages, including a 
‘social tariff’ support scheme, Water Support. Water Support 
is aimed at customers whose household income is assessed 
as being ‘low’ and have a bill over a set threshold (2016/17: 
£420). Under the scheme a customer’s bill will be capped 
at the cost of the average Yorkshire Water bill. We have 
further increased the number of customers we help through 
our support packages, up from nearly 23,000 customers in 
2015/16 to nearly 27,000 in 2016/17. 
Each year, CCW survey water customers about perceived 
value for money. Latest results show that 79% of customers 
agreed our water service was ‘value for money’, and 82% for 
our waste water service. This is a slight reduction compared 
to last year when CCW found 82% and 83% on the water 
and waste water services, respectively. While we strive for 
continual improvement in this measure, we are pleased to be 
achieving our Performance Commitment to improve average 
satisfaction scores this AMP compared to the last one, for 
both water and waste water services. As last year, our scores 
are above the industry average.
The above performance demonstrates that we are delivering 
our Customer Outcome ‘We keep your bills as low as possible’. 
We are committed to keeping bills low and supporting those 
who struggle to pay.
Managing our financial performance
Below, we explain the highlights of our financial performance 
as detailed in the profit and loss account. Our 2016/17 
financial results are consistent with our business plan.
•  The increase in revenue to £1,003.1m (2015/16: £975.8m) is 
largely due to the inflationary annual price increase.
•  Operating costs are tightly managed. Total costs of £717.3m 
(2015/16: £700.6m) are in line with plan except for the 
impact of increased insurance premiums following the 
severe flooding in December 2015. Further cost increases 
are primarily due to the annual pay increase and the 
inflation impact of the water and waste water repair and 
maintenance contracts.
•  Additional exceptional income of £46m has been received 
in 2016/17 following the insurance settlement for the 
December 2015 flood. This follows the £10m received in 
2015/16, making a total insurance payment received of 
£56m. This has been offset by costs associated with the 
ongoing operational mitigation for damaged assets of 
£17.9m. After a small write back of the provision against 
damaged assets, the net credit of £31.5m is included in 
exceptional items (2015/16: £26.5m charge).
•  The above movements in revenue and operating costs result 
in an increase in operating profit excluding exceptional items 
to £285.8m (2015/16: £275.2m). Including exceptional items 
operating profit totals £317.3m (2015/16: £248.7m).
•  Depreciation of £273.5m is consistent with the prior 
year (2015/16: £270.2m).
•  Note 3 sets out a reconciliation of pre-exceptional EBITDA 
of £563.2m (2015/16: £550.7m). The increase on prior year 
is due to the movement in income and operating costs as 
noted above.
•  The net interest payable before exceptional items has 
increased to £213.5m (2015/16: £169.6m). This was primarily 
a result of higher inflation (RPI) leading to higher amounts 
being charged on our index-linked financial instruments.
•  Exceptional fair valuation adjustments total a net 
£466.6m charge in 2016/17 (2015/16: £132.7m net income). 
This is largely due to the movement in fair valuation of 
index-linked swaps we took out in 2007/08. Please see  
the ‘Managing Financial Risk’ section on page 43 for more  
detail. This treatment is in line with our accounting policy 
(note 1) and is disclosed separately due to its material size 
and nature.
•  We are therefore reporting a net loss before taxation for 
2016/17 of £362.8m (2015/16: £211.8m profit). Excluding 
all exceptional items detailed above, this represents an 
underlying net profit of £72.3m (2015/16: £105.6m).
•  We have revalued infrastructure assets as at 31 March 2017 
in line with FRS 102 requirements based on the value in use. 
This revaluation increased the asset value by £280m which 
has been reflected in the revaluation reserve. Please see note 
12 to the Financial Statements for more detail.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Delivering and governing our 
investment programmes 
We have continued to govern the effective and efficient 
delivery of our investment programmes, enhancing our 
approach by better integrating our management of 
operational expenditure (opex) and capital expenditure (capex) 
to move towards a total expenditure (totex) approach. Our 
Board Investment Committee (BIC) uses delegated authority 
from the Board to monitor and direct our investment 
programmes to deliver best value for customers and the 
business. More information about the BIC is provided in the 
Corporate Governance Report later in this ARFS.
Capital expenditure for 2016/17 is £378.6m (2015/16: 
£252.9m). Year two of the current five-year AMP has an 
outturn underspend against the business plan programme of 
£9.0m due largely to rephasing of projects, offset by £8.0m of 
additional expenditure relating to the 2015 floods. 
Managing and governing our 
borrowing requirements
Our treasury operations are controlled centrally by a treasury 
department which operates on behalf of all companies 
in Kelda Group (the Group). Activities are carried out in 
accordance with approved board policies, guidelines and 
procedures. Treasury strategy is designed to manage exposure 
to fluctuations in interest rates, preclude speculation and to 
source and structure the Group’s borrowing requirements.
We use a combination of fixed capital, retained profits, 
long-term loans, finance leases and bank facilities to finance 
our operations. Any funding required is raised by the Group 
treasury department in the name of the appropriate group 
company, operating within the relevant debt covenants. 
Subject to the restrictions required by the Whole Business 
Securitisation (WBS, explained on page 48), funds raised may 
be lent to or from Yorkshire Water Services Limited on a fully 
arm’s length basis. Cash surplus to operating requirements is 
invested in short-term instruments with institutions having a 
long-term rating of at least A-/A-/A3 and a short-term rating 
of at least A1/F1/P1 issued, respectively, by S&P Global Ratings 
(S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Moody’s Investors 
Service (Moody’s).
During the year, we issued £250m of debt via the US Private 
Placement (USPP) market. The amounts raised will be used to 
help fund our capital expenditure programme. Also during the 
year, we raised £200m of bank and institutional loans as part 
of our plan to part-refinance a £260m 6% 2025 bond that 
was repaid shortly after the balance sheet date in April 2017.
Total borrowings, including amounts owed to group 
companies (note 17), was £5,012.9m as at 31 March 2017 
(31 March 2016: £4,584.7m), the increase compared to 31 
March 2016 largely being due to the £250m of USPP debt 
and £200m of bank and institutional loans referred to above. 
Net debt (ie: total borrowings excluding amounts owed from 
group companies and net of cash in hand and at the bank), 
was £3,773.6m at 31 March 2017 (2015/16: £3,551.7m), the 
increase compared to 31 March 2016 again largely being 
due to the £250m of USPP debt and the £200m of bank 
and institutional loans referred to above, but noting that the 
proceeds of the £200m of bank and institutional loans were 
included in the cash figure at the balance sheet date. The 
maturity profile of our borrowings and further detail on net 
debt are set out in note 17 of the Financial Statements.
Levels of gearing (calculated as net debt divided by RCV) 
are monitored and forecast on a regular and frequent 
basis. Gearing is a key covenanted ratio within Yorkshire 
Water Financing Group’s arrangements with its lenders (the 
Yorkshire Water Financing Group being the Companies 
within the Yorkshire Water WBS, explained on page 48). On 
a covenanted basis, gearing at 31 March 2017 was 76.8% 
(2015/16: 77.9%). Gearing is also calculated on a standalone, 
regulatory, basis for Yorkshire Water using a slightly different 
basis of calculation. Gearing on this basis is 75.4% (2015/16: 
76.7%).
Managing financial risk
The operation of the Kelda Group, and therefore Yorkshire 
Water treasury function, is governed by policies and 
procedures, which sets out guidelines for the management 
of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, exposure to 
fluctuations in the rate of inflation and the use of financial 
instruments. We actively maintain a broad portfolio of debt, 
diversified by source and maturity, and designed to ensure 
we have sufficient available funds for operations. Treasury 
policies and procedures are incorporated within our financial 
control procedures.
The long-term sustainability of the Company’s financing 
is of primary importance. We frequently monitor levels of 
indebtedness and associated measures, such as gearing. 
These are forecast not just against covenanted levels within 
our financing documents, but also against levels necessary 
to protect our credit ratings. These take account of future 
expectations and stress-case scenarios relating to future 
business performance, future regulatory price determinations, 
economic conditions and market conditions, not just over the 
current regulatory Price Review period, but also beyond into 
future Price Review periods. More information in relation to 
our credit ratings is provided on page 44.
Our executive management team receives regular reports 
from all areas of the business to enable prompt identification 
of financial and other risks so that appropriate actions can 
be taken.
Page 43
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Our operations expose us to a variety of financial risks that 
include the effects of changes in debt market prices, price risk, 
liquidity risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. Derivative 
financial instruments, including cross currency swaps, interest 
rate swaps and forward currency contracts are employed to 
manage the interest rate and currency risk arising from the 
primary financial instruments used to finance our activities. 
The interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps 
had a net positive fair value of £114.6m (2015/16: positive 
value of £60.4m).
Our revenue is linked to the underlying rate of inflation, 
measured by RPI, and therefore fluctuates in line with 
changes in the rate of inflation. Negative inflation, without 
appropriate management, could potentially breach gearing 
limits despite the Company being profitable. To mitigate this 
risk, we maintain levels of index-linked debt and index-linked 
swaps. The index-linked swaps are an arrangement such that 
interest is both payable and receivable on a notional amount 
of £1,289m, with six month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered 
Rate) receivable and interest payable at fixed amounts plus 
RPI. Movements in RPI are also applied to the debt. Therefore, 
as RPI reduces and income reduces, the interest charge will 
also reduce, or in the case of gearing, as RCV reduces, the 
value of debt also reduces. The maturity of the swaps ranges 
from 2026 to 2063. With long-term expectations of LIBOR at 
historically low levels, the swaps held by the Company gave 
rise to a negative fair value on 31 March 2017 of £2,033.0m 
(2015/16: £1,579.5m).
See note 18 of the Statutory Financial Statements for more 
details on the financial derivatives held by the Company.
Other financial risk includes our exposure to commodity price 
risk, especially energy prices. We aim to manage this risk by 
fixing contract prices where possible and operating within an 
energy purchasing policy that is designed to manage price 
volatility risk. During 2015/16 we took the opportunity in this 
period of low energy prices to fix our energy costs to 2020.
In addition to the above financial management measures, 
our insurance team also works to ensure that we manage 
and mitigate our exposure to costs from public liabilities and 
damage to our assets.
Credit ratings
Yorkshire Water Services Limited and its financing 
subsidiaries have credit ratings assigned by three rating 
agencies. The latest published ratings are as follows:
On 2 June 2017, S&P affirmed the Yorkshire Water Financing 
Group’s Class A rating of ‘A-‘ and Class B rating of ‘BBB’ both 
with a stable outlook.
On 4 July 2017, Moody’s affirmed the Corporate Family Rating 
of Yorkshire Water at ‘Baa2’ and affirmed the Yorkshire Water 
Financing Group’s Class A and Class B rating at Baa1 and Ba1 
respectively, while moving the associate outlooks for those 
ratings from negative to stable. Moody’s stated that their 
rationale for the change in outlook was due to their view that 
Yorkshire Water’s exposure to a persistently lower interest 
rate environment has reduced in light of the measures that 
management and the Company’s shareholders have been 
taking and will continue to work on through the current 
regulatory period.
On 4 July 2017, Fitch affirmed the Yorkshire Water Financing 
Group’s Class A rating of ‘A‘ and Class B rating of ‘BBB
+
’ both 
with a stable outlook.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Corporation and other taxes
We are committed to acting with integrity and transparency in 
all tax matters. Our tax strategy and policies require that we:
•  Comply with both the letter of UK tax law and its 
application as it was intended.
•  Do not make interpretations of tax law considered to 
be opposed to the original published intention of the 
specific law.
•  Do not enter into transactions that have a main purpose 
of gaining a tax advantage.
•  Make timely and accurate tax returns that reflect our 
fiscal obligations to Government.
We do not use artificial tax avoidance schemes or tax 
havens to reduce our tax liabilities. Our overseas companies 
were established for non-tax driven decisions and all active 
companies in the Kelda Group are wholly and exclusively 
resident for tax purposes in the UK. We explain our 
corporate structure on page 47.
We work openly and proactively with HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC) to maintain an effective working relationship. 
Each year we provide our tax returns to HMRC and they 
review our position. In cases which are complex or open to 
interpretation we work proactively with HMRC to 
determine the appropriate tax position.
Yorkshire Water’s Board has agreed to adhere to the tax 
strategy and policies adopted by the Kelda Group of which 
Yorkshire Water is the principal subsidiary. The Kelda Group 
tax strategy provides further detail on the Group’s approach 
to tax risk management and governance arrangements, and is 
publicly available at:
www.keldagroup.com/corporate-responsibility/managing-
corporate-responsibility/our-approach-to-corporate-
responsibility.aspx
Corporation tax
Our corporation tax credit of £101.5m (2015/16: credit of 
£24.4m) is entirely due to the non-cash movement in our 
deferred tax provision.
The deferred tax provision represents the accumulated 
timing difference between accounting profits and taxable 
profits calculated at the prevailing rate of corporation tax. 
Differences due to timing (e.g. accounting depreciation versus 
tax depreciation, known as capital allowances) will reverse in 
the future so the provision becomes taxation payable. Other 
differences are permanent differences as they represent costs 
or revenue that are not subject to corporation tax.
The 2016/17 movement is largely due to the effects of the 
increase in the fair value liability of the Company’s index-linked 
swap portfolio (explained below). Increases or reductions in 
the fair value liability of the Company’s index-linked swap 
portfolio represent an increase or reduction in the net interest 
the financial markets expect will be payable on those index-
linked swaps in future years. 
Changes to the fair value of the liability are not tax deductible 
under UK tax regulations as tax deductions are only available 
as and when the future interest payments are actually paid.
The increase in the fair value of the index-linked swap portfolio 
will therefore create an accounting cost which is not subject to 
taxation until the interest is paid and therefore creates a timing 
difference. The fair value of the index-linked swap portfolio 
can fluctuate significantly and there will be a consequential 
impact on the deferred tax provision.
Yorkshire Water’s 2016/17 effective tax rate for the year ended 
31 March 2017 was 28%, calculated by comparing the loss 
before tax (£362.8m) and total (current and deferred) tax 
credit for the year. This is a higher effective tax rate ie the 
Company has a higher tax credit for the year than if simply 
applying the statutory corporation tax rate of 20% and is 
mainly due to tax losses surrendered from other Kelda Group 
companies to Yorkshire Water. Yorkshire Water does not make 
a payment for those tax losses and this results in an increase to 
the Company’s effective tax rate of 7.3%. A full reconciliation 
of the Company’s tax credit for the year is contained in note 9 
to the Financial Statements.
No material tax uncertainties have had to be taken into 
account in arriving at our tax provision for the year.

Our corporate structure
Yorkshire Water Services Limited is part of the Kelda Holdings 
Limited group (see diagram on page 47). All companies are 
wholly owned unless stated otherwise. Details of the Group’s 
shareholders and capital structure are also published on the 
Group’s website, found at: www.keldagroup.com 
Page 46
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Summary of Group company activities 
The details and activities of the companies within the 
condensed group structure chart above are as follows:
Kelda Holdings Limited – the ultimate parent undertaking 
within the Group. The Company is incorporated in Jersey 
and is wholly and exclusively resident for tax in the UK. The 
Company was incorporated in Jersey because Jersey law 
allows greater choice than the UK as to the way distributions 
can be made to shareholders.
Kelda Eurobond Co Limited – a Group subsidiary 
incorporated in England and Wales and wholly and exclusively 
resident for tax in the UK. It was incorporated for the purposes 
of issuing bonds (i.e. corporate debt) as part of the acquisition 
of the shares of Kelda Group Limited (formerly Kelda Group 
Plc) by the shareholders in 2008. This bond debt meets the 
eligibility requirements of the “quoted Eurobond exemption” . 
All bond debt issued by Kelda Eurobond Co Limited is held by 
the shareholders of Kelda Holdings Limited.
The bonds issued by Kelda Eurobond Co Limited are listed 
on The International Stock Exchange in the Channel Islands 
(TISE). TISE is regarded by the UK’s HMRC as a recognised 
stock exchange for the purposes of the quoted Eurobond 
exemption. Listing on TISE was chosen rather than the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE) for ease of administration, since the 
bonds in question are not traded the greater administrative 
requirements imposed by the LSE are not necessary.
Kelda Non-reg Holdco Limited – a Group subsidiary 
incorporated in England and Wales and wholly and exclusively 
resident for tax in the UK. The Company’s primary activity is 
to provide finance for Kelda Group’s businesses other than 
Yorkshire Water.
Kelda Group Limited – originally the ultimate holding 
company in the Group and formerly a public listed company, 
Kelda Group Plc. It was incorporated in England and Wales 
and is wholly and exclusively resident for tax in the UK. Kelda 
Group Plc’s shares were acquired and the Company de-listed 
in February 2008. 
Saltaire Water Limited – this was the acquisition vehicle 
for the purchase of Kelda Group Limited’s shares (formerly 
Kelda Group Plc) in February 2008. The shares of Kelda 
Group Limited are now held by Kelda Eurobond Co Limited. 
The Company was incorporated in England and Wales and is 
wholly and exclusively resident for tax in the UK.
Please note there have been changes to shareholder ownership since 31 March 2017. At the time of publication shareholder 
ownership was as follows: GIC 33.56%, Gateway 30.32%, RREEF 22.37%, and SAS 12.75%. Prudential is no longer a 
shareholder in the Group.

providing water and waste water services to the Yorkshire 
region. This is the Company to which this Annual Report  
and Financial Statements publication refers.
Yorkshire Water Services Bradford Finance Limited, 
Yorkshire Water Services Odsal Finance Limited, 
Yorkshire Water Services Odsal Finance Holdings 
Limited, Yorkshire Water Services Finance Limited – 
companies within the WBS described below.
Whole Business Securitisation
Yorkshire Water established a financing structure known as 
Whole Business Securitisation (WBS) in July 2009. The WBS 
enhances the creditworthiness of Yorkshire Water by setting 
strict rules that demonstrate to lenders the Company is a safe 
and reliable business in which to invest. Lenders are therefore 
more prepared to lend to Yorkshire Water at lower rates of 
interest than would otherwise be the case. 
This WBS works by placing a protective ring-fence around 
Yorkshire Water’s business which includes the way it operates, 
the way it trades with other group companies outside the 
WBS, and the way it finances itself. The protections include 
limits on borrowings, dividends and the ability to lend money 
to other Kelda companies. The protections also require profits 
to more than cover the amount of interest that Yorkshire 
Water pays.
Due to technical reasons applicable at the time that our 
owners purchased the Kelda Group and set up the WBS, it 
was necessary to establish three companies in the Cayman 
Islands in order to raise debt on the listed bond markets. 
These companies are:
•  Yorkshire Water Services Bradford Finance Limited (issues 
new corporate debt).
•  Yorkshire Water Services Odsal Finance Limited (issued 
legacy corporate debt). 
•  Yorkshire Water Services Odsal Finance Holdings Limited  
(a non-trading, holding company).
The technical requirements for these companies are no longer 
relevant so these foreign companies wouldn’t be needed 
if undertaking the WBS today. However, to unwind this 
structure would incur substantial cost for minimal benefit. 
All three companies are wholly and exclusively resident 
for tax in the UK and file their tax returns only with HMRC. 
This means that any profit or loss made by these companies 
is subject only to UK tax.
Yorkshire Water Services Finance Limited issued legacy 
corporate debt is incorporated in England and Wales and is 
wholly and exclusively resident for tax in the UK.
Long-Term Viability (LTV) Statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Company, 
taking account our current position, the potential impact of 
the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable 
scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the business will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the eight 
year period to March 2025. This takes us through the five-year 
business plan and further to the end of AMP7.
To make this statement the Company has assessed 
viability using the Company’s strategic planning process 
as a starting point.
The Directors have considered the appropriate length of time 
over which to provide the viability statement. In making their 
assessment, they have taken account of the balance between 
timescale and robustness of analysis. The Directors consider 
that a four to eight year range is appropriate for a regulated 
entity depending upon where Yorkshire Water is within the 
current regulatory cycle at the point of assessment and the 
extent to which information is available on the direction of 
the subsequent AMP. As Yorkshire Water is now at the end 
of the second year of the current regulatory cycle and there 
is sufficient information available which could reasonably 
be considered for AMP7, a time period of eight years is 
considered the most appropriate at the present time. This 
is aligned with our current strategic planning horizon. The 
strategic plan and modelling of AMP7 scenarios reflects the 
Directors’ best view of future prospects.
Page 48
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Viability assessment is intrinsically linked to strong risk 
management processes. Aligned risk appetite, actual risk levels 
and both financial and operational plans are critical to the 
Company understanding and managing its risks and 
remaining viable in the long-term.
As part of the annual update of our five-year business plan to 
2020, risk appetite was assessed in the context of the strategic 
risk register, plans to mitigate or tolerate risk and the financial 
resources available to manage the risks.
Underpinning the appetite assessment is a thorough risk 
review process which quantifies the impacts (e.g. financial, 
reputational, service) and likelihood of strategic risks 
materialising and makes appropriate provision with the financial 
forecasts within the business plan. These principal risks are 
detailed on page 55 and their impact and likelihood considered 
within the financial forecasts for the remainder of AMP6.
The AMP7 period, covering the period 1 April 2020 to 31 
March 2025, is subject to significantly greater uncertainty than 
the current AMP. To understand future prospects and viability 
for that period scenario modelling has been undertaken.
The first step of the modelling was to roll forward AMP6 
forecast financial and non-financial outcomes into AMP7 
based on the current regulatory treatment and the 
following assumptions:
•  AMP7 operating costs reflect current experienced costs 
plus foreseeable cost increases, less known efficiencies.
•  AMP7 capital costs reflect the 25-year asset plan within 
the AMP6 strategic direction statement.
•  The balance of the AMP6 Outcome Delivery Incentives 
(ODI) is a net £nil reward/penalty.
•  Borrowing costs adjusted for the expected re-financing 
strategy outcomes based on forecast expectations for 
RPI and LIBOR.
•  Ofwat’s treatment of ODIs, revenue correction and RCV 
log downs do not change materially from our current 
understanding of the regulatory framework.
•  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is in line 
with the range of current market data.
A base case regulated return was then established which, 
together with the information above, was used to determine 
baseline regulated revenues. The Company’s outperformance, 
based on previous AMP periods, was then overlaid on the 
base numbers and the dividend policy was then applied to 
determine base line sustainable distributions and associated 
financial leverage.
A number of downside outperformance and regulated return 
sensitivities were then applied to the base case forecasts for  
the eight year period to determine the impact on the core 
financial covenants. Where necessary, gearing and distribution 
levels were reduced to ensure the ongoing compliance of 
financial covenants.
The final step was to analyse the risk register and create severe 
but realistic downside scenarios using the risks identified in the 
corporate risk management process detailed on page 51.
At a summarised level those risks are shown in the table on 
page 50:
The probability of each of the gross risks was assessed to 
create an expected value of the portfolio of severe downside 
risks. The overall annual value of the expected value was £35m 
operating expenditure and £42m capital expenditure. Yorkshire 
Water has not previously experienced that level of downside 
cost impacts over a prolonged period. To use that value of 
cashflow downside risk in each year of the 8 year assessment 
period is therefore considered very prudent and very unlikely to 
occur. The cashflow risk values above were applied to each of 
the scenarios generated previously.
The financial modelling demonstrates that under a low WACC 
scenario with the above expected values, Yorkshire Water does 
not reach default levels on financial covenants, providing no 
distributions are paid. However, due to the cumulative adverse 
cashflows modelled, in this scenario financial ratios would be at 
a level which would jeopardise maintenance of an investment 
grade credit rating required under the water licence.
In the scenario where long-term adverse conditions prevail, 
there are two significant practical mitigations. The first is that 
management would act to find other mitigations that address 
impacts of risks arising as soon as these occurred. The second 
is the stable regulatory framework under which 
Yorkshire Water operates.
In assessing the viability of Yorkshire Water, the Directors 
have taken account of:
•  The detailed financial projections developed as part of 
the planning process which include investment obligations 
for AMP6 and the best available information about 
AMP7 obligations.
•  The downside scenarios and stress testing linked to the risk 
management process described above.
•  Yorkshire Water’s robust solvency position including its likely 
ability to raise new finance in most market conditions.
•  The strength of mitigations available including restricting 
dividend payments and the stability which exist under the 
regulatory model.
Taking account of this information, the Directors have 
concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that 
Yorkshire Water will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the assessment period. 
The Directors also consider it appropriate to prepare the 
Financial Statements on a going concern basis, as explained in 
the basis of preparation paragraph in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements. See the Director’s Report.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Our approach to  
Risk Management 
Effective risk management 
is essential for us to manage 
uncertainties and achieve  
our objectives. 
It is managed at parent company (Kelda Group) level, 
embedded in our normal business process and culture, and 
overseen by an executive-led Risk Committee. The Risk 
Committee consists of senior executives from across the 
business and is chaired by the Director of Finance, Regulation 
and Markets. This improves our ability to predict and prepare 
for challenges to the achievement of our priorities and 
supports the creation and protection of value in the Company.
We manage risk in line with the following key principles:
•  Transparent risk culture: all risks are measured, managed, 
monitored and reported.
•  Proactive approach: risk management is dynamic with 
risks and opportunities identified and escalated to be 
managed at the appropriate level in the business.
•  Risk governance: all risks are subject to appropriate 
controls and governance.
•  Risk appetite: a clearly defined risk appetite framework 
is aligned to the business strategy and reflects the Board’s 
approach to risk taking.
Our risk management approach is summarised below and 
applies to all activities, decisions and processes.

and we follow this structure in describing our approach

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Understand context and objectives
We describe our corporate strategy in the Business Strategy 
section at the start of this Strategic Report. Our strategy 
sets the context in which we define and manage our 
approach to risk.
Identify risks
Risk identification is embedded in our operational 
management systems across the business. A network of 
Risk Champions works with leadership teams to prompt risk 
identification, consistent measurement and review. Risks are 
logged in a range of risk management databases. We run 
risk identification workshops with the Board twice a year, as 
well as with key programmes, new teams or processes and 
leadership teams as required. Each risk is allocated to a Risk 
Owner who is responsible for the monitoring, management 
and reporting of that risk through the risk management 
process for the life of the risk.
Define risk appetite
The Board sets the corporate risk appetite, defining the 
tolerable level of risk for each of the risk measures (see table 
below). We adopt a cautious approach to the management 
of risk. This means we expect a low residual risk with a strong 
control environment. Deviations from defined process are 
accepted if formally agreed at the appropriate level and the 
risk captured. We balance the cost of control with the risk 
appetite and the long-term viability of the business.
Risk Owners determine the tolerable level for each risk within 
the corporate risk appetite framework. We act where net risk 
exceeds appetite. When we are at appetite we monitor and 
audit our controls to gain assurance that we will continue to 
meet our objectives.
Impact Appetite
Health and safety
Kelda Group and Yorkshire Water recognise the inherent water industry health and safety risk 
and are only prepared to tolerate risks that have been reduced to levels as low as reasonably 
practicable in line with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) guidance.
Value
Kelda Group and Yorkshire Water have no tolerance of any risk that may result in a breach of 
covenanted ratios. We will maintain headroom agreed by the Board. 
Service
Kelda Group and Yorkshire Water will achieve performance that results in no net financial loss 
over the AMP and maintains our cautious appetite on reputation. 
Kelda and Yorkshire Water will not tolerate risk that results in an annual reduction in SIM score 
greater than two points.
Reputation
Kelda Group and Yorkshire Water wants to be best in class, respected across the industry and 
region. We will only tolerate one-off or occasional national media, stakeholder, regulator or 
customer criticism over the achievement of objectives.
Compliance
Kelda Group and Yorkshire Water will be compliant, but will tolerate risks that have been reduced 
to levels as low as reasonably practicable. It will only tolerate one-off, planned breaches of 
regulation in the pursuit of guaranteed improvement in compliance.
People
Kelda Group and Yorkshire Water work hard to create the right environment, while maintaining 
good relations through robust consultation and engagement with all its colleagues.

Risk hierarchy of  
aligned risk registers
Measure risks and escalate
To ensure that risks are managed at the right level, they 
are escalated according to their potential impact through 
a hierarchy of aligned registers at strategic, functional and 
operational levels, as depicted in the diagram below. 
The Risk Committee reviews the corporate risks, controls and 
risk appetite each month, and assesses the tolerability of the 
overall risk profile. All material movements in business unit or 
corporate risks are reported monthly to the Risk Committee 
and senior leaders.
The Board monitors the tolerability of the overall level of 
risk, assessing the impact on our customers, financial health, 
colleagues and reputation, based on monthly risk reports. 
Principal risks are those which are deemed to have the 
potential to threaten viability or take the business significantly 
beyond risk appetite. This may be individual risks from the 
corporate register or an aggregation of related risks. The 
Directors and executive management have performed a robust 
assessment of the principal risks which have been reviewed by 
the Audit Committee.
The diagram opposite maps the principal risks facing Yorkshire 
Water and Kelda Group at the year-end according to the 
likelihood that the risk will realise and the potential impact 
if it does. It also indicates whether we perceive the risk to 
Yorkshire Water and Kelda Group is increasing or reducing. 
The table shows that:
•  Protecting our data is currently our highest risk.
•  Improved controls during the year have reduced the 
likelihood that risks to our protection of the environment 
and security will realise, although the impact will be very 
high if they do.
•  The opening of the non-household retail market has 
introduced the risk of non-compliance with the 
Competition Act.
•  The likelihood that the risk to our talent, culture and 
succession will realise has increased during the year, due 
to the extent of the change programmes currently being 
managed in the business.

We adopt a best practice ‘three levels of assurance’ approach. 
To support dynamic risk management we have a monthly risk 
reporting cycle of joint risk and audit reporting. This ensures 
that risks are escalated, understood and managed at the right 
level in the business, and appropriate assurance is provided.
Our ‘three levels of assurance’ approach
The table on page 55 details the specific assurance available to 
the risk owners, management and directors for each principal 
risk. In addition, we have established assurance arrangements 
which are common across all our principal risks. 
First line assurance is typically provided by operational 
managers ensuring compliance with established controls, 
policies and procedures. Line managers ensure that we have 
appropriate skills to deliver the expected level of service in the 
right way. Each department has a dedicated risk champion to 
identify, escalate and oversee the management of risk.
We operate an integrated management system (IMS) 
which provides second line confidence that policies and 
procedures achieve our regulatory and legal requirements. 
This is externally accredited to international quality standards 
(ISO) for asset management (ISO 55001), environment (ISO 
14001), information security (ISO 27001) and quality process 
management (ISO 9001). In addition, a range of second 
line monitoring and checks is undertaken by subject matter 
experts in Finance and Regulation and our Business Support 
Group. Our programme management office provides 
assurance over the progress of our capital programme as 
well as our suite of change programmes. All senior managers 
provide assurance that company policies and procedures are in 
place and operating to achieve compliance with our regulatory 
and legal requirements through our annual control risk self-
assessment (CRSA) process. The Risk Committee, comprising 
all our executive directors, meets monthly to oversee the 
management and tolerability of risk across the business. 
Our internal audit function provides independent assurance 
on the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management 
system including our systems of internal control. Our audit 
programme is agreed and monitored by the Audit Committee. 
Our external financial and technical auditors provide further 
independent assurance over the accuracy and completeness 
of our financial and operational performance reporting.
We are working to improve the integration of these assurance 
arrangements into a single, principle based Board Assurance 
Framework during 2017/18.
Risk management achievements during 2016/17
We have a continuous improvement plan for risk 
management, which is monitored by the Board Audit 
Committee. In 2016/17 we have:
•  Updated our corporate risk probability methodology 
in line with industry best practice, to ensure a consistent, 
evidence based approach to assessing the likelihood of 
risk materialising.
•  Developed a suite of key risk indicators for all corporate 
risks to promote proactive risk management.
•  Developed our corporate approach to risk scenario planning.
•  Improved and cascaded our risk management policy 
to include our commitment to the ‘three levels of 
assurance’ model.
•  Updated and integrated our risk and audit reporting.

Public and colleague safety 
We fail to protect the safety, health and wellbeing of 
our customers, colleagues and contract partners.
The risk has been managed through the 
delivery of the first year of the occupational 
health and safety (OH&S) improvement 
programme as well as on-going 
development and embedding 
of policy and procedures.
•  The OH&S Management System, supported by a suite of  
good practice policies and procedures. 
•  A programme of OH&S training and certification ensures all  
our staff have appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely.
•  10 Life Saving Rules have been agreed, with roll out to  
all staff to be completed by September 2017.
•  The OH&S improvement programme is driving improvement  
in asset management, process and personal safety practices.

delivery of the OH&S improvement programme.
•  The asset integrity team defining good practice policies and procedures  
to maintain the safety of our physical assets, assuring compliance via their 
inspection programme.
•  SHE committee overseeing the management of health, safety 
and environmental risks.
2
Enough clean, safe drinking water 
We cannot supply sufficient clean, safe water to 
meet the everyday demand of our customers.
This risk has reduced due to the impact of 
sustainable improvements we have delivered 
through capital schemes. We continue to 
monitor the impact of the weather on water 
supply on a daily basis and use our grid 
system and abstraction permits to manage 
this risk.
•  Maintenance of the flexible grid network.
•  Consistent use of the Water Resources Allocation Planning 
(WRAP) to identify and respond to issues early.
•  Routine drinking water safety planning.
•  Leakage management planning and monitoring with  
increased investment in targeted solutions.
•  Ongoing resource and asset availability monitoring  
and response.
•  Certified ISO 55001 compliance.
•  Operational management regularly reviewing compliance with good practice 
asset operating and management plans. 
•  Rigorous water quality sample inspection regime.
•  Asset integrity: policy and inspection programme.
•  Capital programme and outcome delivery assurance via the Board  
Investment Committee.
3
Protect the environment 
We cause harm to the water environment through 
unsafe abstraction or discharge leading to pollution, 
or we fail to manage our carbon impact.
This risk has reduced due to our sector 
leading carbon management and innovation 
programmes. We continue to learn from 
pollution events to improve the impact of 
our discharge to the water environment.
•  Environmental and quality management systems.
•  Investment programmes in waste water treatment, 
networks and bathing waters.
•  Pollution incident reduction plan.
•  Land, coast and river management programmes.

and management plans. 
•  Asset integrity: policy and inspection programme.
•  Legal Services reviewing pollution incidents for learning.
•  Capital programme and outcome delivery assurance 
via the Board Investment Committee.

Climate change resilience 
We fail to plan ahead to ensure that we can maintain essential 
services and fail to deal with the impacts of population 
growth, climate change and extreme weather conditions.
We have clarified our 25-year climate 
change strategy and are developing  
frontier plans, optimising innovative 
partnership solutions.
•  Climate change strategy and implementation of the 25  
year Water Resources Management Plan as agreed with  
the EA.

5
Customer trust 
We do not consistently meet the expectations of our 
customers by failing to deliver on our commitments.
We continue to consult with our customers 
to understand what they expect and 
prioritise the quality of service delivery. 
Significant capital schemes are delivering 
improvements in service to specific risk areas 
such as Hull, Sheffield and Beverley.
•  Focus on outcomes for customers is at the heart of our 
performance management and prioritisation processes, 
improvement is monitored through the Customer Forum.
•  Customer Forum and online Customer Panel consultation 
drives our strategy and plans.
•  Transparent and assured reporting.
•  Customer support services and investment programme.
•  Certified ISO 9001 compliance.
•  Data analytics provides live assurance over compliance with policies  
and procedures.

with agreed policies and procedures.
•  External auditors assuring the financial and performance information we  
report to customers.
•  Board and Corporate Responsibility Committee overseeing the management  
of risks to customer service and levels of customer trust in the Company.
6
Financial sustainability 
We fail to manage the effects of changes to debt market 
prices, interest rates, revenue and competition to achieve 
financial resilience.
In addition to strong business as usual 
financial control, key restructuring 
programmes delivering improvements in our 
financial resilience, thereby reducing this risk.

Enough clean, safe drinking water 
We cannot supply sufficient clean, safe water to 
meet the everyday demand of our customers.
This risk has reduced due to the impact of 
sustainable improvements we have delivered

this risk.

growth, climate change and extreme weather conditions.
We have clarified our 25-year climate

prioritise the quality of service delivery.

improvements in service to specific risk areas

Security 
We do not keep our people, assets and information 
secure, leading to a security breach.

ever present and is volatile. We continue to 
strengthen our physical, information and 
cyber controls and response plans, and have 
improved security culture and awareness.

Talent, culture and succession 
Our plans do not ensure we have the talent and 
culture to achieve our objectives now and in the future. 
We recognise that despite strong planning 
and people management this risk is 
increasing due to the challenge of our 
substantial change programme on our 
colleagues. We are developing our culture, 
succession plans and skills to improve 
our agility.

accessible policies and procedures.

Water sector reform 
We are not resilient to market change. 
This risk has not changed as we have 
successfully managed our response to 
the water sector market opening. We are 
confident that we remain alert and well 
positioned to respond to the on-going risks 
and future challenge.

Data protection 
We fail to manage our personal data to achieve expected 
international standards.

stepped change in requirements in 2018 and 
the dispersed nature of our business. We

Competition Act 
Our processes and actions are not compliant with the 
requirements of the Act leading to investigation or fine.
This is a new principal risk recognising 
the potential impact of not managing 
the changes in our structure in line with 
Competition Act requirements. Legal 
Services and Regulation teams have driven 
a significant training and awareness 
programme. Compliance with expected 
controls is monitored.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Assuring the quality of  
this Strategic Report
Our assurance for this 
Strategic Report comes from 
several sources and is a 
year-round activity. We have 
used our best practice 
risk-based ‘three levels’ 
approach. By mapping our 
assurance activities into 
three levels, we make sure 
that sufficient assurance is 
provided at the right time. 
A description of the levels of 
assurance is provided below. 
Level 1 - Business operations
This is provided from controls in our front-line operations. 
It takes place throughout the year. We regularly review our 
processes, systems and controls to ensure accurate reporting. 
It includes having the right people in the right roles, who are 
responsible for delivering a service, for example our named 
data providers and data managers. The value of this assurance 
is that it is timely and comes from the business experts who 
understand the performance and the challenges faced.
Level 2 - Oversight functions
This comes from oversight teams with specialist knowledge, 
such as our finance, regulation and legal teams. This assurance 
is separate from those who have responsibility for delivery. 
The value of this assurance is that those involved will review 
information for technical accuracy, compliance and 
against wider company expectations. We have a formal 
monthly reporting process for data relating to our 
Performance Commitments, and a quarterly process 
for our SBO commitments.
Level 3 - Independent assurance
This is carried out by independent assurance providers who 
operate to professional and ethical standards. This means 
they will form their own conclusions on the information and 
evidence they review. The value of this assurance is that it is 
independent of line management and organisational structure. 
The contents of this Strategic Report have had the following 
independent assurance:
•  Our Internal Audit team have completed a financial and 
regulatory accounting audit on the controls in place for 
financial accounting, for example reconciliations and 
journaling. Internal Audit have also reviewed the reported 
performance on our Performance Commitments and our 
SBO commitments.
•  Our external technical auditor, Halcrow, has reviewed the 
stated position on our Performance Commitments 
to confirm accuracy and completeness.
•  Our external financial auditor, PwC, has reviewed the 
financial information to confirm it is true and fair based on 
the state of affairs of the Company and that the accounts 
have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies.
You can find our Assurance Plan on our website at:

authorised committee of the Board of directors  
on 13 July 2017 and signed on its behalf by:

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Chairman’s Introduction
I am pleased to present the 
Corporate Governance 
Report for the year ended 
31 March 2017 . The Board 
has experienced a successful, 
although challenging, year 
in which we have been 
able to demonstrate our 
commitments to the highest 
standards of corporate 
governance. 
This year we report on our compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code recognising the revised 2016 Code, which 
comes into effect for the 2017/18 reporting period. We have 
reviewed the terms of reference of the Audit Committee and 
introduced changes consistent with the 2016 Code revisions. 
As described in our Strategic Report, the opening of the retail 
market for non-household customer’s on 1 April 2017 was a 
key milestone for the business. Our decision not to exit this 
business to a newly created Kelda Group company required 
careful consideration and the establishment of the Board’s 
Non-Household Retail Committee was key in terms of good 
corporate governance.
At the end of May 2016, we announced the resignation of 
our Chairman, Richard Parry-Jones who had led the Board 
since March 2015. I was delighted to accept the position of 
interim, and subsequently permanent, Chairman in September 
2016 and look forward to leading the Board in meeting its 
strategic objectives and the changes within the industry over 
the coming years.
At the year end, we announced the retirement of Martin 
Havenhand, our longest serving non-executive director. 
I would like to thank Martin for his valuable contribution to 
the Board for over nine years. We have appointed two new 
independent non-executive directors, Teresa Robson-Capps 
and Julia Unwin, both Yorkshire residents, who together 
bring diverse and wide experience from a number of sectors. 
Their extensive experience will enrich the Board in its 
leadership of the Company.
As previously reported, Kath Pinnock intends to step down 
in 2017, and I would like to extend my thanks to Kath for 
her commitment to the Company. I look forward to further 
strengthening the Board’s skills as we welcome a new 
independent director, Andrew Wyllie, on 1 September 2017.
Our Board evaluation process in early 2017 led to an action 
to develop the Board and senior management succession 
planning over the coming year. Board succession will be a 
key focus of the Nomination Committee together with the 
ongoing review of the Board skills matrix.
Over the following pages we present the Directors’ 
biographies, the Board’s role and activities during the year 
and further describe the changes outlined above.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements The Board is committed 
to achieving the highest 
standards of corporate 
governance in accordance 
with the requirements of 
company law, current best 
practice, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) 
and Ofwat’s guidance.
Principles of Corporate Governance
The Board remains accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for maintaining standards of corporate 
governance. This corporate governance report describes 
how the Board and its committees discharge their duties.
The Board is pleased to confirm that by 31 March 2015, it 
had fully implemented the principles which Ofwat expects 
companies operating in the water sector in England and Wales 
to apply, as set out in its document entitled “Board leadership, 
transparency and governance principles” published in January 
2014 (“the Ofwat Principles”). A majority of independent 
non-executive directors sit on the Board, which is led by an 
independent non-executive Chairman. There are no investor 
representatives present on the Board. 
The matters reserved to the Board, together with the Terms 
of Reference of the Board’s principal Committees are set 
out in further detail below and are also published on the 
Company’s website at: www.yorkshirewater.com/about-us/
what-we-do/corporate-governance-and-structure
Yorkshire Water is a private company and does not have 
listed equity. As such it is not required under the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules to report against compliance with 
the Code at any time during the period under review. 
However, the terms of its Instrument of Appointment 
require it to conduct its business as if it were a separate listed 
public company and accordingly the Company has particular 
regard to the Code.
The Code expressly states that it is not a rigid set of rules 
and that it consists of principles and provisions. The key 
principles of the Code are linked to Leadership, Effectiveness, 
Accountability, Remuneration and Relations with Shareholders. 
The companies whose shares are listed are required to 
apply the main principles set out in the Code and to report 
to shareholders on how they have done so. The Code 
acknowledges that departures from provisions of the Code 
may be justified in particular circumstances and that the 
reasons for any such departure should be explained to 
shareholders. The Company has complied with the provisions 
of the Code except as disclosed on page 74.
In April 2016, the Financial Reporting Council produced  
a new version of the Code (the “2016 Code”) which will apply 
to accounting periods beginning on or after 17 June 2016. 
The changes reflect the impact of the European Union’s  
Audit Regulation and Directive which will relate to the work  
of Audit Committees. Whilst the Board is not required to 
report against its compliance with the 2016 Code in this 
report, it has chosen to seek early compliance with the 2016 
Code where possible. Further details on this compliance are 
disclosed where applicable within this report or in the Audit 
Committee Report.
In accordance with the Ofwat Principles the Board adopted  
its own “Board Leadership, Transparency and Governance 
Code” (“the YW Code”) in February 2014. This is available  
on the website. The YW Code sets out how the Company  
has complied with the Ofwat Principles and the time frame 
within which it would fully implement the Ofwat Principles.

Corporate Governance Report
For the year ended 31 March 2017
Page 65
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Following the resignation of Richard Parry-Jones on 
31 May 2016, Anthony Rabin became interim Chairman and 
was subsequently appointed as independent non-executive 
Chairman on 9 September 2016. Richard Parry-Jones had not 
been involved in Anthony’s selection or appointment 
as Chairman. 
Anthony Rabin, Richard Flint, and Liz Barber are also Directors 
of Kelda Holdings Limited and Kelda Eurobond Co Limited. 
Anthony is the independent chairman of Kelda Holdings 
Limited and Kelda Eurobond Co Limited.
In accordance with provision B.1.1 of the Code, the Board 
considered Anthony Rabin to be independent on his 
appointment. Provision B.1.1 of the Code does not prohibit 
chairmanship of other companies in the Group and on 
appointment as Chairman, the Board considered him to be 
independent in judgement and character, not withstanding 
the existence of his other directorships. He has no relationship, 
nor has he ever had any relationship with any of the 
Company’s shareholders except for his chairmanship of Kelda 
Holdings Limited and Kelda Eurobond Co Limited, and none 
of the other situations listed in B1.1 of the Code, which might 
otherwise call into question his independence, apply.
On 12 July 2017, the Chairman’s independence on 
appointment was again reviewed. It was concluded that  
the Chairman could be regarded as independent since 
the Code does not preclude other directorships in other 
companies, and these were known to the Board at the  
time of his appointment.
As described on page 43, the Company’s holding company, 
Kelda Eurobond Co Limited, operates for the purpose of 
managing the bonds issued in connection with the financing 
of the acquisition of the Group in 2008. The Board of Kelda 
Eurobond Co Limited meets only for the purposes of dealing 
with the bonds and to approve the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. Previous Chairs have always sat on both 
the Boards of Kelda Holdings Limited and Kelda Eurobond 
Co Limited and consistent with the previous approach taken, 
Anthony Rabin was also appointed to both of those boards. 
The Board considers Anthony Rabin’s position as independent 
Chairman of both the Company, Kelda Eurobond Co Limited 
and Kelda Holdings Limited to be an important link in 
ensuring visibility and accountability between the boards and 
maintaining good governance.
Meetings of the Boards of the Company and of Kelda 
Holdings Limited are separate, and as with all the directors, 
Anthony is required to disclose any conflicts arising at each 
meeting of the Board.
During the year, the Board, led by the Nomination Committee, 
completed an extensive and rigorous recruitment process 
which resulted in the appointment of Teresa Robson-
Capps and Julia Unwin on 1 January 2017. The process was 
supported by Odgers Berndtson, an independent recruitment 
agency with no other connections with the Company.
During the period from May 2016 to January 2017, when the 
recruitment was taking place for additional non-executive 
directors, Anthony Rabin continued to chair the Audit 
Committee. This was considered necessary given his recent 
and relevant financial experience.
A search for an additional independent non-executive 
director has taken place using an independent recruitment 
agency with no connections to the Company. On 12 July 
2017, following the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, the Board approved the appointment of  
Andrew Wyllie as an independent non-executive with effect  
from 1 September 2017.
Martin Havenhand stepped down from the Board on 
31 March 2017, having served nine years and six months 
since his appointment. It is also the intention that Kath 
Pinnock will step down from the Board during 2017/18 
having served a little over nine years as an independent 
non-executive director.
It is a requirement of the Code that the Board should state its 
reasons if it determines that a director is independent, despite 
their serving on the Board for more than nine years.
The Board is satisfied that both Martin Havenhand and 
Kath Pinnock have remained independent in character and 
judgement throughout their membership of the Board and 
determined that the minimal extensions to their terms of 
appointment have been of value to the Board. The Board 
believes that the extension of the terms of appointment of 
both Martin Havenhand and Kath Pinnock beyond the nine 
years provided for in the Code has been necessary to enable 
a thorough search to be undertaken for new Board members 
with diverse characteristics reflective of the region and 
communities which the Company serves.
Kath continues to undertake a variety of other external 
roles which provide her with a range of experience and 
perspectives enabling her to bring an independent approach 
to the Board.
In accordance with Condition P of its Instrument of 
Appointment the Board contains at least three independent 
non-executive directors who are “persons of standing with 
relevant experience” and who “collectively have connections 
with and knowledge of the area within which” the Company 
holds its appointment, and “an understanding of the interests 
of the customers of the Company and how these can be 
respected and protected” .
Page 66
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Senior Independent Director
Prior to his appointment as Chairman, Anthony Rabin held 
the position of Senior Independent Director from 25 March 
2015. The appointment of a new senior independent 
director did not take place pending the appointment of new 
independent directors to the Board. Following a protracted 
search for new independent directors the Nomination 
Committee met on 7 June 2017 to consider the appointment 
of a senior independent director. The Board met on 12 July 
2017 to consider the recommendation of the Committee 
and approved the appointment of Ray O’Toole as the Senior 
Independent Director.
The Board recognises that the appointment of a senior 
independent director is a requirement of the Code, to serve 
as an intermediary for the other directors and to lead the 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance. As Anthony Rabin 
previously held this position and is known to the Board, 
the Board considers that it remains effective and has been 
comfortable maintaining this position on an interim basis. 
The appraisal of the Chairman’s performance was carried out 
by the Board as a whole in the financial year, supported by the 
Company Secretary.
Board effectiveness and roles
Richard Parry-Jones, Anthony Rabin, Martin Havenhand,  
Ray O’Toole, Kath Pinnock, Teresa Robson-Capps and Julia 
Unwin were considered by the Board to be independent 
(as defined by the Code). They had no relationship with 
management or shareholders and were free from any  
business or other relationship which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgements. The 
independent non-executive directors meet collectively with  
the shareholders. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate. 
The roles have been formally set out and agreed by the Board 
and are also published on the Company’s website at:  
www.yorkshirewater.com/about-us/what-we-do/corporate-
governance-and-structure
There are clear levels of delegated authority, which 
enable management to take decisions in the normal 
course of business.
The Board is satisfied that it acts independently and that 
both the Board and its committees have the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Company to enable them to discharge their respective 
duties and responsibilities effectively.
In the matters reserved to the Kelda Holdings Limited board, 
the principle is made clear that the Group must not act in a 
way which would prevent the Company from complying with 
its Instrument of Appointment, the Water Industry Act and 
any other requirements of the relevant regulatory regime. 
This accords with provisions contained within the 
Shareholders’ Agreement, to which Kelda Holdings Limited 
is a party. The directors of Kelda Holdings Limited remain 
mindful of their duty to ensure that this requirement is met 
in their consideration of any matters pertaining to Yorkshire 
Water and indeed the Kelda Group as a whole.
In accordance with the Ofwat Principles and as set out in the 
Yorkshire Water Code, during 2016/17:
• The Board had an independent Chairman, 
Richard Parry-Jones and subsequently Anthony Rabin.
• As there were no investor representatives on the Board,  
the number of investor representatives was no greater  
than the number of independent directors excluding 
the independent Chairman.
Between 1 June 2016 and 31 December 2016, following 
the resignation of Richard Parry-Jones, the independent 
non-executive directors (including the independent Chairman) 
were not the largest single group on the Board. The number 
of independent non-executive directors (including the 
independent Chairman) was in fact equal to the number 
of executive directors.
The Nomination Committee has applied a rigorous process 
in the search for new independent non-executive directors 
and it has focussed on a need to ensure diversity of the 
Board. Although this has resulted in a protracted search the 
Board has considered it essential to address the Board’s aim. 
During the period when there was only an equal number of 
independent non-executive directors, compared to executive 
directors, the Board remained confident that the balance was 
sufficient to ensure effective leadership in the spirit of the 
Ofwat Principles and the Code.
At the end of the financial year, the Board structure did, 
however, reflect compliance with the Code’s requirement 
that at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
comprise non-executive directors determined by the 
Board to be independent.
At the end of the financial year, the amendments to our 
Board structure also ensured our compliance with the Ofwat 
requirement that the number of independent non-executive 
directors (including the independent chairman) be greater than 
the number of executive directors.
Appointment of Directors
The Board applies a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of all new directors to the 
Board in accordance with the relevant principle of the Code 
with a view to ensuring that the Board has the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Company. The Chairman periodically reviews the 
composition of the Board, as well as evaluation of individual 
directors, to ensure that it remains effective. Succession 
planning has been identified as an area of focus following 
this year’s board evaluation.
Further details of the appointment process are described in 
the Nomination Committee report.
In view of the private status of the Company the Board does 
not consider it necessary or appropriate to submit the 
directors for regular re-election.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Directors training and development
All new directors receive an induction and training on joining 
the Board, including information about the Company and their 
responsibilities, meetings with key managers, and visits to the 
Company’s operations. They also receive relevant information 
about the Company’s operations, the regulatory regime and 
the water industry in general. The Chairman frequently held 
individual meetings with each of the other non-executive 
directors and with the Company’s shareholders during the 
financial year.
Briefings are provided to directors on relevant issues, including 
legislative, regulatory and financial reporting matters. Training 
is available to directors on, and after, their appointment to 
meet their requirements. In conjunction with the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive reviews and agrees with the executive 
directors their training and development needs. The Chairman 
keeps under review and agrees the training and development 
needs of the non-executive directors which is organised by 
the Company Secretary. Directors have undertaken training 
on such areas as unconscious bias, inclusion and diversity, 
information security and the Competition Act 1998 during 
the financial year.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense in furtherance 
of their duties in relation to board or committee matters.
Directors have access to the Company Secretary who is 
responsible for ensuring that board procedures are followed 
in accordance with good governance and facilitates the flow 
of communication between senior management and the 
non-executive directors. The directors receive full and timely 
access to all relevant information, including a monthly board 
pack of operational and financial reports. Direct access to key 
executives is encouraged. The Company has directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance in place.
Board structure and committee attendance
There are currently nine standing committees of the Board 
to assist it in discharging its responsibilities. Each of these 
committees has written terms of reference setting out their 
duties and purpose. These are available on request from the 
Company Secretary or on the corporate governance section  
of the Company’s website at: www.yorkshirewater.com 
Other committees are formed as and when required to deal 
with specific issues, for example funding committees are 
established to consider the raising of finance on behalf of the 
Company. Appropriate terms of reference are established by 
the Board at the appropriate time.
The Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and Safety, Health and 
Environment (SHE) Committees are the Company’s principal 
committees and all operate in a comparable way to those 
of listed company boards. Membership of each of these 
committees includes a majority of independent non-executive 
directors and the committees’ accountabilities in relation to 
the Company all operate at the Yorkshire Water level.
The other committees are the Kelda Management Team, 
Board Investment Committee, Regulation Committee, Legal 
Committee and the Non-Household Retail Committee. These 
other committees do not have a majority of independent 
directors. They comprise executive directors and other senior 
managers within the business with limited authority delegated 
to them by the Board, as set out in their terms of reference. 
The committees are mostly focused on operational day to day 
matters and report on their activity to the Board. The Kelda 
Management Team meet on a weekly basis and attendance 
by a majority of independent directors would present an 
unnecessary additional time commitment.
The Non-Household Retail Committee was established on 21 
April 2016 to ensure good governance over the review and 
provision of the strategic direction for management of the 
Non-Household Retail Business operated on behalf of the 
Company by Three Sixty Water (Yorkshire) Limited, in advance 
of the launch of the retail market in April 2017. We describe 
our latest approach to the Non-Household Retail Business in 
the Trusted Company chapter of the Strategic Report earlier in 
this ARFS.
Page 68
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements The Board held ten scheduled meetings during the year. 
In addition to scheduled board meetings several additional 
meetings have been held where specific needs arose, this 
has included meetings to consider the re-evaluation of the 
exit to the non-household retail market and to approve the 
appointment of new directors to the Board. The Board also 
held several long-term strategy workshops during the year.
The table below shows the number of meetings of the 
Board, its committees and the Group Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) Committee attended during the year by each director 
as a member of that board or committee, out of possible 
attendances. The Board’s expectation, practice and

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Board responsibilities
The Board is accountable and responsible for the control  
of the Company’s business, its strategy and its decisions. 
The primary focus for the Board is to lead the development 
and delivery of the strategy needed to meet the service and 
performance expectations of the Company’s customers and  
all its various stakeholders.
The Board also determines its key policies, and approves the 
business plans for the Company, interim and final financial 
statements, recommendations of dividends, significant 
investment and major business proposals, as well as 
significant organisational matters and corporate governance 
arrangements. There are clear levels of delegated authority, 
which also enable management to take decisions in the 
normal course of business.
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decision 
and the requirement for Board approval on these matters is 
communicated widely throughout the senior management of 
the Company. The schedule is published on the Company’s 
website at www.yorkshirewater.com and includes the 
following key matters:
•  The Company’s management and control structure.
•  Interim dividend and recommendation of final dividend.
•  Charges scheme and tariffs.
•  Approval of capital expenditure and investment 
in accordance with the Company’s delegated 
financial authorities.
Limited exceptions are reserved for the Company’s holding 
company, Kelda Holdings Limited. The Board reviewed the 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision on 7 June 2017 
and determined that it was appropriate for the matters 
reserved to be amended to clarify certain aspects. Previously 
the matters reserved had been structured so as to require 
the Board to seek the prior approval of the Board of Kelda 
Holdings Limited before determining business strategy, while 
the Board was not required to seek the prior approval of the 
Board of Kelda Holdings Limited in determining strategic 
plans providing it had regard to the overall Group strategic 
plans. In practice, the Company’s shareholders have not 
required business strategy to be approved in advance of 
any determination by the Board and for that reason the 
Board considered it appropriate that the matters reserved 
be amended. The matters reserved now make it clear that 
business strategy and strategic plans are for the Board to 
determine, without any requirement to seek the prior approval 
of the Board of Kelda Holdings Limited. These will be updated 
annually having regard to the overall Group strategic plans. 
The Board of Kelda Holdings Limited was engaged and 
consulted in the process of review of the matters reserved and 
the Board of Kelda approved the change on 8 June 2017.
The Board is content that it has always been able to make well 
informed and high quality strategic and sustainable decisions 
based on a clear line of sight into the business and that it has 
been able to make its decisions in the best interests of the 
Company for the long-term.
The Boards of Kelda Holdings and the Company work 
independently of each other, however, there is good 
collaboration between them. A number of strategy sessions 
were held during the financial year, these were separately 
structured but with a final session for both boards to review 
ideas together. Kelda Holdings board strategy discussions 
focussed on strategy for the Group and were not limited only 
to that of the Company.
Board Activities
During the year, the Board received detailed monthly reports 
prepared by management on the Company’s operations. In 
addition to those monthly reports, the following matters of 
significance were considered by the Board in accordance with 
its principles of good governance:
•  Preparations for Non-Household Retail competition, 
including the contracting strategy with Three Sixty Limited 
and the decision not to exit to Three Sixty Limited in the 
immediate term.
•  Letters of assurance provided to MOSL and Defra on  
market readiness.
•  The annual business plan.
•  The Annual Report and Financial Statements.
•  The appointment of auditors.
•  The decision regarding the procurement of new auditors 
and consideration of tenders received.
•  Decisions regarding several large capital projects, including 
enhancements to Hull Waste water Treatment Works 
(WwTW), an upgrade to our SAP IT system, sludge 
management facilities in Dewsbury, and a new anaerobic 
digestion facility in Leeds.
•  Decisions on tariffs.
•  The decision on the settlement of the flood insurance 
claim following the flooding in December 2015.
•  Decisions regarding several key operating contracts.
•  The review of key performance commitment targets and 
investment decisions to assure performance.
•  The increased focus on the monitoring and assessment 
of key risks during the year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Teresa Robson-Capps, an 
independent non-executive director with recent and relevant 
financial experience. Until her appointment on 1 January 2017 
the Committee chairmanship was fulfilled by Anthony Rabin, 
who although Chairman, remained on the Committee and 
was chosen to act as interim chair for the period pending the 
appointment of Dr Robson-Capps. Anthony Rabin stepped 
down from the Committee on 26 January 2017.
He agreed to chair the Audit Committee which was held 
on 25 January 2017 due to a pre-existing commitment on 
the part of Teresa Robson-Capps and stepped down 
after that meeting.
Page 70
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Whilst the Board recognised that in this period the Company 
was not in full compliance with the Code, it was felt necessary 
to maintain consistency in the chairmanship of the Committee 
and for the Committee to retain the benefit of Anthony’s 
recent and relevant financial experience.
The other Committee members are the non-executive 
directors Ray O’Toole, Kath Pinnock, and Julia Unwin, 
who joined the Committee on 1 January 2017. Liz Barber, 
Director of Finance, Regulation and Markets, the external 
auditors, the Group Internal Audit Manager and the 
Company Secretary attend all meetings. Martin Havenhand 
was a member of the Committee until his retirement from 
the business on 31 March 2017.
The Audit Committee met six times during the reporting year. 
The Committee Chairman reports on the activities of the 
Committee to the board meeting immediately following 
each committee meeting.
The duties of the Audit Committee and the activities in the 
year are covered in the Audit Committee report.
Nomination Committee
Details of the membership of the Nomination Committee and 
its activities during the year are contained in the Nomination 
Committee report.
Remuneration Committee
Details of the membership and role of the Remuneration 
Committee are included in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report. The Chief Executive, the Director of Human Resources 
and the Company Secretary have attended meetings  
by invitation.
Safety, Health and Environment Committee (SHE)
The SHE committee reviews and makes recommendations to 
the Board on the adequacy and strategic direction for safety, 
health and environment policies and procedures within the 
Company and promotes and champions health and safety.
The members of the SHE Committee are the Chairman and 
the independent non-executive directors, the Chief Executive, 
the Director of Asset Management and the Director of Service 
Delivery. The Chairman of the Committee is Ray O’Toole.

Company’s articles of association between board meetings 
and generally to give effect to the strategy determined by 
the Board and to supervise the executive and operational 
management of the Company. 
The key tasks of KMT are:
•  To monitor and supervise the management of the Company.
•  To review the Company’s periodic trading performance.
The proceedings of the KMT are reported to the Board.
Board Investment Committee (BIC)
The primary duty of BIC is to provide a strategic cross-business 
view of capital investment on behalf of the Company, to 
deliver service and compliance requirements at maximum 
capital and operating efficiency.
The Director of Finance, Regulation and Markets, the Director 
of Regulation, the Director of Asset Management and the 
Director of Service Delivery are all members of BIC together 
with the Director of Business Support and senior managers

responsibility for the periodic review process. The chair of the 
committee is the Chief Executive.
The proceedings of the Regulation Committee are 
reported to the Board.

non-executive directors, sit on the Group’s Corporate 
Responsibility Committee together with the Chief Executive 
who chairs the committee. The Director of Communications, 
Director of Human Resources and the Company Secretary 
are invited to attend all meetings. Other directors and Group 
employees attend by invitation. During the reporting year this 
Committee met on four occasions.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee’s key tasks include:
•  Delivery of the Group’s corporate social  
responsibility reports.
•  The creation of a culture of environmental and corporate 
responsibility awareness within the Group.
•  Liaising with and directing activity of other relevant  
Group committees.
•  Advising on opportunities for partnerships to further  
the Group’s corporate responsibility objectives.
•  Benchmarking performance of the Group against  
leading comparators.
In carrying out its duties the Committee has a focus on 
the Company’s activities.
Board evaluation
In accordance with the Code, the Board conducts an 
externally facilitated evaluation of the performance of the 
Board, its committees and directors every three years. This 
was undertaken in 2016 by Lintstock and will next take 
place during the 2018/19 financial year. Following the 2016 
evaluation, action was taken to reduce the number of 
scheduled Board meetings during 2017 and beyond from 
ten to eight in line with the average number of Board 
meetings held within a year by FTSE 350 companies.
This year, a formal and thorough internal evaluation process 
was conducted in January 2017. This sought to review a wide 
number of areas, including the balance of skills, experience, 
knowledge, effectiveness and conduct of the Board, its 
progress during the year, the effectiveness of its principal 
committees and the performance of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive. It also reviewed progress in addressing the actions 
raised as part of the externally facilitated 2016 evaluation.
Process 
The evaluation was conducted through a secure web-based 
process, facilitated by the Company Secretary, under the 
direction of the Chairman. Directors were requested to 
complete an online questionnaire. The questions were 
tailored to reflect feedback from the previous year’s 
evaluation, the Code requirements and the Financial 
Reporting Council’s ‘Guidance on Board Effectiveness’.
The non-executive directors and executive directors reviewed 
and commented on the performance of the Chairman within 
a separate section of the questionnaire.
The results from the online questionnaire were reviewed and 
compiled into a report, which was presented to the Board at 
its meeting on 22 March 2017 for review and debate.
Insights and actions 
Page 72
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Insights and actions 
In their report on last year’s Board evaluation, Lintstock 
highlighted issues arising around frequency and duration 
of Board meetings, Board papers, Board presentations and 
succession planning. Ensuring appropriate focus on strategy 
had also been identified as a top priority in terms of improving 
the Board’s performance. This year, it was clear that the Board 
was more comfortable with the focus on strategy, along 
with the frequency and duration of meetings, Board papers 
and presentations, whilst recognising the need for 
continuous improvement.
Overall the responses to the Board and Committee 
questionnaires were very positive, highlighting the 
improvements to risk management during the year, with 
no significant or unexpected areas of concern. Further 
development in relation to feedback on performance, decision 
making by the Board, directors’ development and succession 
planning were raised as key items. Committee size was also 
a common theme among each of the questionnaires.
Following a detailed review at its meeting, the Board agreed 
to several actions, which included:
•  A review of committee size to increase effectiveness and 
reflect that of comparatively sized FTSE 350 companies.  
This will be undertaken by the Chairman following the 
appointment of Andrew Wyllie, our additional new 
independent non-executive director, on 1 September 2017.
•  Increased focus during the year on board succession and 
succession planning.
•  The introduction of further opportunities for board 
development such as team building events delivered 
by an external facilitator.
Interaction with shareholders
The Chairman ensures that the views of shareholders are 
communicated to the Board as a whole. The non-executive 
directors can attend meetings with the shareholders to enable 
them to develop an understanding of their views.
Principle E.1 of the Code requires that there should 
be a dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives. The Board should also keep in 
touch with shareholder opinion in whatever ways are most 
practical. This is carried out through the Boards meetings to 
share views on long-term strategy. The Boards also meet for a 
scheduled six monthly dinner to share ideas and views on the 
effects of topical issues (eg Brexit).
The Company takes a systematic approach to identifying, 
prioritising and engaging its key stakeholders, who are 
many and varied. The Company’s communications team 
co-ordinates stakeholder engagement activity across 
the business.
Quarterly, the communications team carries out an analysis 
of current and forthcoming issues affecting the business, 
drawing on insight and research gathered by the business 
and the Company’s strategic and operational risk registers. 
The analysis involves looking at several specific areas – the 
political, economic, social, technological, environmental and 
internal environments. This analysis is then used to draw up 
communication, engagement and influencing programmes 
with key stakeholder groups.
In view of the private status of the Company it does 
not hold an annual general meeting.
Conflicts of interest
All directors have a statutory duty to avoid any situation in 
which they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest 
which conflicts or possibly may conflict with the interests 
of the Company. In accordance with standard practice, the 
Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions which 
permit those directors who are not conflicted to authorise 
conflict situations. Procedures have been put in place for 
the disclosure of any potential conflicts by the directors to 
the Board and if appropriate for the authorisation of such 
conflicts. The procedures permit any authorisation to be 
subject to any conditions that the directors who are not 
conflicted consider being appropriate. All of the directors 
are required to notify the Company Secretary if they believe 
a conflict situation might arise and directors are required to 
consider any conflicts at each board meeting. The directors 
do not consider that during the financial year any actual 
conflicts of interest have arisen between the roles of the 
directors as directors of the Company and any other roles 
which they may hold.
Page 73
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Corporate governance statement 
The Board confirms that it has complied with the Code throughout the year under review save in the following respects:
•  A.4.1 During the year Anthony Rabin stepped down as senior independent director upon his appointment as Chairman and 
following the retirement of Richard Parry-Jones. The appointment of a new senior independent director did not take place 
immediately when he stepped down pending the appointment of new independent directors. Following a protracted period 
of recruitment for new independent directors, the Nomination Committee determined to recommend to the Board that 
Ray O’Toole be appointed as the Senior Independent Director. The Board was satisfied that there were open channels for 
discussion between the Chairman, Chief Executive and other directors, and the shareholders during the period when there 
was no appointed senior independent director. Upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee the Board 
approved the appointment of Ray O’Toole as the Senior Independent Director on 12 July 2017.
• B.1.1 As noted above, Martin Havenhand had served on the Board for nine and a half years when he stepped down in March 
2017. Kath Pinnock has also served for more than nine years and the intention is she will step down during the financial year 
2017/18. The extension of their terms of appointment beyond nine years has enabled a thorough search for new independent 
non-executive directors to be undertaken. Martin Havenhand stepped down following the appointment of Julia Unwin and 
Teresa Robson-Capps. It is the intention that Kath Pinnock will step down on 31 August 2017 with the appointment of  
Andrew Wyllie as a new independent non-executive director commencing on 1 September 2017. The Board has been satisfied 
that Martin Havenhand and Kath Pinnock have remained independent in judgement and character throughout their terms 
of office and for the period following each of their nine year terms. The Board regards the extension of their terms of office 
beyond nine years as being for a minimal period. 
• B.1.2 Except for the periods 1 April to 31 May 2016 and 1 January to 31 March 2017, half of the Board excluding the Chairman 
was not comprised of independent non-executive directors. As explained above, an extensive and rigorous recruitment process 
has been undertaken for new Board members who will have diverse characteristics reflective of the region and communities 
we serve. The process of recruitment has been longer than first anticipated, resulting in failure to comply with section 
B.1.2 of the Code. 
•  B.2.3 The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms, however, there are two instances where terms have 
exceeded six years. The Board considers that when the terms were extended this was appropriate; that the directors retained 
their independence and there is no adverse impact on the Company in having directors serve more than a six year term. 
The directors are not submitted for re-election at regular intervals and considering the private status of the Company the 
articles of the Company do not require that the directors retire by rotation.
•  B.7.1 The directors are not subject to re-election every three years as the Company is a private company and the articles of 
the Company do not require that the directors retire by rotation.
•  C.3.1 For the period from his appointment as interim Chairman on 31 May 2016 until 26 January 2017 Anthony Rabin 
remained on the Audit Committee and was chair of that Committee until the appointment of Teresa Robson-Capps on 1 
January 2017. He stepped down from the Committee on 26 January 2017. Whilst the Board recognised that in this period 
the Company was not in full compliance with the Code, it was felt necessary, as mentioned above, for the Committee to 
retain Anthony’s recent and relevant financial experience.
•  E.2 As a private company, the Company is not required to hold an annual general meeting unless the shareholders so 
request. Representatives from the Board, and the board committees, meet regularly with shareholders throughout the year.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 13 July 2017.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Nomination Committee Report
The members of the Nomination Committee are the non-executive directors of the Company together with the Chief Executive. 
The Chair of the Committee was the Company Chairman during the financial year. The Chief Executive, the Director of Human 
Resources and the Company Secretary have attended meetings by invitation. The proceedings of the Nomination Committee 
are reported to the Board.
The Committee meets at least once a year and when required to review the structure, size and composition of the Board, 
the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee make recommendations to the Board about any adjustments 
that are deemed necessary.
The Nomination Committee met on four occasions during the reporting year to consider:
•  The recruitment process for the appointment of two new independent non-executive directors.
•  A further recruitment process for the appointment of an additional independent non-executive director.
•  The extension of Kath Pinnock’s term of office to 31 August 2017.
•  The extension of Martin Havenhand’s term of office to 31 March 2017.
•  The extension of Ray O’Toole’s term of office to 28 June 2018.
Board appointments
In early 2016, the Company commissioned the external search agency, Odgers Berndtson, and made use of their network, 
to assist in the recruitment of two independent non-executive directors to replace Martin Havenhand and Kath Pinnock who 
were to retire in 2017. As part of their search, Odgers Berndtson also advertised openly on the Sunday Times Online and 
Executiveappointments.com. A selection committee including the Chairman, Kath Pinnock, Richard Flint and the Director 
of Human Resources, Shauna Purdey was established to oversee the process.
After Anthony Rabin’s appointment as Chairman in September 2016, the search commissioned by Odgers Berndtson was 
widened to include a third additional independent non-executive director.
A lengthy recruitment process resulted from the Board’s requirement for an extensive list of candidates to satisfy the Board’s 
focus on the areas of gender and ethnicity. All shortlists derived from the search and nomination process for new board 
members were therefore balanced about age, gender, skills and experience and ethnic background.
The key skills required of the candidates were identified in line with the board skills matrix to include political experience, either 
regional or national, digital technology experience, customer service experience and experience of industries which had been 
opened to competition.
Following the Committee’s recommendation to the Board, Teresa Robson-Capps and Julia Unwin were appointed 
in January 2017.
A search for a third new independent non-executive director has taken place using an independent recruitment agency with 
no connections to the Company. On 12 July 2017, following the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board 
approved the appointment of Andrew Wyllie as an independent non-executive with effect from 1 September 2017.
Pending this appointment, it was agreed that Kath Pinnock’s term of appointment would be extended by a further six months 
until 31 August 2017. Although this extends her term of office beyond nine years, the Board considered that in this period Kath’s 
independence of judgement and character was retained and her contribution to the Board will be valuable during this time.
Subsequent to the year end, the Committee met on 7 June 2017, to consider the appointment of a senior independent director. 
Upon the recommendation of the Committee, Ray O’Toole was appointed to the position of Senior Independent Director by the 
Board on 12 July 2017.
Page 75
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Succession planning
To maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience on the Board, the Nomination Committee also keeps under review 
the leadership needs of the Company, including succession plans for appointments to the Board.
The Board recognises that the absence of good succession planning can be a risk to the long-term success of the Company and 
is essential in securing good governance. It has therefore been identified from the latest Board evaluation as an area for increased 
focus and will be linked to the Board’s strategy for the remainder of AMP6.
The Board has produced a capability and experience matrix to ensure that the key skills, knowledge and experience are provided 
by all board members, including corporate responsibility and sustainability. This was last reviewed by the Nomination Committee 
in January 2016 as part of the review process prior to the recruitment of Julia Unwin and Teresa Robson-Capps and will remain 
under review considering the current recruitment process for a new independent non-executive director.
Board diversity
The Corporate Responsibility (CR) Committee has continued to lead discussion on the Board’s approach and objectives for 
the Company in relation to diversity and inclusion. It is the intention that the Remuneration Committee will continue to develop 
the work of the CR Committee in these areas.
The Company continues to focus on the areas of gender and ethnicity, enhancing the balance within its workforce to progress 
it towards becoming a more diverse and inclusive employer. The Board has successfully achieved its target of 25% female board 
representation in advance of 2020. The Board will however continue to review its progress annually. The Board may also consider 
setting an aspirational target for board diversity.
All board members completed the Company’s e-learning diversity and inclusion training during the financial year. The Group’s 
Diversity and Inclusion policy is available on the website at: www.keldagroup.com/media/2497/e5-human-rights-policy.pdf
Gender, ethnicity and age statistics are provided in the Strategic Report on page 37.
Further details of the Board’s policy and objectives on diversity are referred to on page 107.
Page 76
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Audit Committee Report
For the year ended 31 March 2017
Role and Membership
The role of the Audit 
Committee is to review the 
integrity of the financial 
statements, including the 
financial and accounting 
policies and practices, and 
to monitor the system of 
internal control. 
To support the achievement of this the Committee approves 
and monitors the delivery of both the internal audit and 
external audit plans, follows up on concerns they raise 
and oversees the quality of service provided by each. The 
Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment of the external audit and the audit fee.
The Committee also reviews the arrangements by which 
employees can raise, in confidence, concerns about potential 
improprieties. It provides oversight to issues raised, the 
outcome of investigations and subsequent action.
To ensure compliance with the new EU audit framework, 
which came into effect in the UK in June 2016 and resulted in 
several changes to the Companies Act 2016, minor changes 
were introduced to the Audit Committee terms of reference. 
These include, requiring the Committee to:
•  Re-tender the external audit contract at least every ten 
years, and appoint a new auditor at least every 20 years, 
to reflect the new provisions under the Companies 
Act 2016 for public companies.
•  Have competence relevant to the sector in which the 
Company operates, a new addition to the Corporate 
Governance Code.
•  Comprise at least three independent non-executive 
directors, and that the Chairman shall be an independent 
non-executive director, in line with the 2016 Code and 
changes introduced to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
These amendments address specific changes under the 2016 
Code, the terms of reference remain in compliance with the 
current code and a wider review of this will be undertaken 
during 2017/18.
The leadership of the Committee changed in January 2017, 
with Teresa Robson-Capps taking the role of Audit Committee 
Chair. Julia Unwin also joined the Committee in January as a 
new independent non-executive director.
Independence of the external auditor
Financial Reporting Council revisions to the Corporate 
Governance Code guidance for audit committees and the 
Ethical Standard for auditors have replaced other standards. 
The guidance is applicable to the Company for the 2017/18 
financial year. The aim of the change in guidance is to improve 
the independence of the external auditor.
The Company has reviewed its auditor independence policy in 
the light of these changes. The policy establishes procedures 
and guidance by which the Company’s relationship with its 
external auditor is governed. This enables the Committee to 
satisfy itself that there are no factors which may, or may be 
seen to, impinge upon the independence and objectivity of 
the audit process, about the level of non-audit fees.
The Committee does not pre-approve the provision of any 
non-audit work by the external auditor. The allocation of 
each piece of non-audit work to the external auditor is to be 
approved in advance. The Committee satisfies itself that the 
auditor is best placed to provide the service and that a market 
rate has been obtained. Minor amendments have been made 
to the list of non-audit services that cannot be provided 
by the auditor.
From the financial year starting 1 April 2020, the Committee 
has set a cap on fees for non-audit work across the Group in 
any one financial year of 70% of the statutory external audit 
fee for the whole Group. The only exception to this cap is the 
fee for work required by law or regulation. The cap shall be 
calculated by comparing the fees for non-audit work provided 
by the external auditor or networked firm to the Kelda Group 
in any one year with the average statutory audit fee, excluding 
fees for any audit related services such as comfort letters, over 
the previous three years. 
Page 77
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements In addition to these updated areas the key features of the 
auditor independence policy are:
•  Clear accountability of the external auditor to the 
Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Board.
•  The external auditor is required to disclose all relationships 
which may affect the firm’s independence and the 
objectivity of the audit partner and staff.
•  The external auditor is required to disclose the safeguards 
and steps taken in order to ensure its independence  
and objectivity.
•   The external auditor is required to confirm in writing to  
the committee that in its judgement, it is independent 
within the meaning of the relevant regulations and 
professional requirements. 
•  The external auditor is required to disclose any gifts or 
hospitality which have been provided or exchanged 
between the company and the auditor, unless in the case 
of gifts, the value is clearly insignificant and in the case of 
hospitality it is reasonable in terms of its frequency, 
nature and cost.
•  Rotation of external audit partners and appropriate 
restrictions on appointment of employees of the 
external auditor.
The split between audit and non-audit fees and a description 
of the non-audit fees for the year to 31 March 2017 appears 
in note 3 to the Statutory Financial Statements. The amount 
and nature of non-audit fees are considered by the Committee 
not to affect the independence or objectivity of the 
external auditor.
Effectiveness of the external auditor
The Committee meets with the external auditors without 
the presence of executive management when considered 
necessary or appropriate to do so and, in any event, annually.
To fulfil its responsibilities in respect of considering the 
effectiveness of the external auditors the Audit Committee 
has reviewed:
•  The scope of work, areas of responsibility and terms in 
the external audit engagement letter.
•  The audit plan as presented by the external auditors for 
the Company and Group.
•  The detailed findings of the audit as reported to the 
Committee and discussed any areas of focus that have 
been identified.
•  The findings from an internal survey completed by the 
Board and management stakeholders about the conduct 
and quality of the audit.
The Audit Committee, having considered all available 
information, is satisfied with the effectiveness of the 
external auditors.
Appointment of new auditor
In compliance with EU audit reform the Board agreed that 
as PwC have been providing the Group external audit since 
2007/08 it would re-tender the audit for the financial year 
ending 31 March 2018. The Audit Committee approved the 
tender and evaluation process in September 2016. Tenders 
were invited from leading audit firms Ernst Young, Deloitte 
and Grant Thornton as well as the incumbents. KPMG were 
unable to tender due to independence considerations. 
An access day was held with management, the Chairman  
and Audit Committee Chair on 24 January 2017.  
Tender documents were assessed according to the  
approved methodology. Three firms were selected to  
progress to the final phase of the tender process.  
This involved final detailed presentations to Committee  
on 23 March. The Committee agreed on the preferred 
candidate and made a recommendation to Board. 
The recommendation to appoint Deloitte to succeed PwC  
was accepted by Board at the meeting on 23 March 2017,  
and is effective once PwC conclude the 2016/17 audits of  
the Kelda Group subsidiaries later in 2017.
Audit Committee agenda
During 2016/17 the Audit Committee has met six times. 
Its regular business included consideration of reports on 
the financial statements, the Annual Performance Report, 
assurance over regulatory compliance and readiness for 
non-household retail competition, risk management, audit 
planning, the activities of the Risk and Internal Audit team and 
its key findings, and consideration of the operation of internal 
control processes. 
The Committee reported to Board that it had discharged its 
responsibilities during the year. The key tasks undertaken to 
achieve this were:
•  Reviewing the Company’s financial statements, including an 
assessment of the appropriateness of the key judgements 
supporting them.
•  Assessing the implications of the report from the external 
auditor on the Company’s regulatory performance.
•  Considering the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management system.
•  Reviewing the corporate risk appetite for 
recommendation to Board.
•  Assessing the Company’s system of internal control through 
the receipt of quarterly updates from Internal Audit as well 
as individual reports addressing specific issues.
•  Overseeing the Company’s relationship with the external 
auditors, agreeing the nature and scope of the audit and 
reviewing the independence, performance and effectiveness 
of the external auditors.
•  Approving the 2016/17 Group Internal Audit charter and 
Internal Audit three-year plan.
•  Reviewing the assurance over the delivery of the 
requirements of the Water Act, particularly the Company’s 
readiness for non-household retail competition. 
•  Reviewing the company’s Whistleblowing Policy.
Page 78
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements In undertaking these tasks the Committee received and 
reviewed work carried out by the internal and external 
auditors and their findings. Both the internal and external 
auditors work to an annual plan developed in consultation 
with the Committee. In addition, the Committee reviewed 
specific business areas and processes from time to time.
The Audit Committee has advised the Board on whether 
this Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Company has a policy (Speak Up, our whistleblowing 
policy) for disclosure of malpractice which applies to the 
Company. The Committee reviewed the arrangements by 
which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters 
and the approach to investigating these. The Committee 
receives a quarterly update on the outcome of investigations 
and actions taken to address any issues raised. 
Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
in relation to the 2016/17 financial statements
During the year the Audit Committee considered the ongoing 
appropriateness of the Company’s accounting policies. The 
significant financial issues/judgements in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements and disclosures have been 
discussed and challenged, with input from management and 
the external auditor. This has included:
Long-Term Viability (LTV) of the Company
2015/16 was the first year the Company prepared a LTV 
statement. The statement has been enhanced for 2016/17 
through review of external best practice, specific feedback 
received from stakeholders and improvements in the risk 
management process. The period of consideration is the eight 
years to 31 March 2025 which covers the remainder of AMP6 
and AMP7. The LTV statement is included on pages 48 to 50 
within the Strategic Report.
The UK Corporate Governance Code, section C2.2, requires 
directors to state whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, drawing attention to any qualifications or 
assumptions as necessary. The Going Concern Statement is 
included on page 108 within the Directors’ Report.
Taxation
There are few judgements applied in the calculation of 
taxation and deferred taxation in the Yorkshire Water Financial 
Statements. The Audit Committee reviewed the tax disclosure 
notes explaining the tax position and ensured transparency by 
requesting that disclose the rationale for not paying for utilised 
group tax losses in Yorkshire Water. The effective tax rate and 
the overall suite of taxation paid, including non-corporation 
tax payments are explained in the Strategic Report.
The corporation tax creditor at the year-end reflects an 
estimate of the amount of corporation tax payable for 
fiscal years with open corporation tax computations with 
HMRC. The deferred tax provision at the year-end reflects 
the estimated accounting provision. This is due to timing 
differences arising from the inclusion of income and  
expenses in tax computations in periods different from  
those in which they are recognised in the Financial  
Statements. The Audit Committee challenged management’s 
preparation of these estimates, assessed the inputs and 
deemed them to be reasonable.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments
The Yorkshire Water Financing Group holds several index-
linked swaps and other financial instruments such as interest 
rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and energy 
swaps. FRS 102 was adopted when the standard became 
applicable and requires that when arriving at the fair value of 
the financial instruments the credit position of the Company 
is considered.
Yorkshire Water Financing Group has 116 such instruments 
and obtains the fair value of its various financial instruments 
using the following methods:
•  29 instruments have been valued based on third party 
valuations, primarily from banks. As required by the 
accounting standards, Yorkshire Water adjusts the 
mid-market valuation provided by third parties to reflect 
its own credit risk. The interest rate swaps, cross currency 
swaps and finance lease swaps are valued this way.
•  87 instruments are valued using a custom-built index-
linked swaps valuation model as the institutions that these 
instruments are held with do not perform their own mark to 
market valuation. The model is used in preparing valuations 
which form part of the audited Financial Statements. 
The financial markets remain highly volatile post the Brexit 
vote in June 2016. There was a significant movement in the 
fair value of index-linked swaps at the half year which has 
since stabilised. The valuation has been calculated as at 31 
March using the above methodology.
Infrastructure assets
The Company has adopted a policy of revaluing its 
infrastructure assets to ensure that the balance sheet reflects 
the value of the assets to the Company at each reporting 
date. The valuation is arrived at using Value in Use (VIU).
VIU is determined using a discounted cash flows approach to 
calculate the Business Enterprise Value. The key assumptions 
used in the model are the discount rate (the cost of equity), 
Retail Price Index (RPI) and the cashflow assumptions. The 
Audit Committee has reviewed and challenged management’s 
decision to adopt a consistently prudent approach to the 
overall value of the discount, maintaining the premium over 
RCV at a slightly higher level of 18% compared to the 15% 
applied in 2015. A long-term RPI rate has been adopted of 
3.0% (2015/16: 3.0%) which is based on the 2% government 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) target plus a 1% estimate of the 
wedge between RPI and CPI.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Provision for doubtful debts
Due to the nature of the business the provisioning of doubtful 
debts is by necessity based on subjective judgement of the 
recoverability of debtor balances. The approach considers 
the ageing of the debtors and historical experience on 
recoverability. The Committee has reviewed management’s 
report setting out the assumptions used to calculate the 
provision for doubtful debts and it was concluded that the 
approach continues to be appropriate.
Exceptional Items
The accounting treatment and disclosure of exceptional items 
is reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Audit Committee. 
In 2016/17 this includes treatment of the income and costs 
relating to the 2015 flood and the valuation of index-linked 
swaps. In line with accounting policy these items are disclosed 
as materially significant either by their nature or by their value 
and warrant separate disclosure.
Measured income accrual
The forecast measured income accrual is an estimate of the 
amount of water and waste water charges unbilled at the 
year end. It is system generated based on algorithms using 
historical water consumption and tariff data at a customer 
account level. This is consistent with the approach adopted  
in previous years.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Company’s internal control 
systems and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Board 
confirms that procedures providing an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Company have been in place for 
the year to 31 March 2017 and up to the date of approval 
of the ARFS and are regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Company has a comprehensive and well-defined risk 
management policy, including control policies, with clear 
structures, delegated authority levels and accountabilities, 
described within the Strategic Report. The process is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. The process can only provide reasonable, 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group Risk Committee monitors the overall level of risk, 
the quality of control frameworks and the delivery of action 
plans to bring risk in line with appetite. 
In 2016/17 the Company has reviewed the effectiveness of its 
risk management process, to ensure that it is comprehensive, 
integrated, proactive and based on constant monitoring of 
business risk. All risks are managed at the appropriate level 
through the risk register hierarchy and stated controls, owners 
and action plans where necessary. The key features of the 
process include the following:
•  The key risks facing the Company are identified through a 
clear risk assessment matrix, and recorded in the corporate 
risk register.
•  The Risk Committee reviews all movements in strategic 
risk as well as considering the adequacy of the controls in 
place to mitigate strategic risks to risk appetite.
•  Risk registers are maintained by individual business units, 
with clear allocation of management responsibility for risk 
identification, recording, analysis and control.
•  Risk assessment is completed with use of strategic risk 
impact and probability scales and results plotted to 
enable prioritised action.
•  Key risk indicators are used to monitor changes 
in risk position.
•  The Risk Committee reviews the Company’s 
strategic risk position.
•  A risk review is conducted with KMT and the Board using 
a PESTLE analysis (political, economic, social, technological, 
legal and environmental) at least annually.
•  The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the 
effectiveness of the risk management process, systems, 
controls and resources on behalf the Company.
•  Delivery of the risk based Internal Audit plan provides 
independent assurance to Audit Committee and 
senior leaders.
The Committee has considered the control environment 
and control activities which the Board can rely on for 
disclosures in this report. During the reporting year, the 
Committee has also acted on behalf of the Company to 
review the effectiveness of:
•  Risk management: Internal audit conducted by our internal 
audit co-source partner, KPMG, including materiality 
assessment and comparison to best practice.
•  The effectiveness of internal audit: Monitoring performance 
against agreed Key Performance Indicators. 
•  The effectiveness of external audit: Annual questionnaire 
of key stakeholders allowed tracking of performance 
against targets. 
The Audit Committee confirms that it has reviewed the 
system of internal control. It has received the reports of the 
Committee and has conducted a formal review covering all 
controls including financial, operational, compliance and risk 
management. No significant failings of internal control were 
identified during these reviews, limited weaknesses were 
identified, none of which are significant and all have clear 
action plans to address them in an appropriate time frame.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements  Annual Statement by the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee), 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
including details of the directors’ pay for the year to 
31 March 2017 .
Remuneration highlights
Our current remuneration policy continues to set the framework 
for our Directors’ remuneration. During the year under review, 
the design and structure of our executive incentive plans 
remained the same as the year before and ensured that a 
significant proportion of remuneration earned by directors is 
linked to performance. Our policy will continue to reflect this 
principle in 2017/18.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee’s main goal has been to ensure that  
our remuneration practices have been in line with our 
approved policy. Activities included:
•  Approval of the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
participants.
•  Review and approval of Executive Directors’ individual  
and departmental objectives.
•  Approval of the vesting position of the 2014 LTIP.
•  Review and approval of Executive Directors’ salary levels.
•  Review and approval of Executive Directors’ and senior 
manager bonus levels.
Directors’ performance and impact on pay
In delivering the stretching targets which were set at the 
beginning of the year, the leadership team has delivered 
strong performance and been driven by our consistent focus 
on putting the needs of our customers first. As a regulated 
business and a provider of the most essential services to 
customers, we recognise that in the short and long-term 
we must continue to deliver against all our Strategic Business 
Objectives (SBOs) as well as delivering exceptional service 
to customers.
This strong performance was demonstrated by the delivery of 
an improved score in the water industry’s measure of service, 
SIM, with 83.4 points compared to the 2015/16 score of 82.6. 
We also ranked as the highest performing water company 
in the UK Customer Service Index (UKCSI) and our average 
combined water and sewerage bills are the second lowest in 
the UK. We continue to outperform our regulatory leakage 
management target and have successfully completed significant 
investment to protect and enhance the environment.
Good progress has been made against the delivery of our safety 
improvement plan which remains the priority of the leadership 
team. We continue to meet the challenge of operating 
efficiently and delivering fair returns to shareholders.
Outperformance on many of the targets set has led to 
payments being awarded under the annual and long-term 
incentive plans. Details of how these have been calculated are 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
This report is divided into the remuneration policy and an 
annual report on remuneration which sets out and explains 
how this policy was implemented during 2016/17 and its 
proposed application in the current financial year.

Remuneration Policy Report
The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration 
and conditions of employment of the executive directors and 
the next most senior category of executives.
The Company’s remuneration policy is set out in detail below. 
The Company’s policy is to ensure that it attracts and retains 
key talent with the skills and experience necessary to lead and 
manage a business of Yorkshire Water’s size and complexity.
Remuneration packages for executives are designed to enable 
the creation of sustainable long-term value for shareholders 
and align with the interests of our customers. Accordingly, 
a significant proportion of directors’ remuneration is tied to 
performance through annual and long-term incentive plan 
awards. Additionally, remuneration packages are structured 
to enable executive directors to receive remuneration which 
is positioned in the upper quartile of the market for upper 
quartile performance, considering the relevant market and 
industry comparators, individual performance, responsibilities 
and experience.
To help guide and inform the Remuneration Committee, total 
remuneration is benchmarked periodically against the Water 
Industry and/or Utilities companies of a similar size, complexity 
and geographic scope when determining competitive 
remuneration levels.
The current remuneration package for directors comprises 
the elements set out in the table below and remains 
unchanged from that disclosed in the 2015/16 remuneration 
report (save for references to financial years and the 
pay scenario figures, which have been updated where 
appropriate).
The Remuneration Committee commits to:
•  Promoting the maintenance of a robust remuneration policy 
aligned with the Company’s strategic priorities.
•  Ensuring the Board’s approved business strategy is 
supported by the incentive plans in operation.
•  Rewarding the Executive Directors’ on Company success 
by linking a significant proportion of their remuneration 
opportunity to Company performance.
•  Monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of the remuneration 
policy to ensure that it achieves its aim of attracting, 
motivating and retaining the leaders and talent required  
to deliver exceptional shareholder and customer value. 
The following table on pages 85 and 86 sets out each element 
of reward and how it supports the Company’s short and long-
term strategic objectives.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Annual incentive plan bonus opportunity
In recognition of their Group responsibilities, the Chief Executive 
and the Director of Finance, Regulation and Markets can earn 
an annual incentive award of up to 100% of their salary. Other 
executive directors on the Board can earn an annual incentive 
award of up to 70% of their salary.
Under this plan the annual incentive award is calculated as a 
percentage of basic salary as at 31 March as follows:
Incentive bonus payments are made in June based on 
performance in the year ending on the preceding 31 March.
Long-term incentive plan opportunity
The Chief Executive and the Director of Finance, Regulation 
and Markets can earn an LTIP award of up to 200% of their 
salary. Other executive directors on the Board can earn an LTIP 
award of up to 150% of their salary. The LTIP is a rolling 
three-year plan based on the achievement of specific 
performance conditions with targets set at the start of the 
performance period.
The proportion of the award that will vest following the 
performance period is dependent upon the Company’s 
performance during the three-year period. Benefits under 
the plan are non-pensionable.
Awards will not vest unless the Committee is satisfied that 
underlying financial performance has been satisfactory 
over the performance period, considering the Company’s 
circumstances, including the regulatory regime in place over 
the period. The Committee can scale back vesting to any 
extent considered appropriate.
The LTIP rules provide that in prescribed circumstances such 
as death, injury, disability, retirement, business transfer or 
any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, 
outstanding awards will vest as normal on the original 
vesting date to the extent that the performance conditions 
are satisfied. At the end of the performance period and 
unless the Committee decides otherwise, the award would 
normally be reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect the period 
of time between the award date and the date on which the 
participant ceases to be employed by the Company.
50% of the maximum annual bonus  
payable is dependent upon delivery of agreed 
personal / individual objectives set at the start

which vested in 2016/17 are provided in the section below 
entitled Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Performance measures and target setting approach
The annual incentive plan is designed to reward the delivery 
of in-year targets. Performance measures are based on a 
balanced set of performance measures which are linked 
directly to the corporate strategy. We describe our strategy in 
the Strategic Report of this ARFS.
Annual incentive payments are subject to the achievement of 
stretching performance hurdles for each measure, which are 
determined at the outset of the financial year. Each measure is 
considered separately, as well as collectively, with targets set to 
ensure that the potential outcomes are affordable and aligned 
with the annual budget agreed by the Board. Annual targets 
are determined based on the approved five-year business plan 
which took effect from 2015/16 and these will be material in 
determining actual performance and therefore any incentive 
bonus payable.

When determining performance conditions for the long-term 
incentives, the Committee looks to align executive directors’ 
pay with overall Company performance and the longer-term 
interests of our shareholders and customers. LTIP Performance 
Conditions and targets are set to be stretching but achievable, 
and are reviewed at the start of each cycle based on a 
number of internal and external reference points. 
A description of how the plan operates is provided below.
Step one – Ofwat Performance Condition
The SIM Performance Condition acts as a gateway and is 
met only if the Company SIM performance is at or above 
a predetermined threshold. If the SIM outturn is below the 
threshold set, the LTIP will not vest. Once the gateway is open, 
dependent on the achievement of SIM targets above the 
threshold, Cashflow and Stability and Reliability performance 
conditions, the vesting of the LTIP is either capped at 50% 
or 75%. A cap does not apply if the maximum SIM target 
is achieved.
Step two – Cashflow Performance Condition
Following the end of the three-year performance period, 
the Committee determines the achievement of the Cashflow 
Performance Condition, and subject to the Stability and 
Reliability Performance Condition set out in Step three below, 
a percentage for vesting of the award is determined in 
accordance with the following table:
Cashflow measure
Percentage 
determined
Targeted Cashflow is at least 120% 100%
Targeted Cashflow is at least 
100% but below 120%
Pro rata between 
70% and 100%
Targeted Cashflow is at least 90% 
but below 100%
Pro rata between 
1% and 70%
Targeted Cashflow is less than 90% 0%
Step three – Stability and Reliability 
Performance Condition
The Stability and Reliability Performance Condition is that 
25% of the percentage determined under Step two shall vest 
in respect of the awards for each Ofwat stability measure as 
assessed in the Ofwat Report (or where replaced and assessed 
by regulatory self-reporting procedures for performance in 
the third year of the LTIP performance period) (financial year 
2016/17 for the 2014 award, 2017/18 for the 2015 award and 
2018/19 for the 2016 award) as “stable” or “improving” .
Page 89
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Step four – SIM Bonus 
In the event that the Ofwat Ranking of Yorkshire Water is first 
amongst the Ofwat Comparator Group for the Ofwat SIM 
Measure as ranked in the Ofwat Report (or in the event that 
such ranking is not published by Ofwat, as ranked by such 
other comparative assessment as adopted by the Committee 
for performance in the third year of the applicable LTIP 
performance period) then a further 10% will be added to the 
amount to vest in respect of the 2016 award, i.e. the amount 
to vest would be 110% of the value derived after Step three.
In the event that the Ofwat Ranking of Yorkshire Water is 
second or lower amongst the Ofwat Comparator Group 
for the Ofwat SIM Measure or an alternative measure as 
described above, then no SIM bonus will be paid and the 
amount to vest would be as derived after Step three.
Pay for performance scenarios
A significant proportion of executive remuneration is 
performance related and therefore “at risk” . The figure below 
is an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities 
for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between 
the different elements of remuneration, under three different 
performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘On-target’ 
and ‘Maximum.

The ‘Minimum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, (salary

elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages 
not linked to performance. Taxable benefits are the value of 
benefits provided by the Company which includes healthcare 
provision for 2017/18, company car or the cash equivalent and 
fuel (assumed to be the same levels as the 2016/17 values).
The ‘On-target’ scenario for Richard Flint and Liz Barber 
reflects their fixed remuneration plus an annual incentive pay 
out of 85% of the maximum bonus payable as well as the 
vesting of the LTIP at 70% of the maximum award. For Nevil 
Muncaster and Charlie Haysom, the ‘On-target’ scenario 
reflects their fixed remuneration plus an annual incentive of 
approximately 86% of the maximum bonus payable as well 
as the vesting of the LTIP at 70% of the maximum award.
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, 
plus full pay out of all incentives.
Remuneration Committee discretion
The Remuneration Committee may exercise discretion in four 
broad areas for each element of remuneration, as follows:
•  To ensure fairness and align executive remuneration 
with underlying individual and Company performance, 
the Committee may adjust, upwards or downwards, the 
outcome of any annual or long-term incentive plan payment 
within the limits of the relevant plan rules.
•  Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made 
on a neutral basis, i.e. the intention of any adjustment 
will be that the event is not to the benefit or detriment of 
participants. Adjustments due to underlying performance 
may be made in exceptional circumstances to ensure 
outcomes are fair both to shareholders and participants.
•  In the case of a non-regular event occurring,  
the Committee may apply its discretion to ensure  
fairness and seek alignment with business objectives.  
Non-regular events include, but are not limited to:  
corporate transactions, changes in the Company’s 
accounting policies, administrative matters, internal 
promotions, external recruitment, terminations, etc.
•  Any use of discretion by the Committee during the  
financial year will be detailed in the relevant Annual  
Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
When making decisions on executive director remuneration, 
the Committee considers the levels of remuneration and pay 
awards made to the wider employee population (see the 
remuneration policy for other employees in the section below).
Prior to the annual salary review, the HR Director provides the 
Committee with a summary of the proposed level of increase 
for overall employee pay, which forms a part of the analysis by 
the Committee on the appropriateness of any salary changes.
Remuneration policy for other employees
Our approach to remuneration considers affordability, levels 
of responsibility, individual performance and salary levels in 
comparable companies for all senior colleagues. The majority 
of employees are covered by collective agreements which are 
negotiated based on our principles of affordability, fairness 
and transparency.
All employees can participate in an incentive plan. Senior 
managers (34 colleagues as at April 2016) participate in the 
LTIP. All managers participate in an annual incentive scheme 
with potential bonuses of up to 10, 15 or 30% of salary based 
on seniority. All other colleagues participate in a quarterly 
bonus scheme, with payments that vary depending on 
company performance in that quarter.
In adherence to our principles of fairness and transparency, 
we pay all colleagues, contract partners and service providers 
minimum salaries equivalent to the voluntary Living Wage.
Pension scheme eligibility is consistent for all colleagues. 
The defined benefit scheme (KGPP) is closed to new members. 
All new colleagues have the option (subject to auto-enrolment 
provisions) to join the Company’s stakeholder scheme which is 
a defined contribution scheme.

Recruitment of Executive Directors
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive 
Director, the Remuneration Committee may make use of 
all the existing components of remuneration detailed in the 
Remuneration Policy including the following:
•  Basic pay of around the market median for the role when 
benchmarked across the Water Industry and/or Utilities.
•  A short-term review of basic pay may be agreed on 
appointment subject to performance for example, following 
up to 12 months in the role.
•  The annual incentive and LTIP offered subject to approval of 
the committee.
•  All other benefits apply in accordance with the contractual 
and non-contractual terms of the role. 
Service contracts
In respect of executive directors, the Company’s policy on 
the duration of service contracts is that they should not 
normally be of fixed duration, should be subject to twelve 
months’ notice by the Company and six months’ notice by the 
Director. Notice periods are consistent with current corporate 
governance best practice. Termination payments are made in 
accordance with the terms of the contract.
The executive directors service agreement dates are set 
out in the table below based on the policy outlined above. 
The agreements do not contain any specific provision 
for compensation payable on early termination. Any 
termination payment would be calculated to take account 
of the contractual notice period and any annual or long-
term incentive payment due, subject to the achievement of 
performance objectives, and considering the period worked.

Martin Havenhand and Richard Parry-Jones were 
non-executive directors during 2016/17. Martin Havenhand 
was re-appointed as a non-executive director for a six month 
period commencing on 1 October 2016. He stepped down on 
31 March 2017 at the end of his term of appointment. 
Richard Parry Jones retired on 31 May 2016.
Statement of policy for 2017/18
Following a review of the current remuneration policy, the 
Committee recommended the following changes to the 
design and structure of the annual incentive plan and the LTIP.
The changes made to the annual incentive plan for 2017/18 
include the following:
•  Increase in the weighting of Corporate Objectives for 
executive directors from 50% to 80%. The weighting for 
Personal Objectives, will reduce to 20% accordingly.
•  Within the agreed Corporate Objectives for 2017/18, 
there will be an increase in the weighting of financial 
measures within the scorecard to 60%
The above two changes will result in financial performance 
generating 48% of the annual bonus. The remaining 52% 
of annual bonus will be generated by performance across 
a range of corporate non-financial, transformational, 
departmental and individual objectives/measures. The tables 
on pages 93 and 94 set out the new structure and the annual 
performance targets for 2017/18.

2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Cash Available For Distribution (CAFD) performance 
condition will be positioned as the key performance metric 
that generates an LTIP award, rather than the SIM measure. 
The Stability & Reliability and SIM measures will then be used 
to moderate the level of vesting. The four elements of Stability 
and Reliability (water above ground, water below ground, 
waste water above ground, and waste water below ground) 
will each reduce the level of award by 20% if they are not at 
the ‘stable’ performance level, as will not achieving the SIM 
target. The SIM measure will reduce the LTIP award by 20% 
only if the SIM has not improved year-on-year, as per the 
Performance Commitment; by 10% if it has improved  
year-on-year, but has not met the agreed target; and not  
at all if the target is met or exceeded. The current relative  
SIM measure will be removed. The CAFD performance  
range of 90-120% will remain for the 2017-2020 LTIP.  
The 2017 LTIP targets will be disclosed retrospectively in  
the 2017/18 Annual Report.

Outcomes for LTIP 2014
On 11 August 2014, the Chief Executive and the Director of 
Finance, Regulation and Markets received awards equivalent 
to 200% of base salary. Other executive directors received 
awards equivalent to 150% of salary. Payments under the plan 
are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The awards made in 2014 were subject to the following 
performance conditions.
Step one – Ofwat Performance Condition
The SIM Performance Condition is met only if the Company 
SIM performance for 2016/17 is at or above 83 points. If SIM 
Performance is below 83 points in 2016/17 then the SIM 
Performance Condition shall not be met and the 2016 Award 
shall not vest. If SIM performance is 86 points or higher, the 
Award shall vest in accordance with the following table.
The table above is based on the Yorkshire Water SIM business plan target of 84 points in 2016/17.
Page 99
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Step two – Cashflow Performance Condition
Following the end of the three-year performance period, 
the Committee determines the achievement of the Cashflow 
performance measure. The Cashflow performance condition 
is that, subject to the Stability and Reliability Performance 
Condition set out in Step three below, a percentage for 
vesting of the award is determined in accordance with the 
following table.

70% and 100%
Targeted Cashflow is at least 90% 
but below 100%
Pro rata between 
1% and 70%
Targeted Cashflow is less than 90% 0%
The Cashflow measures are based on Cash For Distribution 
(CAFD) targets for the three-year vesting period. For the 2014 
LTIP award, they consisted of:
•  Distribution targets as approved in the 2014/15 
business plan for that year.
•  Distribution as per the approved 5 year Blueprint 
2020 plan for 2015/16 and 2016/17.
Step three – Stability and Reliability 
Performance Condition
The Stability and Reliability Performance Condition is that 
25% of the percentage determined under Step two shall 
vest in respect of the awards for each Ofwat stability and 
reliability measure as assessed in the Ofwat Report (or where 
replaced by alternative regulatory self-reporting procedures 
for performance in the financial year 2016/17 for the 2014 
award) as “stable” or “improving” .
Step four – SIM Bonus 
In the event that the Ofwat Ranking of Yorkshire Water is 
first amongst the Ofwat Comparator Group for the Ofwat 
SIM Measure as ranked in the Ofwat Report (or as ranked 
by an alternative comparative assessment adopted by 
the Remuneration Committee if the Ofwat ranking is not 
published in the 2016/17 financial year) then a further 10% 
will be added to the amount to vest in respect of the 2014 
award, i.e. the amount to vest would be 110% of the value 
derived after Step three.
In the event that the Ofwat Ranking of Yorkshire Water is 
second or lower amongst the Ofwat Comparator Group for 
the Ofwat SIM Measure as ranked in the Ofwat Report (or 
as ranked by an alternative comparative assessment adopted 
by the Remuneration Committee if the Ofwat ranking is not 
published in the 2016/17 financial year) then no SIM bonus 
will be paid and the amount to vest would be as derived 
after Step three.
Based on the achievement of the 2014 performance 
conditions set out below, the vesting of the 2014 LTIP was 
determined by the Committee on 7 June 2017 as follows:
1.  Yorkshire Water SIM performance for 2016/17 is 83.4 
points, therefore opening the gateway for the LTIP to vest 
with an overall cap of 50% depending on the outcomes 
of the other performance conditions below.
2.  The CAFD outturn against target over the three year was 
established at 112.6% resulting in a vesting of 88.9% 
(between 70% and 100% in the table left).
3.  Stability and reliability measures were achieved 
for all asset groups.
Water Infrastructure Stable
Water Non-infrastructure Stable
Sewerage Infrastructure Stable

4.  Yorkshire Water did not rank first in the Ofwat 
SIM Comparator Group for 2015/16.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Charlie Haysom
Membership of the Kelda Group Pension Plan, giving (from 
April 2013) pension of 1/77th of pensionable pay for each 
year of service plus additional lump sum based on 3/77ths of 
pensionable pay for each year of service. Normal retirement 
age is 65 but may take benefits built up for service prior to 1 
April 2013 unreduced from age 60 and benefits accrued from 
1 April 2013 unreduced from age 63.
Mr Haysom started drawing his Plan pension on 18 January 
2017 (i.e. his 60th birthday). The pension benefits built up 
after 31 March 2013 were actuarially reduced to reflect taking 
his benefits at age 60 (i.e. 3 years earlier than age 63). The 
total Plan pension (before any commutation) was £74,196 p.a. 
plus an additional lump sum of £5,416 after reflecting the 
appropriate early retirement reductions.
He is also entitled to benefits under the Employer Financed 
Retirement Benefits (“EFRBs”) Arrangement. Mr Haysom has 
been accruing pension benefits in the EFRBs (instead of the 
Plan) since April 2014. These benefits are not yet in payment 
and continuing to accrue going forwards. 
His remaining benefits that are not yet in payment (all in 
relation to EFRBs benefits) at 31 March 2017 are a pension  
of £14,660 p.a. plus an additional lump sum of £18,615.
To calculate the value of benefits accrued in the period 1 April 
2016 to 31 March 2017, we have taken the year end benefits 
to be those in payment from the Plan, as described, plus the 
accrued EFRBs benefits.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Dividends
A dividend of £139.1m was paid in the year (2015/16: £90.9m), 
broken down as follows:
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Gross dividends 139.1 90.9

Kelda Finance interest (24.4) (20.2)
Net distributions available 
to shareholders of Kelda 
Holdings limited 45.4 0.0
No final dividend for the year is proposed. 
The Company’s dividend policy is to: 
•  Deliver real growth in dividends recognising the 
management of economic risks, the continuing need for 
investment of profits in the business and to pay additional 
dividends which reflect efficiency improvement, and 
particularly improvements beyond those assumed in the 
determination of price limits.
• To pay dividends in respect of the non-regulated business 
reflecting the profitability of those activities.
•  Where it is foreseeable that the Company will have sufficient 
profits available for distribution, to continue to pay annual 
dividends consistent with this policy. The Company can also 
pay special dividends as part of any capital reorganisation 
which the Board concludes to be in the best interests of the 
Company and complies with its obligations under its licence.
The Directors consider that the dividends paid in the year are 
in accordance with these principles.
Reserves
The loss for the financial year of £261.3m (2015/16: profit 
of £236.2m) has been deducted from (2015/16: added to) 
the profit and loss reserve, bringing the balance held in this 
reserve to £539.2m (2015/16: £940.3m). Information relating 
to reserves is disclosed within the statement of changes 
in equity on page 117.
Research and development
The Company undertakes a programme of research in 
pursuit of improvements in service and operating efficiency. 
In 2016/17 £5.5m (2015/16 £5.1m) was committed 
to research and development.
Fixed assets
The Directors are aware that the value of certain land and 
buildings in the balance sheet may not be representative of 
their market value. However, a substantial proportion of land 
and buildings comprises specialised operational properties 
and structures for which there is no ready market and it is 
not therefore practicable to provide a full valuation.
Previously movements in fixed assets have included 
transfers to KeyLand Developments Limited, which were 
all made on the basis of independent external valuations 
obtained specifically for the purpose and approved by  
Ofwat. With effect from 1 April 1996, only those transfers 
with a value of over £500,000 have been subject to  
approval by Ofwat.
Revaluation of assets
Certain classes of the Company’s tangible fixed assets, 
infrastructure assets, were revalued in the year as detailed in 
note 12 to the Statutory Financial Statements. As a result of 
the valuation carried out at 31 March 2017 the carrying value 
of the infrastructure assets was increased by £280m and the 
resulting revaluation surplus taken to the revaluation reserve.
Certain classes of the Company’s land and buildings are 
also held at valuation, on the basis of existing use, valued 
by independent qualified valuers in March 2014. The assets 
subject to a policy of revaluation will continue to be revalued 
on a periodic basis, to coincide with valuations required for 
future Ofwat Periodic Reviews.
Capital and infrastructure renewals expenditure
Total expenditure on activities during the year amounted 
to £378.6m (2015/16: £252.9m). More information relating to 
capital expenditure and fixed assets is disclosed in note 12 
to the Statutory Financial Statements. This figure excludes 
£8.0m exceptional expenditure relating to the 2015 floods.
Environment 
The environmental policy of the Company recognises that 
a sustainable water and waste water business is dependent 
on environmentally sustainable operations. It is therefore 
committed to integrating environmental best practice and 
continuous improvement in environmental performance 
through the efficient, effective and proper conduct of 
its business. 
Environmental performance is reported throughout the 
Strategic Report of this Annual Report, and on the Company’s 
website which is regularly updated. This can be viewed at: 
www.yorkshirewater.com/about-us/what-we-do/investment-
in-the-environment
Community
The Company contributes actively to the communities which 
it serves. It encourages and supports colleagues in volunteering, 
charitable giving and community involvement. Our Big Wish for 
Ethiopia campaign focuses on six key themes of volunteering, 
fundraising, customers, influencing, education and capacity 
building. So far we have raised £731,000 towards our 5 year 
target of £1m for projects in Ethiopia. Further details on our 
community activities can be found in the Strategic Report of 
this ARFS.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Employees and employment policies 
The Company continues to place an importance on ensuring 
a positive working environment for all colleagues and a culture 
of open, honest internal communications and feedback. 
This is also described in the Trusted Company section of the 
Strategic Report. The Company Values provide the framework 
for the consistent behaviours expected from colleagues.
Colleague engagement takes place using a range of channels 
including regular operational ‘hubs’ covering over 900 
operational employees, the intranet, ‘Team Talks’ and ‘Talk 
Back’ sessions with line managers and directors, annual 
business plan cascades, ‘people leader’ events to cascade key 
business performance messages and a bi-annual employee 
engagement survey. All line managers are encouraged to 
develop and implement action plans with their teams, taking 
accountability for developing colleague morale, engagement 
and trusted relationships.
To further promote successful employee relations, collective 
bargaining arrangements are in place with the Company’s 
recognised trade unions – UNISON, GMB and Unite. In 
addition, Communication and Consultation forums take place 
across the Company, comprising elected union and non-
union employees meeting on a quarterly basis with directors 
and senior managers to share performance information and 
discuss health and safety issues. These meetings also provide 
an opportunity to seek employee views which can then be 
taken into account in decision making.
The Company is committed to providing a diverse and 
inclusive working environment which reflects its customer 
base and is committed to equality and opportunity for all. 
A director sponsored Diversity and Inclusion Working Group 
actively drives progress in this area; ensuring the policy is 
reviewed regularly, setting targets, monitoring progress and 
ensuring that the aspirations of the Company are being met. 
The Group has three prioritised areas of focus, Gender, Ability 
and Ethnicity, these key areas help us become a more diverse 
and inclusive employer and better reflect our customer base.
The Company focuses its recruitment activities so that they 
are attracting colleagues from all walks of life and experiences 
to encourage even greater innovation and creativity. 
They proactively identify roles within the business that could 
be particularly suitable for individuals with disabilities. 
The Company runs an internship in partnership with a local 
school for students with an autistic spectrum condition where 
students work in real roles in the business at the same time as 
gaining a formal qualification. The Company is now part of a 
group leading the role out of an internship programme across 
the region. The Company is a two tick employer and any 
candidate who considers themselves to have a disability 
is guaranteed an interview if they meet the essential 
criteria for the role.
The Company has a big role to play in addressing skills 
shortages, particularly when it comes to the Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects. 
The Company proactively supports national Women in 
Engineering week by running a number of events with girls 
from local schools. This year the company is re-engaging 
with girls who visited the previous year’s events with a view 
to tracking them and their aspirations and how they have 
changed over a number of years. The Company has invested 
in a STEM focussed development programme to support 
our female talent in technical roles and will support 100 
females through specific talent development programmes 
over this AMP.
The Company aims to attract, select, develop and retain 
the best talent to meet the needs of the business. There is 
a strong commitment to developing a pipeline of technical 
talent and understanding future skills requirements to meet 
the Company’s evolving needs. The talent framework is 
used to discuss aspirations, skills and development needs 
at all levels. During this AMP the Company will recruit 160 
apprentices to create a strong pipeline of talent for the future. 
The Company works in partnership with a number of schools 
across the region to ensure that young people become more 
employable when they leave school and have a better chance 
of gaining employment. The Company provides a wide range 
of development tools, including in-house and accredited 
programmes to help all employees develop the necessary skills, 
knowledge, values and experience to realise their performance 
potential. The Company also recognises the important role 
of mentoring and over 150 colleagues are in mentoring 
relationships either internally or externally.
Key to achieving operational excellence and delivering out-
performance is ensuring that every individual understands 
their role and how they can make a difference while feeling 
valued for their contribution. The Company is committed to 
rewarding the right performance and provides salary and 
benefits packages which are designed to be competitive. 
Performance related pay gives colleagues at all levels the 
opportunity to share in the success of the business, through 
quarterly or annual bonus payments linked to the achievement 
of individual and business plan targets.
Political donations
The Company does not support any political party and does 
not make what are commonly regarded as donations to any 
political party or other political organisations. However, the 
definition of “donations” in the Political Parties Elections and 
Referendums Act 2000 covers a number of activities which 
form part of the necessary relationship between the Company 
and stakeholders. This includes promoting the Company’s 
activities at the main political parties’ annual conferences.
As part of its stakeholder engagement programme the 
Group incurred expenditure of £4,923 (2015/16: £1,700) 
on such activities.

The Company’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are described in the Strategic Report. The financial 
position of the Company is described on pages 41 to 50  
and its borrowing facilities are described on page 43 In 
addition, pages 41 to 50 include details of the Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
Yorkshire Water has available a combination of cash and 
committed undrawn bank facilities totalling £1,015.1m at 
31 March 2017 (2015/16: £807.7m). The Directors have 
considered the 5 year business plan and the cash position of 
the Company, specifically the sufficiency of the funds available 
to fund the operating and capital investment activities of 
the Company for the 12 months from the date of signing 
the financial statements. In addition, the Company has an 
indefinite licence to operate as a water and sewerage operator 
terminable with a 25-year notice period. As a consequence 
the Directors’ believe that the Company is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence over a period of at least twelve months from  
the date of approval of the financial statements. For this 
reason, they continue to consider it appropriate to adopt  
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing  
the Financial Statements.
Directors’ statement
As required by the Code, the Directors confirm that they 
consider the Annual Report and financial statements, taken 
as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders and other 
stakeholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. When arriving at this position the Board 
was assisted by a number of processes including the following:
•  The Annual Report and Financial Statements is drafted 
by senior management with overall co-ordination by the 
Director of Finance, Regulation and Markets to ensure 
consistency across the relevant sections.

factual accuracy.
•  Comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements are undertaken by the executive 
directors and senior management.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Statement 
of Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland” (FRS 102), and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, 
the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently.
•  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 102, have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent.
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to  
ensure that the financial statements comply with the  
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the ultimate parent company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors’ Report was approved by a duly authorised 
committee of the Board of directors on 13 July 2017 and signed

Our audit approach
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and 
effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. 
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address 
these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make 
on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Infrastructure asset revaluation. 
Index linked swaps. 
Bad debt provision.
Exceptional items.
Overview 
Overall materiality: £20.5 million which 
represents 3.5% of earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(EBITDA) before exceptional items.
The Company is structured into three 
main divisions (asset management, service 
delivery and support services), Auditscope 
is a single reporting unit for the purposes 
of the financial statements. This was 
subject to an audit of its complete financial 
information to obtain sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence as a basis for our opinion.

scope
Area of 
focus
Materiality
Page 110
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors Report’ – Statutory Financial Statements Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Infrastructure asset revaluation
The Company performed an assessment of the 
carrying value of infrastructure assets as at 31 
March 2017 in line with the requirements of 
FRS 102, using an external expert. The valuation 
was performed by using forecast cash flows to 
calculate a value-in-use basis of the assets. We 
focused on this area due to the significance of 
the infrastructure asset balance because the 
determination of appropriate assumptions within 
the valuation model such as discount rate requires 
management judgement.
• We obtained management’s valuation model and assessed its 
appropriateness in accordance with FRS 102. We used our specialist 
knowledge to evaluate the methodology and the assumptions and inputs 
used by management. 
• We performed sensitivity analysis over the principal assumptions in the 
revaluation including the discount rate and long term growth rate. 
• We considered the multiple of net valuation versus Regulatory 
Capital Value, a common metric used in the industry as a proxy for 
the transactional value of companies. We determined this ratio to be 
appropriate and supported by evidence from recent market transactions.
We found no issues with the assumptions used and concluded that there 
was sufficient evidence to support the valuation methodology 
adopted and the final outcome.
Index-linked swaps
The Company holds index-linked swaps which 
had a nominal value of £1,289 million at 31 March 
2017. The swaps have a carrying value of £2,157 
million (2016: £1,734 million) on the balance 
sheet at 31 March 2017. We focused on this area 
because of the magnitude of the balance and the 
complexity required in determining the 
mark-to-market valuations and credit risk 
adjustments related to the instruments.
• We obtained management’s index-linked swaps valuation model 
and assessed the reasonableness of the methodology and 
limitations of the model. 
• For a sample of swaps, we re-performed the valuation, using independent 
market data inputs and an independent valuation model, noting no issues. 
• We agreed the trade input data back to the original trade term sheets. 
We found no issues with the valuation model and the assumptions 
used and concluded that the valuation of swaps was appropriate.
Bad debt provision
The bad debt provision is based on a detailed 
calculation that applies a percentage provision to 
individual aged debt categories. Given the large 
number of individual customer accounts, there 
is an ongoing risk of debt being more difficult to 
collect than anticipated. The determination by 
management of the appropriate level of provision 
is therefore open to judgement.
• We evaluated the appropriateness of the bad debt provision through an 
assessment of historical debt performance and recalculated the provision 
with reference to the Company’s stated accounting policy. We found 
that the provision was supported by the historical evidence and obtained 
appropriate explanations for significant movements year on year.  
• We also tested the validity of the ageing of customer debt to which 
the bad debt provision rates were applied. 
• We assessed the post year end collection performance of the Company 
against the level of provision. 
• We were satisfied with the evidence obtained.
Exceptional items
The Company incurred a number of exceptional 
costs, offset by subsequent insurance income 
following significant flooding during the extreme 
weather in the region in December 2015 and 
January 2016. The total exceptional income 
of £35.1 million comprises £46.0m insurance 
income received in the year, £17.9m of ongoing 
operational costs directly attributable to the 
flooding and a £3.4m adjustment to reduce the 
original asset impairment charge in prior year. 
We focused on this balance because of both 
its magnitude and the degree of estimation 
required due to the ongoing nature of the 
impact assessment and insurance recoveries.
• We evaluated the insurance income and tested the balance was 
received in the period.
• We tested a sample of costs and confirmed that the costs related to 
the period under review and arose as a direct result of the flooding. 
We assessed the clarity of the disclosure surrounding adjusting items in 
addition to the balance.
We were satisfied with the evidence obtained.
Page 111
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors Report’ – Statutory Financial Statements How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account 
the geographic structure of the company, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
company operates. 
The Company is structured into three main divisions 
(asset management, service delivery and support services), 
but is a single reporting unit for the purposes of the 
financial statements.
In establishing the overall approach to our audit, we 
assessed the risk of material misstatement, taking into 
account the nature, likelihood and potential magnitude of 
any misstatement. Following this assessment, we applied 
professional judgement to determine the extent of testing 
required over each balance in the financial statements.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall 
materiality
£20.5 million 
(2016: £19.7 million).
How we 
determined it
3.5% of earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA)  
before exceptional items.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
EBITDA is the primary measure of 
performance used by the ultimate 
owners of the company.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £1.0 million (2016: £1.0 
million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
The Directors have chosen to voluntarily report how they have 
applied the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) as 
if the company were a premium listed company. Under ISAs 
(UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation 
to the Directors’ statement about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern 
basis presumes that the company has adequate resources to 
remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, 
for at least one year from the date the financial statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance 
with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements;
•  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding 
of the company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified 
any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report. We have nothing to report in this respect.

inconsistent with our knowledge of the company acquired in 
the course of performing our audit.

performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add or 
to draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add or 
to draw attention to.
• the Directors’ explanation on pages 48 to 50 of the Annual Report,

statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any

consistency of that information with the financial statements. 
In our opinion the information given in the Corporate

respect to internal control and risk management systems and 
about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements.

Responsibilities for the financial  
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 109, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements  
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by; and 
•  the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 
we consider whether those reports include the disclosures 
required by applicable legal requirements.

Statements 
For the year ended 31 March 2017
1. Accounting policies
Yorkshire Water Services Limited (“Yorkshire Water” or the 
“Company”) is a company limited by shares and incorporated 
and domiciled in the UK. Registered address: Yorkshire Water 
Services Limited, Western House, Halifax Road, Bradford, 
BD6 2SZ.
Basis of preparation
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company prepared 
its financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable 
in the UK and Republic of Ireland (“FRS 102”) and the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Company is exempt by virtue of s400 of the Companies 
Act 2006 from the requirement to prepare group financial 
statements. These financial statements present information 
about the Company as an individual undertaking and not 
about its group.
The presentation currency of these financial statements  
is sterling. 
Kelda Eurobond Co Limited includes the Company in its 
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial 
statements of Kelda Eurobond Co Limited are prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU and are available to the public and may 
be obtained from Western House, Halifax Road, Bradford, 
West Yorkshire, BD6 2SZ. In these financial statements, the 
Company is considered to be a qualifying entity (for the 
purposes of this FRS) and has applied the exemptions available 
under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures: 
•  reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding  
from the beginning to end of the period; 
•  cash flow statement and related notes; 
•  key management personnel compensation; and 
•  transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries, 
or with their parent.
As the consolidated financial statements of Kelda Eurobond 
Co Limited include the equivalent disclosures, the Company 
has also taken certain exemptions under FRS 102 available 
in respect of the disclosures required by FRS 102.11 Basic 
Financial Instruments and FRS 102.12 Other Financial 
Instrument Issues.
The accounting policies set out on the following pages have, 
unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these financial statements. 
The preparation of these financial statements requires the 
use of certain critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation and uncertainty. Judgements made by the 
directors, in the application of these accounting policies 
that have significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the 
next year are discussed in note 26.
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost 
basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated 
at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial 
instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss 
and certain categories of tangible fixed assets measured in 
accordance with the revaluation model.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the 
Company’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance 
sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value 
are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange 
rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the profit and loss account.

(continued) 
Basic financial instruments
Trade and other debtors 
Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at transaction 
price less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses. If the 
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for example 
if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms, then it is 
measured at the present value of future payments discounted 
at a market rate of instrument for a similar debt instrument.
Trade and other creditors 
Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at transaction 
price plus attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. If the arrangement constitutes a 
financing transaction, for example if payment is deferred 
beyond normal business terms, then it is measured at the 
present value of future payments discounted at a market 
rate of instrument for a similar debt instrument.
Interest-bearing borrowings classified as basic 
financial instruments
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment losses.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and  
call deposits. 
Other financial instruments
Financial instruments not considered to be basic 
financial instruments (Other financial instruments)
Other financial instruments not meeting the definition of 
basic financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition other financial instruments 
are measured at fair value with changes recognised in profit  
or loss except as follows:
• investments in equity instruments that are not publicly 
traded and whose fair value cannot otherwise be measured 
reliably shall be measured at cost less impairment; and 
• hedging instruments in a designated hedging relationship 
shall be recognised as set out below.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. 
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives 
qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant  
gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged  
(see below).
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a 
hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in 
the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately 
in profit or loss. The carrying value of the hedged item is 
adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to 
the risk being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost or 
amortised cost) and any gains or losses on remeasurement  
are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account 
(even if those gains would normally be recognised directly  
in reserves).
If hedge accounting is discontinued and the hedged financial 
asset or liability has not been derecognised, any adjustments 
to the carrying amount of the hedged item are amortised 
into profit or loss using the effective interest method over the 
remaining life of the hedged item.
The Company applies fair value hedge accounting to its cross 
currency interest rate swaps and associated bonds  
and its fixed to floating interest rate swaps and  
associated bonds.
Cash flow hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a 
hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probably forecast transaction, the effective 
part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument 
is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Page 119
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 1. Accounting policies 
(continued) 
For cash flow hedges, where the forecast transactions 
resulted in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-
financial liability, the hedging gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is included in the initial cost or other 
carrying amount of the asset or liability. Alternatively when 
the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss the hedging 
gain or loss is reclassified to profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or the entity discontinues designation of the 
hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the 
above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative 
unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in 
the profit and loss account immediately. 
Energy price swaps, which hedge the Company’s exposure 
to energy price risk by exchanging the day ahead index price 
of energy for a fixed price, are designated as cashflow 
hedges and hedge accounting has been applied.
Tangible fixed assets
Infrastructure assets are valued using a policy of revaluation. 
Residential properties, non-specialised properties and rural 
estates held within land and buildings are held at valuation. 
Other tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items of tangible fixed assets.
Leases in which the Company assumes substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are 
classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance 
lease are stated on initial recognition at an amount equal 
to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, including 
any incremental costs directly attributable to negotiating 
and arranging the lease. At initial recognition a finance lease 
liability is recognised equal to the fair value of the leased 
asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. The present value of the minimum lease payments 
is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Lease 
payments are accounted for as described on page 122.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether an 
indicator of impairment exists, if such an indicator exists 
then an impairment test is performed.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account on 
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
part of an item of tangible fixed assets. Leased assets are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their 
useful lives. Land is not depreciated. Assets in the course 
of construction are not depreciated until commissioned. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
:
Land and buildings
Buildings 25 - 100 years
Residential properties,  
non-specialised properties (revalued)
60 years
Rural estates (land) (revalued) Not depreciated
Plant and equipment
Fixed plant 5 - 40 years
Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 - 10 years
Infrastructure assets
Infrastructure assets - water mains  
and sewers (revalued)
40 - 125 years
Infrastructure assets - earth banked 
dams and reservoirs (revalued)
200 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed if there is an indication of a significant change 
since last annual reporting date in the pattern by which 
the company expects to consume an asset’s future 
economic benefits. 
Revaluation
Infrastructure assets, residential properties, non-specialised 
properties and rural estates are stated at fair value less any 
subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Any increase in the carrying value of fixed assets arising as 
a result of a revaluation is recognised by first reversing any 
accumulated depreciation relating to the associated assets. 
Any remaining increase in carrying value after depreciation has 
been reversed is recognised as an increase in the cost of the 
associated assets.
FRS 102 requires assets to be valued by independent valuers 
on a periodic basis, which is adopted by the Company. An 
interim valuation is booked in the intervening years if there has 
been a material change. The last valuation of infrastructure 
assets was carried out on 31 March 2017. The last valuation 
of residential properties, non-specialised properties and rural 
estates held within land and buildings was carried out on 31 
March 2014. The valuation of land and buildings carried out 
at 31 March 2014 has been considered at 31 March 2017 by 
the directors, who concluded that current book values are not 
materially different to current fair values.
Page 120
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 1. Accounting policies 
(continued) 
The fair value of infrastructure assets was measured using a 
two step approach. Firstly the Company measured the value in 
use, using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash 
flow incorporates the future growth rates and an assumed 
discount rate. The business value in use less relevant working 
capital balances was then allocated to individual classes of 
fixed assets. This value in use method is considered the most 
reliable method to determine the current value for the tangible 
fixed assets. The fair value of certain categories of land and 
buildings was measured on the basis of existing use. 
Gains on revaluation are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the revaluation reserve. However, 
the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that 
it reverses a revaluation decrease previously recognised in the 
profit and loss account.
Losses arising on revaluation are recognised in other 
comprehensive income to the extent of any previously 
recognised revaluation increase accumulated in equity, in 
respect of that asset. Any excess is recognised in the profit 
and loss account.
Contributions
Capital contributions - The Company is permitted by the 
regulators to recover costs in relation to mains and sewer 
diversions, where requested by other counterparties. This is 
presented net within fixed assets, thus decreasing the cost of 
new components.
Intangible assets and goodwill 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to 
cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination from which it arose.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Software is amortised on a straight line basis over its 
useful life. The useful life of software is estimated to 
be five years.
Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful 
life. Goodwill has no residual value. The finite useful life of 
goodwill is estimated to be 19 years.
The company reviews the amortisation period and method 
when events and circumstances indicate that the useful life 
may have changed since the last reporting date. 
Intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment in 
accordance with FRS 102 Section 27 Impairment of assets 
when there is an indication that goodwill or an intangible 
asset may be impaired.
Government grants 
Government grants are included within accruals and 
deferred income in the balance sheet and credited to the 
profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the 
assets to which they relate or in periods in which the related 
costs are incurred.
Impairment excluding stocks and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including trade and other debtors)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss 
is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is 
impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the 
loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured 
at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between 
its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective 
interest rate. For financial instruments measured at cost less 
impairment an impairment is calculated as the difference 
between its carrying amount and the best estimate of the 
amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it 
were to be sold at the reporting date. Interest on the impaired 
asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding 
of the discount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit 
or loss. When a subsequent event causes the amount of 
impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment  
loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, 
other than stocks and deferred tax assets, are reviewed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then 
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable 
amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of 
its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually 
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of 
assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in 
a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing 
is allocated to cash-generating units, or (“CGU”) that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, if goodwill 
cannot be allocated to individual CGUs or groups of CGUs, the 
company tests the impairment of goodwill by determining the 
recoverable amount of the entity in its entirety, including the 
integrated acquired operations. 
Page 121
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 1. Accounting policies 
(continued) 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an 
asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment 
losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. 
An impairment loss is reversed if and only if the reasons  
for the impairment have ceased to apply. 
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans and other long-term 
employee benefits
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit 
plan under which the company pays fixed contributions 
into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account in 
the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Group defined benefit plan 
The Company’s employees are members of a group wide 
defined benefit pension plan. As there is no contractual 
agreement or stated group policy for charging the net 
defined benefit cost of the plan to participating entities, the 
net defined benefit cost of the pension plan is recognised 
fully by the sponsoring employer of the plan, which is Kelda 
Group Limited. The Company recognises a cost equal to its 
contribution payable for the period as an expense.
Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when 
the company is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or 
to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made 
to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for 
voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the 
company has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is 
probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of 
acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable 
more than 12 months after the reporting date, then they are 
discounted to their present value.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recognised 
at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee 
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies 
within its group, the company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, 
the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes probable that the 
company will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.
Revenue
Revenue comprises charges to customers for water, waste 
water and other services excluding value added tax and arises 
only in the United Kingdom. 
Revenue is recognised when the service has been provided 
to the customer. Revenue relates to charges due in the 
year, excluding any amounts paid in advance. Revenue for 
measured water charges includes amounts billed plus an 
estimation of the amounts unbilled at the year end. The 
accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon 
daily average water consumption, which is calculated based 
upon historical billing information.
No revenue is recognised for unoccupied properties and no 
bills are raised. If a bill has been issued, and the Company 
subsequently become aware that the property is unoccupied, 
the bill and relevant revenue is cancelled. Generally a property 
is classed as void if it is unoccupied and unfurnished.
Expenses
Operating lease 
Payments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made 
under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss 
account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease 
unless the payments to the lessor are structured to increase 
in line with expected general inflation; in which case the 
payments related to the structured increases are recognised as 
incurred. Lease incentives received are recognised in profit and 
loss over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total 
lease expense.
Finance lease
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the 
finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability 
using the rate implicit in the lease. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Contingent rents are charged as 
expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. 
Page 122
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 1. Accounting policies 
(continued) 
Interest payable and interest receivable 
Interest payable and similar charges include interest payable, 
movements in the fair value of financial instruments excluding 
those meeting hedging criteria, finance leases recognised 
in profit or loss using the effective interest method and 
net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the 
profit and loss account (see foreign currency accounting 
policy). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes 
a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as 
part of the cost of that asset.
Other interest receivable and similar income include interest 
receivable on funds invested, movements in the fair value of 
financial instruments excluding those meeting hedging criteria 
and net foreign exchange gains. 
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit 
or loss as they accrue, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the profit and loss account 
on the date the Company’s right to receive payments is 
established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported  
on a net basis.
Dividends payable
Final dividends payable are recognised on approval of the 
dividend. Interim dividends are recognised on payment  
of the dividend.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items which derive from events or 
transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the 
reporting entity and which individually or, if of a similar  
type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their  
size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a  
true and fair view.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly 
in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is 
recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the 
taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise 
from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments 
in periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements. The following timing differences 
are not provided for: differences between accumulated 
depreciation and tax allowances for the cost of a fixed asset 
if and when all conditions for retaining the tax allowances 
have been met. Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent 
differences arising because certain types of income or expense 
are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain 
tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the 
corresponding income or expense. 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected 
to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. For non-depreciable assets that are measured using the 
revaluation model, deferred tax is provided at the rates and 
allowances applicable to the sale of the asset/property, except 
when the asset has a limited useful life and the objective of 
the company’s business model is to consume substantially  
all of the value through use. In the latter case the tax rate  
that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related 
difference is used.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will 
be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or 
other future taxable profits.

Total exceptional fair value charges (521.1) (0.7)
Last year an exceptional charge of £26.5m was recognised as a result of the impact of severe flooding at certain operational sites 
of the Company during the year. This charge consists of an asset impairment of £35.0m, operating costs of £1.5m and insurance 
income of £10.0m. At 31 March 2017 an exceptional income of £31.5m was recognised. This consists of £46.0m in insurance 
income, £17.9m of operational costs and a £3.4m adjustment to reduce the original asset impairment charge.
The movement in the fair value of index-linked swaps is a result of swaps which were taken out by the Company during 
2007/08. These swaps hedge against movements in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) by receiving interest based on LIBOR and 
accruing interest payable based on RPI. The swaps have been valued at the reporting date at fair value, which at 31 March 2017 
resulted in a £2,156.5m liability (2015/16: £1,734.3m liability). Of this, £2,033.0m (2015/16: £1,579.5m) is recognised within other 
financial liabilities (note 18) and £123.5m (2015/16: £154.7m) is recognised within long-term borrowings (note 16). This financial 
year has seen the liability on the swaps increase by a further £453.5m.
The movement in the fair value of finance lease swaps is a result of floating to fixed interest rate swaps taken out by the 
Company to hedge against movements in 12 month LIBOR interest rates on floating rate finance leases. The swaps hedge 
the movement in interest rates by receiving interest based on 12 month LIBOR and accruing interest payable at a fixed rate. 
The swaps have been valued at the reporting date at fair value, which at 31 March 2017 resulted in a £25.2m liability (2015/16: 
£24.9m liability). The year on year increase of the liability of £0.3m (2015/16: £0.7m increase in liability) has been recognised as 
an exceptional finance cost. This has been included in the profit and loss account as the accounting rules which would allow 
it to be held in reserves were no longer met. The interest charged or credited to the profit and loss account in relation to these 
swaps is shown in note 8.
Exceptional fair value income includes the fair value movement of various combined cross currency interest rate swaps which 
were designated in fair value hedge relationships. The combined cross currency interest rate swaps have been valued at the 
reporting date at fair value. In line with FRS 102, the financial instruments to which the swaps relate have also been 
measured at fair value at 31 March 2017. The net impact of the fair value movement of the cross currency swaps and the 
associated bonds has resulted in a £4.1m income (2015/16: £3.7m charge) to the profit and loss account.
Exceptional fair value income includes the fair value movement of various fixed to floating interest rate swaps which were 
designated in fair value hedge relationships. These fair value interest rate swaps have been valued at the reporting date  
at fair value. In line with FRS102, the financial instruments to which the swaps relate have also been measured at fair  
value at 31 March 2017. The net impact of the fair value movement of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps and  
the associated bonds has resulted in a £16.9m charge (2015/16: £8.0m income) to the profit and loss account.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 9. Taxation (continued) 
Non deductible expenses – expenditure and costs that are incurred by the Company but are not deductible for tax 
purposes. For Yorkshire Water, this mainly relates to non-deductible depreciation on capital assets that do not qualify for 
capital allowances.
Income not taxable for tax purposes – income reflected in the accounts which is not subject to tax as either there is no cash 
received by the Company or the income has reduced the amount of capital allowances that can be claimed on the assets 
associated with the income.
Group relief received for no charge – during the period, Yorkshire Water has claimed tax losses from other Kelda Group 
companies. Yorkshire Water did not make a payment for those tax losses.
Income from capital disposal not subject to tax – proceeds from property disposals that are not subject to tax either due 
to the offset of capital losses, indexation that is allowed for tax purposes or the properties have been transferred to other 
Kelda Group companies and will be subject to tax when disposed from the Group.
Effect of future tax rate changes on deferred tax balances – lower future enacted corporation tax rates will reduce the 
amount of deferred tax that must be provided for. The tax timing differences on which deferred tax is provided will be 
expected to reverse at the lower corporation tax rate.
The corporation tax rate of 20%, enacted in the Finance Act 2013 and applicable from 1 April 2015, has been used in 
preparing these financial statements. 
The Finance (No 2) Act 2015 will reduce the corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and the Finance Act 2016 will 
reduce the rate further to 17% from 1 April 2020. These reductions to the corporation tax rate were substantively enacted 
on 25 October 2015 and 6 September 2016 respectively and accordingly the deferred tax liability at 31 March 2017 has 
been calculated using these rates.

corporate costs. Of the £139.1m dividend paid in the year (2015/16: £90.9m), £69.3m (2015/16: £70.7m) was used to 
make inter-company interest payments to the Company and £24.4m (2015/16: £20.2m) was used to pay head office 
costs and interest on debt issued by Kelda Finance (No.2) Limited and Kelda Finance (No.3) PLC. The remaining 
£45.4m (2015/16: £nil) dividend was paid to the ultimate shareholders. No final dividend for the year has been proposed.

Revaluation
The Company’s infrastructure assets were valued at 
31 March 2017. These valuations were performed in 
accordance with FRS 102 which requires that assets subject 
to a policy of revaluation should be carried at their fair 
value less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
FRS 102 allows, where market based evidence of fair value 
is not available due to the specialised nature of the items 
of property plant and equipment, an entity to estimate fair 
value using an income approach. Having considered the 
requirement of FRS 102, management concluded that the 
most reliable valuation method to determine the current 
value for the tangible fixed assets of a UK water company  
is a two-step approach:
• Estimating the business value in use (‘VIU’), using a 
discounted cash flow (‘DCF’) model excluding out 
performance against Ofwat’s targets to determine 
the business enterprise value. Excluding forecast 
outperformance against the regulatory allowance is a 
proxy for excluding any goodwill that a purchaser would 
pay for the business. The enterprise value was then  
cross-checked against the Regulatory Capital Value 
(‘RCV’); and
• Allocating the VIU of the business (less relevant working 
capital balances) to individual classes of tangible  
fixed assets.
The increase in valuation has been incorporated into 
the financial statements and the resulting revaluation 
adjustments taken to the revaluation reserve. A revaluation 
of £280m, before deferred tax and adjustment for 
historical depreciation, was recognised in the year ended 
31 March 2017. 
Certain categories of the Company’s land and buildings  
are also held at valuation, on the basis of existing use,  
and were valued by independent qualified valuers  
in March 2014. 
The valuations were undertaken in accordance with the 
Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors in the UK by the following surveyors: 
Non-specialist properties DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Ltd
Rural estates Carter Jones LLP
Residential properties Savills (L&P) Ltd
These external valuations will be re-performed on a 
periodic basis. An interim valuation is booked in intervening 
years based on directors’ valuations. The valuations carried 
out at 31 March 2014 have been considered at 31 March 
2017 by the directors, who concluded that current book 
values are not materially different to current market values.

Yorkshire Water raises debt as part of the Yorkshire Water Financing Group. Debt covenants covering the Yorkshire Water 
Financing Group include the consolidated external debt of this group of companies. When calculating the consolidated debt 
position it should be noted that the book value recorded in these financial statements on the internal loan relating to the 
exchanged bonds is higher than the book value recorded in Yorkshire Water Services Odsal Finance Limited financial 
statements by £28.2m (2015/16: £31.0m), which account for the exchanged bonds in line with FRS 101. 
Net debt includes unamortised issue costs of £13.7m (2015/16: £14.1m).
Borrowings repayable in instalments after more than five years include £77.0m (2015/16: £81.3m) in respect of finance leases 
which have expiry dates ranging from 2032 to 2043 and carry interest rates based on 12 month LIBOR and 6 month LIBOR. 
The finance lease creditors are secured on the underlying assets.   
As at 31 March 2017 Yorkshire Water had access to undrawn committed bank facilities totalling £784.76m (2015/16: 
£783.75m), £319.76m of which expire in March 2018 and £465.0m expire in October 2018.

Managing financial risk
Yorkshire Water’s operations expose the company to a variety of financial risks that include, amongst other things, 
inflation risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. 
In relation to inflation risk, Yorkshire Water’s revenue is linked to the underlying rate of inflation measured by the 
Retail Price Index (RPI) and therefore is subject to fluctuations in line with changes in RPI. In addition, Yorkshire Water’s 
regulatory capital value (RCV), which is one of the critical components for setting customer’s bills, is also linked to RPI. 
Yorkshire Water raises funds by issuing debt to third parties. These funds are used by the company to finance its activities 
(including funding the company’s long-term capital investment programme). As the percentage of the company’s net  
debt to RCV is a key covenanted ratio within Yorkshire Water’s financing arrangements with its lenders, negative  
inflation, without appropriate management, could potentially breach such net debt to RCV ratios despite the  
company being profitable.
Interest rate swaps
Yorkshire Water holds £45.0m notional value (2015/16: £45.0m) of floating to fixed interest rate swaps. These swaps are 
recognised at a fair value liability of £25.3m at 31 March 2017 (2015/16: £24.9m). Hedge accounting has not been applied.
Yorkshire Water holds £430.0m notional value (2015/16: £430.0m) of fixed to floating interest rate swaps. These swaps are 
recognised at a fair value asset of £61.5m at 31 March 2017 (2015/16: £48.5m asset). Hedge accounting has been applied.
Cross currency interest rate swaps
Yorkshire Water hedges the fair value of certain US dollar notes using a series of combined interest rate and foreign currency 
swaps that in combination form cross currency interest rate swaps, swapping dollar principal repayments into sterling and 
fixed rate dollar interest payments into floating rate sterling interest payments. These swaps are recognised at a fair value 
asset of £79.8m at 31 March 2017 (2015/16: £42.3m asset). Hedge accounting has been applied.
Yorkshire Water hedges the fair value of the Australian dollar bond using a combined interest rate and foreign 
currency swap that in combination forms a cross currency interest rate swap, swapping Australian dollar principal 
repayments into sterling and fixed rate Australian dollar interest payments into floating rate sterling interest payments. 
These swaps are recognised at a fair value liability of £1.4m at 31 March 2017 (2015/16: £5.5m liability). 
Hedge accounting has been applied.
Page 137
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements Index linked swaps
The Company holds a number of index-linked swaps, with a notional value of £1,289.0m:
There are three cashflows associated with the swaps:
• six monthly interest receivable linked to LIBOR;
• six monthly interest payable linked to RPI; and
• an RPI-linked bullet that is payable on maturity of the instruments or at certain predetermined dates over 
the duration of the swaps.
Interest payments and receipts are accrued in the profit and loss account. The RPI bullet accumulated at the balance sheet date 
has been discounted using an appropriate rate applied to the specific life of the future accretion paydowns of the index-linked 
swaps. This is accrued in the profit and loss account and recognised within long-term borrowings.
With six month LIBOR and applicable discount rates at historically low levels in the short-term, Yorkshire Water’s portfolio 
of index-linked swaps gave rise to a fair value liability of £2,156.5m (2015/16: £1,734.3m liability) at the year end date. 
Of this amount £123.5m (2015/16: £154.7m) has been recognised within long-term borrowings, and represents the 
discounted value of the RPI bullet accrued to 31 March 2017. The remaining £2,033.0m is recognised within other 
financial liabilities. 
The valuation model used by Yorkshire Water to determine the fair value of the inflation linked swap portfolio as at 31 March 
2017 includes a funding valuation adjustment, credit valuation adjustment and debit valuation adjustment to reflect the long-
term credit risk of Yorkshire Water’s index-linked swap portfolio. The mark to market value of the index linked swaps 
excluding these adjustments is £2,696.9m (2015/16: £2,390.7m).
The RPI bullet accrued to 31 March 2017 was £200.6m (2015/16: £237.1m) which has been reduced by £77.1m (2015/16: 
£82.4m) when discounted to present values.

Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 20. Employee benefits
The Company’s employees are members of a group wide defined benefit pension plan. As there is no contractual 
agreement or stated group policy for charging the net defined benefit costs of the plan to participating entities, the net 
defined benefit cost of the pension plan is recognised fully by the sponsoring employer of the plan, which is Kelda Group 
Limited. The Company recognises a cost equal to its contribution payable for the period as an expense.
The disclosures below provide information about the group plan as a whole. 
Contributions during the year ended 31 March 2017 were paid by members at 5%, 6%, 7% or 8.5% of pensionable 
pay (depending on benefit category). The majority of members pay contributions through a salary sacrifice arrangement. 
The group contributed 17.0% of pensionable pay. The group also paid lump sum deficit contributions of £1.1m per 
month in the year to 31 March 2017.

26. Accounting estimates and judgements
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The directors consider the principal areas of judgement in the financial statements to be:
•  Fair value of financial instruments 
The Company’s accounting policy for financial instruments is detailed on page XX. In accordance with FRS 102, financial 
instruments are recognised in the financial statements at fair value. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded 
on an active market is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique. Management uses its judgement to make 
assumptions relating to future cash flows, mainly based on forward interest rates from observable yield curves at the end of 
the reporting period, counter-party funding adjustments and contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reflects own 
or counter-party credit risk. The fair value of financial instruments would be £33.8m higher or lower were the counter-party 
funding assumption to change by 10 basis points. The fair value of financial instruments would be £35.2m higher or lower 
were the credit curve assumption to change by 10 basis points.
•   Property, plant and equipment 
The Company’s accounting policy for property, plant and equipment (’PPE’) is detailed in note 1 of the financial statements. 
Estimated useful economic lives of PPE are based on management’s judgement and experience. When management identifies 
that actual useful lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively. 
Due to the significance of capital investment to the Company, variations between actual and estimated useful lives could 
impact operating results both positively and negatively. Historically, only minor changes to estimated useful lives have  
been required.  
Certain categories of PPE are held at valuation based on value in use. Value in use is determined using a discounted cashflow 
model which requires management to make subjective judgements concerning the cash flows, growth rates and discount rates 
of the cash generating units under review.  
The Company is required to evaluate the carrying value of PPE for impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in 
management’s judgement, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. 
•  Impairment of certain items of property, plant and equipment  
Last year, certain operational sites of the Company were affected by severe flooding. As at 31 March 2016, the full extent 
and value of impacted assets was uncertain and management therefore used its judgement to estimate the value of impaired 
assets. An impairment of £35.0m was recognised. Since then the value of assets impacted has been established, and the value 
of the impairment has reduced by £3.4m which has been recognised this year.
•  Provision for doubtful debts 
At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records provisions for impairment 
of receivables based on experience including, for example, comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of 
actual write-off history. The actual level of debt collected may differ for the estimated levels of recovery, which could impact 
operating results positively or negatively. As at 31 March 2017 current trade receivables were £132.5m (2015/16: £116.7m), 
before provision for impairments.
•  Taxation 
Amounts recognised in respect of corporation tax reflects management’s estimation of the amount of tax payable for fiscal 
years with open tax computations where liabilities remain to be agreed by HMRC.
Page 142
Introductions – Strategic Report – Governance – Independent Auditors’ Report – Statutory Financial Statements 27 . Infrastructure renewals expenditure 
Infrastructure renewals expenditure as defined by Ofwat is the actual expenditure incurred in the financial year in 
maintaining the operating capability of infrastructure assets through renewal or renovation of those assets. Total 
infrastructure renewals expenditure for 2017 was £100.3m (2016: £80.5m). Of this amount £81.5m (2016: £62.1m)  
relates to expenditure that was capital in nature and charged to the balance sheet and £18.8m (2016: £18.4m) relates  
to expenditure that was operational in nature and expensed to the profit and loss account.
28. Contingent liabilities
On 20 July 2015 an employee of the Company suffered a fatal accident while carrying out his duties. This is currently subject 
to a Health and Safety Executive investigation. The duration, timing and outcome of this investigation is currently unknown. 
Should the Company be found liable as a result of these investigations (which has not been indicated) it is possible it will be 
subject to fines, the size and timing of which are unknown due to the early stages of the investigation.
Yorkshire Water has received a letter of claim on behalf of personal search companies (PSC) relating to a claim for historical 
fees that they have paid to Yorkshire Water for water and drainages reports obtained when buying a house. The PSCs state 
that the historical fees should not have been paid to Yorkshire Water as the information should have provided for no fee. 
At this early stage it is not known if Yorkshire Water would be liable for these claims, the total value to which they could 
amount, or the timing of any cash outflow.
