JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Chairman’s statement
This is the last year that I shall 
be writing this statement as 
Chairman and therefore I am 
particularly pleased to be able 
to report that James Fisher 
and Sons plc (James Fisher) 
had another good year in 2017 
producing an underlying profit 
before tax of £50.3m, an increase 
of 10% over the prior year.  This 
reflected the strength of the 
Group’s business model with its 
broad spread of activities across 
the marine sector, its strong 
international presence and its 
ability to innovate and grow new 
businesses.
Three of our four divisions improved their 
results with Marine Support leading the 
way with a 17% improvement in profits 
generated by new markets in Brazil, the 
Middle East and offshore renewables. 
Specialist Technical delivered another 
strong performance making good progress 
with the delivery of its project pipeline and 
the Indian submarine rescue contract in 
particular. Tankships continued its run of 
profit increases generated by high vessel 
utilisation levels and careful attention to 
costs. Offshore Oil managed a result only 
marginally below the prior year: demand 
began to firm in some sectors towards year 
end while the division was also successful 
in opening new opportunities in the Middle 
East, Asia and in subsea decommissioning.
Group revenue for the year grew by 9% to 
£505.4m (2016: £466.0m). An increase in 
the Group’s underlying effective tax rate 
to 17.2%, (2016: 15.4%), held back the 
increase in underlying diluted earnings 
per share to 7% at 81.4 pence per share. 
Statutory diluted earnings per share were 
79.5 pence (2016: 78.7 pence).
With a number of major projects 
underway, careful attention has been paid 
to managing cash flow this year in the 
face of the expected increase in working 
capital. This build-up squeezed our cash 
conversion rate to 56% in 2017 and 
despite this, the year-end balance sheet 
gearing remained at a conservative 47% 
(2016: 41%) with the ratio of net debt 
(excluding bonds) to underlying earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation at 1.6 times (2016: 1.4 times).
The underlying strength of the Group’s 
performance and the positive outlook 
for the year ahead has led the Board to 
propose an increase in the final dividend to 
19.3 pence (2016: 17.6 pence) per share 
making a total for the year of 28.7 pence 
per share, an increase of 10% compared 
with 2016.
Strategic overview
Over the last ten years, with the exception 
of 2015, James Fisher has increased its 
profit and dividends every year, normally 
by more than 10%: this despite external 
events such as the financial crisis of 
2007-8, the fall in oil prices in 2014 
and most recently, Brexit. Key to this 
performance has been the Group’s ability 
to innovate and to build new businesses. 
The rapid growth of our ship-to-ship 
(STS) transfer business from 2007; the 
development of a market-leading position 
in submarine rescue and hyperbaric 
engineering since 2012 and more recently, 
the growth of a completely new activity 
in offshore renewables have enabled the 
Group to absorb these external shocks and 
continue to grow. This growth in turn has 
built an ever wider international presence, 
so that the Group is not dependent on 
any one geographical market. With a 
stable management team in place and a 
continued commitment to a decentralised 
management structure which keeps 
decision-making close to our customers 
and markets, this track record of change 
and innovation is set to continue.
All four of our divisions are well placed for 
the future. Marine Support is benefiting 
from the opening of new markets for STS, 
such as in Brazil, from the development 
of its subsea project businesses, and 
from its expanding presence in offshore 
renewables. Specialist Technical has 
market-leading positions in both its 
hyperbaric and submarine rescue niches 
and in its reactor decommissioning 
business in the nuclear sector.  While this 
division will always be project driven and 
therefore ‘lumpier’ in terms of turnover 
and working capital, it has an attractive 
pipeline of medium-term prospects. 
Tankships continues to perform well in a 
relatively stable market: this position will be 
underpinned by the introduction of more 
modern tonnage on some routes. Offshore 
Oil is now positioned for recovery: our 
businesses and management teams have 
done well both in terms of reducing their

costs and in opening new markets for their 
services in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
The strength of our balance sheet 
enables us to invest in development 
projects alongside a full capital investment 
programme. With the focus mainly on 
organic growth, we nevertheless remain 
alert for acquisition opportunities to help 
speed the development of our businesses. 
The purchase of Rotos 360 Limited in 
March 2017 for an initial consideration 
of £1.5m and EDS HV Group Limited in 
December 2017 for £9.0m have further 
extended our range of market-leading 
services to the offshore renewables sector.
The Board
After fourteen years on the Board and 
nearly six as Chairman, I announced 
in January that I will stand down at the 
conclusion of this year’s Annual General 
Meeting (AGM). It has been a privilege to 
have been part of James Fisher during 
an exciting period in the history of the 
Company.  The Group’s success is 
generated by the hard work and dedication 
of staff and management throughout the 
Group and it has been a great pleasure 
to meet and work with so many of them 
during my time with James Fisher.
The Board has chosen Malcolm Paul to 
become Chairman at the conclusion of the 
AGM. Malcolm has extensive experience in 
managing decentralised and international 
companies similar to James Fisher and 
has been an Independent Non-Executive 
Director since 2011. He has a deep 
knowledge of the Company having chaired 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
as well as being the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. He will bring the 
right balance of continuity and change to 
this role going forward.
Effective 1 February, I was also pleased 
to announce that Justin Atkinson had 
agreed to join the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. He will succeed 
Malcolm as chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Justin was until recently the 
CEO of the Keller Group plc, a FTSE 250 
business in the international construction 
sector. He will bring experience of 
successfully managing a group on a similar 
growth path to James Fisher.
With the development of James Fisher in 
recent years and the increasing spread of 
its international operations, the Board has 
been giving careful thought as to when it 
would be appropriate to strengthen the 
central executive team. In January 2017, 
Fergus Graham joined the Group having 
worked previously at De La Rue plc and 
other international companies in both 
operations and cross-border business 
development. He has played a senior role 
in our Marine Support division during the 
past year. The Board has now agreed to 
appoint Fergus as an Executive Director 
with effect from 1 March 2018. He will take 
responsibility for all of the Marine Support 
division which generated 47% of the 
Group’s turnover in 2017.  This will free up 
more time for Nick Henry as CEO to lead 
the Group’s further development.
Staff
The continued growth and success of the 
Group owes everything to the dedication 
of our staff who now work in many different 
countries across the globe. Some have 
to work in very challenging environments 
and all have to show a high level of 
professionalism worthy of the confidence 
our customers place in us. On behalf of the 
Board and from me especially in my final 
year, I would like to thank all our employees 
for their hard work and commitment shown 
to the James Fisher Group.
Outlook
Our Marine Support division has 
commenced the year with good prospects 
in its offshore renewables and marine 
project activities, as well as firm demand 
in the STS transfer business. Specialist 
Technical continues to work through its 
strong order book and has a good pipeline 
of active prospects. The timing of the 
award of these new projects will determine 
whether this division is able to deliver a 
further step up in profits in 2018. Tankships 
continues to operate well in a stable 
market. Sentiment amongst our Offshore 
Oil division’s customers has turned more 
positive in recent weeks and, while it is 
still too early to assess any general trend, 
this has begun to be reflected in orders 
received for repair and maintenance work 
in particular.  We therefore have a positive 
view of the year ahead and are confident 
of the Group’s potential to provide further 
growth and value for our shareholders in 
the future.

COBRA – JFD’s new diver breathing system 
JFD has successfully completed its first deep-water commercial dive project with 
its new diver breathing system COBRA (Compact Bailout Rebreathing Apparatus), 
a sophisticated system that was designed and developed to provide divers 
with an emergency supply of breathing gas in the event of a primary failure. The 
COBRA system provides divers with 20 minutes of air at a depth of 270 metres or 
45 minutes of emergency life support at a depth of 120 metres. This is compared 
to current alternative systems, which can only provide 3 minutes of air at 270 
metres, and 7 minutes at 120 metres. The extended operation time significantly 
improves the likelihood of a successful rescue in the event of an emergency. 4
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Chief Executive’s review
Nick Henry, Chief Executive Officer
Group strategy 
The Group’s strategy is to grow its 
business organically by leveraging 
its existing marine skill base in 
specialist expertise to a global market, 
supplemented by selective bolt-
on acquisitions which broaden the 
Group’s range of services, products or 
geographical coverage. Our strategic 
aim is to deliver long-term growth in 
earnings per share and consistently 
to increase shareholder value. Our 
businesses target an operating margin 
of at least 10%, a pre-tax return on 
capital employed of at least 15% and 
are expected to be cash-generative via 
careful management of working capital 
and investments. 
Whilst the Group prioritises organic 
growth, our strategy is to supplement it 
with value-enhancing acquisitions which 
fit into our existing divisions. James 
Fisher seeks to acquire businesses that 
have a niche product or service offering, 
with growth potential, a track record of 
profitability, cash generation and strong 
management. 
Business model
The Group’s businesses provide a range 
of marine services to large corporations 
and government bodies through its four 
divisions: Marine Support, Specialist 
Technical, Offshore Oil and Tankships. 
James Fisher’s businesses are 
entrepreneurially-led with a decentralised 
management structure which 
encourages managers to be responsible 
for making timely decisions in response 
to changes in the market and in the 
competitive environment. Many of the 
Group’s businesses operate in specialist 
niches and hold market-leading 
positions in their particular sector. Their 
growth is focused on the less mature 
markets around the world with 50% 
(2016: 51%) of the Group’s revenue 
derived from customers in the Middle 
East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are 
used to measure the success of the 
business model. These include revenue 
growth, operating margin (the ratio of 
underlying operating profit to revenue), 
return on capital employed and cash 
conversion. This year, revenue growth 
was 9% and the underlying operating 
margin increased to 11.0% (2016: 10.9%). 
The Group’ s post-tax return on capital 
employed was 12.2% (2016: 13.0%) and 
the reduction was due to the working 
capital requirement in relation to the 
contract to build two submarine rescue 
vessels for the Indian Navy. The Group’ s 
cash conversion, which measures the 
proportion of underlying operating profit 
that is turned into operating cash, was 
56% (2016: 103%) after adjustment for 
the investment in working capital for 
the submarine rescue project, which is 
expected to reverse in 2018 when the 
vessels are scheduled for delivery.
Strategic progress 
The Group’s corporate objectives are to 
deliver long-term growth in underlying 
earnings per share and to deliver 
progressive dividend growth. In 2017, 
underlying earnings per share grew by 
7% and the compound rate of growth 
over the last ten years in underlying 
earnings per share is 10%. Dividends 
have increased in each of the last 23 
years and the compound rate of dividend 
growth over the last ten years is 10%. 
Over the last few years, the Group has 
made a number of acquisitions of marine 
service businesses which have been 
integrated into James Fisher Marine 
Services (JFMS) to form a substantial 
offshore and subsea operator for the 
renewables industry. JFMS provides a 
wide range of services to the offshore 
wind and tidal sector to support both 
the construction and maintenance 
of this fast-growing industry. During 
2017 this range of services was further 
enhanced through the acquisition 
of Rotos 360 Limited (Rotos 360), a 
leading provider of blade repair services, 
and EDS HV Group Limited (EDS), the 
leading provider of high voltage cable 
connections and cable repair services. 
In March 2017, Rotos 360 was acquired 
for an initial £1.5m in cash, with a 
further potential £5.0m based on future 
profitability. The company repairs offshore 
wind farm rotor blades through innovative 
use of suspended work platforms and 
ultra violet resin curing techniques which 
reduce operational downtime.
In December 2017, EDS was acquired 
for an initial £9.0m with a potential 
further £5.6m based on profit targets 
over the next two years.  EDS operates  5

HMS Queen Elizabeth
Our Tankships business, James Fisher Everard (JFE), supported the initial sea trials of the first of a new class of aircraft 
carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, by providing refuelling services in July and August 2017. The Ministry of Defence 
determined that the most suitable port providing the level of security required for its largest-ever warship was the Port 
of Cromarty Firth, at Invergordon. Refuelling by road tanker would have been impractical, as it would have required 120 
lorries for each fuel stop.  
JFE swiftly relocated two tanker vessels, the M.V . Sarnia Cherie and the M.V . Sarnia Liberty, from the south coast of England to 
Scotland. Loaded with cargoes of F-76 fuel from the oil fuel depot in Gosport, Hampshire each vessel was weighed down at 
the stern due to the small, steeply shelving mooring berth at Invergordon and the need to counter the angle. Sister company 
Fendercare provided two 250 metre-lengths of 4” hose with associated connectors to maximise the rate of fuel transfer. 
Observing strict windows of time when the HMS Queen Elizabeth was available for refuelling, JFE completed two separate 
fuelling operations safely and efficiently whilst working to a tight and demanding deadline. This allowed the HMS Queen 
Elizabeth to fulfil its sea trials and return to its home port of Portsmouth for the commissioning ceremony. 
Nick Henry, Chief Executive Officer
in the high voltage sector providing 
cabling connection services to the 
offshore wind farms and, in 2017, was a 
significant supplier to the Rampion wind 
farm, off the south coast of the UK. 
JFMS’ first significant integrated 
marine services contract to support 
the construction of the Galloper wind 
farm, located 27km off the coast of 
Suffolk, UK, continued to progress 
well and the contract, worth in excess 
of £30m, is scheduled to complete in 
2018. In November 2017 the Group 
announced the award of a package of 
services to support the construction of 
the East Anglia One wind farm which is 
worth £3.1m, confirming its position as 
the leading integrated marine service 
provider to the offshore renewables 
sector.
Our Marine Support business, 
Fendercare, is the world leader in 
ship-to-ship transfers from a network 
of over 50 bases around the world, with 
a 20-year track record of conducting 
safe and efficient operations. In 2017, it 
commenced operations in the Santos 
basin, off the coast of Brazil, for two 
oil majors. This is a new market with 
significant potential for further growth. 
JFD, our Specialist Technical business 
and the world’s leading producer and 
operator of untethered submarine 
rescue systems, made good progress 
on the final engineering, assembly and 
testing of two submarine rescue vessels 
which are scheduled to be delivered 
to the Indian Navy in 2018. When the 
vessels’ sea trials are completed JFD 
will commence a 25-year contract to 
operate the service in India. Our strategy 
in this niche area continues to be to 
grow long-term service contracts, having 
supplied submarine rescue vessels of 
our design. JFD also operates submarine 
rescue services for NATO, the Singapore 
Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.
The business also progressed with two 
saturation diving systems for a Chinese 
salvage customer. JFD is a market 
leader in saturation diving and other 
diving equipment and the installation 
of its specialist diving systems leads 
to future demand for its products and 
for refurbishments or life extension to 
existing assets. 
The Group’s Tankships division continued 
its progress and increased earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation by 6% 
to £15.8m (2016: £14.9m). Its earnings 
and strong cash flow are utilised in the 
organic and acquisitive growth of the 
other three divisions. Tankships further 
progressed its fleet renewal programme 
by agreeing terms to lease and sell the 
Milford Fisher and replace it with a more 
modern second hand, 4kT vessel during 
the first quarter of 2018.
In Offshore Oil, after a slow start to the 
year, the market improvement seen  6
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Chief Executive’s review continued
in the early summer months failed to 
continue into the autumn. This meant 
that the market remained flat for the year 
and the backlog of maintenance work 
remains to be addressed. The Group’s 
competitive position in our various 
geographic markets remains strong and 
hence Offshore Oil is well-positioned 
for the upturn in market activity as and 
when this occurs.

Underlying operating profit (£m) 24.5 21.0 
Underlying operating margin 10.4% 10.3%
Return on capital  
employed 
15.5% 13.9%
Marine Support revenue was 16% 
higher in 2017 at £236.3m (2016: 
£203.6m). After adjusting for the 
beneficial impact of currency rates, 
the increase was 14%. Underlying 
operating profit increased by 17% to 
£24.5m due to strong performance at 
Fendercare, which initiated ship-to-ship 
(STS) transfer services in Brazil, good 
growth from Subtech in Africa and the 
Middle East, and further progress in the 
renewables sector.
STS transfer services commenced in 
Brazil in January 2017 for two oil majors 
and built up to become a significant 
operation by the end of the year. This 
offset a slightly softer market in the 
Asia Pacific and West African regions 
but drove overall STS revenue growth 
of 16% in the year. Our fendering 
and marine products business also 
produced double digit revenue growth 
and increased its profitability. 
Revenue at Subtech, which is 
headquartered in Durban, South 
Africa, increased by over 50%, having 
established a presence in the Middle 
East and having landed significant 
subsea projects in Ghana, Nigeria and 
Saudi Arabia to provide diving and cable 
laying services.
JFMS successfully continued to provide 
its wide range of integrated marine 
services to the Galloper wind farm 
construction project. Rotos 360 has 
completed over 70 wind turbine blade 
repairs on ten wind farms since it was 
acquired in March 2017. At the Lynn 
and Inner Dowsing offshore wind farm, 
it completed a full turnkey repair project 
to repair 27 turbines in a contract worth 
£3.4m.
Specialist Technical 2017 2016
Underlying operating profit (£m) 21.1 19.9
Underlying operating margin 13.6% 13.1%
Return on capital  
employed 
19.7% 27.8%
Revenue was 3% ahead of 2016 and 
underlying operating profit 6% ahead 
at £21.1m (2016: £19.9m). The market 
for UK nuclear decommissioning, which 
represents around one third of the 
division, continued to be challenging 
and resulted in marginally lower revenue, 
but this was offset by our specialist 
diving and submarine rescue business, 
JFD, which increased sales by 6%.
JFD made good progress in the design, 
assembly and testing of two submarine 
rescue vessels, which are due for delivery 
to the Indian Navy during 2018. The first 
vessel was substantially complete at 
the end of 2017 and has subsequently 
achieved acceptance testing at our 
Inchinnan site near Glasgow, UK. Delivery 
is scheduled for March 2018 and the 
second vessel is due to be delivered in 
November 2018.
JFD Australia supplied a Transfer 
Under Pressure unit and a hyperbaric 
equipment suite in support of the 
contract to manage submarine rescue 
operations for the Royal Australian Navy. 
The annual exercise to practice and 
prove established rescue procedures 
which took place off the coast of West 
Australia, was successfully completed 
in November. On 19 February 2018, the 
Group acquired Cowan Manufacturing 
Pty Limited, a business based in 
New South Wales, Australia, which 
designs and manufactures portable 
hyperbaric chambers primarily for the 
Royal Australian Navy and the wider 
international defence market. 
JFD also took part in a major 
international submarine rescue exercise, 
Dynamic Monarch 2017, which 
demonstrated the capabilities of the  7

NATO partner nations’ (France, Norway 
and UK) submarine rescue system and 
provided training. Dynamic Monarch, 
which took place in Turkey, is one of 
the largest international submarine 
rescue exercises, which occurs every 
three years, and is designed to test 
international forces’ inter-operability and 
ability to respond to submarines that 
have become disabled, anywhere in the 
world.
James Fisher Nuclear (JFN), our 
nuclear decommissioning business, 
achieved the design scheme completion 
milestone on the Winfrith core 
reactor decommissioning contract 
which commenced in 2016. On-site 
implementation is scheduled for 2018. 
In March, the first drone survey within 
Sellafield’s high security chemical 
separation area was completed, 
removing the need for scaffolding or 
special access vehicles, saving both 
time and money. However the business 
faced a slower market for new projects 
in its main UK markets.
Offshore Oil 2017 2016
Underlying operating profit (£m) 3.8 4.2
Underlying operating margin 6.7% 7.6%
Return on capital

3.2% 3.5%
As reported at the half year, Offshore 
Oil had a slow start to the year, but 
business improved in the summer 
months. However, this improvement was 
not maintained into the autumn.
Revenue was 2% higher at £56.4m 
but after adjusting for the impact of

The business, which distributes clean 
petroleum products around the northern 
European coastline, maintained high

record of carrying out its operations 
to high standards of health and safety. 
In July and August, two of its vessels 
supported the sea trials of HMS Queen 
Elizabeth, the UK Navy’s largest aircraft 
carrier, by providing refuelling services 
in Invergordon, Scotland. The business 
responded quickly and pragmatically by 
deploying two vessels from the south 
coast of the UK, to support its customer.
Maputo project, Mozambique
Subtech, the Group’s Durban headquartered marine service 
company, completed a major quay offset project in the Port of 
Maputo in Mozambique. The project, which enabled other 
infrastructure projects at the port, involved the installation and 
commissioning of the new fender support structures and new 
fender spacing systems, within a 19 day shutdown period of the 
existing quay. The quay was extended and deepened to enable 
it to accommodate a fully-laden Panamex vessel. The first such 
vessel was successfully berthed three days after the quay was 
reopened in July 2017. 8
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Our businesses are linked together 
by a set of common marine service 
skills. The Group provides solutions 
to customers through the provision 
of specialist equipment supported 
by the detailed knowledge of our 
people, who are industry experts 
in their specific operations. The 
equipment is often designed and 
assembled by our people, who then 
operate it and provide through-life 
support to our customers.
Whilst our expertise originates in 
the UK, the Group provides these 
solutions and support internationally 
and focuses on servicing less mature 
markets.
Addressing such customer demands 
for quality and improvement requires 
the continuous development of 
innovative products to maintain 
market leadership in our areas of 
service.
The Group has a decentralised 
management structure and 
encourages managers to be 
responsible for making timely 
decisions in the best interests of their 
businesses but with the back-up and 
resources of a larger group.
Our businesses have strong, 
experienced management teams 
that are rewarded according to the 
success of their businesses. An 
entrepreneurial culture means that 
decisions are made quickly and in 
response to changes in the market 
and the competitive environment.
Organic growth from our existing 
businesses supported by selective 
acquisitions is central to the growth 
of the Group. Acquisitions broaden 
our product range and service 
portfolio, deepen our management 
pool and potentially extend our 
geographical coverage for our large 
multinational customers. James 
Fisher has acquired a number of 
owner-managed companies with 
specific expertise, often with strong 
market positions. The Group’s global 
reach has facilitated the extension 
of the scope of the operations of 
these companies to an international 
market. Subsequent strong organic 
growth has been achieved through 
investment in people, working capital 
and equipment.
Business model
Our business model comprises high quality niche businesses which offer a range of marine services 
predominantly to large multinational customers and governments globally.

James Fisher has a range of 
entrepreneurially-led businesses which 
are market leaders in their specific 
operational niche. Our businesses 
operate in demanding environments 
where strong marine service and 
specialist engineering skills are valued 
and rewarded. We seek to provide 
solutions to our customers in the less 
mature and fast-growing markets where 
they value trusted and quality suppliers. 
Our niche operations are integrated 
into a wider service offering to a diverse 
range of end markets.
Our focus on operational excellence 
requires that our businesses:
• are cash-generative;
•  have operating margins in excess of 
10%; and
•  provide returns on capital employed 
in excess of 15%.
Bolt-on acquisitions broaden the range 
of products and services that we 
provide. Our acquisition strategy has 
focused on niche businesses with a 
strong entrepreneurial culture which fit 
well with our operating style and growth 
strategy. As a cash-generative Group 
with a strong balance sheet, businesses 
are usually acquired using existing 
cash or borrowing resources. The 
businesses acquired have a good track 
record and typically need additional 
resources for their next growth phase. 
Where an acquisition bolts on to existing 
businesses, we seek to optimise shared 
back office functions, purchasing 
opportunities and cross-selling within 
the Group.
Strategy
The Group’s strategy is to grow its business organically by leveraging its existing marine skill base in areas 
of specialist expertise to a global market. This is supported by selective acquisitions to broaden the product 
and service range or geographical coverage. 10

Specialist Technical
Market drivers
JFD is the world’s leading supplier of 
saturation diving systems and related diving 
equipment. Its end markets are oil and gas 
and defence. Saturation diving systems are 
both fixed and portable. Fixed systems are 
usually built into dive support vessels (DSVs). 
JFD provides the equipment and the follow-
on consumables, support and maintenance 
to the DSV operator. The construction and 
replacement of DSVs drives new build 
saturation diving systems which in turn drives 
ancillary service and product spend. JFD’s 
defence market is based on service, repair 
and on-going calibration requirements, and on 
projects requiring specialist diving equipment.
JFD is also a leading provider of submarine 
rescue services. It encompasses the ability 
to design, deliver and operate submarine 
rescue vehicles. It has long-term service 
contracts with navies providing a very niche 
area of capability. The driver is the tendering 
of defence projects for provision of the 
equipment, which can then lead to longer-term 
service contracts to operate the service. We 
currently provide submarine rescue services 
to the UK, Singaporean and Australian navies. 
The business also provides swimmer delivery 
vessels to the special operations markets.
James Fisher Nuclear (JFN) provides 
engineered products and services to the 
nuclear industry both in the operation of 
nuclear power plants and decommissioning. 
Its products and services operate in hazardous 
environments. The business provides 
instrumentation, non-destructive testing, 
calibration and digital radiography to the 
nuclear, aerospace and process industries. The 
market drivers for JFN are the demand for its 
products, services and lifetime support from 
the UK decommissioning industry, radiological 
calibration requirements and projects within the 
aerospace, process and defence industries.
Sector
Our Specialist Technical businesses supply diving equipment and services, submarine 
rescue vessels and through-life rescue services and engineering solutions to the 
international defence market and UK nuclear decommissioning market. The submarine 
rescue market is a small niche with a national navy either having its own capability 
or relying on other countries. Other subsea services provided to the defence sector 
include diving equipment and special operation swimmer delivery vessels. The Group 
also supplies saturation diving systems which are installed onto dive support vessels 
and support deep subsea diving activities. James Fisher Nuclear provides engineered 
solutions which operate in hazardous environments in the nuclear industry.

Tankships
Market drivers
James Fisher Everard (JFE) distributes 
clean petroleum products under contracts 
with oil majors from refineries and 
terminals to storage facilities around 
the European coast, and to islands. It 
operates a fleet of double-hulled product 
tankers with capacity ranging from 
3,000mt to 13,000mt. The business 
driver is the level of consumption of clean 
products (petrol, diesel and kerosene) in 
the UK, Ireland and northern Europe.
JFE has undertaken 36,620 voyages 
since the year 2000, carrying in excess of 
78.5 million tonnes of petroleum products. 
This has been achieved whilst maintaining 
an excellent safety record.
Shipping clean petroleum products 
dramatically reduces our customers’ 
carbon footprint compared to other 
modes of transportation. Shipping’s CO2 
emissions are half that produced by road 
freight, and just one full ship keeps more 
than 150 trucks off the roads.
The division operates Cattedown 
Wharves, a port in Plymouth which 
provides berthing and marine services 
to the oil majors which own tank farms 
in Plymouth. It also handles dry cargoes 
such as animal feed being imported into 
the South West and clay being exported 
from the region. The primary driver for the 
business is the level of consumption of 
clean oil products within the South West 
region of the UK.
Sector
Our Tankships division operates a fleet of product tankers which trade along the UK 
and northern European coastline carrying petrol, diesel and kerosene. The division 
performs over 1,000 voyages each year carrying fuel from refineries and terminals to 
major coastal storage facilities. The division also operates a port in Plymouth, UK.

2017 results
The Group delivered another year of growth with underlying profit before tax increasing by 10% to £50.3m (2016: £45.8m). Strong 
growth in Marine Support, helped by uplifts at Specialist Technical and Tankships more than offset a £0.4m reduction in underlying 
operating profit in Offshore Oil.

* excludes separately disclosed items
Revenue increased by 9% due to strong 
growth in Marine Support and more 
modest uplifts in each of the other 
three divisions. Adjusting for currency 
fluctuations, revenue growth was 7%. 
Underlying operating profit was 10% 
higher and consequently underlying 
operating margins increased to 11.0% 
(2016: 10.9%). The Group’s post-tax 
return on capital employed was 12.2% 
(2016: 13.0%). Cash conversion, the 
measure of how much operating profit 
is converted into cash, was lower at 
56% (2016: 103%), as £24.4m of 
working capital was required for the 
submarine rescue project for the Indian 
Navy. Subject to on-time delivery and 
payment, this will reverse in 2018 and, 
excluding the working capital investment 
on this project, cash conversion would 
have been 99%, which demonstrates 
good conversion of profit into cash from 
the rest of the business. 
As previously signalled, trading was 
strongly second half weighted in 2017 
and 62% of underlying operating profit 
arose in the latter half of 2017. This was 
across all divisions but most marked 
in Offshore Oil and Marine Support. 
Offshore Oil had a slow start to the year 
but its second half underlying operating 
profit was two and a half times greater 
than the first half and around 30% 
stronger than prior year comparator. 
Marine Support’s underlying operating 
profit was nearly 70% stronger in 
the second half due to the timing of 
renewables projects, subsea projects in 
the Middle East and Africa, and growing 
ship-to-ship transfers in Brazil.
The Group’ s main currency exposure is 
in respect of US Dollar cash inflows. To 
reduce the risk of earnings volatility, the 
Group mitigates the risk of exchange 
rate changes by entering into forward 
contracts to hedge approximately half of 
estimated US Dollar inflows. In 2017, the 
average GBP:USD rate was £1:$1.30 
(2016: £1:$1.36). This 4% weakening 
of Sterling added £8.0m to revenue in 
the year and, net of the effect of forward 
contracts, £1.2m to underlying operating 
profit. 
Marine Support increased underlying 
operating profit for the year by 17% 
due to the strong second half referred 
to above. Specialist Technical improved 
underlying operating margins to 13.6% 
(2016: 13.1%) with the assembly of two 
submarine rescue vessels for the Indian 
Navy on track. Offshore Oil delivered a 
similar performance to last year despite 
a weaker first half, and Tankships 
continued its recent track record of 
double digit underlying operating 
margins combined with strong cash 
generation. 15

Finance charges
Net finance charges were £0.5m higher 
at £5.5m (2016: £5.0m) as the Group 
incurred £0.5m in relation to the interest 
element on forward contracts. In addition, 
higher borrowings increased finance 
charges by £0.4m which was offset by a 
lower cost of borrowing by £0.1m and a 
reduction of £0.3m in notional interest on 
pension schemes.
Interest cover, the ratio of underlying 
operating profit to the net finance charges, 
excluding pension related charges, was 
12.8 times (2016: 14.1 times).
Taxation 
The tax charge for the year of £8.7m 
(2016: £7.1m) on underlying profit 
before tax of £50.3m (2016: £45.8m) 
represents an underlying effective tax 
rate (ETR) of 17.2% (2016: 15.4%). The 
Group ETR is impacted by recurring 
items such as the geographical mix of 
profits, tonnage tax relief on the profits 
of its tanker operations and expenses 
disallowed for tax. The Group operates 
in 21 countries so its ETR is a blend 
of national tax rates applied to locally 
generated profits. Non-recurring items 
include adjustments to tax calculations 
in previous years where the outturn has 
been or will be lower.
The Group’s tax policy, which has been 
approved by the Board, is available 
on the website (www.james-fisher.
co.uk). Whilst the Group has a duty to 
shareholders to seek to minimise its 
tax burden, its tax policy is to do so in 
a manner which is consistent with its 
commercial objectives, and which meets 
its legal obligations and its code of 
ethics. We aim to manage our tax affairs 
in a responsible and transparent manner 
and with regard for the intention of the 
legislation, rather than just the wording 
itself.
Our tax objectives are to comply with 
all applicable tax laws and regulations, 
including the timely submission of all 
tax returns and tax payments, and 
to undertake all dealings with local 
tax authorities in a professional and 
timely manner. The Group operates 
in a complex global environment and 
continues to monitor the OECD’s Base 
Erosion Profit Shifting initiatives as part 
of its tax risk management. We seek 
to comply with local transfer pricing 
legislation in each relevant jurisdiction 
and involve external tax advisers, 
where appropriate, to identify any 
changes to pricing policies and related 
documentation.
The Group paid £8.0m (2016: £6.9m) of 
corporation tax in cash across all of its 
jurisdictions, with around 39% paid to 
the UK tax authorities. A further £26.0m 
was paid in the UK for payroll taxes 
(2016: £28.2m).
Profit before taxation, 
earnings per share and 
dividends
Underlying profit before taxation was 
10% higher at £50.3m (2016: £45.8m) 
and statutory profit before taxation was 
£49.0m (2016: £44.9m). 
Underlying diluted earnings per share 
increased by 7% to 81.4p per share 
(2016: 76.3p). Statutory diluted earnings 
per share were 79.5p per share (2016:

2018 to shareholders on the register on 
6 April 2018, subject to approval at the

charges or income.
The net separately disclosed charge 
increased to £0.9m in 2017 (2016: 
£0.6m). Amortisation of intangible 
assets (which arises when businesses 
are acquired) increased to £2.0m due 
to the full year impact of the businesses 
acquired in 2016. Contingent 
consideration releases are based on 
latest estimates of obligations in relation 
to targets originally agreed within a sale 
and purchase agreement. A credit of 
£1.7m (2016: £3.3m) related to two 
prior period acquisitions. 
Cash flow and borrowings
As previously reported, the contract 
to design, assemble and deliver two 
submarine rescue vessels to the Indian 
Navy required significant working capital 
funding during the build phase from 
May 2016 through to delivery of the first 
vessel in March 2018. At 31 December 
2017, £31.2m (2016: £6.8m) of working 
capital had cumulatively been drawn 
down to fund this project and, subject 
to delivery and payment on time, is 
expected to reverse by the end of 2018.
Working capital over the last four 
half year period ends, excluding the 
submarine rescue project for India, 
has consistently been around 17% of 
sales. Free cash flow (which is the net 
cash generated before cash spend on 
business acquisitions and dividends) 
was an outflow of £7.7m (2016: inflow 
of £25.0m), reflecting the working capital 
referred to above.
Net capital expenditure in the year was 
£24.7m (2016: £14.8m), with £15.7m 
invested in Marine Support on dive 
systems and equipment to support 
project wins in the Middle East and 
Africa, and a replacement tugboat in the 
Asia Pacific region.
Net borrowings increased in the year by 
£26.8m to £132.5m (2016: £105.7m) 
due to working capital funding on the 
submarine rescue project of £24.4m 
(2016: £6.8m), businesses acquired of 
£5.2m (2016: £24.6m) and dividends 
paid of £13.9m (2016: £12.3m). At 
31 December 2017, the ratio of net  17
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
borrowings to underlying earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (Ebitda) was 1.6 times 
(2016: 1.4 times) and the Group had 
£71.8m (2016: £49.7m) of undrawn 
committed banking facilities.  The ratio 
of net borrowings including bonds and 
guarantees to Ebitda was 2.2 times 
(2016: 1.9 times). Net gearing, the ratio 
of net debt to equity, was 47% (2016: 
41%).
Acquisitions
During the year the Group acquired 
Rotos 360 Limited for an initial 
consideration of £1.5m, with potentially 
up to a further £5.0m of future 
consideration based on a profit target 
for the year ending 31 December 
2019. EDS HV Group Limited was 
acquired in December 2017 for an 
initial consideration of £9.0m, with 
potentially up to a further £5.6m of 
future consideration based on profit 
targets for the two years ending 30 
September 2019. Both businesses add 
to the Group’s Marine Support division’s 
capability for the renewables sector.
In February 2018, the Group acquired 
the entire issued share capital of 
Cowan Manufacturing Pty Limited for 
consideration of AUD$2.6m (£1.5m) in 
cash.
Pensions
The Group operates a range of defined 
contribution schemes for current 
employees and contributed £3.7m 
(2016: £3.8m) into those schemes in 
the year. The Group has an obligation 
of £19.8m (2016: £26.8m) for its 
own closed defined benefit scheme 
and for two industry-wide defined 
benefit schemes. This decreased 
due to contributions of £4.6m and 
re-measurement gains of £3.2m due 
to changes in inflation and mortality 
assumptions and improved asset 
performance.
IFRS 15
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with 
customers’, which is effective from 
1 January 2018, identifies performance 
obligations in contracts with customers 
and recognises revenue as these 
performance obligations are satisfied. 
The Group’s results announcement for 
the six months ending 30 June 2018 
will be the first to be prepared under 
IFRS 15. James Fisher has undertaken 
a detailed review of all material contracts 
with customers and different types 
of revenue streams to determine the 
impact of IFRS 15 on the opening 
balance sheet at 1 January 2017 and for 
the year ended 31 December 2017. The 
estimated impact on retained earnings 
at 1 January 2017 is a reduction of 
around £5m and on the results reported 
in 2017 is a reduction of revenue by 
around £6m and profit before taxation 
by £0.7m-£1.5m. 18

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s risk management 
framework
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the management of risk in the 
Group. Our internal control and risk 
management framework is regularly 
monitored and reviewed by the 
Board and the Audit Committee, 
and comprises a series of policies, 
processes, procedures and 
organisational structures which are 
designed to ensure that the level of 
risk to which the Group is exposed is 
consistent with the Board’s risk appetite 
and the Company’s strategic objectives.
The Board determines the Group’ s 
policies on risk, appetite for risk and 
levels of risk tolerance, and specifically 
approves: risk management policies and 
plans; significant insurance and/or legal 
claims and/or settlements; acquisitions, 
disposals and capital expenditures; and 
the Group budget, forecast and three 
year plan. The Board has put in place a 
documented organisational structure with 
strictly defined limits of authority from the 
Board to operating units that have been 
communicated throughout the businesses 
and are well understood by the Executive 
Directors, functional and business leaders 
who have delegated authority and specific 
responsibility for ensuring compliance with 
and implementing policies at corporate, 
divisional and business unit level. Group 
functions and operating units are each 
required to operate within this control 
environment and in accordance with 
the established policies and procedures 
covering areas including ethics, anti-
bribery and corruption, conflicts, treasury, 
employment, slavery and human 
trafficking, whistleblowing, data protection, 
health and safety and environment.
The Group’s trading companies are 
supported by Group functions for 
finance, treasury, taxation, internal 
audit, insurance, legal and company 
secretarial, human resources and payroll 
and information systems: the functional 
heads report to a nominated Executive 
Director. The Board retains an oversight 
role, receives regular reports on key 
issues and has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision, 
designed to ensure that it maintains full 
and effective control over appropriate 
strategic, investment, financial, 
organisational and compliance issues. 
This schedule is subject to review by the 
Board on an annual basis.
The Board also operates a Group 
Risk Committee (GRC), which meets 
quarterly and is chaired by Nick 
Henry, with representation from 
functional heads including finance, 
human resources, legal and company 
secretarial, information services, 
insurance and internal audit. The 
main responsibilities of the GRC are 
to identify and monitor operational 
risks and ensure that those risks are 
being actively managed throughout the 
Group; to support the Group’s Internal 
Control and Risk Management strategy 
and policy; and to review reports on 
Key Risks and Risk Maps prepared by 
trading companies in order to monitor 
and report on the types of risk within the 
Group and report on how effectively risk 
management is performed/monitored 
within each business unit/trading 
company. The minutes of the GRC are 
reported to the Board. 
Risk management systems
The key features of the Group’s risk 
management systems are as follows:
•  Each trading business is required to 
maintain an up to date risk register, 
which is reviewed at each quarterly 
business board meeting, identifies 
key risks and assesses the likelihood 
and impact of each risk before and 
after mitigation measures are taken.
•  On an annual basis the risk registers 
are submitted for analysis to the 
Group General Counsel and internal 
audit. This analysis is considered 
by the Board when determining 
the Group’s principal risks, and the 
areas of internal audit focus for the 
forthcoming period.
•  The trading company managing 
directors complete a risk 
management review questionnaire 
on an annual basis which is a 
self-assessment of operational 
controls and compliance with 
Group policies, applicable laws 
and regulations relating to their 
business. This enables business 
managers to identify risks and focus 
on mitigating strategies. The reviews 
are submitted to the Group General 
Counsel and internal audit for 
analysis and reporting to the Board.
Business reporting and 
performance reviews
The Group operates an annual 
budgeting process and produces 
quarterly forecasts which are reviewed 
and approved by the Board. Monthly 
results are compared with budget 
and prior year, and individual business  20
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
reviews are conducted quarterly, which 
include a review of financial results. The 
businesses also compile a three year 
strategic plan.
The Executive Directors hold quarterly 
board meetings with each business 
unit to discuss strategy, financial results 
and forecasts, business needs and the 
management of risks facing the business.
Identifying and monitoring 
material risks
Material risks are identified and 
monitored as follows:
•  A risk evaluation process 
commences in the operating 
companies with an annual exercise 
to identify the significant operational 
and financial risks facing the 
business. This is supported by a 
self-assessment internal control 
review questionnaire completed 
by each operating company and 
submitted to internal audit. This 
process is robust and challenging, 
ensures that risks are identified and 
that management has adequate 
internal control systems in place 
to report any weaknesses that 
require management attention. The 
results of the analysis are utilised to 
determine future areas of internal 
audit focus.
•  A ‘risk score’ is determined for each 
risk, based on the likelihood of the 
identified risk arising and the potential 
impact on the business of an adverse 
outcome. The risk score before 
and after mitigation is reviewed at 
business and Group level.
•  The risk assessments are 
summarised and presented to the 
Board, which evaluates the principal 
risks of the Group by reference to 
the strategy and operating business 
environment.
Principal risks and 
uncertainties
The most significant risks which the 
Board considers may affect our business 
(based on the risk evaluation process 
described above) are listed below. On the 
basis that the Board considers that the 
Group’s principal risks have not materially 
changed, the categories of risks listed 
below are similar to last year. The Group’s 
decentralised business model and 
geographical spread helps to mitigate the 
impact of each principal risk.
The Board has considered the potential 
effect of the UK’s exit from the European 
Union throughout the year. It considers 
that Brexit is unlikely to have a material 
impact on the Group, as its business 
interests and customer base in the 
EU are not significant. The Board will 
continue to track and consider the 
implications of Brexit and its potential 
impact as the terms of the UK’s exit, 
both during and after transition, become 
clearer.

Changes in risk 
profile 2017 – 2018
Project delivery
The failure to meet customer expectations on project 
delivery could have potentially significant adverse 
financial and reputational consequences and could 
potentially result in claims and litigation.
Projects and contracts are subject to on-going review at levels 
and frequencies appropriate to performance and potential risks. 
Our businesses employ industry experts to help ensure effective project 
delivery and performance. This together with established processes 
and procedures, reporting systems, management oversight, customer 
feedback and staff training and development is designed to mitigate the 
risk to successful project delivery.
An increase in size and 
volume of contracts 
increases project delivery 
risk, but this is in proportion 
with the growth of the 
Group.
Contractual risk
As the Group continues to grow, wins larger contracts 
and operates in more geographies, sometimes with 
local partners, the Company is potentially exposed to 
increased risks such as late payment or cost overruns.
The Group utilises professional expertise to minimise risk in contract 
negotiation with customers and partners. All major tenders, contracts and 
joint ventures are referred to the Board for approval and limits of authority 
are designed to ensure that contracts are reviewed and approved at 
appropriate levels prior to commitment.  In addition the project delivery 
and performance function (referred to above) provides assurance on 
delivery.
Marginally higher.
Recruitment and retention of key staff
James Fisher has strong and experienced 
management teams in its operational businesses and 
depends on the skills, experience and competence 
of all of its people to drive the business forward in 
established and new markets. The Group’s success 
in delivering its strategic objectives depends on 
recruiting and retaining the right people in all areas 
of our business and planning succession in key 
leadership positions. The failure to attract, retain and 
develop personnel of the requisite calibre could have 
an adverse impact on the business.
Our strategy to attract and retain talent includes graduate recruitment, 
identifying and developing future leaders, regular appraisals, formal and informal 
training plans, succession planning, and appropriate remuneration incentives 
including the extension of share schemes to key individuals. We aim to develop 
talent from within. Succession and talent development is regularly discussed at 
Board and trading company level. There are several management development 
programmes in place for individuals who have been identified as potential 
senior managers. These programmes are defined to help develop and grow 
the capabilities and behaviours required of senior managers so that we have 
potential successors for key business roles. These strategies are designed to 
retain and motivate individuals and to ensure their commitment to the success 
of the business. Staff turnover at senior levels within the Group remains low.
No change.

Health, safety and environment
The Group’s success is dependent on conducting its 
business safely and in accordance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements. Our businesses are reliant 
on ensuring that a good reputation is maintained with 
their customers. An adverse operational incident 
or failure to maintain appropriate levels of service 
delivery would potentially damage the Group’s 
reputation leading to financial and commercial 
consequences.
The Group places a particular emphasis on operational excellence 
including the health, safety and security of its operations and the quality of 
services provided. These key areas are continually monitored and reported 
to the Board. We have policies and processes to safely and compliantly 
manage our operations, to protect our employees and others, to react 
appropriately to operational incidents and to deal quickly and effectively 
with any safety or service failings.
No change.
Financial risk
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial 
risks which could adversely affect the financial 
performance of the Company. The risks include 
interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risk.
An increase in interest rates or change in exchange 
rates or credit restriction would have a financial 
impact.
The Group maintains relationships with a small key group of banks and 
reviews its funding mix and requirements at each Board meeting. The 
Board discusses macro-economic issues and their potential impact on 
each of these risks.
The Group enters into bilateral facilities to spread its maturity profile and 
aims to maximise the term of its revolving credit facilities. The Group’s 
centralised finance function oversees all key strategic finance matters 
and is responsible for treasury, tax, foreign exchange and funding 
requirements. This includes the day-to-day management of the Group’s 
liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. Forward currency 
contracts and interest rate swaps are entered into to mitigate the risks of 
adverse currency or interest rate movements. The Group also seeks to 
secure payment in hard currency to mitigate exchange rate risk.
2016 was a period of 
high volatility in this 
area. 2017 was less 
volatile.
Energy markets
The Group has significant operations across the 
energy sector and serves a broad range of oil and 
gas, nuclear and renewables customers.
A marked change in circumstances in individual 
market sectors, energy prices or change in 
government regulation or policy may lead to 
reduced activity which can affect demand for the 
Group’s products and services and impact financial 
performance.
The Group has exposure across the energy sector and to a broad 
range of end markets and differing geographies. This, together with the 
maintenance of close relationships with key customers and suppliers, 
helps to mitigate the potential impact of market risks in the energy sector.
Specifically with regard to the oil and gas sector, the Group has limited 
exposure to the exploration phase and seeks longer-term contracts for 
inspection, repair and maintenance work.
The strategic risks are 
reducing in proportion 
to the wider diversity of 
businesses within the 
Group.
Operating in emerging markets
The Group has increasing activities in overseas 
emerging markets and key growth economies which 
are often undertaken in association with local joint 
venture partners. This, together with legislative 
restrictions, embargoes, sanctions and exchange 
controls, has the potential for increasing the Group’s 
financial and governance risk exposure. Any 
significant failure to comply with laws or regulations 
could lead to liabilities and penalties.
Risk and internal control of overseas joint ventures is a key area of 
management’s focus. As businesses develop we monitor and review 
the structure of, and reporting lines for, our overseas operations and the 
relations with third parties to ensure an appropriate form of command and 
control is maintained, dependent on the particular operating environment 
and the nature and size of the business. The Group allocates additional 
resource to areas of higher risk and has enhanced its internal audit 
reviews for overseas businesses which are supported by external audit 
companies, where appropriate.
Processes are in place that are designed to ensure that all businesses 
operate in accordance with legislative restrictions, embargoes, sanctions 
and exchange controls and the Group’s policies and applicable laws.
No change.
Cyber security
Attempts to cause harm to the Group and its 
businesses via digital channels could lead to theft, 
fraud, interruption to business and damage to our 
reputation.
The Group’s IT systems are defended through the use of software 
protection and processes which are regularly reviewed and tested. These 
defences include gateways, firewalls and threat detectors. IT security 
information and updates are reviewed on a regular basis. Group IT 
systems were subjected to penetration tests and vulnerability scans 
during 2017 which were satisfactory. Accounting and banking controls 
are regularly appraised to ensure they are appropriate, up to date and 
comply with recommended practice.
There have been no 
major security breaches 
or fraud in 2017 and the 
risk is unchanged. 22

Corporate responsibility
Introduction
The Board remains committed to high 
standards of corporate governance, 
and to ensuring consistent application 
across the Group of its values of 
honesty, integrity and fairness which, 
in the Company’s view, are the key 
elements for building a sustainable 
and profitable business. Corporate 
responsibility remains central to the 
delivery of our business strategy. This 
report will explain how we applied 
the principles of good governance 
throughout the year in key areas, and 
outlines the processes and controls we 
use to manage the Group’s approach 
to health and safety, environmental 
matters, our employees, business ethics 
and social responsibilities.
Our Board of Directors sets the strategic 
and financial objectives for the Group 
and in doing so, requires and seeks 
to ensure that the Group maintains 
high ethical standards of behaviour 
throughout its businesses.
For the purposes of sections 414CA 
and CB of the Companies Act 2006, this 
report shall constitute the Group’s non-
financial information statement.
Health and safety 
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
in relation to the health, safety and 
welfare of its employees, contractors 
and visitors to the Group’s premises, 
as well as all those who come into 
contact with the Group in its diverse 
activities. The Board considered and 
re-approved the Group’s existing 
health safety and environment policy in 
January 2018 as a declaration of our 
intent and commitment. We continue 
to strive towards our ultimate aim of 
having no accidents or injuries and we 
have a proactive safety culture across 
the Group which promotes compliance 
and ensures continuous improvement. 
We have a strong focus on employee 
training, regulatory compliance and 
accident reduction, all of which are 
monitored and reported across the 
Group. Accountability remains with local 
management who are best-placed to 
ensure that their businesses comply 
with local laws and regulations and 
specific needs on a day-to-day basis. 
This is overseen by Nick Henry, the 
Chief Executive Officer, who has overall 
responsibility for health and safety. The 
review of health and safety performance 
is high on the agenda at each Board 
and business board meetings, and 
remains a top priority for the Group.
The Group Health and Safety 
Committee (GHSC), chaired by Nick 
Henry, meets on a quarterly basis to 
discuss all health and safety issues 
including incidents, mitigating actions 
and training requirements. The GHSC 
ensures that recordable safety incidents 
are reported to the Board and that each 
Group operating company is maintaining 
high standards of health and safety in 
its business. Through the GHSC, the 
Group shares best practice and lessons 
learnt following any health and safety 
incidents, including near misses, to 
mitigate the risk of recurrence.
The Group’s principal operating 
companies maintain internationally 
recognised occupational health and 
safety management systems accredited 
to OHSAS 18001 and management 
systems which are accredited to the 
international quality standard ISO 
19001. 
The Group has adopted the Reporting 
of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations 2013 
(RIDDOR) in the reporting of reportable 
incidents. A reportable incident under 
RIDDOR is a work-related injury which 
results in a person’s incapacitation for 
more than seven days. The number of 
reportable incidents across the Group in 
2017 was 5 (2016: 5).
The Group also records lost time 
accidents (LTAs) to monitor performance 
and trends. An LTA is an incident which 
causes a worker to be incapacitated 
for three or more consecutive days, not 
including the day of incident. In 2017, 
the Group incurred 5 LTAs (2016: 6).
The Group monitors its overall RIDDOR 
reportable frequency rate, defined as the 
number of RIDDOR reportable incidents 
per one hundred thousand hours of 
work. In 2017, the Group’s RIDDOR 
reportable frequency rate was 0.1 
(2016: 0.1). 23

Environmental matters
The Group recognises its responsibility 
to protect the environment for the 
benefit of all and is committed to 
operating its businesses to ensure that 
the environmental impact of its activities, 
its consumption of raw materials and its 
production of waste is minimised. The 
Group is committed to working within 
the appropriate regulatory frameworks 
to minimise the impacts of its operations 
on the environment.
Nearly all of our principal operating 
companies are ISO 14001 compliant. 
This internationally recognised 
environmental management system 
enables a systematic approach to 
handling environmental issues.
Energy consumption was measured 
across the Group by recording data on 
the combustion of fuel and the use of 
electricity at its facilities. The Group’s 
total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
are set out below.
Emissions total (in thousands of 
metric tons)
2017 2016
CO2 equivalent from 
electricity consumption in 
facilities
2.3 3.0
CO2 from combustion of 
fuel at facilities and road 
vehicles
2.4 2.9
CO2 from combustion of 
fuel in vessels
84.0 83.9
Total emissions (CO2) 88.6 89.8
Emissions from the combustion of 
bunkers which fuel the tankers in the 
Tankships division amounted to 95% of 
the Group’s total emissions (2016: 93%). 
The benefit of sea transportation is that 
one 4,000 metric ton vessel can carry 
150 times the volume of fuel carried by 
a single road tanker, which significantly 
reduces congestion and emissions to 
air. Emissions from fuel combustion in 
vessels  was similar to 2016 despite one 
fewer vessel in the Tankships division. 
This was due to the growth in ship-to-
ship transfer services in Brazil which 
commenced in January 2017.
The Group’s carbon intensity ratio 
calculated against the Group’s revenue 
remained flat at 0.02% (2016: 0.02%). 
Our Tankships division operates a Ship 
Energy Efficiency Management Plan to 
regulate shipping energy efficiency and 
to control its marine GHG emissions. 
One objective under the Group’s 
health, safety and environment policy 
is to ensure that the impact of our 
activities and our production of waste is 
minimised, as such waste management 
and recycling of materials is encouraged 
across the Group and in an effort to 
reduce our carbon emissions from 
travelling to and from meetings, the use 
of video conferencing is widely used 
throughout the Group.
Employee related matters 
The Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for employee matters and he 
is assisted by the Group Head of Human 
Resources. The Group is committed 
to complying with all applicable laws 
governing employment practices and 
to the prevention of discrimination 
on the basis of any unlawful criteria. 
Employment arrangements are intended 
to be fair, equitable and consistent with 
the skills and abilities of the employees 
and the needs of the business.
The Group is committed to developing its 
employees and ensuring that investment 
in learning and development is in line 
with the business strategy and goals. 
We recognise that the success of our 
business depends on our talented 
workforce. Employees throughout the 
Group are encouraged to participate in 
training and development programmes 
and to obtain professional qualifications 
relevant to their roles. In order to develop 
this further, the Group has broadened its 
management development and graduate 
recruitment programmes, which focus 
on recruiting talented graduates and 
developing skills and experience to 
produce potential future managers. The 
Company also has a dedicated learning 
and development team who deliver in-
house training to employees throughout 
the Group on a wide variety of personal 
development and compliance-related 
topics, much of which is tailored to each 
business to give the employees targeted, 
bespoke training which will advance their 
development. 
The Group believes that effective 
learning and development will help to 
attract and retain high quality people, 
support them in reaching their potential 
and build the capabilities necessary 
to succeed, which in turn rewards 
the Group by securing the dedication 
and motivation of those employees. 
Keeping our people inspired remains 
one of our highest priorities and so 
we focus on creating an environment 
where performance is rewarded, people 
are respected for their contributions, 
diversity and inclusion is encouraged 
and where integrity is upheld in all 
aspects of our work. The Group 
remains committed to providing equal 
opportunities free from discrimination, 
and to developing and retaining talent 
to maximise business growth and 
performance.
The Company also recognises the need 
to provide flexible working practices 
to support the needs of employees to 
maintain a successful work-life balance. 
In support of this the Company operates 
a flexible working policy. Under this 
policy, the Company states that it will, 
where possible, try and accommodate 
an employee’s needs. During 2017, 
49 requests for flexible working were 
made and 100% were accepted by the 
Company.
Developing and maintaining employee 
engagement with the Company is 
important. The Group communicates 
with its employees on matters of 
concern to them as employees, 
and on the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of 
the Company. This is done principally 
through management briefings and 
newsletters, the Company’s website, 
the Group’s intranet resource, and 
by the distribution of preliminary and 
interim announcements and press  24
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
releases. Copies of the Annual Report 
and Accounts are also made available 
to the operating businesses and this 
communication process enables 
employees to gain an understanding of 
the Group’s objectives and performance 
and how they have contributed to those 
results. Where decisions are being made 
which are likely to affect employees’ 
interests, such employees or their 
representatives are consulted so that 
their views can be taken into account. 
We operate in a competitive 
marketplace and the Board recognises 
the importance of rewarding employees 
appropriately for the value they bring to 
the business. It aims to offer rewards 
that attract and retain key talent.
The Group also encourages its 
employees to share in its successes 
through share ownership. As at 
31 December 2017, 284 employees 
were participants in the James Fisher 
Sharesave Scheme which gives them 
the opportunity to purchase shares at 
the end of a three or five year saving 
plan (2016: 293).
Equal opportunities and 
diversity 
The Group values the diverse 
backgrounds of all its people and 
strives to create a culture of honesty, 
openness and accountability. It is Group 
policy to treat all job applicants and 
employees fairly. The Group has made 
the commitment that no employee 
or potential employee shall receive 
more or less favourable treatment or 
consideration on the grounds of race, 
colour, ethnic origin, nationality, national 
origin, religion or belief, gender, age, 
disability, sexual orientation, marital status 
or any other similarly protected status. 
We aim to ensure that people from any 
background or of any gender identity 
have equal access to employment, 
training and career progression 
opportunities. We strive to select 
individuals on merit and do not consider 
that targets or quotas are appropriate.
The Board recognises that having a 
diverse workforce allows the Group to 
meet better the differing requirements 
of our global customer base. Our 
strategy is to identify current and/ 
or future potential successors to 
senior management roles throughout 
the Group, and gender diversity is 
encouraged by the Board. The Group’s 
diversity policy is reviewed annually and 
approved by the Board and is available 
on the Company’s website.
The objectives of the Group’s diversity 
policy are to ensure that the Group 
benefits from a diverse workforce and 
has a working environment where all 
employees are encouraged to realise 
their full potential and where there is an 
open atmosphere of trust, honesty and 
respect. The policy applies to all Group 
employees and to all staff, contractors, 
consultants and any other individual 
working for, at, or on behalf of the 
Group. One diversity policy initiative is 
to provide training and mentoring for 
women at all stages of their career to 
support their development as leaders. 
In the last two years, 63 women passed 
through this leadership programme.

The Group will report on gender pay in 
accordance with the requirements of 
the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap 
Information) Regulations 2017 by 4 April 
2018. The Board has been considering 
the preliminary results of the Group 
analysis and whether any action might 
be required.
All of our employees are treated with 
respect and dignity. Harassment of 
any kind is not tolerated. In addition to 
complying with legislative requirements, 
the Group strives to ensure that disabled 
employees are treated fairly and that 
their training, career development 
and promotion needs are met. If an 
employee were to become disabled 
during the course of their employment, 
the Group would provide support, 
wherever practicable, whether through 
re-training or re-deployment, so that 
they continue to be employed, wherever 
practicable, in the same job, or if this 
were not practicable, every effort would 
be made to find suitable alternative 
employment.
Respect for human rights
James Fisher is committed to 
supporting and respecting human 
rights in the workplace and in the 
communities in which it operates 
across its international business. We 
have implemented work practices and 
policies throughout the Group which 
are designed to ensure that respect 
for human rights is integrated into the 
systems and culture of our businesses. 
We do not tolerate the use of child or 
forced labour within our business and 
take all steps possible to ensure that our 
suppliers and customers also uphold 
internationally recognised human rights. 
The Group has a formal slavery and 
human trafficking statement which is 
available on the Group’s website and 
which outlines steps taken by the Group 
to ensure that there is transparency in 
the Group and throughout our supply 
chains. As part of this policy statement, 
the Group encourages any concerns 
relating to modern slavery to be raised 
using the procedure set out in the 
whistleblowing policy. There is an 
on-going process of risk assessment 
with the effectiveness of this statement 
and the Group’s other policies, and 
procedures being regularly monitored 
and reviewed by the Audit Committee 
to ensure that they align with our Group 
strategy. During 2017, no whistleblowing 
reports were brought to the attention of 
the Audit Committee.

Business ethics, anti-bribery 
and corruption matters
As a Group we aim to act responsibly 
and ethically in all of our business 
dealings. Through our ethics policy 
we aim to instill the highest standards 
of business behaviour across the 
Group and we focus on embedding 
a culture of ethical compliance so 
that all of our people understand the 
standards of ethical business practice 
that are expected of them. As well as 
protecting the reputation of the Group 
and safeguarding the investment of 
our shareholders, the business ethics 
policy aims to protect the interests of 
every employee by ensuring legal and 
regulatory compliance in all jurisdictions 
where the Group operates, as well as 
promoting responsible behaviour across 
the Group.
The Group has an established anti-
bribery and corruption policy and has 
introduced a compliance programme 
which has the support of the Board 
and senior management within the 
Group. The programme includes 
communication of the statement 
and policy, training, risk assessment, 
monitoring and review processes. 
Employees assessed to be at risk are 
required to complete the training and 
to self-certify that they understand and 
agree to be bound by its provisions. By 
the end of 2017, over 1,000 employees 
had undertaken this training.
The Group does not permit bribery, nor 
illegal or corrupt business practices 
and our whistleblowing procedure 
allows employees to raise any 
malpractice concerns they may have 
in an appropriate forum without fear 
of recourse. On-going compliance is 
monitored by local compliance officers 
who are required to report to their local 
boards and to the Group Compliance 
Officer on at least a biannual basis. The 
compliance officers are responsible 
for ensuring that risk assessments, 
training and awareness are carried out 
where appropriate and are kept up to 
date. They are also required to monitor, 
record and report agency arrangements 
with third parties to ensure that all our 
business dealings are appropriate and 
within our ethical framework.
Customers
Our customers are extremely important 
to us. The Group aims to provide 
superior customer service through value 
added solutions combined with high 
quality products. First class customer 
service and innovation are critical to our 
success.
We appreciate that every customer 
has different needs and expectations 
and we have developed long-lasting 
relationships with customers and 
suppliers over many years to help 
customers find the solutions they need. 
We have followed a customer-led 
strategy with regards to expansion into 
international markets, and we are proud 
to be a trusted partner of many major 
corporations, government agencies 
and other customers around the 
world. We understand that a continued 
commitment to our existing and future 
customers is fundamental to our 
success and so we strive to work hard 
to understand our customers’ needs 
and to continue delivering customer 
satisfaction.
Suppliers
Our businesses have developed their 
own long-term relationships with 
suppliers based upon best practice, 
legal requirements and Group policies 
and procedures. Group companies 
promote human rights, social 
responsibility, trade compliance and 
anti-corruption within their own supplier 
base, and key suppliers are vetted to 
ensure that they adhere to all relevant 
laws, our policies and codes of conduct 
and, where appropriate, operate within 
internationally recognised quality, health 
and safety and management systems.
Our community matters 
Whilst the Group has no formal 
policy on supporting the community, 
it continues to encourage its businesses 
to support local communities within 
their operational areas. During 2017, 
the Group was involved in the provision 
and installation of two manual boreholes 
which will provide fresh drinking water 
to two rural communities based in the 
Mpohor district of the western region 
of Ghana. The Group has also set up 
an educational bursary in South Africa 
for prospective new mariners in a bid 
to help promising female students 
complete the necessary studies for a 
career in the maritime industry. During 
the year our employees have given 
their time and money to a wide range 
of charitable giving and fund raising 
activities.
Charitable causes supported in 2017 
included: Macmillan; Make a Wish 
Foundation; Meningitis Research 
Charity; Ty Gobaith (Hope House) 
children’s hospice; RNLI; NeST 
(Nephrotic Syndrome Trust); the 
Alzheimer’s Society; Breast Cancer 
Now; CLAN Cancer Support.
The Sir John Fisher Foundation (SJFF) is 
a charitable trust, which was established 
in 1979 by Sir John and Lady Fisher, 
and supports causes throughout 
the UK, with special regard to those 
based in and working for the benefit of 
people living in Barrow-in-Furness and 
the surrounding area. The Trustees of 
SJFF hold a significant shareholding in 
the Company and support charitable 
causes in relation to maritime, medical 
and disability, education, music, arts and 
community projects. In 2017 SJFF made 
grants or commitments to charitable 
causes of £2.0m (2016: £2.3m).

Corporate governance report
Introduction from the Chairman
I am pleased to present the 2017 Corporate governance 
report on behalf of the Board. The Board remains committed 
to high standards of corporate governance and to ensure 
that values and behaviours are consistent across the Group. 
This report, together with the Audit Committee, Nominations 
Committee and Directors’ remuneration reports, are intended 
to give shareholders a clear and meaningful explanation of 
how the Board and its Committees discharge their corporate 
governance responsibilities, and how the principles of good 
governance (as set out in the Financial Reporting Council’s UK 
Corporate Governance Code (April 2016) (the Code), which 
is the version of the Code which applies to the Company for 
2017), have been applied throughout the Group. A copy of the 
Code can be found at the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) 
website: https://www.frc.org.uk.
In addition to the Code, the Annual Report and Accounts 
have been drawn up and presented in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006, the Large and Medium-sized

2008 (as amended by the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013) and the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. The liabilities of 
the Directors in connection with this report are subject to the 
limitations and restrictions provided by such law.
I would encourage all shareholders to attend our AGM on 
3 May 2018 as it provides an excellent opportunity to meet the

Board and Committees operation of the Board
All Directors participate in discussing strategy, performance 
and financial and risk management of the Company. Strategy, 
acquisition and disposal of businesses and major capital 
investments are agreed between the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Group Finance Director prior to 
review and approval by the Board. Meetings of the Board are 
structured to allow open discussion.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, the Chairman 
ensures that all Directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information on all relevant matters in advance of the Board 
meetings, including comprehensive financial and business 
reports covering the Group’s principal activities. The Non-
Executive Directors regularly visit major business centres of 
the Group in order to enhance their knowledge including in 
relation to the services and products offered, which in turn 
acts to strengthen their contribution to Board debate. In 2017, 
visits included JFD and James Fisher Nuclear at their UK 
headquarters, and the Non-Executive Directors also received 
presentations from management on key strategic plans, 
including relating to individual businesses and markets.
During the year, the Board has considered a wide range of 
matters including safety, operations, corporate governance, 
strategy, forecasts and long-term objectives, acquisitions, 
financing, taxation, risk management, internal controls, 
the Group’s principal risks, management and succession 
planning and Board composition, as well as shareholder 
announcements. The Board has a regular programme of 
six meetings and a schedule which identifies matters to be 
discussed at each meeting. The January and July meetings 
are primarily focused on review of corporate governance 
matters. The other quarterly meetings each have a broad 
based business agenda, which covers the items noted above.
Committees
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to the 
following Board Committees:
• Audit Committee;
• Remuneration Committee; and
• Nominations Committee.
Each Committee is provided with sufficient resources to 
undertake their duties and has formal written terms of 
reference which are reviewed annually and available on the 
Company’s website.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, set 
out in writing, clearly defined, and approved by the Board. 
A.3 Chairman
The Chairman’s role is to lead the Board and to ensure the 
Board operates effectively in all aspects. The Chairman 
sets the Board’s agenda and ensures that adequate time 
is available for discussion of all agenda items, in particular 
strategic issues. On his appointment in August 2012, the 
Board considered Charles Rice to be independent in character 
and judgement in accordance with the Code.
The Board has considered and is satisfied that the role of 
Chairman operates effectively.
A.4 Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer’s role is to have the day-to-day 
responsibility for running the Group, including leadership of 
senior management in executing the Company’s strategy 
and managing the operational requirements of the Group’s 
businesses. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 31
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
The Board has considered and is satisfied that the role of 
Chief Executive Officer operates effectively.
A.5 Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers that the Non-Executive Directors 
combine broad business and commercial experience to 
bring independent and objective judgement to bear, and to 
challenge constructively the Executive Directors on issues of 
strategy, performance, resource and standards of conduct. 
The balance between Non-Executive and Executive Directors 
enables the Board to provide clear and effective leadership 
and to maintain the highest standards of integrity across the 
Group’s business activities.
Each Non-Executive Director is expected to commit 
sufficient time to allow for attendance at Board and 
Committee meetings and for keeping in touch with the senior 
management team, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Malcolm Paul, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
also acts as a sounding board for the Chairman and as an 
intermediary for Non-Executive Directors where necessary. 
During the year, there were no unresolved concerns regarding 
the running of the Company.
During the year, Charles Rice met with the Non-Executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors present on more 
than one occasion and Malcolm Paul, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, met with the other Non-Executive 
Directors without the Chairman present on more than one 
occasion.
B. Board Effectiveness
B.1 Composition of the Board 
For further information on the composition of the Board, 
please refer to the Nominations Committee report on 
pages 38 to 39.
B.2 Appointments to the Board
Appointments to the Board are overseen by the Nominations 
Committee. Please refer to the Nominations Committee report 
on pages 38 to 39.
B.3 Commitment
Following the Board evaluation process, detailed further 
below, the Board is satisfied that each of the Directors is able 
to devote sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.
Contracts and letters of appointment with Directors are made 
available at the AGM or on request. Executive Directors are 
encouraged to take up non-executive positions in other 
companies or organisations, provided such appointments 
are approved by the Board, which considers, amongst other 
things, the time commitment required. The details of current 
external appointments are set out in the biographies of the 
Board of Directors on pages 26 to 27.
B.4 Development
On appointment, new Directors are given a detailed 
induction to the Group’s business, together with an on-
going programme of visits to the Group’s major sites and 
meetings with senior management. On-going training and 
development for Directors is available as appropriate and is 
reviewed and agreed with the Chairman annually. The Board is 
confident that all its members have the knowledge, ability and 
experience to perform the functions required of a director of a 
listed company.
B.5 Information and support
All members of the Board are supplied with appropriate, 
clear and accurate information in a timely manner covering 
matters which are to be considered at forthcoming Board or 
Committee meetings.
Should Directors judge it necessary to seek independent 
legal advice about the performance of their duties with 
the Company, they are entitled to do so at the Company’s 
expense. Directors also have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all governance matters and for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed, and applicable 
rules and regulations are complied with. The Company 
Secretary also advises the Directors on any important changes 
in legislation, regulation and best practice. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter requiring 
Board approval. In 2017, the Board approved the appointment 
of Jim Marsh as Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary in succession to Michael Hoggan. 
B.6 Evaluation
At the end of each year, the Board undertakes an 
annual evaluation of its own performance and that of the 
Remuneration, Nominations and Audit Committees and of 
each individual Director against the framework of Board 
effectiveness produced by the FRC. The Board determined 
that an external facilitation of the annual review of performance 
was not necessary this year, as it would be undertaken next 
year as part of the 2018 annual review, being 3 years since the 
last external facilitation.
The 2017 performance evaluations were designed to assist 
the Board in identifying strengths and weaknesses and areas 
for further improving performance and required each Director 
to complete in confidence a detailed questionnaire relating to 
key aspects of Board performance, and performance of the 
Board’s principal Committees. The review included an analysis 
of the Board’s and Committees’ performance in key areas  32
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
including corporate governance, structure and procedures, 
strategy and its effectiveness, risk management and control 
and communications with stakeholders. The results of the 
evaluation were collated by the Company Secretary and 
reported to the Board via the Chairman with recommendations 
for further consideration and action as appropriate.
The 2017 review concluded that the Board functions well as a 
unit and provides a good balance of support and challenge to 
management.
The annual review of individual Directors’ performance was 
conducted internally. The Chairman’s performance was 
reviewed by the other Non-Executive Directors led by the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and taking into 
account the views of the Executive Directors. The performance 
of the Executive Directors was reviewed by the Non-Executive 
Directors with the Chairman in attendance. The Chairman and 
the Executive Directors reviewed the performance of each 
of the other Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers 
that each Director continues to contribute and demonstrate 
commitment to the role.
B.7 Re-election
For further information on the Company’s compliance with the 
Code provisions relating to the re-election of Directors, please 
refer to the Directors’ report on pages 54 to 57.
C. Accountability
C.1 Financial and business reporting
The Board considers that the Annual Report and Accounts 
taken as a whole present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy. In making this 
assessment, the Board took into account its own knowledge 
of the Group, the markets in which the Group operates, its 
strategy and performance in the year, a detailed review of 
the content of the Annual Report and Accounts and other 
periodic financial statements and announcements, together 
with the recommendation of the Audit Committee. Key 
considerations included ensuring that there was consistency 
between the accounts and the narrative provided in the front 
half of the Annual Report, and there was an appropriate 
balance between the reporting of weaknesses, difficulties 
and challenges, as well as successes, in an open and honest 
manner.
The going concern assessment and the viability statement are 
set out in the Directors’ report on pages 56 and 57; and the 
Strategic report on pages 8 and 9 sets out an explanation of 
the Company’s business model and the strategy for delivering 
the Company’s objectives.
C.2 Risk management and internal controls
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for ensuring that the Company maintains 
sound risk management and internal control procedures.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee monitors the 
Group’s risk management and internal control process and 
reviews its effectiveness on an on-going basis. This is part 
of an established process, in accordance with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting 
published in September 2014, for the identification, evaluation 
and management of the significant risks facing the Group, 
which operates and is reviewed continually throughout the 
year. The Group’s internal control systems are designed 
to provide the Board with reasonable assurance as to the 
effective and efficient operation of the Group and to ensure 
the quality of internal and external reporting and compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations. However, there are 
inherent limitations in any system of internal control and 
accordingly even the most effective system can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. Details of those principal risks and the Group’s 
approach to mitigating them are set out in the Strategic report 
on pages 19 to 21.
As part of its internal control procedures, the Group has a 
whistleblowing policy which encourages employees to report 
in good faith any genuine suspicions of fraud, bribery or 
malpractice in order to identify any problems within the Group 
at an early stage. The policy is designed to ensure that any 
employee who raises a genuine concern is protected. Any 
concerns can be raised in the first instance with the Company 
Secretary in confidence.
The Board is committed to ensuring the highest standards in 
all of the Group’s business dealings and condemns corruption 
in all its forms. The Group has a formal anti-bribery and 
corruption statement and policy and does not tolerate or 
condone corruption or bribery in any of the Group’s business 
dealings. This policy has been implemented throughout 
the Group and is supported by a group-wide training and 
awareness programme and regular compliance reviews. This 
policy is reviewed annually by the Board and is available on 
the Group’s website.
The Board has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of 
modern slavery and is committed to acting in an ethical manner 
and with integrity and transparency in our Group’s business 
dealings. The Group has a formal slavery and human trafficking 
statement which outlines the steps taken by the Group to 
ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place

within any part of the Group’s business or within the Group’s 
supply chains, which is available on the Group’s website.
C.3 Audit Committee and auditor
For further information on the Company’s compliance with 
the Code provisions relating to the Audit Committee and the 
Company’s auditor, please refer to the Audit Committee report 
on pages 34 to 37.
D. Remuneration
For further information on the Company’s compliance with 
the Code provisions relating to the level and components of 
remuneration and remuneration procedure, please refer to the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 40 to 53.
E. Relations with shareholders
The Company communicates with shareholders through the 
Annual Report and Accounts, Half Year Report, preliminary 
announcements, interim management statements, investor 
days and the Company website. The Board takes the 
opportunity at the AGM to meet and communicate with private 
and institutional shareholders and welcomes their involvement. 
In addition, the Company invites regular direct communication 
with its shareholders as part of the Company’s investor 
relations programme.
Non-attributable feedback on the investor presentations given 
by the Company to shareholders is circulated to the Board. 
The Chairman periodically consults with major shareholders in 
order to develop a balanced understanding of any issues and 
concerns and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
is available to attend meetings with major shareholders if 
requested. In addition if at any meetings of the Executive 
Directors with investors a governance or strategy matter is 
raised, it is relayed back to the Board.
The Board is therefore of the view that appropriate steps have 
been taken to ensure all Board members, in particular the 
Non-Executive Directors, develop an understanding of the 
views of the major shareholders.
The Dorothy May White comes into service
In April 2017, Workington Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) volunteers welcomed their new state-of-the-art Shannon 
class lifeboat. The charity’s new £2m lifeboat was part-funded by a substantial donation in 2016 from The Sir John Fisher 
Foundation. 
The Shannon class lifeboat is the first modern RNLI all-weather lifeboat to be powered by water jets and not propellers. It is 
capable of 25 knots which is 50% faster than the lifeboats it replaces and is the most agile lifeboat in the RNLI’s fleet.
At a ceremony in June 2017, the vessel was named in memory of Dorothy May White, who gave a generous legacy to the RNLI, and 
was formally handed over to RNLI Workington by Rowland Hart Jackson (a trustee of the Sir John Fisher Foundation).
Since coming into service, it has already been called out a number of times, including on the morning of 16 September 2017, 
when it was called out to assist in the rescue of a lone kayaker who had capsized in choppy seas five miles west of St Bees 
Head.  34
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Audit Committee report
Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of 
the Audit Committee
I am pleased to introduce the report of the Audit Committee 
for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Committee and the work it performs is of fundamental 
importance to the Board in discharging its responsibility 
for oversight and monitoring of financial reporting, risk 
management and internal control. I have been chairman of 
the Committee since 2012 and it is my responsibility to ensure 
that the Committee fulfils its responsibilities in a rigorous and 
effective manner. The Committee’s agenda is designed, in 
conjunction with the Board’s, to ensure that all significant 
areas of risk are covered and to enable it to provide timely 
input to Board deliberations.
In line with the Code, this report seeks to focus on specific 
aspects considered by the Committee during the year and 
aims to provide assurance to you, our shareholders, that the 
control environment of the Group is being properly supervised 
and monitored.
I am satisfied that the Committee is properly constituted with 
written terms of reference, which include all matters referred 
to in the Code and is provided with good quality information to 
allow proper consideration to be given to topics under review. 
I am also satisfied that meetings are scheduled to allow 
sufficient time for discussion and to ensure that all matters are 
considered fully. The Committee’s terms of reference, which 
are available on our website, were updated in January 2018 
in accordance with the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees, 
April 2016.
Of particular importance is the requirement to ensure 
that the Group’s financial reporting is fair, balanced and 
understandable. We therefore review all the Group’s financial 
reports before publication, including where necessary 
alternative performance measures, with this responsibility 
at the forefront of our minds, and we are satisfied that they 
provide a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of 
the Group’s position and performance.
This year the Committee has continued to focus on reviewing 
the Group’s systems of risk management and internal 
controls, as well as ensuring the integrity of the Group’s public 
financial reporting. Whilst we do not believe that the UK’s 
future departure from the EU will have a material impact on the 
Group we keep this matter under constant review. In addition 
we have reviewed and endorsed the Group’s approach to tax 
transparency in all the regions of the world in which the Group 
operates.
The Group has previously accounted for long-term contracts 
by estimating the percentage stage of completion based on 
costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract 
costs. For the last 24 months our finance team, led by our 
Group Finance Director Stuart Kilpatrick, has been considering 
the impact of IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition – Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers, effective 1 January 2018, which 
focuses on when control over the goods or services passes 
to the customer. Through a series of conferences and working 
parties in association with our auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG), key 
issues have been identified, analysis undertaken and regular 
reports made to the Committee. Specific details of our work in 
this regard are set out below.
IFRS 16, which becomes effective from 1 January 2019, 
will in due course impact on the Group accounts. This new 
standard will bring operating leases onto the Group’s balance 
sheet for the first time as an asset to be depreciated and a 
corresponding liability against which future lease payments will 
be set. Work is currently underway to establish full details of the 
leases that will most affect the Group which broadly fall into two 
categories; bareboat vessel leases, where the Group charters or 
hires a vessel with no crew or provisions included as part of the 
agreement; and rented property leases.
The Committee operates in an open manner, has clear and 
concise channels of communication with the Board and, should 
it be necessary, I would be available to meet with investors.
Malcolm Paul
Chairman of the Audit Committee 35
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
Audit Committee composition
The Committee is chaired by Malcolm Paul and consists 
exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors whose 
biographical details are set out on page 27. The Board is 
satisfied that Malcolm Paul, a chartered accountant who 
was formerly finance director of a FTSE 250 company, has 
significant recent and relevant financial experience. The other 
members throughout the year were Aedamar Comiskey, 
David Moorhouse and Michael Salter. Following the Board 
changes announced on 18 January 2018 Justin Atkinson, 
an independent non-executive director and a chartered 
accountant, joined the Committee on 1 February 2018 with 
the intention of becoming chairman of the Audit Committee 
with effect from the conclusion of the AGM on 3 May 2018. 
The members of the Committee collectively have broad 
financial, commercial, professional and technical experience 
and as a whole are considered to have competence relevant 
to the sectors in which the Group operates. Committee 
attendance is shown on page 30.
The Committee had three scheduled meetings during the 
year in February, August and November on dates to coincide 
with the financial reporting cycle. The Group Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Group Finance Director, the Company 
Secretary, the internal auditor and senior members of the 
finance team attend each meeting by invitation together with 
representatives of the auditor, including the reporting partner. 
At each scheduled meeting the Committee provides the 
opportunity to discuss matters privately with the auditor and 
the internal auditor. In addition, the chairman of the Committee 
holds regular meetings with the KPMG audit reporting partner  
to discuss matters related to the Group. The KPMG audit 
partner for the Group rotated during 2017 from David Bills 
to Mike Barradell following the audit tender process which 
was completed in 2016. Details of the Committee’s specific 
responsibilities and how it exercises those responsibilities 
are set out in the remainder of this report. The Board and the 
members of the Committee separately review the performance 
of the Audit Committee each year and are satisfied that 
the Committee discharges its duties and responsibilities in 
accordance with its terms of reference.
Main responsibilities of the Committee
The Audit Committee’s main duties and responsibilities are to:
•  monitor the integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
including a review of the significant financial reporting 
judgements contained therein;
•  assess the independence and objectivity of the auditor 
and make recommendations to the Board for the auditor’s 
appointment, re-appointment and removal;
•  approve the auditor’s remuneration including non-audit 
fees, terms of engagement and provision of non-audit 
services;
•  review the Group’s internal financial controls and systems 
for risk management and internal control;
•  monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function;
•  monitor the Company’s policies for handling allegations 
from whistleblowers; and 
•  hold a broad remit to review and comment upon market 
communications including public announcements and 
analysts’ presentations.
Financial reporting
The Committee’s primary responsibility in relation to the 
Group’s financial reporting is to review and challenge where 
necessary, with both senior management and the auditor, the 
appropriateness of the Group’s Interim Statement and Annual 
Report and Accounts with particular focus on:
•  whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted 
and properly applied;
•  the clarity of disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements;
•  whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements in material areas or where there has been 
discussion with or issues raised by the auditor; and
•  whether the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy.
To facilitate its financial reporting responsibility the Committee 
received reports from the Company’s auditor, KPMG, at each 
of the scheduled Committee meetings. The first meeting in 
February 2017 considered the accounting, financial control 
and audit issues reported by the auditors that flowed from 
their audit work and reviewed the financial statements and 
specific disclosures, including the viability and going concern 
statements, for recommendation to the Board. In addition to 
standard agenda items, the February meeting also received 
evaluations of the external and internal audit process and 
reviewed the procedures and outputs for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of risk. The August meeting 
received a review by the auditor of the Half Year results 
and considered the accounting, financial control and audit 
issues arising to enable the Committee to review the Interim 
Statement and recommend it to the Board. The November 
meeting reviewed the planning memorandum for the annual 
audit, including proposed scope and key risks, together with 
an indication of the proposed audit fee, which was subject to 
subsequent agreement. In addition, the meeting considered 
a detailed report from internal audit on their work for the year 
and approved the internal audit programme for 2018. 36
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Integrity of financial reporting
The Committee has a primary responsibility to review the 
integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts and the Interim 
Statement of the Company, which includes the review and 
discussion of papers prepared by management and takes 
account of the views of the auditor. The key areas reviewed in 
the 2017 financial year are set out below.
IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition – Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers
The introduction of IFRS 15 with effect from 1 January 2018 
will change the basis for revenue recognition from a stage 
of completion of a contract to the delivery against identified 
performance obligations.
The main revenue streams within the Group are goods and 
services, rental income and construction contracts and for 
the most part revenue is recognised at the point in time when 
the performance obligation is met. Long-term contracts, often 
spanning a financial year end, are also a feature of some of our 
business segments, most noticeably in Specialist Technical 
and Marine Support. In these situations, revenue is to be 
recognised over time having regard to performance obligations 
identified from the contract.
The Committee received reports on a number of contracts, 
including the Indian submarine rescue contract, the Galloper 
wind  farm project, the decommissioning of the core nuclear 
reactor at Winfrith, Dorset and the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle 
initiative. The Committee critically examined the recognition of 
revenue and profit on these significant long-term projects to 
ensure both were recognised in the correct accounting period 
and that judgements made by management were reasonable 
and in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15.
Where appropriate, matters arising were discussed with senior 
management and KPMG in their capacity as auditors, and the 
Committee concluded that the financial statements recognised 
revenue and profits in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy.
Goodwill valuation
The Committee considered the Group’s carrying value 
of goodwill and impairment reviews based on underlying 
assumptions, including where appropriate the impact of 
changes in oil and gas prices, together with the achievability of 
long-term forecasts and the discount rates applied to forecast 
cash flows. Senior management provided detailed analysis 
to determine the sensitivity of the outcome to changes in key 
assumptions and we are satisfied that the judgements made 
are both reasonable and appropriate.
Acquisition accounting
The level of judgement involved in determining acquisition 
fair values and the valuation of acquired intangible assets 
is a potential risk to the Group. The Committee considered 
the fair value and accounting policy adjustments made to 
each acquisition and assessments in respect of contingent 
consideration provisions. These were discussed separately 
with the Group Finance Director and the auditor, and the 
Committee concluded that acquisitions had been accounted 
for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Operations in overseas jurisdictions with 
uncertain legislation
Due to the diverse nature of the territories in which the 
Group operates often with local partners, there is an inherent 
commercial and financial risk arising from operating in 
these locations. This is particularly prominent in the Group’s 
operations in emerging markets, due to a potentially more 
uncertain legislative, political and regulatory environment. The 
Committee received regular updates on the operational and 
financial performance of the Group’s business operations in 
these territories together with the assessment of areas where 
specific judgements have been necessary.
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set out 
above was adequately addressed by the Executive Directors 
and senior management, appropriately tested and reviewed 
by the auditor, and the judgements and disclosures made 
in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts and 2017 Interim 
Statement were appropriate.
Going concern
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the going 
concern assumption in preparing the financial statements. This 
included a review of papers prepared by senior management 
in relation to the Group’s internal budgets, forecasts of 
future performance, available financing facilities and facility 
headroom. Taking account of possible changes that may 
impact trading performance and other factors that might affect 
availability, we expect the Group to maintain the necessary 
headroom under its borrowing facilities for the forthcoming 
year. We are satisfied that the going concern basis of 
preparation continues to be appropriate in preparing the 
financial statements.
Viability statement
The Committee reviewed the Company’s viability statement 
set out on pages 56 and 57 and in particular took care to 
understand the analysis which was prepared by management 
and supports the Board’s view that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period assessed.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED 37
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
Risk management and internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of these systems and the Group’s internal audit 
function. We received regular reports throughout the year 
from the Group Risk Committee and we have reviewed the 
Group’s systems of risk management and internal controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls, and 
have concluded that the systems are sound and effective. 
Reports on whistleblowing complaints and material internal 
control failings are referred to the Committee for review and 
oversight to ensure that appropriate and timely actions are 
identified and completed. During 2016 and 2017 there were 
no whistleblowing reports or material instances of internal 
control failure brought to the attention of the Committee. 
The responsibilities and processes for risk management are 
described in more detail on page 19.
External audit performance
The Committee continually assesses the performance of the 
auditor, KPMG, from the initial planning stage when they receive 
and discuss the audit plan and proposed strategy, approach, 
objectives, significant risk areas and other areas of focus, 
drawing on input from the Group’s senior management, until 
conclusion of the audit. The Committee conducts annually a 
formal assessment of the auditor’s performance based on its 
own experience and that of the Group’s senior management. 
This process includes the use of questionnaires which focus 
on the quality and ability of the audit teams, the robustness 
of the audit process and the quality of communication and 
governance, including the independence of the audit firm. 
The results of the review are considered by the Committee 
and discussed with the auditor who provides input on the 
preparedness of the Group’s own finance teams and the 
conclusions are reported to and discussed by the Board.
For the 2017 audit, the Committee considered that the 
performance of the auditor, including their interaction with the 
Company, senior management and the Committee, was good. 
The Committee was also satisfied that KPMG provided an 
effective audit and remain independent and objective.
Non-audit services
The Committee accepts that certain non-prohibited work 
is best undertaken by the auditor and to safeguard the 
auditor’s objectivity and independence the Committee has a 
long-standing policy on engagement of the auditor for non-
audit services, which the Committee reviews annually and 
recommends to the Board for approval. In accordance with EU 
Audit Regulations and standards published by the FRC in June 
2016, the Committee has not engaged the auditor on matters 
restricted by those Regulations and standards, and fees from 
permitted work have been pre-approved by the Committee. 
KPMG were not instructed to carry out any non-audit services 
during 2017.
Internal audit
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the work carried 
out by the internal audit department which considers, reviews 
and reports on key commercial, financial and control risks 
across the Group. The internal audit function is managed 
by an experienced professional assisted by senior financial 
managers from within the Group who undertake their work 
in accordance with an annual programme approved by 
the Committee. In addition, during 2017 we engaged the 
services of PricewaterhouseCoopers to support our internal 
audit resources particular at overseas offices. The scope 
of each internal audit review is agreed by the Committee in 
consultation with the internal auditor to ensure that key areas 
for each business are addressed.
In 2017, 25 internal audits were undertaken of which 17 were 
in the UK and 8 overseas (2016: 15). The internal audit reports 
were presented to the Committee for review and shared with 
senior managers for action, as well as being provided to the 
auditor for information. The internal auditor is responsible 
to the Committee for ensuring that all required actions are 
followed up and completed in a timely manner.
The effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function is 
continually reviewed and a formal review is undertaken 
annually by the Board and the Committee. Following the 
final 2017 review, the Committee recommended and the 
Board concluded that the Group’s internal audit process was 
appropriate and effective.

Nominations Committee report
Nominations Committee composition
The Committee reports to the Board and is chaired by Charles 
Rice with all other members being independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee members are Charles Rice, Malcolm 
Paul, Aedamar Comiskey, David Moorhouse and Michael 
Salter. Justin Atkinson joined the Committee on 1 February 
2018. The Committee had three meetings in 2017 and its work 
included reviewing the composition of the Board and succession 
planning. Committee attendance is shown on page 30.
Main responsibilities of the Committee
The Nominations Committee’s terms of reference, which are 
available on our website, were updated in January 2018. The 
main duties and responsibilities are:
•  to regularly review the structure, size and composition of 
the Board (including skills, knowledge, independence and 
experience) and recommend changes;
•  succession planning for Directors and senior executives of 
both the Company and the operating businesses; and
•  identifying and nominating for approval to the Board, 
candidates for Board positions.
Board composition and diversity
During 2017, there were seven Directors on the Board 
comprising the Non-Executive Chairman (who was considered 
independent on appointment), the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Group Finance Director and four independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The names and biographical details of the members 
of the Board are set out on pages 26 and 27. 
The Board functions effectively and efficiently and is considered 
to be of an appropriate size in view of the scale of the Group 
and the diversity of its businesses. The Board considers 
that each Director demonstrates the knowledge, ability and 
experience required to perform the functions of a director of 
the listed company and is of the calibre necessary to support 
and develop the Company’s long-term strategy and success. 
The Board further considers that no individual or small group 
of individuals dominates the Board’s decision-making.
The importance of diversity, including gender, in the Board’s 
composition is recognised and the Board has agreed a target 
of at least two female Board Directors by 31 December 2018. 
The Committee acknowledges however that diversity is not 
solely in relation to gender: ethnicity, age, educational and 
professional backgrounds are also important and diversity 
in senior management and across the entire workforce is 
supported and encouraged. The Group has a diversity policy 
with the purpose of ensuring that the Group benefits from a 
diverse workforce and has a working environment where all 
employees are encouraged to realise their full potential and 
where there is an open atmosphere of trust, honesty and 
respect. The diversity policy is available on the Group website 
as part of the Group policies document. More information 
about our employees, the Group’s employment policies, 
and the Group’s commitment to equal opportunities and 
diversity can be found in the Corporate responsibility report on 
pages 22 to 25 and the Directors’ report on pages 54 to 57.
Appointments to the Board and succession 
planning
The Committee leads the process for board appointments 
and makes recommendations to the Board. Appointments 
are made on merit, against objective criteria, with due regard 
to the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender. 
The Committee adopts a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board, 
working together with external advisors. The Committee 
continues to evaluate the balance of skills and experience on 
the Board and is satisfied that plans are in place for orderly 
succession for appointments to the Board to maintain that 
balance whilst ensuring progressive renewal of the Board. 39
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
In January 2018, I informed the Board of my decision to step 
down at the conclusion of the AGM to be held on 3 May 2018. 
This decision was made after receiving confirmation that the 
necessary steps for a smooth transition were in place. Those 
steps included:
•  Non-Executive Director – the Nominations Committee 
sought the assistance of Korn Ferry to lead the search 
for a new Non-Executive Director to join the Board. Korn 
Ferry is an external search consultancy that has no other 
connection with the Company. Following the search 
and interview process, the Nominations Committee 
subsequently recommended Justin Atkinson to join 
the Board and, following the Board’s approval, Justin 
was appointed with effect from 1 February 2018. Since 
that date he has also become a member of the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees. Justin 
was formerly Chief Executive Officer of Keller Group plc 
between April 2004 and May 2015, having previously held 
the position of Group Finance Director and Chief Operating 
Officer. Justin trained and qualified as an accountant and 
spent the early part of his career with Reuters plc. It is 
intended that Justin will be appointed as chairman of the 
Audit Committee with effect from the conclusion of the 
AGM, subject to his election by shareholders at the AGM.
•  Non-Executive Chairman – the Nominations Committee 
considered a list of potential external candidates for the 
Chairman role provided by Korn Ferry, but concluded 
that, given the availability of a strong internal candidate in 
the current Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
Malcolm Paul, and the suitability of Justin Atkinson to chair 
the Audit Committee, it would recommend the internal 
candidate. Malcolm will transition to the role of Non-
Executive Chairman with effect from the conclusion of the

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual statement
Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee
On behalf of the Board, and the Remuneration Committee, 
which I will chair up until the conclusion of the AGM on 3 May 
2018, I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration 
report for the year ended 31 December 2017.
This report is comprised of two parts, namely:
•  Remuneration policy report – which provides a 
summary of the remuneration policy for which shareholder 
approval was originally obtained at the 2015 AGM and 
which will need to be resubmitted for shareholder approval 
at the AGM. No material changes are being proposed, 
other than a change to shareholding guidelines and the 
introduction of a post-vesting holding period on future 
long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards. In addition, 
a change to the pension policy is being proposed, 
whereby the Committee will aim to offer reduced pension 
contributions, as a percentage of salary, for new executive 
appointments to the Board; and
•  Annual report on remuneration – which sets out 
payments and awards made to the Directors and details 
the link between Company performance and remuneration 
for 2017, and how the remuneration policy will operate for 
2018.
Accordingly, at our AGM there will be two remuneration-related 
resolutions presented: (i) the normal annual advisory vote on 
our Directors’ remuneration report; and (ii) the vote to approve 
our new Directors’ remuneration policy, which will apply to all 
payments to be made to Directors from the AGM and which 
(unless altered with shareholders’ approval) will apply for a 
period of three years.
Pay and performance in 2017
James Fisher delivered a good performance in 2017. The key 
performance measures for the 2017 financial year were as 
follows:
• Underlying profit before tax £50.3m (2016: £45.8m); and
• Underlying diluted earnings per share 81.4p (2016: 76.3p).
Each year the performance of the Executive Directors is 
assessed against a range of financial and personal objectives 
which are aligned with the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
and objectives. By incentivising and rewarding performance 
that delivers our objectives we ensure that pay is tied to 
performance and value delivered to shareholders.
The Executive Directors’ potential maximum level of bonus 
in 2017 was 100% of base salary, with 70% based on 
meeting the Group’s financial objectives and 30% based on 
individual achievement and personal objectives. The Group’s 
financial targets for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
substantially achieved and therefore 82.5% of this element 
of bonus was awarded. The Remuneration Committee 
concluded that personal objectives were met. As a result, 
a combined bonus of 87.75% of base salary was approved for 
Nick Henry and for Stuart Kilpatrick, of which the first 70% will 
be paid in cash and the balance of 17.75% will be settled in 
shares, to be deferred for three years.
Awards under the LTIP granted in 2015 will vest on 6 April 
2018 at a currently estimated 15.4% of the maximum, with the 
earnings per share performance targets over the three years to 
31 December 2017 (70% of awards) not having been achieved 
and an estimated 51.2% vesting against the total shareholder 
return (TSR) targets measured over the three years from 
6 April 2015 (30% of awards). This is an indicative LTIP vesting 
result based on an estimate of TSR as at 7 February 2018. 
The final vesting result will be determined based on the actual 
TSR on 5 April 2018. 41

Further detail of the targets and achievement against them 
is set out in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 45 
and 53.
Shareholder feedback
The Company continues to engage and communicate with 
shareholders regarding the Company’s remuneration policy 
and the Committee considers all feedback received as 
part of its policy review process. Major shareholders and 
representative bodies were consulted at the start of 2018 in 
respect of the proposed changes to the remuneration policy 
to be put forward at the AGM and all major shareholders were 
supportive.
Remuneration policy for 2018
Executive remuneration consists of a base salary, pension 
contribution, benefit provision and, subject to performance 
conditions, an annual bonus plan, part paid in cash and part 
deferred into shares, and shares awarded under an LTIP . 
Incentive pay is subject to clawback and malus provisions 
and, post-vesting, Executive Directors are required to retain 
50% of the net of tax shares awarded until they have satisfied 
the Company’s share ownership guidelines.  
The Committee considers that the remuneration policy 
remains appropriate and that it satisfies the Committee’s 
objective to operate a remuneration structure which 
successfully promotes the long-term success of the Group 
and fully aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with 
those of our shareholders.
The current remuneration policy was originally approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM and as the policy is nearing 
the end of its three year life, it will need to be resubmitted for 
shareholder approval at the AGM.
2018 remuneration
Annual pay awards across the Group are determined on a 
country and sectoral basis, to ensure that pay levels are fair 
and reflect local market and industry conditions. Individual 
merit awards are made where appropriate. Average salary 
awards across our UK businesses therefore ranged between 
0.7% and 3.8% for 2018.  With effect from 1 January 2018, 
Nick Henry’s base salary was increased by 10% to £492,000 
reflecting a number of changes to the size and complexity 
of his role and personal performance. Further details on the 
rationale behind the increase are set out in the implementation 
of the remuneration policy for 2018 section of the Annual 
report on remuneration.  Stuart Kilpatrick’s base salary was 
increased by 3.3% to £310,000 which is consistent with the 
guidelines applied to the general workforce this year.
All other elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages are proposed to remain unchanged. The annual 
bonus maximum opportunity and LTIP awards will be 100% and 
125% of base salary respectively. 70% of the annual bonus will 
be determined by adjusted profit before tax targets and 30% 
on personal measures, with the LTIP awards being determined 
as to 70% by earnings per share targets and 30% by TSR.
Details of a number of adjustments to Non-Executive Director 
fee levels and the remuneration agreed by the Remuneration 
Committee (excluding myself) for my role as Chairman from 
the AGM are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
I hope you will join me in supporting the resolutions in respect 
of this year’s Directors’ remuneration report at the AGM on 
3 May 2018. As I move to the role of Non-Executive Chairman, 
I will be stepping down from my role as chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. It is intended that Aedamar Comiskey 
will take up the role of chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
with effect from the AGM and I wish her well in that role.

JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Remuneration policy report
Overview of Directors’ remuneration policy
James Fisher and Sons plc operates in a competitive 
international environment. To continue to compete 
successfully, the Committee considers that it is essential that 
the level of remuneration and benefits achieves the objective of 
attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the necessary 
high calibre of individuals at all levels of the business. 
The Company therefore sets out to provide competitive 
remuneration to all of its employees, appropriate to the 
business environment in those countries in which it operates.
The remuneration strategy is designed not only to align 
with the Company’s fundamental values of fairness, 
competitiveness and equity, but also to support the 
Company’s corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to 
competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure with a timely pay review process, 
consistently applied to all employees, with links to corporate 
performance is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can 
associate with, and are focused on, the attainment of the 
Company’s strategic goals. Accordingly the remuneration 
package for the Executive Directors is normally reviewed 
annually. Where an Executive Director’s responsibilities change 
during the course of a year, the Committee will consider 
whether a review is appropriate, outside of the annual process.
Executive remuneration reviews are based upon the following 
principles:
•  total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reflect 
the competitive market in which the Company operates, 
and to provide a fair and attractive remuneration package;
•  reward elements should be designed to reinforce the 
link between performance and reward. The majority of 
the total remuneration package should be linked to the 
achievement of appropriate performance targets; and
•  Executive Directors’ incentives should be aligned with the 
interests of shareholders. This is achieved through setting 
performance targets to reward increase in shareholder 
value and through the Committee’s policy to encourage 
shareholding by Executive Directors.
How the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
policy relates to the wider Group
The remuneration policy set out within this report provides 
an overview of the structure that operates for the senior 
executives in the Group. Employees below executive level 
have a lower proportion of their total remuneration made up 
of incentive-based remuneration, with remuneration driven 
by market comparators and the impact of the role of the 
employee in question. Long-term incentives are reserved for 
those judged as having the greatest potential to influence the 
Group’s earnings growth and share price performance. While 
the Remuneration Committee considers pay and conditions 
across the workforce when reviewing and setting the 
Executive Director remuneration policy, the Committee does 
not consult with employees on this matter at the current time.
How shareholders’ views are taken into 
account
The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views 
on our remuneration policy and is mindful of the views of 
shareholders and other stakeholders. Major shareholders and 
representative bodies were consulted at the start of 2018 in 
respect of the proposed changes to the remuneration policy 
to be put forward at the AGM and all major shareholders were 
supportive.
Directors’ remuneration policy
The table below summarises the components of reward for 
Executive Directors of James Fisher and Sons plc that will 
be put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM. The 
main changes from the remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM are as follows:
•  an increase in the share ownership guidelines from 100% 
to 200% of salary for all Executive Directors;
•  the introduction of a post-vesting holding period for all LTIP 
awards granted to Executive Directors following the AGM; 
and
•  while the maximum pension provision will remain at 
15% of salary for the existing Executive Directors, the 
Remuneration Committee will aim to reduce pension 
provision, as a percentage of salary, for new joiners to 
the Board where possible. The level of provision for new 
Directors will be subject to negotiation at the time of the 
appointment, having regard to the pensions applicable to 
the other senior management within the Group.
Any commitments made by the Company prior to the approval 
and implementation of the new policy which were consistent 
with the policy in force at the time, can be honoured, even if 
they would not be consistent with the policy prevailing when 
the commitment is fulfilled.

JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Notes:
(1)  The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the 
annual bonus reflect the Committee’s belief that any incentive 
compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to the 
delivery of both financial and personal objectives;
(2)  TSR and EPS performance conditions are selected by the 
Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the 
delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Group’s 
financial growth, and are consistent with the Company’s objective 
of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders. 
The TSR performance condition is monitored by an independent 
advisor whilst EPS growth is derived from the audited financial 
statements;
(3)  The Committee operates its share plans in accordance with the 
plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent 
with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas 
relating to the operation and administration of the plans (e.g. 
treatment of awards for leavers, change of control, adjustments to 
performance targets);
(4)  Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee arrangement 
does not have performance conditions; and
(5)  In approving the Directors’ remuneration policy, authority is given 
to the Company to honour any past commitments entered into 
with current or former Directors including the vesting of share 
awards granted in the past.
Malus and clawback provisions
Malus and clawback provisions operate in respect of the 
annual bonus (cash and deferred shares) and LTIP awards, 
with Committee discretion to apply them in the event of 
(i) misstatement of results; (ii) an error in determining the share 
award; or (iii) gross misconduct.  The Committee may decide 
to operate the malus and clawback provisions within a three 
year period commencing on the date that the cash part of 
any annual bonus is paid (for cash and deferred share bonus 
awards), and within a three year period of any LTIP vesting date.
Potential value of 2018 remuneration package 
for Executive Directors
In illustrating potential reward opportunities the following 
assumptions have been made:
(1)  Minimum performance is based on fixed pay only 
(comprising basic salary and pension from 1 January 2018 
and the estimated value of benefits for 2018);
(2)  Target performance is based on fixed pay plus 50% of 
the maximum values used for the Company’s incentive 
arrangements;
(3)  Maximum performance is based on: (a) a maximum annual 
bonus of 100% of base salary; and (b) an LTIP award of 
125% of basic salary (presented at face value); and
4)  No share price appreciation or dividend reinvestment has 
been assumed. 
Approach to recruitment
New Executive Directors will be appointed on remuneration 
packages with the same structure and elements set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration policy table. On-going incentive pay 
will be limited to:
• Maximum annual bonus of 100% of salary;
• Up to 200% of salary LTIP award; and
• Participation in the Sharesave.
For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional 
cash or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive 
pay forfeited by an executive when leaving a previous 
employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these 
awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of 
vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments as soon 
as practicable following the appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay 
out according to its original terms. In addition, any other on-
going remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment 
may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for 
approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and 
incidental expenses as appropriate.
Loss of office
The Committee has considered remuneration for Executive 
Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying a 
consistent and equitable approach to ensure the Company is 
equitable but pays no more than necessary. The loss of office 
policy is in line with market practice and will be dependent on 
whether deemed a ‘good leaver’ or ‘bad leaver’. The ‘good 
leaver’ policy includes:
•  payment in lieu of notice equal to one year’s basic salary 
or, if termination is part way through the notice period, the

amount of salary relating to any unexpired notice to the 
date of termination. There is an obligation on Directors to 
mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the Company 
terminates their service contract;
•  bonus payments for the period worked may be made, 
subject to the original performance targets, at the 
discretion of the Committee. Any such payments would be 
made on the normal payment date;
•  vesting of share scheme awards is not automatic and the 
Committee retains the discretion to prevent awards from 
lapsing depending on the circumstances of the departure 
and the best interests of the Company. For a ‘good leaver’: 
(i) deferred bonus awards will normally vest in full at the 
normal vesting date (although may vest earlier, including 
at cessation); and (ii) LTIP awards will normally vest at the 
normal vesting date (although may vest earlier, including at 
cessation) subject to performance against the performance 
targets and LTIP awards will normally be pro-rated. ‘Good 
leaver’ reasons are death, injury, illness or disability, 
redundancy, retirement, transfer of business resulting in 
cessation of the individual’s employment within the Group 
and any other reason at the Committee’s discretion. No 
compensation is paid for summary dismissal, save for any 
statutory entitlements; and
•  Executive Directors will also be entitled to a payment 
in respect of accrued but untaken annual holiday 
entitlements on termination.
Service contracts
It is the Board’s policy that Executive Directors are employed 
on contracts subject to no more than 12 months’ notice from 
either side. The Board recognises however that it may be 
necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer 
an initial longer notice period, which would subsequently 
reduce to 12 months after the expiry of the initial period. The 
service agreements do not have a fixed term. If it becomes 
necessary to consider termination of a service contract, the 
Committee will have regard to all the circumstances of the 
case, including mitigation, when determining any 
compensation to be paid. Details of the current service 
contracts are as follows:
Contract date Notice period
Nick Henry 1 December 2006 12 months
Stuart Kilpatrick 1 July 2010 12 months
The Executive Directors are permitted to serve as non-executive 
directors of other companies, provided the appointment 
is first approved by the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees. Directors are allowed to retain their fees from such 
appointments. During the period, Nick Henry joined the Board 
of Britannia’s Gold Limited as a Non-Executive Director and the 
Executive Directors held no other appointments.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but 
have a letter of appointment setting out their terms and 
conditions. Non-Executive Directors are appointed each year 
for up to 12 months and are entitled to one month’s prior 
written notice of early termination for which no compensation 
is payable. Details of the letters are set out below:
Date of appointment Letter of appointment
Charles Rice 1 April 2004 1 January 2018
Malcolm Paul 1 February 2011 1 January 2018

David Moorhouse 1 August 2013 1 January 2018
Michael Salter 1 August 2013 1 January 2018
Chairman
Fifty per cent of the fee paid to Charles Rice, net of 
deductions, is used to buy ordinary shares in the Company 
and these shares must be held throughout his period in office. 
The shares are purchased in accordance with a trading plan 
agreed with Investec Bank plc dated 7 March 2013.  In the 
interests of simplicity going forward, Malcolm Paul’s fee will be 
paid fully in cash from appointment, following this undertaking 
to increase his shareholding to a total in excess of £200,000.
Annual report on remuneration
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Malcolm Paul 
during 2017. The Committee also comprised three other 
independent Non-Executive Directors: Aedamar Comiskey, 
David Moorhouse and Michael Salter.  Subject to Malcolm Paul’ s 
appointment as Chairman at the AGM it is intended that Aedamar 
Comiskey will take on the role as chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee immediately following conclusion of the AGM.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest 
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. They 
have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships 
with the Executive Directors, nor from being involved in the 
day-to-day business of the Company.
The Committee operates under clear written terms of 
reference and confirms that its constitution and operation 
comply with the applicable provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code prevailing at the date this report is signed in 
relation to Directors’ remuneration policy and practice and that 
it has applied the Code throughout the year. The Committee’s 
terms of reference include:
•  to determine and agree with the Board the framework and 
policy for Executive Directors and senior managers;
•  to review the appropriateness and relevance of the 
remuneration policy;
•  to agree the measures and targets for any performance  46
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
related bonus and share schemes of the Executive 
Directors; and
•  to determine within the terms of the policy the total 
individual remuneration package of the Executive Directors.
The Committee met three times during the year and details of 
attendance at Committee meetings are set out on page 30.
During the year the Committee has considered the 
appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy, 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages, including 
base salaries, the grant of share-based incentive awards, 
the vesting of share-based incentive awards subject to 
performance conditions being met, and the amount and basis 
of performance related bonuses. Charles Rice also attended 
Committee meetings, when invited by the chairman of the 
Committee, and was consulted on matters relating to the 
Executive Directors who reported to him.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In undertaking its responsibilities, the Committee seeks 
independent external advice as necessary. T o this end, FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT) replaced New Bridge 
Street as the principal external advisers to the Committee 
during the financial year. The Committee is comfortable that 
the FIT team provide independent remuneration advice to the 
Committee and do not have any other connections with James 
Fisher and Sons plc that may impair their independence. FIT is 
a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for 
Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at 
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. During the year, FIT 
provided independent advice on a wide range of remuneration 
matters including the Remuneration policy review and the Board 
changes. FIT provides no other services to the Company. The 
fees paid to FIT in respect of work carried out for the year under 
review were £5,000.  Fees paid in year to New Bridge Street 
were £10,500.
Non-Executive Directors
For 2018, the Non-Executive Directors’ fees are set out below.
Reflecting Malcolm Paul’s proposed appointment as Chairman from the AGM, the fees payable to him as combined Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director and chairman of the Remuneration Committee have been separated going forwards.

on performance to 31 December 2016) were estimates last year, using a share price of £16.11 (the 3 month average share price to 31 December 2016). The actual pre-tax value of these awards, based on a share 
price (calculated in accordance with HMRC guidance) of £16.27 at vesting on 6 April 2017, was £158,291 for Nick Henry and £106,162 for Stuart Kilpatrick.
(2)  The ESOS values for 2016 (vesting in April 2017 based on performance to 31 December 2016) were also estimates using a share price of £16.11 (the 3 month average share price to 31 December 2016). Based 
on TSR performance to 31 December 2016, 44.7% of awards were expected to vest. 25% of awards actually vested on 10 April 2017. The intrinsic pre-tax value of these awards, based on a closing share price 
of £16.21 at vesting was £15,423 for Nick Henry and £10,343 for Stuart Kilpatrick.

Annual bonus awards for 2017
The maximum annual bonus for Executive Directors was 100% of base salary, with 70% based on financial objectives and 30% 
based on individual achievement and personal objectives. Details of the actual performance against the targets are as follows:
(i) Financial objectives
(ii) Personal objectives
The headline objectives set for Nick Henry were to set, 
communicate and lead key management priorities; to deliver 
balanced growth via organic development and acquisitions; 
to develop management structure including succession 
planning; and to monitor and manage Group risk profile. 
The headline objectives set for Stuart Kilpatrick were to 
lead financial reporting to shareholders and management 
to improve risk management and internal audit process; to 
manage M&A process and due diligence; and to develop and 
maintain good relationships with investors, banks advisers and 
auditors. Alongside the headline objectives noted above, each 
Executive Director is given specific objectives for the year. In 
2017, in addition to certain commercially sensitive items which 
are not disclosed, these included: for Nick Henry: high focus 
on health and safety and Group risk profile; development 
priorities in JFD, renewables, subsea; certain acquisition 
prospects; and management structure adjustments; and 
for Stuart Kilpatrick: development of accounting and legal 
teams; strengthen internal audit function; manage the Group’s 
acquisition process effectively. Both Executive Directors were 
assessed to have performed well against these objectives and 
to have achieved a good overall result for the year, leading the 
Committee to award 100% of the personal objectives element 
of the bonus.
70% of the bonus award is payable in cash while any bonus in 
excess of 70% of salary will be awarded in deferred shares in 
line with the remuneration policy.
Vesting of 2015 LTIP awards
The LTIP values included in the table below relate to awards 
granted on 5 June 2015 which vest on 6 April 2018 dependent 
on EPS and TSR performance. EPS is measured over the three 
year period ended 31 December 2017 while TSR is measured 
over the three year period from 6 April 2015. Therefore the figures 
set out below for the LTIP vesting result are indicative, based on a 
recent estimate of TSR.
Under the EPS performance target (70% of awards) which uses a 
sliding scale, 25% of this part of an award vests where growth in 
underlying diluted earnings per share of RPI plus 9% is achieved 
over the three year performance period, increasing pro-rata to full 
vesting where growth of RPI plus 18% is achieved. 48

Under the TSR performance target, 25% of this award vests for median TSR increasing pro rata to full vesting for upper quartile 
TSR, measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts. The estimated three year performance 
based on TSR calculations up to 7 February 2018 is as follows:
As a result of not meeting the EPS performance target and based on the indicative TSR performance it is estimated that vesting 
of 51.2% of the TSR performance target will be achieved, the gross value of LTIP share awards that would vest on 6 April 2018 
would be as follows:
Vesting of the 2017 LTIP award is subject to achievement of 
performance targets over a three year period with 70% of the 
award based on EPS targets and 30% based on TSR targets. 
EPS target performance is measured over the three year 
period ending on 31 December 2019. The EPS element of the 
award vests if EPS growth at least equals the RPI increase 
over the period plus 9%. At the threshold level, 25% of the 
EPS element of the award will vest. Full vesting is achieved 
if EPS growth is greater than or equal to 18% in excess of 
the RPI increase over the vesting period. The TSR element 
of the award is subject to the Company’s TSR performance 
relative to the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts, 
over the three year period from 6 April 2017. If at the end of 
the period the Company ranks in the upper quartile, all of the 
TSR element of the award will vest. If the ranking is at median 
level, 25% of TSR element of the award will vest. No element 
of the TSR part of the award will vest for performance below 
the median. For intermediate ranking, a proportionate part of 
each award will vest reducing on a straight-line basis. Any part 
of the award that does not vest at the end of a performance 
period will lapse immediately.
(1) The performance element represents the face value of awards that are currently expected to vest on 6 April 2018.
(2) The share appreciation element represents the value due to the change in share price from the date of award to 31 December 2017.
(3)  The share price at date of grant is based on a five day average immediately prior to the date of grant, and the share price at 31 December 2017 is based on a 
three month average.

Sourcing of shares and dilution
The Remuneration Committee has regard to the limits on 
dilution advised by the Investment Association and contained 
in the relevant share plan rules and reviews the number of 
shares committed and headroom available under share 
incentive schemes in accordance with these dilution limits.
On vesting, the awards of shares under the LTIP are 
satisfied by the shares held by the James Fisher and Sons 
plc Employee Share Trust (Trust). During the year the Trust 
purchased 71,243 ordinary shares on the open market (2016: 
38,823) and at 31 December 2017 the Trust held 27,620 
(2016: 45,368) ordinary shares.

Implementation of the remuneration policy for 
2018
Following consultation with major shareholders, Nick Henry’s 
2018 base salary was increased by 10% to £492,000 
reflecting changes to the size and complexity of his role. Nick 
Henry’s responsibilities as CEO increased significantly in 2012 
following the retirement of the then Executive Chairman, and 
the subsequent appointment of a Non-Executive Chairman. 
While Nick Henry received an increase in base salary at 
the time to reflect his new responsibilities, the level of the 
remuneration was designed to reflect a period of transition of 
the Chair from Executive to Non-Executive. Five years after 
the handover, that transitional period is at an end and, over 
the same period, despite the well-publicised decline in oil and 
gas markets: 
•  the performance of the Company in terms of both revenue 
and profit has increased significantly;
• the Group’s market capitalisation has almost doubled;
•  new offices have been opened in Asia Pacific, Africa and 
South America; and
•  many new initiatives, for example in the renewable and 
defence markets, have been put into action. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 53
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
The Remuneration Committee therefore felt that the increase 
was fair and reasonable.
Stuart Kilpatrick’s base salary was increased by 3.3% to 
£310,000 which is consistent with the guidelines applied to 
the general workforce this year.
Malcolm Paul’s fee as Chairman from the AGM (as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee in his absence), will be set 
at £200,000 p.a. (compared to Charles Rice’s current fee of 
£237,450).
The maximum bonus opportunity continues to be set at 100% 
of base salary. The proposed financial target levels have been 
set to be challenging and appropriately demanding. 70% of 
the annual bonus will be determined by adjusted profit before 
tax targets and 30% by personal objectives. The targets are 
commercially sensitive but it is envisaged that disclosure of the 
targets and performance against targets will be set out in the 
2018 Directors’ remuneration report.
Awards under the 2015 LTIP will be granted to the Executive 
Directors over shares worth 125% of base salary with 70% 
of the award based on EPS growth targets and 30% based 
on relative TSR targets. The performance period for the EPS 
element of the award will run for three years from 1 January 
2018 with 25% of the EPS element of the award vesting for 
EPS growth at least equal to the RPI increase over the period 
plus 9% rising on a straight-line basis to maximum vesting 
for EPS growth greater than or equal to 18% in excess of the 
RPI increase over the vesting period. For the TSR element 
(measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding 
investment trusts), the performance period will be three years 
from 6 April 2018 with full vesting if the Company ranks in the 
upper quartile and 25% of the TSR element vesting for ranking 
median with straight-line vesting in between.

fixed cumulative dividend of 3.5% per annum, payable in 
priority to any dividend on the ordinary shares and payable half 
yearly in arrears on 30 June and 31 December. The holders 
of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as 
declared from time to time by the Directors.

to existing shares, any share may be issued with such rights 
or restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution 
determine, or if the Company has not so determined, as the 
Directors may determine. Other than those specific provisions 
set out in the Articles, there are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the Company or on the exercise of voting 
rights attached to them except that:
•  certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by 
laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws and 
market requirements relating to close periods); and
•  pursuant to the Listing Rules, whereby certain employees 
of the Company require the approval of the Company to 
deal in the Company’s shares.

to the Directors’ shareholdings;
(2)  No Director has an interest in the preference shares of the Company, or in the 
shares of any subsidiary or associated undertaking; and
(3)  The Directors’ interests stated above include any shares held by their 
connected persons. 
Powers of Directors
The powers of the Directors are determined by the Company’s 
Articles, the Companies Act 2006 and the directions given by 
the Company in general meeting. The Directors will be seeking 
to renew the authorities granted to them in prior years at the 
forthcoming AGM. The Directors are authorised to issue and 
allot ordinary shares, to disapply statutory pre-emption rights 
and to make market purchases of the Company’s shares. Any 
shares purchased may be cancelled or held as treasury shares. 
Appointment, retirement and re-election of 
Directors
A Director may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the 
shareholders in general meeting following nomination by the 
Board or a member (or members) entitled to vote at such meeting, 
or following retirement by rotation if the Director chooses to seek 
re-election at a general meeting. In addition, the Directors may 
appoint a Director to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director, 
provided that the individual retires or is elected at the next 
AGM. A Director may be removed by the Company in certain 
circumstances set out in the Articles (for example bankruptcy 
or resignation), or by an ordinary resolution of the Company in 
general meeting. The Articles provide that any Director who has 
held office for more than three years since his last appointment 
must offer himself or herself up for re-election at the AGM and 
that at least one-third of the Board is subject to re-election at 
each AGM. Charles Rice is standing down from the Board at 
the AGM and therefore will not be seeking re-election. Justin 
Atkinson and Fergus Graham have been appointed to the 
Board since the last AGM and are therefore seeking election 
at the forthcoming AGM. With respect to the other Directors, 
having regard to the recommendation contained in the Code that 
all Directors should be subject to annual election by shareholders 
they will all retire at the AGM and stand for re-election. 56
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
The Company maintains an appropriate level of directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance whereby the Directors and officers 
of the Company and its subsidiaries are indemnified against 
liability to third parties and, to the extent permitted by section 
236 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors may be granted 
indemnity by the Company pursuant to the Company’s Articles. 
Directors’ conflict of interest 
Under the Companies Act 2006, a director must avoid a 
situation where a direct or indirect conflict of interest may 
occur. The Board has adopted established procedures to 
address the management of any potential and actual conflicts 
of interest. A review of conflicts which have been authorised 
has been undertaken by the Board, which concluded that any 
conflicts had been appropriately authorised, no circumstances 
existed which would necessitate that any prior authorisation 
be revoked or amended, and the authorisation process 
continued to operate effectively. 
Additional information for shareholders
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution at a 
general meeting of the shareholders.
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, certain 
information has been included in the Corporate responsibility 
report on pages 22 to 25, which would otherwise be required 
to be disclosed in the Directors’ report. These are as follows:
- Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
- Employment of disabled persons
- Employee involvement
No political or charitable donations were made during the year. 
Details of branches of Group subsidiaries can be found on 
pages 107 to 109.
Significant agreements – change of control 
The Company is a guarantor of all of the Group’s bilateral bank 
facilities which upon a change of control could be withdrawn.
The Singapore Submarine Rescue Service Agreement 
made between James Fisher Singapore PTE Ltd. and First 
Response Marine PTE Ltd. dated 17 October 2008 may 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company or James 
Fisher Singapore PTE Ltd.
The rules of the Company’s LTIP , ESOS and Sharesave 
schemes set out the consequences of a change of control on 
the rights of participants under those schemes. Participants 
are generally able to exercise their options on a change of 
control, provided that the relevant performance conditions 
have been satisfied.
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that arise in the event of a change of 
control of the Company.
Financial instruments
Information on the Group’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies, along with its exposure to price risk, 
credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk can be found in 
note 26 on page 90. 
Information required by UK listing rule 9.8.4
There are no disclosures to be made under listing rule 9.8.4.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, the financial position of the 
Group and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out in the Strategic report on pages 19 to 21. The 
Group’s primary sources of funding are bilateral facilities with a 
core group of banks. These bilateral facilities totalled £225m at 
31 December 2017 (2016: £175m). Compliance with banking 
covenants is tested half yearly for the ratio of net debt: 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(Ebitda), interest cover and fixed charge cover. No breaches in 
covenants occurred during the year.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through operating cash flows, with borrowings in place to 
fund acquisitions and capital expenditure. The Group had 
£71.8m (2016: £49.7m) of undrawn committed facilities as at 
31 December 2017. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonable changes in trading performance, 
confirm that the Group should be able to operate within the 
level of its current banking facilities.
The Group uses cash flow forecasts derived from budgets, 
forecasts and medium-term planning to identify headroom 
under the covenant tests. After making enquiries and 
having evaluated the on-going trading of the businesses, 
the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue to operate for a period 
considered to be at least 12 months from the date of this 
report. Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the Group’s viability over a three 
year period ending 31 December 2020.
The Directors have determined that this is most relevant time 
period because it is consistent with the Group’s planning 
process whereby the Board reviews the Group’s strategy and 
its detailed three year plan. This is reviewed and considered 
in light of the Group’s current position and prospects together 
with factors that might affect the three year plan. The Board 
carefully assesses the performance and prospects of each 
business regarding entering new markets and geographies, 
current and expected growth rates, prospective new projects 
and the timing of such projects and the robustness of 
individual business performance.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED 57
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
The Group’s three year plan overlays a number of assumptions 
and sensitivities which are reviewed by the Board; this 
includes a review of whether additional bank facilities will be 
required and available in the plan period.
The review also includes a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group as set out on pages 20 and 21, and the 
potential impact on its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity over the period. The potential 
consequence of Brexit and continued global economic 
uncertainty and the Group’s ability to mitigate the impact of 
any of these risks continued to be considered in 2017.
The Directors have also taken account of the diverse markets 
and geographies in which the Group’s businesses operate, 
and their ability to react quickly to change, to help minimise 
the effect of the principal risks affecting the Group.
Based on their assessment of the Group’s prospects and 
viability, the Directors confirm they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue to operate 
and to meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for the period to 31 
December 2020.
Disclosure of information to the Auditor
Each Director in office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
report confirms that:
•  so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors is unaware; and
•  he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company financial statements each 
financial year in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS standards as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant and reliable;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS standards as adopted by the EU;
•  assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and
•  use the going concern basis of accounting unless they 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statement that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement in respect 
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•  the Strategic report and the Directors’ report include 
a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

Chief Executive Officer Group Finance Director
On behalf of the Board of Directors 
26 February 2018 58
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
1 Our opinion is unmodified  
We have audited the financial statements of James Fisher 
and Sons plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 December 
2017 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Company Statement of Changes in Equity and the related 
notes, including the accounting policies in note 31.  
In our opinion:  
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended;  
•  the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•  the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable 
law.  Our responsibilities are described below.  We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient 
and appropriate basis for our opinion.  Our audit opinion is 
consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.  
We were appointed as auditor by the Directors on 30 June 
2008.  The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 
10 financial years ended 31 December 2017.  We have fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent 
of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public 
interest entities.  No non-audit services prohibited by that 
standard were provided.  
2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.  We 
summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order 
of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, 
together with our key audit procedures to address those 
matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results 
from those procedures.  These matters were addressed, 
and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  
Revenue from construction contracts £81.7m 
(2016: 91.5m), Risk vs 2016: 
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee report), page 103 
(accounting policy) and page 72 (financial disclosures).
The risk: Complex accounting
The contractual arrangements that underpin the measurement 
and recognition of revenue by the Group can be complex, 
with significant judgements involved in the assessment of 
current and future financial performance. In particular, where 
Independent auditor’s report to the  
members of James Fisher and Sons plc 59
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
services rendered are provided through long-term contracts 
and are not completed at the balance sheet date and output 
measures cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised 
in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction 
measured by reference to either an output measure, such as 
deliverables completed or an input measure, such as physical 
progress, attributable man hours and costs incurred measured 
against the expected outcome. The stage of completion is 
estimated by the Group and includes certain judgements as 
contracts may run over a number of accounting periods and 
include forecasts in relation to future costs including labour 
and materials which are not yet known.
Our response: Our audit procedures included:
1.  Methodology choice: assessing whether the revenue 
recognition methodology applied was consistent with 
accounting standards.
2.  Sampling: selecting the contracts for substantive 
audit procedures based on qualitative factors, such 
as commercial complexity and life of contract, and 
quantitative factors, such as financial significance and 
profitability that we considered to be indicative of risk. 
3.  Input assessment: agreeing, for the sample above, 
observable inputs used in the calculations of costs 
incurred, such as direct costs, labour charges and 
document delivery records to source data, including 
customer acceptance acts and countersigned 
agreements, including testing the allocation of costs 
incurred to contracts.
4.  Accounting analysis: assessing, for the sample above, 
whether the judgements made by management over the 
stage of completion and estimates over cost to complete, 
including specific output measures and costs incurred, are 
consistent with our understanding of contract activities and 
performance, including considering contract losses and 
recoverability of revenue relating to variation orders in light 
of managements historical experience on similar contracts.
5.  Assessing transparency: assessing the appropriateness 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of revenue from 
construction contracts.
Our results: We found revenue recognition from construction 
contracts acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Recoverability of Group intangible assets, £199.2m 
(2016: £180.5m) and Parent Company investment in 
subsidiaries, £409.2m (2016: £363.0m) 2016: Risk vs 2016: 
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee report), page 101 
(accounting policy) and page 76 (financial disclosures).
The risk: Forecast based valuation
Goodwill and intangible assets in the Group and Parent 
Company investment in subsidiaries are the most 
quantitatively significant items on the Group and Parent 
Company balance sheet respectively, and their recoverability 
is subjective due to the inherent uncertainty involved in 
forecasting and discounting future cash flows.
This is considered to be one of the areas that had the greatest 
effect on our overall Group and Parent Company audits due 
to their materiality in the context of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements and due to the inherent 
significant judgements involved in the impairment test.
Our response: Our audit procedures included:
1.  Historical comparisons: assessing the reasonableness 
of the budgets by considering the historical accuracy of 
previous forecasts.
2.  Our sector experience: assessing whether assumptions 
used, in particular those relating to forecast revenue 
growth, profit margins and maintenance capital 
expenditure, reflect our knowledge of the business and 
industry, including known or probable changes in the 
business environment.
3.  Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the key inputs 
used in the impairment test, in particular discount rates, 
by comparing them to externally derived data, including 
available sources for comparable companies.
4.  Sensitivity analysis: performing breakeven analysis on 
the key assumptions noted above.
5.  Accounting analysis: challenging the Group’s 
assessment of the recoverability of capitalised 
development costs by assessing the technical feasibility 
and future profitability of the related assets, including 
comparing the management’s judgements to our 
understanding of project progress and performance to 
date obtained from our other audit procedures.
6.  Assessing transparency: assessing whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the impairment test appropriately 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of intangible 
assets and investments in subsidiaries.  
Our results: We found the resulting estimate of the 
recoverable amount of Group intangible assets and Parent 
Company investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.
Group operations in overseas jurisdictions with 
uncertain legislation, Risk vs 2016: 
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee report), page 62 
(accounting policies) and page 105 (financial disclosures).
The risk: Omitted exposures
The Group is multinational and has operations in a number 
of developing markets. Operating in these territories presents 
increased operational and financial risks due to the need to 
comply with potentially uncertain regulatory and legislative 
environments, including legislation relating to tax. Breaches 
of compliance or inappropriate assumptions over provisioning  60
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
for the uncertain legislation could have a significant effect 
on the results and financial position of the Group and is one 
of the judgemental areas our audit is focused on.  Further, 
during 2015 the principal customer of one of the Group’s 
overseas subsidiaries terminated its contract, whilst settlement 
was reached in 2017 with the customer, uncertainty remains 
around the timing and value of any potential residual 
exposures with the local authorities.
Our response: Our audit procedures included:
1.  Inspection: considering the Group’s exposure to potential 
breaches of legislation by making appropriate enquiry 
of the Group in relation to compliance with laws and 
regulations and the existence and status of any significant 
legal matters. We inspected reports returned by overseas 
locations to identify actual and potential non-compliance 
with laws and regulations, both those specific to the 
Group’s business and those relating to the conduct of the 
business generally. Where significant or potential matters 
were identified we obtained confirmations from the Group’s 
legal counsel and legal representatives. 
2.  Input assessment: critically assessing the calculation 
of provisions and liabilities arising from any legal matters 
recognised by the Group by challenging management 
assumptions based on our knowledge and review of 
underlying correspondence and documentation, including 
formal confirmations and discussions with external and 
own lawyers, where relevant.
3.  Sector experience: using our own local specialists 
analysing and challenging the assumptions used to 
determine provisions for tax matters based on their 
knowledge and experience of local regulations and 
practices.
4.  Assessing transparency: assessing the appropriateness 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of provisions, 
including taxation, recognised and contingencies 
disclosed.
Our results: The results of our testing were satisfactory and 
we considered the liability recognized, and the contingency 
disclosures made, to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Valuation of the intangibles acquired in a business 
combination, £9.8m (2016: £0.5m) and contingent 
consideration, £12.8m (2016: £6.8m) Risk vs 2016:  
Refer to page 36 (Audit Committee report), page 101 
(accounting policies) and page 87 (financial disclosures)
The risk:  Subjective valuation
The Group acquired new businesses during the year on a 
consideration partly contingent on the future performance 
of the acquired businesses. The Group also has contingent 
considerations payable on acquisitions in the past, which are 
re-measured at the end of each year under the provisional 
acquisition accounting based on an estimated outturn of the 
future performance of the business. As there is a significant 
level of judgement involved in estimating the fair value of 
acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration, we 
consider this to be a significant audit risk. 
Our response: Our audit procedures included:
1.  Methodology choice: assessing, using our own valuation 
specialist, the results of the intangible asset valuation 
reports by checking that the valuations were in accordance 
with relevant accounting standards and acceptable 
valuation practice.
2.  Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the key inputs 
used in determining the valuation of intangible assets 
acquired, in particular, discount rates and comparable 
market transactions, by comparing them to externally 
derived data. 
3.  Our sector experience: assessing whether the 
assumptions used in calculating contingent consideration, 
in particular those relating to forecast revenue growth, 
contract performance and profit margins, reflect our 
knowledge of the business and industry, including 
assessing the results of the businesses since acquisition 
and historical accuracy of the previous forecasts. 
4.  Assessing transparency: assessing the appropriateness 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of fair value 
measurement of acquired net assets and contingent 
consideration payables.
Our results: We found the valuation of the acquired 
businesses and contingent consideration to be acceptable 
(2016: acceptable).
3 Our application of materiality and an 
overview of the scope of our audit  
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £2.2m (2016: £2.1m), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before tax of 49.0m (2016: 
£44.9m), of which it represents 4.5% (2016: 4.7%).
The materiality for the Parent Company financial statements 
as a whole was set at £0.7m (2016: £1.5m), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of gross assets of £438.5m (2016: 
£360.7m), of which it represents 0.2% (2016: 0.42%).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.1m (2016: 
£0.1m), in addition to other identified misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 188 (2016: 140) reporting components, 
we subjected 34 (2016: 40) to full scope audits for Group 
purposes.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED 61
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
We conducted reviews of financial information (including enquiry) at a further 12 (2016: 6) non-significant components to obtain 
further coverage. These components were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting 
purposes.  
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results:
The remaining 10% of total Group revenue, 14% of Group 
profit before tax and 11% of total Group assets is represented 
by 142 of reporting components, none of which individually 
represented more than 10% of any of total Group revenue, 
Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these 
residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated 
Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement within these.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to 
the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. 
The Group audit team approved the component materialities, 
which ranged from £0.1m to £1.0m (2016: £0.1m to £0.5m), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components. The work on 15 (2016: 22) of the 
48 (2016: 46) components was performed by component 
auditors and the rest, including the audit of the Parent 
Company, was performed by the Group audit team.
Telephone conferences were held with these component 
auditors at the locations which were not audited directly by the 
Group audit team. At these conferences, the findings reported 
to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and 
any further work required by the Group audit team was then

4 We have nothing to report on going concern  
We are required to report to you if:
•  we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ going concern statement on 
page 56 to the financial statements on the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt over the Group and 
Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; or  
•  the related statement under the Listing Rules set out 
on page 56 is materially inconsistent with our audit 
knowledge.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.

5 We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report  
The Directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements.  Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is materially misstated 
or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge.  Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.  
Strategic report and Directors’ report  
Based solely on our work on the other information:  
•  we have not identified material misstatements in the 
Strategic report and the Directors’ report; 
•  in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; 
and  
•  in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.   62
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
6 We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to report by 
exception  
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:  
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or  
•  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or  
•  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
7 Respective responsibilities  
Directors’ responsibilities  
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 57, 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.  
Auditor’s responsibilities   
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other 
irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in 
an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of the financial statements.  
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
Directors’ remuneration report  
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.  
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term 
viability  
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:  
•  the Directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on 
page 56 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity;  
•  the Principal risks and uncertainties disclosures describing 
these risks and explaining how they are being managed 
and mitigated; and  
•  the Directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they considered 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.  
Corporate governance disclosures  
We are required to report to you if:  
•  we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider that 
the annual report and financial statements taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or  
•  the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate governance 
statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules for our review.  
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED 63
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could 
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our sector experience, through 
discussion with the Directors and other management (as 
required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the 
Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly 
affect the financial statements including financial reporting 
(including related company legislation) and taxation legislation.  
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the related annual 
accounts items. 
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations 
in the specific areas of health and safety, anti-bribery, 
employment law, legislation in overseas territories and certain 
aspects of company legislation recognising the nature of the 
Group’s activities and its legal form.  With the exception of 
any known or possible non-compliance, and as required by 
auditing standards, our work in respect of these was limited to 
enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection 
of regulatory and legal correspondence. We considered the 
effect of any known or possible non-compliance in these areas 
as part of our procedures on the related annual accounts 
items.  Further detail in respect of Group operations in 
overseas jurisdictions with uncertain legislation is set out in the 
key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.
We communicated identified laws and regulations 
throughout our team and remained alert to any indications 
of non-compliance throughout the audit.  This included 
communication from the Group to component audit teams 
of relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level, with 
a request to report on any indications of potential existence 
of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations 
(irregularities) in these areas, or other areas directly identified 
by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-
detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal controls.  
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom 
we owe our responsibilities  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
Notes to the financial statements
1 General information
James Fisher and Sons plc (the Company) is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its interest in associates and jointly 
controlled entities (together referred to as the Group), for the year ended 31 December 2017. The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The 
Company and consolidated financial statements were approved for publication by the Directors on 26 February 2018.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), adopted by the European 
Union (adopted IFRS). The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and on an historical cost basis, modified to include revaluation to fair value 
of certain financial instruments. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes for the holding company 
have not been presented in these financial statements. The profit after taxation in the Company was £54.2m (2016: £39.8m). The Group and Company financial 
statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m) except when otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements and those of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU as at 31 December 2017 and are 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
2 Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (non-GAAP)) performance measures which are not defined within IFRS. The 
Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and, as such, these measures are important and should be 
considered alongside the IFRS measures. The adjustments are separately disclosed and are usually items that are significant in size or non-recurring in nature. The 
following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report and Accounts.
2.1 Underlying operating profit and underlying profit before taxation
Underlying operating profit is defined as operating profit before amortisation or impairment of acquired intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to 
deferred consideration (together referred to as, ‘acquisition related income and expense’), the costs of a material restructuring, asset impairment or rationalisation of 
operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets and acquisition expenses are recurring in nature where 
business combinations are part of a group’s strategy. As acquisition expenses fluctuate with activity and to provide a better comparison to businesses that are not 
acquisitive, the Directors consider that both of these items should be separately disclosed to give a better understanding of operating performance. The Directors 
believe that the underlying operating profit is an important measure of the operational performance of the Group. Underlying profit before taxation is defined as 
underlying operating profit less net finance expense.
2.2 Underlying earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as the total of underlying profit before tax, less income tax, but excluding the tax impact on separately disclosed 
items included in the calculation of underlying profit less profit attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the year. The Directors believe that underlying EPS provides an important measure of the underlying earnings capability of the Group. Underlying 
earnings per share is set out in note 10.
2.3 Capital employed and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
Capital employed is defined as net assets less cash and short-term deposits and after adding back borrowings. Average capital employed is adjusted for the timing 
of businesses acquired and after adding back cumulative amortisation of customer relationships. Segmental ROCE is defined as the underlying operating profit, 
divided by average capital employed. The key performance indicator, Group post-tax ROCE, is defined as underlying operating profit, less notional tax, calculated by 
multiplying the effective tax rate by the underlying operating profit, divided by average capital employed.
2.4 Cash conversion
Cash conversion is defined as the ratio of operating cash flow to underlying operating profit. Operating cash flow comprises cash generated from operations plus 
dividends from joint venture undertakings.
2.5 Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda)
Underlying Ebitda is defined as the underlying operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
2.6 Underlying dividend cover
Underlying dividend cover is the ratio of underlying diluted earnings per share to the total dividend per share.

3 Segmental information 
For management reporting purposes, the Group has four operating segments reviewed by the Board: Marine Support, Specialist Technical, Offshore Oil and 
Tankships. These operating segments form the basis of the primary segmental disclosures below. Their principal activities are set out in the Strategic report 
on pages 10 to 13. 
The Board assess the performance of the segments based on underlying operating profit. The Board believes that such information is the most relevant 
in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities which operate within these industries. Inter-segmental sales are made using prices 
determined on an arms length basis. Sector assets exclude cash and short-term deposits and corporate assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to 
operating segments. Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations and corporate liabilities that cannot reasonably be allocated to 
operating liabilities.

Geographic information
Geographical revenue is determined by the location in which the product or service is provided. Where customers receive the product or service in one 
geographical location for use or shipment to another it is not practicable for the Group to identify this and the revenue is attributed to the location of the initial 
shipment. The geographical allocation of segmental assets and liabilities is determined by the location of the attributable business unit.

these activities are not subject to corporation tax. The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the rate applicable 
under UK corporation tax rules as follows:

The effective rate on profit before income tax from continuing operations is 16.9% (2016: 15.1%). The effective income tax rate on the underlying profit before tax is 
17.2% (2016: 15.4%). Over provision in previous years arose due to the timing in which certain transactions have been accounted for, rather than any correction.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had unrecognised tax losses of £10.2m (2016: £8.4m). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses due to 
the uncertainty relating to their future recovery.

10 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year, after excluding 27,620 (2016: 45,368) ordinary shares held by the James Fisher and Sons plc Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT), as treasury shares. Diluted 
earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that 
would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
At 31 December 2017, 105,840 options (2016: 112,108) were excluded from the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares calculation as their effect would be 
anti-dilutive. The average market value of the Company’s shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share options was based on quoted market prices for the 
period during which the options were outstanding.  76

Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units (CGU’s) of which there are 13 in total. 
The recoverable amount of these units has been assessed based on value in use calculations using cash projections based on 3 year plans approved by the Board 
together with projections derived from those plans for the following 2 years. A terminal value of cash flows beyond that date has been calculated at a growth rate in 
line with management’s long-term expectations for the relevant market. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations include gross margin, discount 
rate, inflation of overheads and payroll and growth rates. For presentation purposes the CGU’s are grouped into the appropriate division.
Growth estimates are based on the levels achieved in the current and historic periods adjusted for management expectations of the impact of management actions 
and the future development of the relevant market. Short-term growth rates for turnover are based on the 3 year plan. These growth rates vary depending on the 
market conditions in which the CGU operates. Direct costs are expected to increase in line with turnover.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 77
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
12 Goodwill continued
Discount rates applied to cash projections reflect management’s estimate of the return required from the business to reflect the cost of funds plus an appropriate 
risk premium. This has been determined with reference to the CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) adjusted for risks specific to each CGU’s cash flows. 
The range of pre-tax discount rates used was 6.1% to 7.1% (2016: 7.0% to 7.5%). Effective tax rates of between nil% and 30% (2016: 16.5%) depending on which 
jurisdiction the operations are forecast to take place in have been assumed as estimated long-term rates.
Based on the value in use calculations set out above no impairment of the goodwill of the CGU’s was identified.
Sensitivity to impairment
The Directors have carried out sensitivity analysis to determine the impact on the carrying value of goodwill of a change in discount rate, revenue growth and terminal 
value growth and identified that movements of 1% would not give rise to an impairment to goodwill in any of the CGUs.

21 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group and Company defined benefit pension scheme obligations relate to the James Fisher and Sons plc Pension Fund for Shore Staff (Shore staff),  the 
Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) and the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF).  The financial statements incorporate the latest full actuarial 
valuations of the schemes which have been updated to 31 December 2017 by qualified actuaries using assumptions set out in the table below.  The Group’s

21 Retirement benefit obligations continued
Shore staff
The assets of this scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered account and do not include any of the Group’s assets. The scheme was closed to new 
members in October 2001 and closed to future accrual on 31 December 2010. The most recent actuarial valuation was as at 31 July 2016. It is valued every three 
years following which deficit contributions and the repayment period are subject to agreement between the Company and the Trustees. Estimated contributions to 
this scheme in 2018 are £1.6m.
MNOPF
The MNOPF is an industry-wide pension scheme which is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme. It is valued every three years and deficits have typically been 
funded over a ten year period. The most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2015 and no additional deficit funding was requested 
by the Trustees. The respective share of the Group and Company in the net retirement benefit obligation of the MNOPF are 3.2% (2016: 3.0%) and 1.6% (2016: 
1.4%) respectively. Disclosures relating to this scheme are based on these allocations. The liability recognised represents the discounted value of committed cash 
flows. Information supplied by the trustees of the MNOPF has been reviewed by the Company’s actuaries. The principal assumption in the review is the discount 
rate on the scheme’s liabilities which was 2.50% (2016: 2.75%). The disclosures below relate to the Group’s share of the assets and liabilities within the MNOPF. 
Estimated contributions to this scheme in 2018 are £1.9m.
MNRPF
The MNRPF is an industry-wide pension scheme. The most recent actuarial valuation of the MNRPF was at 31 March 2017 and the Group and Company have 
recognised a liability based on the discounted value of expected cash contributions. The share of the Group and the Company in the net retirement benefit 
obligation of the MNRPF are 2.46% and 0.89% respectively. The principal assumption in the MNRPF valuation is the discount rate on the scheme’s liabilities which 
was 2.50% (2016: 2.75%). Subject to any changes arising out of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2017, estimated contributions to this scheme in 2018 are 
£5.3m.
Actuarial assumptions
The schemes’ assets are stated at their market values on the respective balance sheet dates. The overall expected rates of return on assets reflect the risk-free rate 
of return plus an appropriate risk premium based on the nature of the relevant asset category. The principal assumptions used in updating the latest valuations for 
each of the schemes were:
2017 2016
Inflation (%) 3.15 3.25
Rate of increase of pensions in payment – Shore staff (%) 3.05 3.10
Discount rate for scheme liabilities (%) 2.50 2.75
Expected rates of return on assets (%) 2.50 2.75
Post-retirement mortality: (years)
Shore staff scheme
Current pensioner at 65    male 20.9 21.1
Current pensioner at 65    female 22.7 23.1
Future pensioner at 65      male 21.9 22.7
Future pensioner at 65      female 24.0 24.9
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for the expected increase in longevity. The “current” disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity (in 
years) following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to a member who is currently 45 years old.

In determining the discount rate, assumptions have been made in relation to corporate bond yields and the expected term of liabilities. As noted above, a change in 
discount rate applied has a significant impact on the value of liabilities.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses relating to all schemes recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group’s and Company’s statement of 
comprehensive income is a loss of £50.3m (2016: £53.5m).
(g) Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. The pension charge for the year for these arrangements is equal to the contributions paid and was 
£3.7m (2016: £3.8m). During the year the Company contributed £0.3m (2016: £0.4m) into defined contribution schemes.
22 Share based payments
The Company operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) in respect of Executive Directors and certain senior employees and details of these are set out in the 
Director’s remuneration report on pages 40 to 53. The Company also operates a Sharesave scheme (Sharesave) for eligible employees which is HM Revenue and 
Customs approved.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Group recognises an expense for these benefits provided to employees and the amount charged in respect of equity-settled share based payments was £0.9m 
(Company £0.6m) (Group and Company 2016: £1.1m). The Company has granted conditional awards in the form of options over shares or conditional rights to have 
shares transferred to certain employees under the LTIP scheme over 377,100 (2016: 358,625) ordinary shares of 25p each.

Sharesave
All employees, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, may apply for share options under an employee Save As You Earn plan which may from 
time to time be offered by the Company. An individual’s participation is limited so that the aggregate price payable for shares under option at any time does not 
exceed the statutory limit. Options granted under the plans will normally be exercisable if the employee remains in employment and any other conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee have been satisfied. Options are normally exercisable at the end of the related savings contract but early exercise is permitted in certain 
limited circumstances. The performance period will not normally be less than three and a half years or greater than seven and a half years. Awards were made under 
this scheme on 12 April 2017.
23 Business combinations 
Year ended 31 December 2017 
On 22 March 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Rotos 360 Limited (Rotos 360) for an initial consideration of £1.5m in cash, with potential further 
consideration of up to £5.0m subject to profit targets for the three years ending 31 December 2019. Rotos 360 uses the latest technological innovation to provide 
solutions to the inspection, repair and reconditioning of wind farm rotor blades, primarily in the offshore environment and was established in 2013 as part of a UK 
Government funded research project to reduce the cost of operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines. The acquisition which joined the Marine Support 
division, provides the Group with market-leading capability in wind turbine blade repair, further broadening its offering in the growing offshore wind farm sector. 
On 6 December 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of EDS HV Group Limited (EDS) for an initial consideration of £9.0m in cash with potential further 
consideration of up to £5.6m subject to profit targets for the two years ending 30 September 2019. EDS, headquartered in Lancashire, provides a complete range 
of high voltage engineering services to the renewables industry, covering the design and installation stages of new wind farm construction projects through to the 
subsequent monitoring and fault management, repair and maintenance of the operating assets. The acquisition, which is in the Marine Support division, further 
broadens the Group’s offering to the offshore wind farm sector. As the acquisition of EDS was made in December 2017, the fair values disclosed below will be 
reassessed prior to the end of the next half year period.

Capital management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management policy is to maintain a strong credit rating and covenant ratios in order to be able to support the 
continued growth of its trading businesses and to increase shareholder value. The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through operating 
cash flows, with borrowings in place to fund acquisitions and capital expenditure. At 31 December 2017 the Group had £71.8m (2016: £49.7m) of undrawn 
committed facilities none of which expire within twelve months. 
The Group is required under the terms of its loan agreements to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to Ebitda and net interest costs to earnings 
before interest (Ebit). The Group met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 December 2017. The Directors have prepared forecasts of the cash flows for 
the subsequent eighteen-month period which indicate that, taking into account the factors noted above, the Group will meet its covenant requirements for this 
period. The total amount that it is able to borrow under existing revolving credit facilities is limited to a maximum of £200m (2016: £175m). 
The Group manages its capital structure so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide returns to shareholders that will support the 
future development of the business. Capital is monitored by measuring the gearing ratio which is net debt divided by capital. Net debt comprises interest bearing 
loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Capital represents net equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent. Return on capital employed 
is also monitored. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the expected growth in sustainable income streams after making provision for the retention of capital 
to invest in growth and acquisitions. In evaluating growth investment opportunities, the Group has a target of a 15% pre-tax return on the capital invested.

The Group has exposure to the following financial risks:
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. These arise 
principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and from cash balances held with financial institutions. The carrying amount of financial assets 
represents the maximum credit exposure. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced 
mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and the industry and country in which each customer operates. The Group has a number of large 
customers including Government agencies in the UK and overseas, major oil companies and other multinational corporations. The ten largest customers of 
the Group accounted for approximately 20% of Group revenue (2016: 24%). No customer accounted for more than 3% (2016: 4%) of Group revenue. New 
customers are subject to creditworthiness checks and credit limits are subject to approval by senior management. Goods are sold subject to retention of title 
clauses so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.

The Group considers that the trade receivables that have not been provided against and are past due by more than 30 days are still collectable based on 
historic payment behaviour and extensive analysis of underlying customers’ credit ratings. Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that, apart from 
the amounts included in the table above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables.
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its cash resources and borrowings 
to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due but in a manner designed to maximise the benefit of those resources whilst 
ensuring the security of investment resources. The Group forecasts the profile of its cash requirements on a monthly basis and ensures that sufficient facilities 
are available to meet peak requirements which occur at predictable times in the year. The Group manages the maturity profile of its borrowings by maintaining 
a regular dialogue with its lenders and ensuring that it commences the renegotiation of facilities sufficiently early to allow a comprehensive review of its 
requirements before completion.
The Group’s revolving credit facilities extend over several accounting periods and fall due for renewal in different accounting periods ensuring that the Group 
negotiations with individual lenders follow an orderly process which does not expose the Group to the possibility of a significant reduction in available facilities in 
any single period. At 31 December 2017, the Group had £71.8m (2016: £49.7m) of undrawn committed bank facilities. 92

(c) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks on sales, purchases, cash and borrowings denominated in currencies other than Sterling. These transactional 
exposures are mainly to movement in the US Dollar and the Euro. The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its transactional exposures. Most 
forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.  Forward exchange contracts which qualify as effective cash flow 
hedges are stated at fair value. The principal translation exposures relate to the Norwegian Kroner.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency transactional risk in its principal currencies was as follows based on notional amounts:

Changes in the level of exchange rates will have an impact on consolidated earnings. The following table shows the impact on earnings of a 5% strengthening in the 
exchange rate in the Group’s key currencies against Sterling. The obverse movements would be of the same magnitude. These amounts have been calculated by 
applying changes in exchange rates to the Group’s foreign currency profits and losses and to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency.

Preference shares 27 (0.1) (0.1) (0.1) (0.1)

Fair value has been determined by reference to the market value at the balance sheet date or by discounting the relevant cash flows using current interest 
rates for similar instruments. The fair value of the financial assets has been assessed by the Directors with reference to the current prospects of the 
investments and risks associated with those prospects.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group classifies fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making measurements of fair value. 
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
(a) Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
(b)  Level 2 –  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices); and
(c) Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

31 Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, are set out below.
31.1 Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control has passed. Control exists when the Company controls an 
investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investees and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the investee. Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting from the acquisition date, which is the date on which 
control is passed to the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, using consistent 
accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Payment for the future services from employees or former owners are expensed. Any payments to employees or former owners in respect of the acquisition 
of the business are capitalised. This is carefully managed during the acquisition process so that former owners and/or employees do not receive any incentive 
payments during an earn-out period.
Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control. These joint arrangements are in turn classified as:
•  Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities; and
•  Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Any investment in joint ventures is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus the Group’s post acquisition share in the change in net assets of the joint ventures, 
less any impairment provision. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the post-tax result of the joint ventures. The Group’s share of any changes 
recognised by the joint venture in other comprehensive income are also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement 
and in the consolidated statement of financial position. On the acquisition of non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the fair 
value of the share of net assets acquired is recognised in equity.  Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-
controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.

Company investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost. Income is recognised from these 
investments when its right to receive the dividend is established.
31.2 Foreign currency
Group
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared in their functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they 
operate. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into UK Sterling, which is the Group’s 
presentational currency. 
(i)  Foreign currency transactions in functional currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entities functional currency are initially recorded at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each 
subsequent balance sheet date:
(i)  Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and any exchange differences recognised in the income statement;
(ii)  Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated; and
(iii)  Non-monetary items measured at fair value are retranslated using exchange rates at the date the fair value was determined. Where a gain or loss is 
recognised directly in equity, any exchange component is also recognised in equity and conversely where a gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement, any exchange component is recognised in the income statement.
(ii) Net investment in foreign operations
 Exchange differences arising on monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings which are denominated in the 
functional currency of the subsidiary undertaking are taken directly to the translation reserve and subsequently recognised in the consolidated income statement on 
disposal of the net investment. Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to provide an effective hedge against Group 
equity investments in foreign currency are taken directly to the translation reserve.
(iii)   Translation from functional currency to presentational currency
The assets and liabilities of operations, where the functional currency is different from the Group’s presentational currency are translated at the period end exchange 
rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. All other exchange differences on transactions in foreign currencies 
are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences included in the reserve are also dealt with in the translation reserve.
Company
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on settlement of monetary items or on the retranslation of monetary 
items at rates different from those at which they were initially recognised are taken to the income statement.
All exchange differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement, other than investments in foreign operations and 
foreign currency borrowings used to hedge those investments, where exchange differences are taken to the translation reserve.
31.3 Financial instruments
(a) Loans and receivables
These comprise non-derivative financial assets such as trade receivables, with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are 
recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, if the time value of money has a significant impact on their value, less any impairment losses. Gains and losses are recognised in the 
income statement when the loans or receivables are derecognised, impaired or amortised.
If in a subsequent period the factors which indicated the original decision to impair the asset cease to exist, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed subject 
to the revised carrying value of the asset not exceeding its amortised cost at the date the impairment is reversed. Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement.
(b) Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are included as non-current assets unless intended to be disposed of within twelve months of the balance 
sheet date. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income until the 
investment is derecognised or deemed to be impaired, at which point the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement in the 
period in which it arises. Any impairment loss in respect of an available for sale asset is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement and any 
reversal of impairment loss is not recognised in the income statement.
Where investments are held in unlisted equity shares where there is no active market the investment is held at cost and is subject to an annual impairment review. 100

(c) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Assets are carried in the statement of financial 
position at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement unless designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures, primarily relating to the US Dollar, Euro and Norwegian Krone. It is also exposed 
to the risk of interest rate changes in its borrowings. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk, in the form of foreign currency contracts, to 
manage foreign exchange risk and interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Fair value is calculated by reference to current 
forward exchange contracts with similar maturity profiles, and for interest rate swaps determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. The 
recognition of the gains or losses arising on these movements in fair value depends on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge and if so, the nature of the item 
being hedged.
The Group recognises two classes of hedges for derivative financial instruments:
•  Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or recognised assets or liabilities (cash flow hedge); and
•  Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or an unrecognised firm commitment (fair value hedge).
(i) Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges can include forward foreign currency contracts if the instrument is related to a foreign currency risk of a firm commitment, it involves the 
same currency as the hedged item, and it reduces the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group’s operations.
Cash flow hedges may also include interest rate swaps where the instrument is related to a recognised asset or a liability and it changes the character of 
the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses arising on any portion deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the hedge relates to a firm commitment or forecast transaction which subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the cumulative 
gain or loss relating to that item is removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Otherwise, the cumulative amount is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the related movements on the hedged transaction.
When the term of the hedging instrument expires or it is sold, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss included in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until either the related forecast transaction occurs, in which case it is recognised in 
accordance with the policy stated above, or if the hedged transaction is not expected to take place, it is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(ii) Fair value hedges
Where a derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in the fair value of an asset or liability it is designated as a fair value hedge. Changes in the fair 
value of these derivatives are recorded in the income statement at the same time as the related movements in the hedged asset or liability.
(iii) Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings
All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, which represents the fair value of the consideration received net of any 
issue costs associated with other borrowings. Finance charges, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption of debt instruments including 
preference shares and the direct costs of issue, are accounted for on an amortised cost basis in the income statement. Charges are calculated using the 
effective interest method, and are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount. 
(iv) Other
Changes in the fair value of any derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting under any of the criteria outlined above are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The 
fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using assumptions based on market conditions at the balance sheet 
date or discounted cash flow techniques. 
(d) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits included in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less from the original acquisition date. Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement comprise cash and short-term deposits, net of 
bank overdrafts.
31.4 Intangible assets
Intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at cost or fair value less any provision for impairment. 
Intangible assets assessed as having finite lives are amortised over their estimated useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that they are impaired. Amortisation charges are on a straight-line basis and recognised in the income statement. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Development costs  5 years or over the expected period of product sales, if less
Intellectual property 3 to 20 years
Patents and licences  5 years or over the period of the licence, if less
Other intangibles 5 years

JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
31 Significant accounting policies continued
(a) Goodwill arising on a business combination
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration over the aggregate fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses.
Costs related to an acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities incurred in connection with a business combination, are 
expensed to the income statement. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that it may be impaired. When an impairment loss is recognised it is not reversed in a subsequent accounting period, even if the circumstances which led to 
the impairment cease to exist.
(b) Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination including but not limited to customer relationships, supplier lists, patents and technology 
and that can be separately measured at fair value on a reliable basis are recorded initially at fair value and amortised over their expected useful life. Amortisation is 
expensed to the consolidated income statement.
31.5 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment losses. Refit costs relating to vessels are capitalised 
when incurred and amortised over their estimated useful economic life of 30 months. Cost comprises expenditure incurred during construction, delivery and 
modification. Where a substantial period of time is required to bring an asset into use, attributable finance costs are capitalised and included in the cost of the 
relevant asset. 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual value in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives, as 
follows:
Freehold property  40 years
Leasehold improvements  25 years or the period of the lease, if shorter
Plant and equipment  Between 5 and 20 years
Vessels    Between 10 and 25 years
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.
Residual values of vessels are set initially at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which the Directors believe to be an approximation of current residual 
values. Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the Directors and adjusted if appropriate to reflect the relevant market conditions and 
expectations, obsolescence and normal wear and tear.
31.6 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired. If any indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable 
amount of the asset is made which is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. These calculations are determined for an 
individual asset unless that asset does not generate cash inflows independently from other assets, in which case its value is determined as part of that group of 
assets. To assess the value in use, estimated future cash flows relating to the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
(a) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated against the appropriate combination of business units deemed to obtain advantage from the benefits 
acquired with the goodwill. These are designated as cash generating units (CGU). Impairment is then assessed by comparing the recoverable amount of the 
relevant CGU with the carrying value of the CGU’s goodwill. Recoverable amount is measured as the higher of the CGU’s fair value less cost to sell and the value in 
use. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. An 
impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(b) Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets
If any indication of a potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss. Assets are grouped together for 
this purpose at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
(c) Research and development costs
Research expenditure is expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development which represents the application of research to the development of new products or processes is capitalised provided that specific 
projects are identifiable, technically feasible, and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. The useful life of projects meeting the criteria for 
capitalisation is determined on a project by project basis. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost and amortised over its expected useful life on a 
straight-line basis. Other development costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
If an event occurs after the recognition of an impairment that leads to a decrease in the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised the impairment loss 
is reversed. The reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal 
date. 102
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
31 Significant accounting policies continued
31.7 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Raw 
materials, consumables stores and finished goods for sale are stated at purchase cost on a first in first out basis. Work in progress and finished goods are stated at 
the cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads allocated on a systematic basis based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is based on 
estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale or disposal.
31.8 Taxation
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits from activities not qualifying for tonnage tax relief and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected corporation tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, less any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in the financial statements and the 
amounts used for tax purposes, that will result in an obligation to pay more, a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions:
•  No provision is made where a deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
•  No provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future 
reversal of the underlying temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is expected to be realised or liability 
settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income. Where the cash contributions 
made to the schemes exceed the service costs recognised in the income statement the current tax arising is recorded in other comprehensive income.
31.9 Leases
A lease arrangement under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership rest with the lessee are classified as finance leases and capitalised at the 
inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the related item or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are expensed to the income statement. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset. All other leases are classified as operating 
leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In preparation for the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019, management are in the process of assessing 
the potential impact.
31.10 Pension plans
(i) Defined contribution schemes
Pre-determined contributions paid to a separate privately administered pension plan are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in 
which they arise. Other than this contribution the Group has no further legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions to the scheme.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan under which the amount of pension benefit that an employee receives on retirement is defined by reference to factors 
including age, years of service and compensation. The schemes are funded by payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations agreed between the 
Group and the trustees of trustee-administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (current service 
cost) and to current and prior periods (to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation). Current service costs are recognised in the income 
statement in the current year. Past service costs are recognised in the income statement immediately. When a settlement (which eliminates all obligations for 
benefits already accrued) or a curtailment (which reduces future obligations as a result of a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan 
assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
The interest element of the defined benefit charge is determined by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability at the start of the period and 
is recognised in the income statement. A liability is recognised in the statement of financial position which represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the scheme assets and is calculated separately for each scheme.
The defined benefit obligations represent the estimated amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services in current and prior periods, 
discounted at a rate representing the yield on a high quality corporate bond at the balance sheet date, denominated in the same currency as the obligations, and 
having the same terms to maturity as the related pension liability, applied to the estimated future cash outflows arising from these obligations. When the calculation 
results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits 
available from any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 103
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
31 Significant accounting policies continued
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit related to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-
line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses on experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of other 
comprehensive income.
31.11 Share based payments
Executive savings related share option schemes are operated under which options are granted to employees of the Group. An expense is recognised in the income 
statement with a corresponding credit to equity in respect of the fair value of employee services rendered in exchange for options granted, which is determined by 
the fair value of the option at the date of grant. The amount is expensed over a specified period until the options can be exercised (the vesting period).
The fair value of an option is determined by the use of mathematical modelling techniques, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the Binomial model. 
Non-market vesting conditions (such as profitability and growth targets) are excluded from the fair value calculation but included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable.
An estimate is made of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date. Any adjustments to the original estimates are 
recognised in the income statement (and equity) over the remaining vesting period with any element of any adjustments relating to prior periods recognised in the 
current period. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition (such as total 
shareholder return of the Group relative to an index). These are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance conditions are satisfied.
In addition to failure by the employee to exercise an option in accordance with the exercise period allowed by the scheme, an award made to an employee under a share 
option scheme is deemed to lapse when either the scheme is cancelled by the Company, or when an employee, who continues to qualify for membership of a scheme, 
ceases to pay contributions to that scheme. In these circumstances the full remaining unexpired cost of the award is expensed in the period in which the option lapses. 
Where the exercise of options is satisfied by the issue of shares by the Company the nominal value of any shares issued from the exercise of options is credited to 
share capital with the balance of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, credited to share premium.
31.12 Short-term employee benefits
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for short-term employee benefits, including bonuses, only when contractually or constructively obliged.
31.13 Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from equity from the proceeds.
(a) Treasury shares
Shares issued by the Company which are held by the Company or its subsidiary entities (including the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT)), are designated as 
treasury shares. The cost of these shares is deducted from equity. No gains or losses are recognised on the purchase, sale, cancellation or issue of treasury shares. 
Consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.
(b) Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
Company shares are held in an ESOP . The finance costs and administration costs relating to the ESOP are charged to the income statement. Dividend income 
arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid. 
The Group maintains the following reserves:
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of operations whose financial statements are denominated in foreign 
currencies as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions 
that have not yet occurred.
31.14 Revenue recognition
Revenue, after excluding trade discounts and value added tax, represents the provision of goods and services by the Group in the normal course of business and is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer. The transfer of risks and rewards is assumed to pass to the customer on delivery of the goods 
or completion of the provision of the relevant services. When the Group acts as a lessor for short-term spot rentals, revenue is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the hire.
(a) Construction contracts
(i) General
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs relating to it are recognised in accordance with the stage of 
completion of the contract, in the period in which the work is performed. To assess a construction contract at the outset, total contract costs are established 
by using supplier quotes for third party costs, internal hours based on experience, the nature of the project and the time taken for similar projects in the past, 
to which current labour rates are applied. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to an output measure, such as deliverables completed or an input 
measure, such as physical progress, attributable man hours and costs incurred measured against the expected outcome depending on which is the most 
appropriate method for the specific type of contract. Construction contract costs are monitored on a monthly basis and total expected costs (incurred costs 
to date and expected costs to complete) are reviewed against the original cost budget. Progress made is reviewed to assess whether the long-term project is 
progressing in accordance with the planned level of completion on a regular basis. Any cost overruns resulting in an expected total cost in excess of original 
budget results in a reduced margin being accounted for on the revenue recognised to date. Revenue from the contract is under the percentage of completion 
method by reference to the assessed stage of completion of the contract. Pre-determined ratios or percentages are not used in the estimation process.  104
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
31 Significant accounting policies continued
In determining whether the outcome of a construction contract can be assessed reliably, the Group considers the nature of each contract, the experience of the 
project manager with this type of contract, whether it is similar to contracts delivered in the past, the customer, the time period over which the contract runs and 
forms a view of the likely risk in estimating the project outcome.
Contract costs incurred that relate to future activity are deferred and recognised as inventory. When a loss is expected to be incurred on a construction contract 
it is recognised as an expense immediately in the income statement. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably no profit is 
recognised. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that costs incurred will be recovered.
Where the Group has a contract to design and assemble an asset followed by a long-term service contract to operate and maintain that asset, the revenue is 
recognised separately on the respective parts of the contract.
(ii) Bid costs
All bid costs incurred relating to contracts for the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services to third parties are expensed to the 
income statement as incurred, except for those costs incurred after the point at which the contract award is virtually certain. Directly attributable costs incurred 
subsequent to this point are included within contract costs and amortised over the life of the initial period of the contract to which they relate. 
(b) Warranty costs
Provision is made for warranties offered with products where it is probable that an obligation to transfer economic benefits to the customer in future will arise. 
This provision is based on management’s assessment of the previous history of claims and probability of future obligations arising on a product by product basis. 
Provisions for warranty costs are set out in note 20.
31.15 Non-current assets held for sale
On classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial 
classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are any gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
31.16 Intra-group financial instruments
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be 
insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes 
probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
32 Significant accounting judgements and estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s 
accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The outcome may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed and revised on an on-going basis.
(a) Judgements
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements is included below:
Financial and business risks
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial and business risks. Where possible the Group seeks to minimise these risks through its risk management 
policies. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill, which is set out in note 12, of £174.6m (2016: £165.0m) is tested annually for any permanent impairment in accordance with the accounting policy in 
note 31.6. The value in use of the Group’s cash generating units (CGU) requires assumptions about future levels of demand, gross margins and cost inflation. 
Inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows is a key area of judgement. If indicators of impairment exist the carrying value of 
goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount which represents the higher of the net present value of the CGU’s forecast cash flow and its carrying value. The 
assessment also includes sensitivity analysis to identify the range of outcomes and the validity of underlying assumptions.
Business combinations
Business combinations are set out in note 23 and the Group makes an assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities arising in a business combination 
and of any related contingent consideration. Judgement is applied in assessing appropriate fair values of the assets and liabilities required, identifying any intangible 
assets of the acquired business and in estimating the likelihood of contingent targets being achieved during the relevant period. The outcome of contingent 
consideration arrangements depends on a number of factors outside the control of the business including, but not limited to competition, general economic 
conditions and the availability of resources within the business to meet its obligations to its customers. The Group regularly assesses the likelihood of the targets 
being achieved during the performance period and makes appropriate adjustments to the provision for contingent consideration through the income statement. The 
Group uses a discounted cash flow analysis to assess the value of contingent consideration.
Revenue
Revenue is set out in notes 4 and 31.14. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of the transfer of risks and rewards will vary depending on the 
terms of the sales agreement, the evaluation of the specific risks associated with the performance of the contract (for example design, construction and testing) or 
generally accepted practice where there are no specific arrangements in the contract. Areas of judgement relate to construction contract accounting and specifically 
estimating the stage of completion and forecast outturn of the contract.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 105
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
32 Significant accounting judgements and estimates continued
Income taxes
Taxation is set out in notes 8, 9 and 31.8. The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision 
for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these 
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such 
determination is made. 
The Group has entered the UK tonnage tax regime under which tax on its ship owning and operating activities is based on the net tonnage of vessels operated. 
Income and profits outside this regime are taxed under normal tax rules. This means that it is necessary to make estimates of the allocation of some income and 
expenses between tonnage and non-tonnage tax activities. These estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future 
periods. 
Operating in overseas jurisdictions
The Group operates in emerging markets which increases contractual, operational and financial risk with potentially uncertain or changing regulatory and political 
environments. This is referred to in the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties on page 21 and in note 26. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the 
management form a judgement about the risk of exchange control regulations, political stability, potential changes to tax regions and operating environments.
(b) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material misstatement to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the year ending 31 December 2018 is included in the following notes:
• Note 9 – recognition of deferred tax assets, and the availability of future taxable profit against which tax losses carried forward can be used;
•  Notes 12 and 13 – impairment test of intangible assets and goodwill: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts, including the recoverability of 
development costs; and
•  Note 23 – Business combinations.
33 Standards issued but not yet effective
IFRS 15 and 16 are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition 
guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Sale of goods
Revenue is currently recognised when the significant risk and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer which is assumed to pass on delivery of the goods. 
Revenue is recognised at this point provided that the revenue and costs can be measured reliably, the recovery of the consideration is probable and there is no 
continuing management involvement with the goods.
Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods.
Rendering of Services
The Group is involved in providing a range of services including submarine rescue services. The transfer of risks and rewards is assumed to pass to the customer on 
delivery of the goods or stage of completion of the provision of the relevant services. Under IFRS 15, the total consideration in the service contracts will be allocated 
to individual performance obligations as identified within the contract. The stand-alone selling prices will be determined based on the list prices at which the Group 
sells such services in separate transactions. The estimated negative impact on retained earnings at 1 January 2017 as a result of these changes in accounting for 
contracts that have not been completed at that date is £0.6m.
Construction Contracts
Contract revenue and costs currently are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract, where the outcome can be estimated reliably, in the 
period in which the work is performed.
Under IFRS 15 performance obligations in contracts with customers are identified and the total contract value is allocated to each of the performance obligations 
identified. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. For some of the goods that the Group provides, the customer controls all of the work 
in progress as the products are manufactured, or the goods manufactured are of a specialised nature. The revenue from these contracts will be recognised as the 
products are manufactured in line with the performance over time criteria set out in IFRS 15. Where the identification of IFRS 15 performance obligations gives rise to 
more or less recognition criteria than previous contracts is estimated to be an impact on revenue recognised.
The estimated negative impact on retained earnings at 1 January 2017 as a result of these changes in accounting for contracts that have not been completed at that 
date is approximately £4.5m.
Bid Costs
Currently, all bid costs incurred relating to the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services to third parties are expensed, except for those 
incurred after the point at which the contract award is virtually certain (that would not have arisen if the contract was not secured). Under IFRS 15 management do not 
expect any significant changes to arise.
The Group’s assessment indicates that this will result in a reduction of the opening retained earnings of £0.4m at 1 January 2017.
The Group will continue to work to finalise the impact of the new requirements of IFRS 15, including its subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result of this on-going 
work, it is possible that there may be changes to the impact outlined below. However, these are not expected to be significant. 106
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
33 Standards issued but not yet effective continued
Transition
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the full retrospective method, utilising the practical expedients available. As a result, the Group will apply the requirements of 
IFRS 15 to the comparative period presented together with its financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018. The expedients available are:
•  Expedient 1 – Contracts started and completed in the same annual reporting period. An entity need not restate completed contracts that begin and end in the 
same annual reporting period;
•  Expedient 1A – Further, an entity can elect not to restate contracts that are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented;
•  Expedient 2 – That allows an entity to use the transaction price at the date on which the contract was completed, rather than estimating the variable 
consideration amounts in each comparative reporting period;
•  Expedient 3 – An entity need not separately evaluate the effect of contract modifications before the start of the earliest reporting period presented; and
•  Expedient 4 – An entity does not need to disclose for reporting periods presented before the date of initial application (January 2018):
–  Amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations; and
–  An explanation of when it expects to recognise the revenue
The Group’s assessment indicates that the adoption of these expedients will not result in a significantly different outcome.
Estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 15
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the estimated impact that the initial 
application of IFRS 15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. The estimated impact of the adoption of this standard on the Group’s equity as at 1 January 
2017 is based on assessments undertaken to date and is summarised below. The actual impacts of adopting the standards as at 1 January 2018 may change 
because the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application. Estimates 
to 1 January may also change due to the adoption of the retrospective transition option.

The total estimated adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of the Group’s equity at 1 January 2017 is £5.0m. 
The estimated impact on the consolidated income statement in 2017 is to reduce revenue by approximately £6.0m and to reduce profit before taxation by £0.7m - 
£1.5m.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases 
– Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to reflect all leases on their balance sheet. A lessee will recognise a right-of-use asset reflecting its right to use the asset and a lease liability 
recognising its obligation to make lease payments. There are exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line 
operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the 
financials statements in the period of initial application will depend on future economic conditions, including the Group’s borrowing rate at 1 January 2019, the 
composition of the Group’s lease portfolio at that date, the Group’s latest assessment of whether it will exercise any renewal options and the extent to which the 
Group chooses to use the practical expedients and recognition exemptions.
The most significant impact is that the Group will recognise an asset and liability for its operating leases of vessels. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s future 
minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases of vessels amounted to £12.8m, on an undiscounted basis (see note 28).
As part of its assessment the Group will determine whether it is appropriate to restate comparative information, or adopt a modified retrospective approach.

2.  Any member entitled to vote at the above meeting may 
appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote 
on a show of hands or on a poll, instead of him. A proxy 
need not be a member of the Company but must attend 
the meeting in order to represent a member. If you 
wish your proxy to speak on your behalf, you will need 
to appoint someone other than the Chairman or other 
Director as your proxy. A proxy could be the Chairman, 
another Director of the Company or (if you wish the proxy 
to speak on your behalf) another person who has agreed 
to attend and represent a member. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman or another person as a proxy using 
the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form. 
A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation 
to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed 
to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held 
by him. Completion of the proxy form will not preclude 
a member from attending and voting in person, in which 
case that member’s proxy appointment will automatically 
be terminated. Proxy forms, duly executed (including 
any authority under which it is executed or a copy of 
the authority certified notarially), should be returned to 
Link Asset Services, 34 Beckenham Road, BR3 4TU. 
Alternatively you may submit your proxy form online by 
accessing the shareholder portal at 
www.signalshares.com, logging in and selecting the 
‘proxy voting’ link. If you have not previously registered 
for electronic communications, you will first be asked 
to register as a new user, for which you will require your 
investor code (which can be found on your proxy card, 
share certificate or dividend tax voucher), family name 
and postcode (if resident in the UK). In each case your 
proxy instruction must be received no later than 11.00am 
on 1 May 2018. If you are a CREST member, see note 
4 below. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments 
also applies in relation to amended instructions, and any 
attempt to amend a proxy appointment after the relevant 
deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid 
proxy appointments are received in respect of the same 
share in respect of the same meeting, the one which is last 
sent shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other 
or others.
3.  The right to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by 
persons who have been nominated by a member to enjoy 
information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 
2006 (Nominated Person): they can only be exercised by 
the member. However, a Nominated Person may have a 
right under an agreement between him and the member 
by whom he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy 
for the meeting or to have someone else so appointed. If 
a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does 
not wish to exercise it, he may have a right under such 
an agreement to give instructions to the member as to 
the exercise of voting rights. Nominated persons should 
contact the registered member by whom they were 
nominated in respect of these arrangements.
4.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment 
service may do so by utilising the procedures described 
in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). 
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to 
their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who 
will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of 
CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated 
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
(EUI) specifications and must contain the information 
required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in 
order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by 
the issuer’s agent (ID number – RA10) by the latest time(s) 
for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the Notice of 
Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken 
to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied 
to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)
(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
5.  A member of the Company which is a corporation 
may authorise a person or persons to act as its 
representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006, each such 
representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) 
the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it 
were an individual member of the Company, provided 
that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. 
Representatives of shareholders that are corporations will 
have to produce evidence of their proper appointment 
when attending the general meeting. Please contact our 
Registrar if you need any further guidance on this.
6.  Copies of the Directors’ service contracts, the letters of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors, together 
with a copy of the Company’s Articles of Association will 
be available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours on any weekday 
(Saturdays, Sundays and English public holidays excepted) 
until the close of the AGM and are available for inspection 
at the place of the AGM from 10.30am on the date of the 
meeting until the close of the meeting. 114

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
7.  Members satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the Act) can require the Company 
to publish a statement on its website setting out (i) any 
matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the 
audit) that are to be laid before the meeting, or (ii) any 
circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company 
ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which 
Annual Accounts and Reports were laid in accordance 
with section 437 of the Act, that the members propose 
to raise at the meeting. The Company cannot require the 
members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. 
Any statement placed on the website must also be sent 
to the Company’s auditor no later than the time it is made 
available on the website. The business which may be 
dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required to publish on its website.
8.  The Company must cause to be answered any question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting 
which is put by a member attending the meeting, except 
where: (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the 
preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information; (b) the answer has already been 
given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; 
or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company 
or the good order of the meeting that the question be 
answered.
9.  A copy of this Notice, and other information required by 
section 311A of the Act, can be found at www.james-
fisher.com. A member may not use any electronic address 
provided by the Company in this document or any related 
documents (including the proxy form) for communication 
with the Company for any purpose other than as expressly 
stated in it.
10.  Only persons entered on the register of members of the 
Company at close of business on 1 May 2018 (or, if the 
meeting is adjourned, at close of business on the date 
which is two days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be 
entitled to attend and vote at the meeting or adjourned 
meeting. Changes to entries on the register after this time 
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to 
attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at 
the meeting or adjourned meeting.
11.  As at 26 February 2018 (being the latest practical date 
before the publication of this Notice), the Company’s 
issued share capital consists of 50,200,541 ordinary 
shares, carrying one vote each, and 100,000 preference 
shares carrying one vote each. Therefore the total voting 
rights in the Company are 50,300,541. There are no 
shares in treasury.
12.  As soon as practicable following the AGM, the results of 
the voting at the meeting and the number of votes cast for 
and against and the number of votes withheld in respect 
of each resolution will be announced via a Regulatory 
Information Service and also placed on the Company’s 
website at www.james-fisher.com. 115
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
Explanatory Notes
Resolution 1 – Annual Report
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors of a public 
company to lay its Annual Report before the Company in 
general meeting, giving shareholders the opportunity to ask 
questions on the contents. The Annual Report comprises 
the accounts, the auditor’s report, the Directors’ report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the Strategic report. The 
Company proposes, as an ordinary resolution, a resolution 
on its Annual Report in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Code).
Resolution 2 – Approval of the Directors’ 
remuneration policy
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company 
proposes an ordinary resolution to approve the Directors’ 
remuneration policy (contained in the Annual report on 
remuneration). The proposed policy is set out on pages 42 to 
45 of the Annual Report. The vote on Resolution 2 is a binding 
vote and, if passed, will mean that the Company can only 
make remuneration payments to a current or future director or 
a payment for loss of office to a past director if that payment is 
made in accordance with the approved policy. The Company 
is required to ensure that a vote on its remuneration policy 
takes place at least every three years, or earlier if any changes 
to the policy are proposed. As the Directors’ remuneration 
policy was last approved at the 2015 AGM, it is required to be 
approved at this year’s AGM.
Resolution 3 – Approval of the Annual 
statement by the chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Annual 
report on remuneration
The Company proposes an ordinary resolution to approve 
the Annual statement by the chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Annual report on remuneration for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017 (other than the 
Directors’ remuneration policy covered by Resolution 2). The 
Annual statement and the Annual report on remuneration 
are set out on pages 40 and 41 and on pages 45 to 53 of 
the Annual Report. The vote on this Resolution 3 is advisory 
only and the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not 
conditional on its being passed. The Company’s auditor, 
KPMG LLP , has audited those parts of the Directors’ 
remuneration report that are required to be audited.
Resolution 4 – Declaration of final dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after it has been approved 
by the shareholders in general meeting and may not exceed 
the amount recommended by the Board. The Directors 
recommend a final dividend of 19.30p per ordinary share in 
respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2017. If the 
meeting approves Resolution 4, the final dividend will be paid 
on 11 May 2018 to ordinary shareholders who are on the 
register at the close of business on 6 April 2018.
Resolutions 5 to 12 – Re-election and election 
of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that one third of 
the Directors will retire each year and that each Director must 
stand for re-election at least every three years. Charles Rice is 
standing down from the Board at the AGM and therefore will 
not be seeking re-election. Subject to his re-election, Malcolm 
Paul will replace Charles Rice as Chairman from the end of the 
AGM. Justin Atkinson who joined the Company on 1 February 
2018 as a Non-Executive Director will be proposed for election 
for the first time at this year’s AGM, as will Fergus Graham who 
joined the Board on 1 March 2018 as an Executive Director . 
With respect to the other Directors, in accordance with the 
provision of the Code they will all retire from office and offer 
themselves for re-election at the AGM.
Following performance reviews the Chairman and the Board 
believe that each of the Directors standing for re-election 
continue to perform effectively and with commitment to their 
role including commitment of time for Board and Committee 
meetings and other duties. In addition the Board believes 
that Justin Atkinson should be elected because he will bring 
experience of successfully managing a group on a similar 
growth path to the Group. The Board also considers that each 
of the Non-Executive Directors is independent in character 
and judgement. Each of Resolutions 5 to 12 shall be proposed 
as ordinary resolutions. Biographical details of each of our 
Directors appear on pages 26 and 27 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 13 and 14 – Re-appointment of 
auditor/auditor’s remuneration
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each 
general meeting at which accounts are laid before the 
Company, to hold office until the conclusion of the next such 
meeting. These resolutions propose the re-appointment of 
KPMG LLP as the Company’s auditor to hold office from the 
conclusion of the AGM until the conclusion of the next general 
meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company, 
and authorises the Audit Committee to agree the auditor’s 
remuneration.
Resolution 15 – Authority to allot shares
Authority is given to the Directors to allot shares in the 
Company and to grant rights to subscribe for, and convert 
any security into shares in the Company up to a total nominal 
amount of £4,183,378 representing approximately 33% of the 
nominal value of the Company’s total issued ordinary share 
capital as at 26 February 2018, being the latest practical date 
before publication of this Notice. The authority will expire at 
the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2019, or, if earlier, on  116
JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED
30 June 2019 and replaces an authority granted on 4 May 
2017 which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise this 
authority. At 26 February 2018, the Company does not hold 
any treasury shares.
Resolutions 16 and 17 – Permission to allot 
a limited number of shares other than to 
existing shareholders
Resolution 16, which will be proposed as a special resolution, 
seeks to renew the authority conferred on the Directors at 
last year’s AGM to issue equity securities of the Company 
for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders 
in proportion to their existing shareholdings. Other than in 
connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer 
(where difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas 
shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements) the 
authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an 
aggregate nominal value of £627,507 which includes the sale 
on a non pre-emptive basis of any shares the Company holds 
in treasury for cash, and which represents approximately 
5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 
26 February 2018, being the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of this Notice.
In line with best practice, the Company has not issued 
more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a non pre-
emptive basis over the last three years and the Directors 
confirm their intention to follow the best practice set out 
in the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles which 
provides that companies should not issue shares for cash 
on a non pre-emptive basis representing more than 7.5% 
of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling three-
year period (other than in connection with an acquisition or 
specified capital investment as described in the Pre-Emption 
Group’s Statement of Principles) without prior consultation 
with shareholders. The Directors have no present intention to 
exercise this authority.
Resolution 17 is in addition to Resolution 16 and is also 
a special resolution. In line with the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles, as updated in March 2015, 
Resolution 17 will enable the Directors to allot shares for cash 
or sell shares out of treasury up to a further nominal amount 
of £627,507 representing approximately 5% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 26 February 2018, being 
the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice, 
without first having to offer them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing shareholdings. The authority under 
Resolution 17 will only be used to allot shares or sell shares 
out of treasury in connection with an acquisition or specified 
capital investment of a kind contemplated by the Statement of 
Principles and which is announced contemporaneously with 
the allotment, or has taken place in the preceding six-month 
period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment. 
The Directors have no current intention of exercising this 
authority. If this authority is used, the Company will publish 
details of the placing in its next Annual Report and Accounts.
The authorities under Resolutions 16 and 17 will lapse at 
the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2019 or on 30 
June 2019, whichever is earlier. The maximum nominal 
value of equity securities which could be allotted if both 
authorities were used would be £1,255,014, which represents 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital as at 26 February 2018.
Resolution 18 – Authority to purchase own 
shares
This special resolution, gives the Company authority to 
purchase in the market up to 2,510,027 of its ordinary 
shares of 25p each (representing approximately 5% of the 
Company’s total issued ordinary share capital). The minimum 
and maximum prices at which such shares can be purchased 
is as stated in the Resolution. The authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2019, or on 30 June 
2019, whichever is earlier, and replaces a similar authority 
granted on 4 May 2017 which expires at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming AGM.
If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are 
not held by the Company as treasury shares then such shares 
would be immediately cancelled in which event the number of 
ordinary shares in issue would be reduced. As at 26 February 
2018, being the latest practical date before publication of this 
Notice, there were options over ordinary shares in the capital 
of the Company representing 1.88% of the Company’s total 
issued ordinary share capital. If the authority to purchase the 
Company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full and those 
shares were subsequently cancelled, these options would 
represent 1.97% of the Company’s total issued ordinary share 
capital. The Directors have no present intention to exercise 
this authority and in reaching their decision to purchase 
ordinary shares will take into account, amongst other things, 
the Company’s cash resources and capital requirements, the 
effect of any purchase on earnings per share and whether it is 
in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Resolution 19 – Authority to hold general 
meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear 
days’ notice
The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 
for general meetings is 21 clear days unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period, which cannot, however, be 
less than 14 clear days. AGMs must always be held on at 
least 21 clear days’ notice. This special resolution renews an 
authority given at last year’s AGM which enables the Company 
to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ 
notice. In order to preserve this ability, shareholders must have 
approved the calling of meetings on 14 clear days’ notice.  117

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 
Resolution 19, which is proposed as a special resolution, 
seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the 
Company’s next AGM, when it is intended that a similar 
resolution will be proposed.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter 
of routine for general meetings, but only where, taking into 
account the circumstances and noting the recommendations 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors consider 
that the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting 
and is in the interests of the Company and shareholders as a 
whole.
Recommendation
The Directors consider that the proposed resolutions set out 
in the Notice of AGM are in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole and they unanimously 
recommend that you vote in favour of them, as the Directors 
intend to do in respect of their own holdings of shares in the 
Company. 118
