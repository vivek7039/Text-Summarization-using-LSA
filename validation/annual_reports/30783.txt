Why we exist
Exchange rates are moving all 
the time. If businesses’ 
exposures to them are not 
managed e ﬀectively, they can 
present a signi ﬁcant risk – 
impacting pro ﬁt margins, cash 
 ow and the ability to price 
competitively. competitively.
For those purchasing signi ﬁcant 
volumes of currency, a modest 
movement of just 1- 2 per cent 
in exchange rates can have a 
big impact on ﬁnancial 
performance. Annual volatility in 
GBP/USD has averaged 15.8% 
over the past 10 years. over the past 10 years. 
Alpha exists because managing 
these exposures e ﬀectively is 
time consuming, resource 
intensive and expensive - often 
involving dedicated in-house 
treasury teams or outsourced 
currency management 
consultancies. consultancies.
This makes e ﬀective currency 
management unviable or 
expensive for many. There are 
hundreds of foreign exchange 
brokers in the UK, and most will 
provide products and market 
information to manage currency 
risk. However, these products in risk. However, these products in 
isolation do not provide a 
solution, and used incorrectly 
can often exacerbate currency 
risk further.

Hedging Programmes
Our expert currency strategists work in Our expert currency strategists work in 
consultation with our clients to devise 
and maintain hedging programmes 
that are bespoke to their unique 
objectives and commercial 
environments. Whilst formulating these 
programmes requires high levels of 
analysis and expertise, the principles of analysis and expertise, the principles of 
how they work are very simple: clients 
have to decide how much to hedge, 
how far forward and how often in order 
to achieve the right level of control over 
currency volatility for their commercial 
objectives.
With a hedging programme in place, 
businesses will have a number of 
‘hedging windows’ within which they will 
need to decide when to buy currency.    
This is where technical analysis plays a 
key role. 
Technical Analysis
For the majority of corporates and For the majority of corporates and 
institutions, the decision of ‘when’ to 
buy currency should be a secondary 
consideration - one that is made once a 
hedging programme is in place and risk 
parameters have been established.  
This does not mean, however, that it 
cannot garner signi ﬁcant value. cannot garner signi ﬁcant value.
Conventional wisdom has been to rely 
on market information and budget 
rates to guide market entry, both of 
which are notoriously unreliable.  At 
Alpha, our dedicated team of analysts 
instead carry out technical analysis.  
Such analysis incorporates historical 
and probability data to identify and probability data to identify 
statistically optimal entry points within 
short timeframes (hedging windows). In 
doing so, we are able to achieve 
consistently high levels of accuracy for 
clients, allowing them to substantiate 
their decision making with sound and 
objective rationale. objective rationale.
Online Platform
Our intuitive online platform is simple 
to use but also deeply powerful, 
capable of taking vast amounts of 
complex information on a company’s 
currency exposure and turning it into

delivered through straightforward 
graphics and reports. Such functionality graphics and reports. Such functionality 
is providing companies with new levels 
of visibility and control over their 
currency exposures, expanding their 
risk management capabilities almost 
e ﬀortlessly.  At the same time, 
enhanced reporting is instantly 
delivering a raft of new operating delivering a raft of new operating 
e ﬃciencies for clients.
We are focused on utilising our deep 
pool of knowledge and resources to 
continually develop and enhance our

with our expertise and consultative 
approach, are key competitive 
strengths for Alpha.

Untitled-1   1 29/03/2018   14:09 Summary
FY17 was a landmark year in Alpha’s history. The
IPO in April marked the start of a new chapter
for the Group, providing the capital to make
signiﬁcant investments across all areas of the
business, whilst also raising our public proﬁle.
Although we listed less than 12 months ago, the
beneﬁts are already evident in the full year
performance of the Group, and as such I’m
pleased to report a strong set of ﬁnancial results.
Growth in revenue was up 60% versus FY16 and
underlying operating proﬁt increased 55%.
Board & People
Alpha’s success to date has been the result of the
passion, commitment and vision of its people and
2017 was no exception. On behalf of the Board,
I would like to thank everyone for their hard work
in making 2017 another successful year and am
looking forward to working with you to build on
this further in 2018.
We are also pleased to welcome Henry Lisney
to the Board in the role of Chief Operating Oﬃcer.
Henry joined Alpha in 2013 as a Portfolio
Manager before quickly rising to the role of
Operations Director prior to his appointment in
March this year as COO. He has been hugely
inﬂuential in developing all areas of the business,
spearheading the Company’s IPO last year, as well
as leading the expansion of our product oﬀering.
Henry’s rapid progression is testament to Alpha’s
culture of meritocracy. 
Looking ahead, the Group will continue to beneﬁt
from its founder-led management team. At the
same time, we are delighted to see many existing
employees progressing to take on more senior
roles, and this is playing a key role in ensuring
Alpha’s impressive culture continues to resonate
throughout the Group. 
It is particularly pleasing to note that
15 employees saw their ﬁrst tranche of share
options vest due to the overall strong revenue
performance of the Group and I believe this
increased level of ownership bodes well for a
company that has always thrived oﬀ its
entrepreneurial mind-set.
Dividend
The Board has a stated policy to target a dividend
of approximately 30 per cent. of the Group’s
underlying proﬁts after tax in each ﬁnancial year. 
In line with our stated dividend policy, we paid our
maiden interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share in
October 2017. The Board has recommended a
ﬁnal dividend of 3.4 pence per share giving a total
dividend for the ﬁnancial year of 4.9 pence per

share. Subject to approval by shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2018, the ﬁnal
dividend will be paid on 16 May 2018 to
shareholders on the register at 13 April 2018. The
ex-dividend date will be 12 April 2018.
The Year Ahead
2018 will be our ﬁrst full year as a publically listed
business. Even with our strong performance to
date, we have only penetrated a small proportion
of our addressable market, one that will over time
become even larger with our recent entrance into
overseas markets and expansion into new sectors
such as the institutional and funds market. 
Having invested in technology, new product
development and infrastructure in 2017, along
with the growth of our team, we are well
positioned for further growth. Q1 has already
started positively and with a clear strategy and a
highly motivated team in place, I am looking
forward to the rest of the year with optimism.

Operational Review
2017 marked a strong year of growth for Alpha,
both in revenue and in our investment in staﬀ
and infrastructure.
During the year, we increased our client numbers
by 39%, bringing our total number of clients to
310. Pleasingly, the fact that our revenue has
grown at a higher percentage is a reﬂection of the
larger trades that we are doing and the increasing
size of our clients. 
We will continue to focus on growing our client
base by penetrating our existing corporate
marketplace in the UK, alongside continued
expansion into the institutional marketplace and
overseas sectors.
Europe in particular presents a very exciting area
of expansion for us. During the ﬁnancial year we
have recruited staﬀ for our London oﬃce who are
ﬂuent in foreign languages which has enabled us
to steadily expand into select European
territories. As a result, we successfully onboarded
our ﬁrst European clients in the second half of
the ﬁnancial year.
Whilst we are constantly looking for ways to
acquire new clients, we remain dedicated to
providing the very best levels of service to our
existing client base. To ensure this, my co-founder
Jon Currie has recently moved into a role focused
on enhancing our service delivery and is working
collaboratively with our clients to improve our
customer insights and perpetuate our high levels
of client retention. Further operational progress
was made with the expansion of our FX Analysis
team and through obtaining regulatory approval
to sell derivative products. As well as providing
additional beneﬁts to our existing clients, both
developments will undoubtedly increase our
appeal to prospective clients.
Aside from penetrating our traditional corporate
marketplace, we have targeted the institutional
and funds marketplace, which presents a valuable
growth opportunity for Alpha. As such, we have
created a team with a wealth of experience in
institutional FX and tailored our technology and
service solutions to meet investment managers’
speciﬁc and increasingly complex needs.
Throughout the course of this year we have also
continued to invest in the ongoing development
of our technology platform which has proved to
be an important element of our advisory service
oﬀering and this will continue to be a focus
moving forward. Our online currency
management platform has been developed
in-house and we believe, aﬀords us a strong

competitive advantage. It provides our clients with
a tailored and comprehensive overview of their
currency exposures and is subsequently allowing
them to manage and report on these exposures
more eﬀectively, whilst reducing the time and
costs involved in doing so. We believe that our
bespoke platform oﬀers customers a greater
insight into their hedging activities than our
competitors and has become a key diﬀerentiator
in a short space of time, helping us with both
customer acquisition and retention, as well as
margin protection. In light of this, we made the
important decision to migrate to a new Cloud
Application Platform in February 2018 which
oﬀers richer functionality, greater customisation
and increased scalability.
Technology is an important cornerstone of the
business and we have a strong technology
development roadmap in place, and further
functionality will be introduced during 2018 to
enhance the platform. A reﬂection of the
importance we place on our technology is the fact
that our team of developers has grown from 2 at
the start of the year to 9.
In December, we relocated our head oﬃce to
London to bring all our team under one roof in
order to support the unique culture which
ultimately underpins our success. We have
already seen the beneﬁts of a single, larger oﬃce,
with wider skill sharing, stronger relationships
being forged and a positive atmosphere of
camaraderie and collaboration.
People
When we listed Alpha in April, we underestimated
how inﬂuential it was going to be in helping us
acquire exceptional talent. Our plc status has
served as a testament to Alpha’s success and
future ambitions, enabling us to attract high
calibre individuals in a relatively short space of
time, and with a noticeable shift in the volume
and quality of inbound applications.
As planned, total headcount increased from
30 to 51 during the course of the year.
Of these new recruits, 11 joined the Front Oﬃce
team to continue the rate of client acquisition in
the UK corporate market, as well as penetrating
overseas territories from our oﬃce in London. As
always, we expect staﬀ contributions to increase
incrementally as individuals develop along the
learning curve, and I am pleased that yet again,
new starters in FY17 outperformed those in FY16
- a trend I expect to continue due to the
compounding eﬀect of surrounding great people
with more great people, alongside our evolving
service and infrastructure and the growing
reputation of Alpha in our target markets.
The majority of remaining new team members
joined our Technology team, spearheading new
product development and technological
innovation, with a particular focus on evolving
Alpha’s online currency management platform
and payment functionality, as well as developing
custom platform solutions for our clients.
Thank you
The bedrock of our business has always been our
people, and I would like to thank everyone who
has got Alpha to this stage in its journey. Your
commitment and vision is helping to build a
business that is driving change within the
industry, as well as a culture I feel incredibly
privileged to be a part of.
Last but by no means least, I would like to thank
you, our shareholders who believe in our vision
and are helping us to take Alpha to new heights,
whilst accelerating positive changes within our
industry. 
Outlook
Everyone at Alpha passionately believes our IPO
marked the start of our journey, not the end. We
took Alpha public to enable our growth ambitions
whilst ensuring we could maintain the
entrepreneurial culture that got us here in the
ﬁrst place. We now have the opportunity to create
a very special business, with a clear vision and
growth strategy. I look forward to being able to
report back on further progress achieved in the
current year.

this are already being felt with skill-sharing, stronger

20 March 2018
•  Alongside investing in technology and service delivery to
support Front Oﬃce staﬀ, we have also made considerable
investment in developing our existing infrastructure in order
to drive eﬃciency and increase automation.
•  In January 2018, the Group became a member of SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication) and we continue to test and investigate
new payment networks which have the potential to improve
eﬃciencies and the breadth of our service oﬀering. 
•  In recognition of the value of our currency management
platform, we made the decision to migrate to a new Cloud
Application Platform which oﬀers richer functionality,
greater customisation and scalability.
•  Whilst the outcomes of the Brexit negotiations still remain
uncertain, Alpha’s clients will, by their nature, continue to
have a requirement to buy or sell currency to fulﬁl their
international trading activities. Subsequently, regardless of
the outcome of Brexit negotiations, we remain conﬁdent in
our ability to scale and meet our revenue goals.
Build scale and eﬃciencies
We will continue to ensure our core
service oﬀering and infrastructure
remains agile in order that we can
maintain an ever evolving foundation
upon which to scale and drive
eﬃciencies

Financial Review
Revenue in the year ended 31 December 2017
grew by 60% to £13.5m (2016: £8.5m). Revenue
continues to be driven by increasing revenue
from new clients and strong client retention, as
well as new starters in 2017 continuing to
outperform those from the previous year.
The average commission (revenue as a % of gross
value of currency transactions sold) increased in
the year to 31 December 2017, due primarily to a
higher proportion of forward trades (which attract
a higher commission rate) as well as the larger
trades and a change in the mix of currencies.
There were no structural changes in forward
commission rates in the year to 31 December
2017 compared to the prior year.
Underlying operating proﬁt increased by 55% to
£6.8m (2016: £4.4m) whilst on a reported basis
operating proﬁt was up 29% to £5.6m (2016:
£4.4m). In 2017 there was continued investment
in headcount in both the Front and Back Oﬃce
with total headcount increasing from 30 to 51.
Despite this continued investment, the Group
delivered an underlying operating proﬁt margin of
50% (2016: 51%).
The eﬀective rate of taxation for 2017 was 22%.
This is higher than the standard rate primarily as
a result of costs of the IPO which are not
allowable for tax purposes.
Underlying basic earnings per share that exclude
the impact of the one-oﬀ costs relating to the IPO
and their tax eﬀect and share-based payments,
increased from 13.4p in 2016 to 17.5p in 2017.
Basic earnings per share increased from 13.4p in
2016 to 14.2p in 2017.
On 7 April 2017, the Company issued 6,632,653
new shares upon admission to the London Stock
Exchange raising £12.3m after expenses. Part of
the net proceeds were used to repay the
shareholder loans in existence as at 31 December
2016 of £1.4m.
Cash ﬂow
On a statutory basis, net cash and cash
equivalents increased by £5.5m to £13.1m.
However, the Group’s cash position can ﬂuctuate
signiﬁcantly from year to year due to the impact
of changes in the collateral received from clients,
early settlement of trades, or the unrealised mark
to market proﬁt or loss from client swaps,
resulting in an increase or decrease in cash with a
corresponding change in other payables and
trade receivables. Therefore, in addition to the
statutory cash ﬂow, the Group presents an
adjusted net cash summary below which excludes
the above items. In the year ended 31 December
2017 net cash on the non-statutory basis
increased by £11.9m to £13.7m, largely due to
the net proceeds of the IPO and the proﬁtable
trading in the year.
Financial Review
“2017 was another impressive year for Alpha with strong revenue growth
and robust proﬁt margins.”

The table below presents the operating cash conversion on a similar basis, which excludes collateral
received from clients, early settlements and the unrealised mark to market proﬁt or loss from client
swaps. Cash conversion for the year ended 31 December 2017 reduced to 47% from 60% on the prior
year. The reduction is due to an increase in the proportion of forward trades which represented 89% of
the revenue in 2017 compared to 85% in 2016 as well an increase in the average tenure of forward
transactions.

Relocation of Head Oﬃce
In December 2017 we consolidated our teams into one oﬃce with the staﬀ from Reading moving to London.
The ﬁnancial statements at 31 December 2017 include an onerous lease provision of £190,000 representing
the anticipated diﬀerence in rent receivable and rent payable in Reading for the remainder of the lease.
Dividend
The Board intends to target a dividend of approximately 30% of the Group’s underlying proﬁts after tax in
each ﬁnancial year. In line with this dividend policy which was set out in its Admission document and
following the payment of the interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share in October 2017, the Board is pleased
to declare a maiden ﬁnal dividend of 3.4 pence per share. Subject to shareholder approval, the Dividend
will be payable to Shareholders on the register as at 13 April 2018 and will be paid on 16 May 2018.

UNCERT AINTIES
21
IT and Cyber Security Risk
The Group faces the risk of its operating systems
failing, as well as the failure to safeguard the
business-critical data and systems against cyber
security risks. As a result, the Group may become
unable to carry out its business activities resulting
in a ﬁnancial and reputational loss. 
This risk is mitigated by maintaining robust
network perimeter defences, continual data
backup, and the use of a secure end-to-end CRM
system and online platform. Additionally, a robust
IT security policy is supported by penetration
testing as well as regular training for all members
of staﬀ.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises if the Group is unable to meet
its ﬁnancial obligations when due. For example, if
the Group is unable to deposit margin required
by its banking counterparties, this could lead to
the Group becoming unable or restricted in its
ability to meet trading capital requirements which
in turn could result in the ability of the banking
counterparties to terminate the ﬁnancing facilities
with the Group. 
Alpha operates a matched-principal brokerage
model, meaning it simultaneously executes a
matching trade with its banking counterparties on
receipt of client orders. 
The Group has facilities with the banking
counterparties. These facilities enable the Group
to book both forward and spot contracts on
behalf of its clients. 
The banking counterparties mark to market all of
the Group’s forward contracts at the end of each
business day. 
To calculate the level of margin required, the
Group’s banking counterparties mark to market
(“MTM”) the Group’s net currency positions
(meaning foreign exchange positions favourably
affected by market movements are offset against
those adversely affected). As a result, the Group
is able to benefit from exchange rate
movements when it has positions on both sides
of the market (e.g. a depreciation in the Euro will
negatively impact the Group’s long Euro
positions, but at the same time benefit its Euro
short positions). This results in a net claim
payable to (or claim on) the banking
counterparties. If a net claim is payable, the
Group is required to deposit margin with its
banking counterparties on the following
business day. 
The Group funds margin due to its banking
counterparties through client margin calls and its
own funds. When the Group makes a margin call,
clients have one business day to deposit margin
with the Group once called. 
Principal Risks & Uncertainties
The Board sets out below the key strategic risks and uncertainties that the
Directors consider could impact the business. The Board continually
reviews the potential strategic risks facing the Group and the controls in
place to mitigate any potential adverse impacts. The Board also
recognises that the nature and scope of risks may change and that there
may be other risks to which the Group is exposed and so the list is not
intended to be exhaustive.
248225 Alpha FX_pp12-pp26.qxp  03/04/2018  15:07  Page 21 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS &
UNCERT AINTIES
22
The Group beneﬁts from the fact that trading
terms with its banking counterparties are more
favourable than those oﬀered to its clients, and it
only has to fund its net FX exposure with its
banking counterparties (i.e. if two clients make
equal and opposing trades simultaneously its
exposure is nil). 
Liquidity risk is primarily driven by: 
•  A sudden sharp movement in exchange rates
when a currency is net long/short; or
•  An over-extension of hedging facilities.
If the Group were unable to meet its ﬁnancial
obligations when due, this would have a material
adverse eﬀect on its business, results of
operations, ﬁnancial condition and prospects. 
The Group has a Liquidity Policy in place to
mitigate any such risks. The Liquidity Policy
provides that: 
•  weekly stress tests are carried out that subject
the Group’s net currency positions to simulated
signiﬁcant FX market volatility; 
•  robust margin call terms are maintained with
clients; 
•  an over extension of hedging facilities is
managed through internally mandating a
minimum amount of Alpha’s free cash to be
placed against each hedging facility extended;
and 
•  Alpha’s balance sheet must be well capitalised
with cash so that in the event that they are
called for margin collateral by a banking
counterparty but unable to call on their clients
as they have granted them a ‘hedging facility’,
they are able to fund the position. 
Credit Risk
Alpha is exposed to credit risk if a client fails to
deliver currency at maturity of the contract or fails
to deposit margin when a margin call is made. In
either scenario, Alpha’s policy is to immediately
cancel the trade through booking an equal and
opposite trade (in order to reverse the original
contract). Alpha is therefore exposed to the
movements in the exchange rate of the total
value of the contract since the trade was booked,
or since the date of the last margin call, up to the
date of cancellation. However, Alpha has a credit
policy in place to mitigate any potential losses
arising from a client failing to settle; in particular,
Alpha assesses the creditworthiness of clients
and, where a hedging facility has been extended,
puts in place strict limits (typically limited to
3 per cent. or 5 per cent. of the value of the
contract with a client). If a client should fail to
make payments to the Group when due, this
could have a material adverse eﬀect on the
Group’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial
condition and prospects.
Regulatory Risk
The Group faces the risk of failing to adhere to its
regulatory and legal requirements. The provision
of the Group’s services falls within various
regulatory spheres, including the UK Money
Laundering Regulations 2007, the Payment
Services Regulations 2009, the UK Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 and the Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). The Group
maintains robust policies and procedures,
systems and controls and monitoring and
assurance programmes to ensure continued
compliance with its regulatory obligations.
Alongside this, the Group engages the services of
independent compliance consultancies to review
its compliance with regulatory requirements. 
A report on the Group’s arrangements for
managing compliance risk is presented to the
Board on an annual basis. A compliance update is
also provided at the Group’s Board meetings on a
regular basis.
Operational Risk
The Group is subject to the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people, systems or external events. This can
include so-called ‘Fat Finger’ errors: the incorrect
inputting or execution of a trade (either into the
Group’s reporting software or to one of the
Group’s Banking Counterparties), as well as
internal fraud e.g. intentional misreporting of
positions, employee thefts, and insider trading on
an employee’s own account. 
248225 Alpha FX_pp12-pp26.qxp  03/04/2018  15:07  Page 22 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS &
UNCERT AINTIES
23
The Group minimises ‘Fat Finger’ errors through
daily reconciliations of all account balances
(meaning any trade error should be identiﬁed
early), as well as ensuring trades greater than
£2,000,000.00 are reconciled within the hour.
Where an error has been identiﬁed, it is the
Group’s policy to immediately cancel the trade
through booking an equal and opposite trade (in
order to reverse the original contract). The Group
also maintains a strict division between Front and
Back Oﬃce functions to ensure Back Oﬃce
remain independent and attentive to any errors
that may have been caused by Front Oﬃce.
Internal fraud is minimised through DBS
screening all Back Oﬃce individuals, maintaining
strict delegated authority limits, segregation of
duties and regular monitoring and oversight
across diﬀerent management functions. The
Group also maintains a whistleblowing policy,
which is communicated to all members of staﬀ. 
Financial Reporting Risk
The Group may face the risk of reputational
damage and ﬁnancial loss resulting from a
material misstatement in the Group’s ﬁnancial
reporting. 
This risk is mitigated by ongoing internal reviews
and reconciliation carried out by qualiﬁed and
experienced members of staﬀ and the oversight
of the Audit Committee.
Key Management Risk
The Group’s success is linked to the eﬀorts and
abilities of key personnel and its capacity to retain
such personnel. The executive management team
has signiﬁcant experience in the industry and has
made an important contribution to the Group’s
growth and success. The loss of any member of
the executive management team may have an
adverse eﬀect on operations of the Group. 
To mitigate this risk, the Group continues to value
the contribution made by its key executives and
reward them accordingly. The Group operates
cross functional input and knowledge sharing,
and there is a detailed business continuity plan in
the event of a disruption. The Group also has a
key person insurance policy in place.

RESPONSIBILITY

Equality & Diversity
We remain committed to providing equal
opportunities and diversity in the workplace, by
recruiting and promoting staﬀ based on their
experience, skills and attitude. The Group
therefore does not discriminate between
employees or prospective employees on the
grounds of age, race, disability, religion, gender, or
any other criteria. 
We believe gender diversity within the foreign
exchange industry, especially within Business
Development roles, has considerable room for
improvement. We are therefore focused on
working with our recruitment partners to improve
this trend and ensure gender never has any
bearing on the recruitment process.
Health & Safety (covering rights)
The Board takes seriously its responsibility
towards employees to provide a safe and healthy
working environment. The Group complies with
health and safety legislation including conducting
regular inspections and risk assessments.
Environment
Alpha is committed to minimising the impact its
operations have on the environment. Recycling of
oﬃce supplies is undertaken where possible and
the Group has adopted a largely paperless
marketing model.

Statement of Directors Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year.
Under that law the Directors have elected to
prepare the Group and Company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (IFRSs) and the Company
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). Under company law the Directors
must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless
they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair
view of the state of aﬀairs and proﬁt or loss of the
Group and the Company for the period. The
Directors are also required to prepare ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with the rules of the
London Stock Exchange for companies trading
securities on the Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the
Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates
that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been
followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial
statements; and
248225 Alpha FX_pp31-pp33.qxp  03/04/2018  15:09  Page 32 ANNU AL REPORT 2017 DIRECTORS’ REPORT
33
•  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is appropriate to
presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are suﬃcient to
show and explain the Company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable
them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the Company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the
annual report and the ﬁnancial statements are
made available on a website. Financial statements
are published on the company’s website in
accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of
ﬁnancial statements, which may vary from
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance
and integrity of the company’s website is the
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’
responsibility also extends to the ongoing
integrity of the ﬁnancial statements contained
therein.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements section of our report. We are independent of
the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed
entities, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the parent company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report

and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require
us to report to you where:
•  the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements is not appropriate; or
•  the directors have not disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements any identiﬁed material uncertainties that
may cast signiﬁcant doubt about the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the
ﬁnancial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our
audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identiﬁed, including those which had the
greatest eﬀect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the
eﬀorts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters.
Existence and accuracy of revenue                          
      How we addressed the matter in our audit
We reviewed the revenue recognition policy
applied to each of the Group’s revenue streams
and considered its compliance with IAS18
‘Revenue’. 
We assessed the design and implementation of
the controls covering the existence and accuracy
of revenue transactions. We then sample tested
the relevant controls for operating eﬀectiveness
throughout the year.
We substantively tested a sample of revenue
transactions for each material revenue stream to
verify the existence and accuracy of revenue with
reference to underlying supporting trade tickets
and third-party information recorded with the
banking counterparty.
Our testing did not identify any material
misstatements in the amount of revenue
recognised.
Key Audit Matter 
The Group’s revenue recognition policy is
included with the accounting policies on page 46. 
The Group’s reported revenue is a key
performance indicator for the market, it drives
the level of sales commissions payable to front
oﬃce staﬀ and is a key metric in the Group’s
Growth Share Scheme used to incentivise
directors, key management and certain staﬀ. Due
to the incentive that exists to overstate revenue,
a signiﬁcant risk of material misstatement is
considered to be present over the existence and
accuracy of revenue.

Fair value of unsettled trades at year end             
      
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the
eﬀect of misstatements. For planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which
misstatements, including omissions, could inﬂuence the economic decisions of reasonable users that
are taken on the basis of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceeded
materiality, we use a lower level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed.
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also
take account of the nature of identiﬁed misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their
occurrence, when evaluating their eﬀect on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole.
The materiality for the Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole was set at £330,000 (2016: £256,000).
This was determined with reference to the Group’s proﬁt before tax prior to the costs of the initial
public oﬀering (‘IPO’) in April 2017 and applying a percentage of 5%. Proﬁt before tax and IPO costs is
considered the most appropriate measure in assessing the performance of the Group given the IPO
that occurred during the period and the markets focus on the Group’s underlying proﬁt before tax.
The prior year comparative was set with reference to proﬁt before tax and applying a percentage of 6%.
Performance materiality was set at 70% (2016: 70%) of the Group materiality level on the basis that
Management is accepting of audit diﬀerences proposed and there is a single trading component within
the Group. The materiality for the parent company ﬁnancial statement was set at £300,000
How we addressed the matter in our audit
We reviewed the fair value policy applied to the
open positions at year end and considered its
compliance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair value’. 
We substantively tested a sample of trades within
the open forward book at year end, ensuring that
the mark to market forward rate has been
appropriately applied.
We substantively tested a sample of
Management’s credit valuation adjustment
calculations by vouching the input data to
underlying accounting records and corroborated
the information used by Management to make
their assessment.
We recalculated the credit valuation adjustment
using industry accepted techniques to compare
against Management’s own assessment of fair
value.
Our testing did not identify any material
misstatements in the credit valuation adjustment
or the mark to market valuation of the forward
book.
Key Audit Matter 
The Group has a substantial forward book
comprising forward foreign currency trades not
yet settled. At each reporting date Management
are required to reassess the fair value of
unsettled trades which includes adjusting the
carrying value of the forward book with reference
to their mark to market forward rates and also an
assessment of credit worthiness of their
counterparties. 
A signiﬁcant amount of management time is
directed at ensuring the revaluation of the
forward book to mark to market forward rates
has been performed with material accuracy. 
Management are required to exercise a signiﬁcant
level of judgement in their assessment of the
credit worthiness of their counterparties and
their probability of default. This presents a
signiﬁcant risk of material misstatement in the
completeness and accuracy of the credit
valuation adjustment. 
The Group’s fair value policy is included with the
accounting policies on page 48 and the signiﬁcant
judgements are set out in note 3.

(2016: £31,000). This was determined with reference to the net assets of the company using a
percentage of 2%. The performance materiality for the company was set using the same percentage
level as the Group for the reason set out above.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the committee all individual audit
diﬀerences in excess of £16,500. We also agreed to report diﬀerences below this threshold that, in our
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group comprises the parent company and the trading subsidiary, Alpha FX Limited. BDO LLP
performed a full scope audit of the parent and the subsidiary. There have been no signiﬁcant changes
in scope since the prior year.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the annual report, other than the ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our
opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the
ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements or a
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We
have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
•  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year for which
the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements; and
•  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identiﬁed material misstatements in the
strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to
liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but
to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms
part of our auditor’s report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. General information
Alpha FX Group plc, (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company having listed its shares on AIM, a market
operated by The London Stock Exchange, on 7 April 2017. The Company is incorporated and domiciled
in the UK (registered number 07262416) and its registered oﬃce is 2 Eastbourne Terrace, London,
W2 6LG. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the results of the Company and its
subsidiary undertaking Alpha FX Limited. 
The Company’s principal activity is the provision of foreign exchange services for corporates exposed to
currency market volatility through its 100% owned subsidiary Alpha FX Limited. Activities range from
initial design and implementation of hedging strategies, on-going management and monitoring of
currency risks and the provision of technology solutions.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the
European Union (“IFRS”). 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared using the measurement bases speciﬁed by
IFRS for each type of asset, liability or expense. The detailed measurement bases and principal
accounting policies of the Group are set out below. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented
in pounds sterling (“£”) except when otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies adopted in
the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are set out below and have been applied
consistently throughout all periods presented.
The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements are disclosed at the end of this section.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the
measurement of certain ﬁnancial instruments.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for at least one
year from the approval date of the ﬁnancial statements. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
New standards, amendments and interpretations
At the date of the authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, there are number of new standards,
amendments to standards and interpretations that have been published but are not yet eﬀective for
the year ended 31 December 2017 and have not been adopted early.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the ﬁnal version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings
together all 3 aspects of the accounting for ﬁnancial instruments project: classiﬁcation and
measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is eﬀective for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade
receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Group expects to apply the simpliﬁed approach
and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables. 
The Group adopted the new standard on the required eﬀective date. The Group does not expect a
signiﬁcant impact on the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position or statement of comprehensive
income. The key areas of change in IFRS 9 are around; trade debtors and hedge accounting, which are
not applicable to the Group, as well as intercompany balances. The intercompany loan between parent
and subsidiary is interest free and is repayable on demand. As the subsidiary is proﬁtable and
generating cash, there is a very low probability of default. Therefore, the present and current value of
the loan will have a marginal diﬀerence and the expected loss provision is deemed to be insigniﬁcant to
the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a 5-step model to account for revenue arising from
contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reﬂects the
consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to
a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. The
Group adopted the new standard on the required eﬀective date of 1 January 2018. The Group has
considered the implications and since revenue is derived from ﬁnancial instruments, no signiﬁcant
impact on the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position or statement of comprehensive income has
been identiﬁed.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an
Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance
of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases
under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for ﬁnance leases under IAS 17. The
standard includes 2 recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ‘low-value’ assets (e.g., personal
computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). At the
commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease
liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the
right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease
liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g.,
a change in the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or
rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the amount of the
remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
IFRS 16 is eﬀective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early application is
permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using
either a full retrospective or a modiﬁed retrospective approach. The standard’s transition provisions
permit certain reliefs.
The Group has entered into a long-term lease in respect of land and buildings. The Group is currently
assessing leases under IFRS 16 and expects an impact as the ‘right of use’ assets and corresponding
lease liabilities will come onto the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position for the ﬁrst time in
respect of its current operating leases. Existing operating lease commitments are set in out in Note 27
of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classiﬁed as a subsidiary. The Company controls
an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to
variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to aﬀect those
variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a
change in any elements of control.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial information.
(iii) Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the
Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the
original business combination and the minority’s share of changes in equity since the date of the
combination. In accordance with IAS 27, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets on a transaction by transaction basis.
The Group treats transactions with the non-controlling interest as transactions with equity owners of
the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests the diﬀerence between the fair value of
consideration paid and the relevant share of net assets acquired is recorded in equity.
Segment reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, an operating segment is deﬁned as a business activity
whose operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete
information is available.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. Following admission to AIM, the chief operating
decision-maker responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating
segments, is the board of directors. Prior to the admission to AIM, the chief operating decision-maker
was identiﬁed as the Chief Executive Oﬃcer, who made strategic decisions. The Group has one
reporting segment due to the nature of services provided across the whole business being the same.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue
Spot and forward revenue is recognised when a binding contract is entered into by a client and the rate
is ﬁxed and determined. Revenue represents the diﬀerence between the rate oﬀered to clients and the
rate the Group receives from its banking counterparties. Options revenue is recognised when a binding
contract is entered into by a client and the revenue is ﬁxed and determined. Revenue represents the
diﬀerence between the premiums oﬀered to clients and the premium the Group receives from its
banking counterparties. 
When the Group enters into a contract with a client, it simultaneously enters into a separate matched
contract with its banking counterparty.
Foreign currency translation
The Group’s consolidated historical ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the
parent and subsidiary companies functional currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at the functional currency
rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
All diﬀerences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rates at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.
The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items is recognised in line with the gain or loss
of the item that gave rise to the translation diﬀerence (translation diﬀerences on items whose gain or
loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or proﬁt or loss is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or proﬁt or loss respectively).
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group
has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial instruments are
derecognised when all de-recognition criteria of IAS 39 are met and the Group no longer controls the
contractual rights that comprise the ﬁnancial instrument. This is normally the case when the instrument
is sold, or all the cash ﬂows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third-party.
Financial assets
Classiﬁcation
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets as either fair value through income statement, or as loans and
receivables. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that
arise principally through the provision of services to customers. They are initially recognised at fair
value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method. They are
included in current assets. Loans and receivables comprise mainly cash and cash equivalents and trade
and other receivables.
Trade receivables represent the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial assets arising as a result of matched
principal transactions. The treatment of these is outlined in the policy below.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets at fair value through income statement
Financial assets at fair value through income statement include ﬁnancial assets designated upon initial
recognition at fair value through income statement. Derivatives are also categorised as ﬁnancial assets
designated upon initial recognition at fair value through income statement because they are not
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classiﬁed as current assets as they are expected to be
settled within 12 months. Financial assets at fair value through income statement are initially recognised
at fair value, including directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent changes in fair value are
recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
diﬃculties on the part of the counterparty or default or signiﬁcant delay in payment) that the Group will
be unable to collect amounts due as a result of non-performance under agreed terms. The amount of
such a provision is the diﬀerence between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future
expected cash ﬂows associated with the impaired receivable.
Financial liabilities
Classiﬁcation
The Group determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial liabilities at initial recognition. All ﬁnancial
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, carried at
amortised cost including directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities
include derivative ﬁnancial liabilities, overdrafts, trade and other payables, and loans received from
shareholders.
De-recognition of liabilities
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or
expires. When an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially
diﬀerent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or
modiﬁcation is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability,
and the diﬀerence in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income.
Oﬀsetting ﬁnancial instruments
When there is a legally enforceable right to oﬀset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously, ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities are oﬀset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial assets are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and liabilities when their
fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in the consolidated statement
of comprehensive income. The Group’s derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at fair value through
income statement comprise of forward foreign exchange contracts and options.
The Group undertakes matched principal broking involving simultaneous back-to-back derivative
transactions with counterparties. These transactions are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial instruments at fair value
through the income statement and are shown gross, except where a netting agreement, which is legally
enforceable, exists and the intention is for the asset and liability to be settled net.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) reﬂects the credit risk of the counterparties inherent in the valuation
of the derivative ﬁnancial instruments. The adjustment represents the estimated fair value of protection
required to hedge the counterparty credit risk. The adjustment takes into account counterparty
exposure, applicable collateral arrangement and default probability rates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits held at call with banks. For the
purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash
equivalents as deﬁned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Other payables
Other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
eﬀective interest method. Other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been
acquired in the ordinary course of business. They are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due in
one year or less. If payment is due at a later date, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate to the circumstances and for which suﬃcient
data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising
the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
•  Level 1 quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
•  Level 2 valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
•  Level 3 valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable
Fair value disclosures for ﬁnancial instruments are provided in Note 16.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities
based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the inputs into the valuations and the level of the fair
value hierarchy as explained above.
Taxes
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or
paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that
are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income is
recognised in equity and not in the statement of comprehensive income.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary diﬀerences at the reporting date arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oﬀset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to oﬀset
current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority.
Employee beneﬁts
Pension obligations
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for employees. The assets of the scheme
are held separately from those of the Group. The annual contributions are charged to the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. Discretionary contributions are occasionally made to Director’s
deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain senior executives of the Group
through the Growth Share Scheme and unapproved options scheme. Equity-settled share-based
schemes are measured at fair value, excluding the eﬀect of non-market-based vesting conditions, at the
date of grant using an appropriate option pricing model. The Growth Shares Scheme has been valued
using a Monte Carlo Simulation Approach due to the existence of market based conditions.
Non-market-based conditions exist over revenue based targets which require management to estimate
the probability of meeting these conditions. The unapproved options scheme has been valued using a
Black Scholes option pricing model as only a service based condition exists. Both schemes require
the estimation of appropriate attrition rates to estimate the number of share options which are likely
to vest.
The fair value of the shares or share options is recognised over the vesting period to reﬂect the value of
the employee services received. The charge relating to grants to employees of the Company is
recognised as an expense in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of each item of property, plant and equipment. Estimated residual
values are included in the calculation of depreciation. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and
equipment are as follows:
Improvements to property       –          Period of lease
Fixtures and ﬁttings                   –          4 to 5 years straight-line
Computer equipment                –          3 years straight-line
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed by the Directors and adjusted if appropriate at the end
of each reporting period.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist of internally developed software. Development expenditure on an individual
project is recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:
•  The technical feasibility of completing the development
•  That it will be available for use or sale
•  Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset
•  How the asset will generate future economic beneﬁts
•  The availability of resources to complete the development
•  The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development
Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied
requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use.
Internally developed software costs are amortised over the useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis
over 3 years being the period of expected future beneﬁt. Amortisation is recorded in operating expenses.
During the period of development, the asset is tested annually for impairment.
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.
Operating leases
The costs associated with operating leases are taken to the statement of comprehensive income on an
accruals basis over the period of the lease. Rental payable under operating leases is charged to the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The
beneﬁt of lease incentives is spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is
probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured based on the
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date
and are discounted to present value where the eﬀect is material.
An onerous property provision is recognised and measured as a provision when the Group has a
present obligation arising under a property related contract. An onerous contract is considered to exist
where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under
the contract exceeds the economic beneﬁts expected to be received under it.

3. Signiﬁcant accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements requires management to make estimates,
judgements and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Uncertainty about
these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to
the carrying amount of the assets or liability aﬀected in the future.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. In the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements and estimates which
have the most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements:
Estimates
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to
collect all the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the
diﬀerence between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash ﬂows
associated with the impaired receivable. In order to calculate the present value of the future expected
cash ﬂows, management must make an estimate of expected future cash ﬂows and apply an
appropriate discount factor, estimated using the latest market information.
Judgements
Development costs
Development costs that are directly attributable to the development of a project are capitalised based on
management’s assessment of the likelihood of a successful outcome for each project. This is based on the
management’s judgement that the project is technologically, commercially and economically feasible in
accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. In determining the amount to be capitalised, management makes
assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and
the expected period of beneﬁts. Details of capitalised development costs are shown in note 11.
Onerous lease
As described in note 2 (provisions), onerous lease provisions are recognised for estimated losses on
leases where the forecast costs of fulﬁlling the lease throughout the contracted period exceed the
forecast income receivable. The provision is calculated based on present value of the estimated
obligations under a lease where the unavoidable costs of the lease exceed the economic beneﬁt
expected to be received from it. 
Credit value adjustment
The credit value adjustment has been calculated by management based on the assumption that the
Group will be unable to collect all the amounts due under the terms receivable, and therefore, is a
method of counterparty credit risk management. The amount of the adjustment represents the
diﬀerence between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash ﬂows
associated with the receivables. In order to calculate the present value of the future expected cash
ﬂows, management must make an estimate of expected future cash ﬂows, using the latest real-time
market information, risk ratings of the clients and experience. 
Share-based payments
As described in note 2 (share-based payments), equity settled share awards are recognised as an
expense based on their fair value at date of grant. The fair value of equity settled growth shares
scheme and unapproved share options are estimated through the use of option valuation models
which require an element of judgement in assessing the inputs. Judgement is also exercised in
assessing the number of options subject to non-market vesting conditions that will vest.

3. Signiﬁcant accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Fair value of equity consideration on share for share exchange
In the year ended 31 December 2016 the remaining 13.3% non-controlling interest in Alpha FX Limited
was purchased through the issue of equity in the Company. The fair value of the shares issued was
determined based on a multiple of post-tax income. A non-controlling discount to the overall equity
value was applied to arrive at a best estimate of the fair value of this consideration.
4. Segmental reporting
During the year the Group generated revenue from the sale of forward currency contracts, foreign
exchange spot transactions and option contracts. The revenue attributable to the sale of these
products is shown below:

During the year ended 31 December 2017 revenue totalling £752,888 (2016: £17,186) arose from
customers based outside the United Kingdom. All other revenue arose from customers based in the
United Kingdom. In 2017 one customer contributed 5% of the Group’s revenue (2016 – 11%). All
non-current assets of the Group are domiciled in the United Kingdom.

9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt for the year attributable to equity holders of
the parent, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares during the year. Diluted earnings per
share additionally includes in the calculation, the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would
be issued on conversion of any dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group additionally discloses an underlying earnings per share calculation that excludes the impact of
the one-oﬀ costs relating to the IPO and their tax eﬀect and share-based payments, which better enables
comparison of ﬁnancial performance in the current year with comparative years.

14. Derivative ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (continued)
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are intended to reduce the level of foreign currency
risk for expected future cash ﬂows. The tables above show the fair value of those foreign exchange
forward contracts as at each year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and options fall into level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as set out in
note 2. Level 2 comprises those ﬁnancial instruments which can be valued using inputs other than
quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices). The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is measured using observable
forward exchange rates for contracts with a similar maturity at the reporting date. The fair value of
option foreign exchange contracts is measured using an industry standard external model that best
presents the unpublished interbank valuations.
There were no transfers between level 1 and 2 during the current or prior year.

transactions with banking counterparties and are reported as separate ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial
liabilities in the statement of ﬁnancial position. The transactions are subject to ISDA (International Swaps

16. Fair value
Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables,
trade and other payables as well as other current liabilities approximated to their carrying amounts. This
was due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair values of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are determined by discounting the
cash ﬂow using a market rate of interest that reﬂects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the
reporting period which approximate their carrying amounts.
Management is of the opinion that the fair value of loans and borrowings approximates to their carrying
values as these are subject to interest rates, which are comparable to open market rates.
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
All loans are classed as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
17. Financial risk management
The Group’s current activities result in the following ﬁnancial risks and the management response to
those risks in order to minimise any resulting adverse eﬀects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
Objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the methods used to measure the risk
Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other cash
balances and derivative ﬁnancial assets. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables,
shareholder loans and derivative ﬁnancial liabilities. The main risks arising from ﬁnancial instruments are
credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed in further
detail below.
The Group monitors and mitigates ﬁnancial risk on a consolidated basis. The Group has implemented a
framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk
management practices appropriate to a listed company. The Group has a robust ‘three-lines of defence’
risk and compliance framework covering all operational and compliance activities. This framework is
overseen and enforced by the Director of Risk & Compliance, who has extensive experience overseeing
risk and compliance within a number of reputable ﬁnancial services ﬁrms. As part of this framework the
Group has a Risk Committee, whose membership consists of directors responsible for each risk category.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one or more counterparties will not meet its obligations under a ﬁnancial
instrument or customer contract leading to a ﬁnancial loss. There are no signiﬁcant concentrations of
credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to ﬁnancial assets arises from
derivative ﬁnancial instruments, represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date. The
Group evaluated the concentration of risk as low with respect to derivative ﬁnancial assets arising from
contracts with counterparties. This is due to the fact that no single customer represents a signiﬁcant
proportion of the total value of customer contracts and the business has historically low levels of
counterparty default.

17. Financial risk management (continued)
Where the Group provides credit to counterparties, this is subject to credit veriﬁcation checks. The
Group’s counterparties are reviewed at least annually and are subject to an on-going credit review
process by the Risk and Compliance team. Counterparty exposures are monitored in real time. Daily
stress tests are carried out to assess and minimise client credit risk exposures under various market
volatility scenarios.
Credit risk is minimised by the operation of matched derivative transactions, whereby derivatives sold to
customers are then matched on a back-to-back basis with an oﬀsetting derivative from a banking
counterparty. Derivatives are entered into with banking counterparties, which minimises credit risk
further, as the Group is only exposed to the net position of its derivative assets and liabilities and this
position is collateralised on a daily basis. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is illustrated in
the ﬁnancial assets table in note 15.
Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as
they fall due. Extensive controls are in place to ensure that this liquidity risk is mitigated. The Group’s
liquidity requirements are constantly reviewed, and the Group employs stress testing to model the
suﬃciency of its liquidity in stressed market scenarios. Clients’ ability to pay margin and settle contracts
is monitored in real-time, with automated triggers and alerts conﬁgured into the Group’s systems. The
Group maintains cash reserves and continues to increase these reserves relative to its trading activity
on an on-going basis.
It is the Board’s responsibility to set appropriate limits to the liquidity risk of the Group, as well as
ensuring that a strong system of internal controls is implemented and enforced, whilst the daily
management of liquidity risk rests with the Head of Product and Liquidity Risk (overseen by its CFO). The
Group manages its liquidity on a trade by trade basis, rejecting any trade that has the potential to harm
its liquidity and maintains robust margin terms with its clients that require them to deposit margin if
their forward contracts adversely deviate in fair value. The Group also attempts to ensure it maintains
(as closely as is possible) a balanced position in each currency, with regular stress testing of its net long
or short in a particular currency against sudden and unforeseen market movements (“Black Swan
Events”).
The Head of Product and Liquidity Risk is responsible for implementing and monitoring the relevant
controls, and for providing the CFO with timely and accurate reporting on the Group’s liquidity position
and ﬁnancial performance (e.g. budget against actual). In conjunction with the CFO, they are also
responsible for ensuring the Group has capital and liquidity resources, in suﬃcient amount and quality,
to meet its liabilities as they fall due and to support its growth and strategic objectives.
The Group has suﬃcient cash resources (alongside additional borrowing facilities with its banking
partner) to pay its debts and contractual liabilities as they fall due. Consequently, management does not
believe that the Group has a material exposure to liquidity risk.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a ﬁnancial instrument or cash ﬂows associated with the
instrument will ﬂuctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from
interest-bearing ﬁnancial assets and liabilities used by the Group. Interest-bearing assets comprise cash
and cash equivalents which are considered to be short term liquid assets. It is the Group’s policy to
settle derivative ﬁnancial liabilities arising from contracts with customers (included within trade
payables) and other payables within the credit terms allowed and the Group does not therefore incur
interest on overdue balances.
All borrowings are subject to ﬁxed interest rates until maturity. The £300,000 overdraft facility is subject
to ﬂoating interest at 4.75% above the Bank of England base rate. A change in interest rates would not
directly have a material impact on proﬁt or equity and therefore a sensitivity analysis for the impact of
interest rate changes has not been disclosed.

17. Financial risk management (continued)
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk refers to the risk that non-sterling revenue earned on a transaction may ﬂuctuate
due to changes in foreign currency rates. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue and
cash holdings that are denominated in a currency other than sterling. The principal currencies giving
rise to this risk vary each year depending on the currency of transactions undertaken by the Group.
Details of the foreign currency cash balances can be found in note 19.
The Group manages its exposure to currency movements in line with its Treasury Policy. Client money
received in a foreign currency is deposited in a bank account of the same currency to provide a natural
hedge. The Group reduces its exposure to foreign exchange by retranslating excess cash in foreign
currencies into sterling on a regular basis. The Group hedges a proportion of its unrealised proﬁts
through foreign exchange contacts designated as at fair value through proﬁt and loss.
Foreign currency risk – sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal recurring foreign currency transactions are in Euros. Other foreign currency
transactions that occur in other currencies including US Dollar and Australian Dollar, are ad-hoc in
nature with foreign currency balances being held for short periods of time, resulting in minimal risk to
the business. The Group has therefore considered the sensitivity to movements in the Sterling/Euro
exchange rate by considering the impact on those revenues, costs and assets denominated in Euros as
experienced in the given period.
                                                                                 Impact on proﬁt after tax                                   Impact on equity

10% strengthening in the £/€ 
exchange rate                                                  (265,322)                  (273,541)                    (265,322)                   (273,541)
The impact of a change of 10% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current
level of exchange rates and the volatility observed both on a historical basis and market expectations
for future movement. When applied to the closing sterling/euro exchange rate of €1.1249/£ (2016:
€1.169) this would result in a weakened exchange rate of €1.0124/£ (2016: €1.0521) and a
strengthened exchange rate of €1.2374/£ (2016: €1.2859/£).
Management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to maximise shareholder value whilst safeguarding
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group’s policy is to maintain a capital base and funding structure that maintains creditor, regulator
and market conﬁdence and provides ﬂexibility for business development whilst also optimising returns
to shareholders.
The entity monitors its total capital as its total equity as shown in the statement of ﬁnancial position.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares or adjust the
dividends paid to shareholders.

The following movements of share capital occurred during the year ended 31 December 2016:

760 new 'A' ordinary shares and 138 new 'B' ordinary shares with a nominal value of £1 were issued at
par. The A shares were issued pro-rata on the basis of existing shareholdings in order to maintain the
split of shares between certain shareholders. The 138 ‘B’ shares were issued as consideration for
shares repurchased from a non-controlling interest shareholder in Alpha FX Limited.
On 10 November 2016, the Company repurchased and cancelled 40 'A' ordinary shares and 20 'B'
ordinary shares. On 14 November 2016, the Company issued 31 'C' Ordinary shares and 109 'D'

Share premium account

admission to the London Stock Exchange, amounting to £13,000,000, less the directly attributable
costs of issuing of the new equity, amounting to £762,049. 
Capital redemption reserve
The reserve of £3,701 arose following the buy-back of shares in both the year ended 31 December
2016 and the year ended 31 December 2017.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve was created in October 2016 as a result of the share for share exchange with non-
controlling interests. The merger relief reserve represents the diﬀerence between the fair value and
nominal value of shares issued on the acquisition of non-controlling interests, where the Company has
taken advantage of merger relief.
Retained earnings
Represents all other net gains and losses and transactions not recognised elsewhere.
21. Transactions with non-controlling interests in prior year
In the year ended 31 December 2016, the Company repurchased 25% of the issued share capital
Alpha FX Limited from a non-controlling interest for a total consideration of £1,000,000. Dividends due
to the 25% non-controlling interest were waived at on 31 March 2016. The 60 Ordinary A shares
purchased from the non-controlling interest were subsequently cancelled which had the eﬀect of
increasing the remaining shareholding of the non-controlling interest from 10% to 13.3%.
In October 2016, the Company repurchased the remaining 13.3% of the issued share capital of Alpha
FX Limited at par value of £2,300 from a non-controlling interest. The consideration was satisﬁed by
the issue of 138 shares in the Company at par. The merger reserve represents the diﬀerence between
fair value of the shares issued by the Company which was assessed to be £666,667 and the nominal
value of the shares of £138.

earnings movement. An amount of £260,759 was credited to retained earnings on the repurchase of a
25% non-controlling interest in March 2016. An amount of £31,701 was charged to retained earnings
on the cancellation of shares in the subsidiary in March 2016 and a further £173,081 was credited to
retained earnings on the repurchase of a 13.3% non-controlling interest in October 2016. With eﬀect

26. Share-based payments
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled
transactions). 
Under the Growth Share Scheme, selected employees of the Group have been issued with B shares in
Alpha FX Limited. The rights attaching to the B shares include a put option which, when exercised,
enable the shareholder to convert the B shares into ordinary shares of the Company. The rate of
conversion is that the B shares will be regarded as worth a pro rata share of the gain above a speciﬁc
hurdle set at £25m. The B shares will vest in 5 equal annual instalments starting on 31 December 2017
until 31 December 2021. Vesting requires 30% revenue growth per annum for the ﬁrst three years and
20% revenue growth per annum in years four and ﬁve. Conversion each year is following the publication
of the audited ﬁnancial statements of Alpha FX Limited. The share options granted will not vest if
performance conditions are not met.
Providing the vesting conditions have been met, the Company will issue shares in consideration of the
B shares based on the average share price of the Company over the 60 days prior to the exercise of the
put option. The B shares were subscribed for at nominal value with the employee settling the applicable
tax based on the market value at the date of grant. 
In the year ended 31 December 2017 awards were made of 2,073 B shares in Alpha FX Limited (2016:
nil), representing 10.7% of the issued share capital. The fair value was calculated using a Monte-Carlo
simulation model. The model considers historical and expected dividends, and the share price volatility
of the Group relative to that of its competitors, to predict the share performance. The share-based
payment charge of the Growth Shares awarded during the year ended 31 December 2017 was
£399,685 (2016: £nil).
Based on share price of the Company of 487.5p at 31 December 2017, it is estimated upon exercise of
the put options in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company will issue 565,387
shares.
Under the original terms of the Growth Share Scheme, the B Shares allotted to participants would vest
in three equal tranches, occurring annually, starting on 31 December 2017 until 31 December 2019.
Vesting would require 30 per cent revenue growth per year, meaning that full vesting would require
three-year compound growth of 120 per cent. After consultations with participants in the scheme it was
extended to 5 years. However, in line with IFRS2, the charges incurred by Alpha FX will still be recognised
over the original three-year period, assuming modiﬁcation has not occurred.

26. Share-based payments (continued)
When determining the grant date fair value of awards, service and non-market performance conditions
are not taken into account. However, the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance
conditions are reﬂected within the grant date fair value. 
The inputs used for fair valuing the awards granted during the year were as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                              31 December

In the year ended 31 December 2017, an award was made to a Director under an unapproved option
agreement of 57,297 share options at an exercise price of £0.002 per option share which are
exercisable between 3 April 2018 and 3 April 2020. The fair value of the option granted during the year
was £82,687 which was calculated using a Black Scholes model. The inputs used for fair valuing this
award were expected volatility of 25%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.09% and a one year option life.
The Group recognised total expenses related to the above equity-settled share-based payment
transactions in the year ended 31 December 2017 of £482,372 (2016: £nil).

29. Subsequent events
On 20 March 2018 the Group launched a new business division, ‘Alpha Institutional’, whose focus is on expanding
Alpha’s service oﬀering to fund and institutional clients. 
In order to incentivise key personnel a newly formed subsidiary has been incorporated under Alpha FX Limited, the
Group’s existing subsidiary and main trading entity. The share capital of the new subsidiary is 60% owned by Alpha
FX Limited, with the balance split between ﬁve key individuals. Commencing three full years following incorporation,
the individuals will have the option to convert a percentage of their shareholding into Group shares each year,
based upon strict performance criteria. At conversion, and in exchange for converting their shares into the Group,
Alpha FX Limited’s shareholding over Alpha FX Institutional Limited will commensurately increase.
On 20 March 2018 the Company determined that following the vesting of shares under the Growth Share Scheme
for the year ended 31 December 2017, it would be issuing 565,387 shares on 27 March 2018. The number of
shares to be issued is based on the average share price in the 60 days prior to vesting of 508.1p.

1. Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and with Financial
Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements (“FRS 100”) and Financial
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”).
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions
conferred by FRS 101. Therefore these ﬁnancial statements do not include:

•  certain disclosures regarding the Company’s capital;
•  a statement of cash ﬂows;
•  the eﬀect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
•  the disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel; and
•  disclosures of related party transactions with other wholly-owned members of Alpha FX Group plc
group of companies.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 101 ﬁnancial instrument disclosure exemptions have been
adopted because equivalent disclosures are included in the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial
statements. These ﬁnancial statements do not include certain disclosures in respect of:
•  Share based payments;
•  Financial instruments (other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording ﬁnancial
instruments at fair value); or
•  Fair value measurement other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording ﬁnancial
instruments at fair value.
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared in pounds sterling which is the functional currency of the Group.

a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the AGM and you should
have received a Form of Proxy with this Notice of Meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the
procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the Form of Proxy.

Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the AGM or another person as your proxy using the Form
of Proxy are set out in the notes to the Form of Proxy. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf
at the AGM you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your
instructions directly to them.

to diﬀerent shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one
share. To appoint more than one proxy, please contact the registrar of the Company.

of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain
from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks
ﬁt in relation to any other matter which is put before the AGM.

only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined
by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members
in respect of the joint holding (the ﬁrst-named being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
11  To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set
out above. Note that the cut oﬀ time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also apply in
relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-
oﬀ time will be disregarded.
12  Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the
instructions using another hard-copy Form of Proxy, please contact Equiniti Limited at Aspect
House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA.
13  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the
latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Termination of proxy appointments
14  In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed
hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Equiniti Limited
at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA. In the case of a member which is
a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf
by an oﬃcer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other
authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certiﬁed copy of such power or
authority) must be included with the revocation notice. The revocation notice must be received by
Equiniti Limited no later than 10.00 a.m. on 9 May 2018.
15  If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time
speciﬁed then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy appointment will remain valid.
16  Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the AGM and voting in person. If you
have appointed a proxy and attend the AGM in person, your proxy appointment will automatically
be terminated.
Corporate representatives
17  A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may
exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate
representative exercises powers over the same share.

appointment service may do so for the AGM and any adjournment by using the procedures

248225 Alpha FX_pp74-end.qxp  03/04/2018  14:35  Page 82 19  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the
appropriate CREST message (a CREST proxy instruction) must be properly authenticated in
accordance with Euroclear’s speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such
instructions, as described in the CREST manual. All messages relating to the appointment of a proxy
or an instruction to a previously appointed proxy must be transmitted so as to be received by
Equiniti Limited (ID RA19) no later than 10.00 a.m. on 9 May 2018. It is the responsibility of the
CREST member concerned to take such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers, are referred, in
particular, to those sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST
system and timings. The Company may treat a CREST proxy instruction as invalid in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.

248225 Alpha FX_pp74-end.qxp  03/04/2018  14:35  Page 83 Explanation of the Resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 10 are proposed as ordinary resolutions.  This means that for each of those resolutions
to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 11 is proposed as a special resolution.  This means that for this resolution to be passed, at
least three quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1: Approval of Annual Report and Accounts
Resolution 1 proposes that the Company’s annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017,
together with the directors’ report and auditor’s report on these accounts be received, considered and
adopted (“Annual Report and Accounts”). The Company’s Annual Report and Accounts will be posted
to shareholders on 4 April 2018 and will be available online at
https://www.alphafx.co.uk/investors/ﬁnancial-information/reports-and-accounts/ for download and
printing from such date.
Resolutions 2 to 6: Re-election of directors
Resolutions 2 to 6 deal with the re-election of directors, who shall each retire as directors in accordance
with the Articles of Association and, being eligible, oﬀer themselves for re-election as directors of
the Company.
Biographical details for each of the directors are available online at
https://www.alphafx.co.uk/investors/directors/ 
Resolutions 7 and 8: Re-appointment and remuneration of auditor
Resolution 7 relates to the re-appointment of BDO LLP as the Company’s auditor to hold oﬃce until the
next annual general meeting of the Company whilst resolution 8 will be proposed to authorise the
directors to set the auditor’s remuneration.
Resolution 9:  Payment of ﬁnal dividend
Resolution 9 proposes the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.4 pence per ordinary share in the capital of
the Company.  An interim dividend of 1.5p per ordinary share was paid in October 2017, giving a total
dividend for the ﬁnancial year of 4.9p per ordinary share. 
Resolution 10: Allotment of share capital
Resolution 10 grants the directors general authority to allot ordinary shares in the capital of the
Company or to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, such shares in the Company
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £22,000, representing approximately 33 per cent. of the
Company’s current issued ordinary share capital.
Resolution 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 requires that on an allotment of new shares for cash, such
shares must ﬁrst be oﬀered to existing shareholders in proportion to the number of shares that they
each hold at that time.  The directors believe that there may be circumstances when it is in the best
interests of the Company to allot new ordinary shares either on an entirely non-pre-emptive basis or in
a way that departs from the statutory requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006.
Accordingly, resolution 11 grants the directors general authority to allot equity securities for cash (a) in
connection with a rights issue, open oﬀer, scrip dividend, scheme or other pre-emptive oﬀer, and (b)
otherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to £6,552, representing approximately 10 per cent.
of the Company’s current issued ordinary share capital, as if section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 did
not apply to any such allotment.
