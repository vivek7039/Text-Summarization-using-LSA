This year we have achieved strong progress 
against the strategic priorities that we identified 
despite a challenging and uncertain environment. 
Through this strategic focus we have increased 
our market share, evidenced through our 
like-for-like sales
a
 outperformance of the market 
this year and have taken steps to position the 
Group well for the year ahead. 
I	am	delighted	by	the	increasing	momentum	in	our	sales	performance 	
during	a	period	which	has	seen	mixed	results	across	the	sector.	The	cost 	
headwinds	facing	the	industry	have	impacted	profits	as	we	expected 	
and	our	adjusted	earnings	per	share
a
	were	down	1.4%	as	a	result. 	
However,	I	am	encouraged	by	the	results	across	the	business	which 	
show	success	in	the	steps	being	taken	to	better	position	the	Group 	
in	the	evolving	market. 	
This	year	the	Directors	are	recommending	the	payment	of	a	final	dividend 	
of	5.0p	per	share	making	a	total	of	7 .5p	for	the	year.	Given	the	uncertain 	
macro	environment	it	is	our	intention	going	forward	to	determine	a	full 	
year	dividend	paid	only	in	the	form	of	a	final	dividend	dependent	on 	
several	 factors	 including	 both	 current	 performance	 and	 future	 prospects.
On	behalf	of	the	Board	I	would	like	to	thank	our	46,000	people	across 	
the	business,	without	whom	the	progress	made	over	the	course	of	the 	
year	would	not	be	possible.	Now,	more	than	ever,	our	people	are 	
demonstrating	the	ability	to	adapt	to	the	ever-changing	environment 	
we	operate	in,	all	the	while	continuing	to	delight	guests	and	offer 	
great	 experiences.	
We	take	our	responsibilities	to	pensioners	seriously.	In	July	we	reached 	
an	agreement	on	the	2016	triennial	pensions	valuation	with	the	scheme 	
trustees.	This	resulted	in	an	unchanged	level	of	cash	contributions 	
through	to	2023	to	eliminate	the	scheme	deficit	with	a	potential	additional 	
payment	of	£13m	to	be	made	into	escrow	in	2024	should	further	funds 	
be	required	then.	I	am	delighted	that	we	reached	a	positive	agreement 	
for	both	the	Group	and	the	trustees.
There	have	been	no	changes	to	the	Board	during	the	year.	I	remain 	
pleased	with	its	composition	and	I	believe	we	have	the	right	balance 	
of	skills	to	drive	the	business	forward.
Our	market	continues	to	be	challenged	by	increasing	external	cost 	
headwinds	and	macro	uncertainty.	In	this	context,	we	shall	remain 	
focused	on	the	identified	strategic	priorities	which	best	position	the 	
Group	to	grow	long-term	shareholder	value.

 WELL PLACED  
TO DELIVER 
CONTINUED 
OUTPERFORMANCE 
This	year	has	been	a	period	of 	
strong	operational	achievement	for 	
Mitchells	&	Butlers	with	a	sustained 	
return	to	like-for-like	sales	growth. 	
Phil Urban 
Chief Executive
14 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 It is now two years since I became CEO of 
Mitchells & Butlers, and I feel that we have 
covered a lot of ground. When new to the role, 
we were feeling the pain from all the new supply 
that had opened on our doorsteps over the 
previous 18 months. 
Our	sales	were	declining,	we	were	tracking	c.3%	behind	our	competitors 	
as	measured	by	the	Peach	Tracker,	and	with	unprecedented	cost 	
headwinds	on	the	horizon,	we	knew	we	had	to	do	something	different. 	
We	laid	out	our	three	strategic	priorities	that	we	felt	we	needed	to 	
address,	that	we	continue	to	work	towards	today,	namely	rebalancing 	
our	portfolio;	driving	a	commercial	edge	to	the	way	we	do	business; 	
and	also	instilling	an	innovation	ethos	across	all	that	we	do. 	
In	February	2016,	we	launched	a	programme	of	work	designed	to	meet 	
these	priorities,	which	I	believe	is	now	bearing	real	fruit.	Unashamedly, 	
our	first	objective	was	to	restore	the	business	to	sales	growth,	as	without 	
that,	it	was	difficult	to	see	how	we	could	move	forward. 	
It	is	this	programme	of	work	that	has	driven	the	sales	recovery,	with	the 	
capital	investment	programme,	our	sales	training	and	ethos,	and	our 	
investment	in	and	adoption	of	reputation.com	as	our	tool	to	listen	to	our 	
guests,	coupled	with	better	informed	pricing	decisions,	being	the 	
driving	forces.
We	cannot	and	will	not	let	up	on	the	drive	to	grow	sales.	However,	we 	
think	we	have	identified	the	right	levers	that	will	continue	to	strengthen 	
our	position.	Despite	this	progress,	we	still	saw	our	profit	decline	last	year 	
and	so	attention	more	latterly	has	been	focused	on	the	opportunities	we 	
have	to	drive	efficiency.	To	that	end,	we	have	numerous	initiatives	that 	
we	have	been	working	on,	that	we	believe	will	start	to	change	the 	
gearing	of	our	business.
The	strategic	report	that	follows	updates	you	on	our	progress	against 	
the	three	strategic	priorities	in	the	year;	outlines	our	current	view	of	the 	
market	in	which	we	operate;	details	our	financial	performance	in	the 	
period;	and	updates	you	on	our	priorities	for	2018. 	
Overall,	I	believe	that	the	progress	we	have	made	in	the	year,	and	the 	
initiatives	we	have	in	place	going	forward,	leave	us	well-placed	to	deliver 	
continued	 market	 outperformance	 as	 well	 as	 long	 term	 shareholder	 value.
Over the last year we have made further progress against 
our three strategic priorities which were introduced to 
address a period of like-for-like sales
a
 declines and market 
under-performance: 
•	 To build a more balanced business
•	 To instil a more commercial culture
•	 To drive an innovation agenda 
Our	initiatives	in	these	areas	have	been	successful	in	restoring	sales 	
growth	and	mitigating	£26m	of	the	inflationary	cost	headwinds	which 	
we	faced	in	the	past	year.	With	inflationary	costs	continuing	into	the	next 	
financial	year,	our	focus	on	efficiency	remains	at	the	forefront.	To	this	end, 	
we	are	embarking	on	the	second	phase	of	initiatives	and	will	provide	a 	
further	update	on	these	in	May. 	
We	achieved	like-for-like	sales
a
	growth	of	1.8%	in	the	financial	year 	
having	continued	to	build	steadily	on	the	sales	improvement	which 	
began	in	the	second	half	of	FY	2016.	The	improvement	is	partly	driven 	
by	capital,	however	the	uninvested	estate	improved	like-for-like	sales
a
	
trajectory	by	0.6ppts	over	the	course	of	the	year.	This	momentum	has 	
seen	us	consistently	outperforming	the	market.	Although	the	final 	
quarter	was	impacted	by	disappointing	weather,	trading	since	the	year 	
end	has	resulted	in	strengthened	like-for-like	sales
a
	growth	of	2.3%	and 	
we	will	look	to	carry	this	momentum	forward.
As	a	result	of	the	inflationary	cost	pressures,	adjusted	operating	profit
a
	
was	down	3. 1%,	on	a	52	week	basis,	despite	the	positive	sales	trajectory. 	
Our priorities
Building a more balanced business
Our	estate	comprises	over	1,750	pubs	and	restaurants,	of	which	more 	
than	80%	are	freehold	or	long-leasehold.	Our	focus	in	this	area	is	to 	
optimise	the	balance	of	brands	across	the	estate	in	order	to	create 	
long-term	value. 	
We	are	committed	to	improving	the	quality	of	the	estate	by	exposing 	
it	to	more	premium	market	spaces	and	by	improving	overall	amenity. 	
We	conducted	a	full	estate	review	last	year	giving	us	a	plan	for	each	of 	
our	sites.	One	outcome	of	this	review	was	the	disposal	of	79	sites,	which 	
completed	earlier	in	the	year.	A	second	was	the	identification	of	a	section 	
of	the	estate	which	we	believe	may	not	be	positioned	to	generate	value. 	
These	are	predominantly	short	leasehold	sites	in	retail	and	leisure 	
locations,	currently	trading	below	expectations.	Having	reviewed	in	detail 	
the	future	trading	potential	and	brand	or	offer	conversion	options	for	these 	
sites	this	year,	we	have	concluded	that	several	are	unlikely	to	generate	a 	
positive	return	over	the	remaining	life	of	their	lease.	We	have	reflected 	
this	judgement	in	an	increased	onerous	lease	provision	this	year.

business	is	through	growth	of	Miller	&	Carter,	our	successful	steakhouse 	
format	which	is	generating	strong	like-for-like	sales.	Over	the	past	year 	
we	have	increased	the	number	of	sites	from	52	to	84,	with	26	of	the 	
additional	sites	facilitated	through	conversions	of	existing	sites,	and	we 	
anticipate	reaching	100	sites	at	the	beginning	of	the	next	calendar	year. 	
Conversions	are	delivering	average	EBITDA	returns	of	more	than	40%, 	
and	we	continue	to	explore	various	new	types	of	locations	for	the	brand. 	
We	also	continue	to	work	on	enhancing	the	amenity	of	other	formats 	
through	our	remodel	programme.	For	example,	we	have	continued 	
to	progress	our	evolution	of	Harvester	through	remodels	offering	a 	
fresh	and	contemporary	design,	bringing	rotisserie	chicken	to	the	fore, 	
as	well	as	a	retargeted	offer	which	is	delivering	sales	uplifts	of	10% 	
following	investment.
During	the	year	we	have	also	focused	investment	on	our 	
accommodation	offer.	We	operate	over	900	rooms	across	52	locations 	
and	believe	we	can	generate	a	strong	return	by	upgrading	the	rooms 	
to	be	more	closely	aligned	with	the	feel	of	the	brand	they	are	attached 	
to,	which	in	most	cases	means	premiumisation	of	the	accommodation. 	
We	have	completed	15	remodels	this	financial	year	with	sales	uplifts	of 	
over	20.0%	following	investment.	We	intend	to	continue	our	investment 	
in	accommodation	next	financial	year	and,	in	addition,	will	complete	the 	
build	of	a	purpose-built	lodge. 	
In	total	we	have	completed	252	remodels	and	conversions	in	FY	2017 	
(FY	2016	252),	which	means	we	are	on	track	to	maintain	the	reduction 	
in	our	redevelopment	cycle	from	11	to	12	years	previously	to	six	to	seven 	
years	now. 	
Instilling a more commercial culture
Instilling	a	commercial	culture	is	critical	to	achieving	profitable	sales 	
growth	and	we	are	pleased	with	the	progress	made	in	this	area	over	the 	
year.	The	four	new	operating	divisions,	each	containing	similar	customer 	
types	and	brands,	introduced	last	year	have	improved	our	guest	focus 	
and	we	have	made	significant	progress	across	a	number	of	initiatives 	
as	evidenced	by	our	like-for-like	sales	improvement. 	
The	growth	of	social	media	has	made	online	reputation	more	important 	
than	ever	and	we	have	made	significant	progress	in	this	area	over	the 	
course	of	the	year.	Using	reputation.com,	an	online	feedback 	
consolidation	tool,	managers	are	now	responding	to	83%	of	the	growing 	
number	of	online	comments,	up	from	59%	a	year	ago.	As	managers	have 	
increased	their	level	of	engagement	with	their	guests	we	have	also	seen 	
average	feedback	scores	increase	over	the	course	of	the	year	with	total 	
net	promoter	score	having	increased	to	7 .8	ppts	to	59%. 	
In	these	times	of	unprecedented	cost	headwinds,	it	is	important	that	we 	
rigorously	identify	and	secure	efficiency	and	cost	saving	opportunities 	
across	the	business.	Our	progress	in	this	area	is	well	advanced	with	cost

 REVENUE BY REGION  
 (FY 2017)
16 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 The	demand	for	food	delivery	within	the	industry	has	remained	in 	
growth	and	we	have	been	positioning	ourselves	in	order	to	benefit 	
from	customers’	changing	habits	which	we	believe	provide	an 	
opportunity	to	capture	incremental	sales.	Over	the	course	of	the	year 	
we	have	increased	the	number	of	sites	offering	Deliveroo	from	25	to	61. 	
We	have	also	carried	out	a	successful	trial	with	JustEat,	allowing	us	to 	
offer	Harvester	and	Toby	Carvery	delivery	as	well	as	click	and	collect. 	
People
As	ever,	people	are	central	to	our	Company’s	success.	We	operate	in	the 	
hospitality	industry	where	the	guest	experience	is	critical	and	cannot	be 	
delivered	without	the	dedication	of	our	46,000	employees.	In	the	face 	
of	numerous	changes	within	the	business,	we	are	pleased	that	our 	
engagement	scores	have	improved	by	2.0	points	and	our	retail	team 	
turnover	has	reduced	by	4. 1	percentage	points.	When	considered	in 	
the	context	of	the	average	cost	of	replacing	each	team	member,	including 	
the	cost	of	recruitment,	management	time	and	training,	this	represents 	
a	significant	cost	saving.
Our	apprentice	scheme	is	vitally	important	to	us.	We	believe	these 	
young	people	are	the	lifeblood	of	the	industry	and	we	are	delighted 	
to	have	added	a	further	1,300	people	to	our	programme	during	the 	
financial	 year.
A	further	advancement	in	this	area	is	the	launch	of	our	new	online 	
training	platform	containing	a	complete	library	of	training	materials	and 	
with	the	ability	to	plan	and	track	development.	This	resource	allows 	
employees	access	to	materials	which	will	help	them	to	further	their 	
career	as	and	when	they	want	to,	and	also	allows	them	to	learn	remotely 	
using	their	own	device.	The	platform	also	encourages	employees	to 	
connect	and	share	their	learning	experiences	to	encourage	others. 	
Current trading and outlook
In	the	first	seven	weeks	of	the	new	financial	year	like-for-like	sales
a
	 have	
grown	by	2.3%. 	
We	are	pleased	with	the	progress	made	in	the	last	year	having	returned 	
the	Company	to	sales	growth,	consistently	outperforming	the	market. 	
However,	the	market	in	which	we	operate	presents	us	with	an 	
unprecedented	level	of	challenge	and	uncertainty.	Through	this	period 	
we	shall	remain	focused	on	delivering	our	strategy	and	give	priority	to 	
maintaining	both	the	competitiveness	of	our	estate	and	a	strong	balance 	
sheet,	both	of	which	we	believe	will	leave	us	well	positioned	in	the 	
long	term. 	
 
Phil Urban
Chief Executive
a.		 The	Directors	use	a	number	of	alternative	performance	measures	(APMs)	that	are 	
considered	critical	to	aid	understanding	of	the	Group’s	performance.	Key	measures 	
are	explained	on	pages	140	to	142	of	this	report.
savings	of	£26m	delivered	in	FY	2017	and	further	initiatives	identified 	
for	delivery	in	the	current	financial	year.	For	example,	we	have	improved 	
two	key	operational	systems	during	the	year. 	
The	first	is	a	time	and	attendance	labour	system	which	requires	team 	
members	to	clock	in	and	out,	ensuring	that	staff	are	paid	accurately	for 	
the	time	worked,	whilst	also	increasing	deployment	efficiency	through 	
enhanced	planning	tools.	In	addition,	managers	are	able	to	access	the 	
system	from	any	device	and	the	next	stage	of	roll	out	will	include	the 	
capability	for	team	members	to	swap	shifts	and	for	us	to	share	resource 	
across	local	sites. 	
The	second	system	which	we	have	updated	during	the	year	is	our 	
stock	control	system.	This	upgraded	technology	halves	the	time	taken 	
to	do	stock	counts	and	improves	stock	control	ability,	reducing	both 	
the	instances	of	an	item	being	out	of	stock	and	wastage.	The	next	stage 	
of	this	development	is	an	auto	ordering	system	which	is	now	in	trial. 	
In	addition	to	this	activity,	we	continue	to	leverage	our	scale	through 	
our	central	procurement	processes,	meaning	that	we	are	able	to	mitigate 	
a	large	portion	of	the	input	cost	inflation	currently	impacting	the	market. 	
Alongside	our	procurement	efforts,	pricing	and	margin	management 	
remain	critical	activities	within	the	business.	We	are	currently	trialling 	
the	use	of	a	dynamic	pricing	model	in	order	to	challenge	and	to	fine 	
tune	our	pricing	strategy. 	
Our	focus	on	maximising	bookings	continues	and	we	have	now	set	up 	
a	central	bookings	team	to	take	calls	which	are	missed	at	site,	with	the 	
conversion	rate	to	a	booking	of	these	intercepted	calls	at	47%. 	
Food	safety	and	health	and	safety	will	always	remain	a	top	priority	for 	
the	business;	we	are	pleased	therefore	that	our	safety	record	improved 	
during	the	year.	At	the	end	of	the	year	97 .5%	of	our	sites	were	rated 	
good	or	very	good	for	food	hygiene,	a	higher	proportion	than	any 	
other	national	pub	company. 	
Driving an innovation agenda
Technology	continues	to	evolve	at	a	rapid	pace	and	we	have	made	good 	
progress	against	our	digital	strategy	which	positions	us	well	to	benefit 	
from	these	changes.	Technology	now	impacts	each	aspect	of	the	guest 	
journey,	from	learning	about	our	offers	to	experiences	in	site	with	us	and 	
our	ability	to	encourage	guests	to	return.	One	significant	area	of	progress 	
during	the	year	has	been	the	development	of	our	mobile	order	at	table 	
facility,	allowing	guests	to	order	food	and	drinks	from	their	own	devices. 	
This	technology	is	currently	in	trial	in	O’Neill’s	with	a	view	to	roll	out 	
across	the	brand	and	to	identify	opportunities	in	other	brands	for 	
development	and	roll	out.	The	order	at	table	facility	will	be	combined 	
with	our	existing	mobile	payment	platform	within	our	brand	apps, 	
facilitating	a	digital	experience	throughout	the	guest	journey.

Trends	within	the	broader	eating	out	market	are	mixed,	with	the 	
restaurant	sector	overall	seeing	sales	decline	but	with	branded 	
restaurants	experiencing	growth	of	4.5%	in	2017 .	Recent	data	suggests 	
that	consumer	behaviour	is	changing,	with	people	eating	out	less 	
frequently	but	spending	more	when	they	do	make	the	decision	to	go 	
out.	In	addition,	although	restaurant	supply	growth	has	steadied	over 	
the	last	year	the	market	remains	highly	competitive	and,	as	a	result,	levels 	
of	discounting	appear	to	be	increasing	in	some	segments	of	the	market. 	
This	context	helps	inform	our	strategic	priorities	to	keep	our	brands	front 	
of	mind	for	the	guest	through	innovation	and	continuous	development, 	
as	well	as	premiumising,	in	order	to	take	advantage	of	changing 	
customer	 behaviour.	
There	are	unprecedented	cost	headwinds	facing	the	sector,	putting	the 	
focus	on	efficiency	and	maximising	profitable	sales	growth.	In	addition, 	
there	is	also	political	uncertainty	domestically	and	surrounding	the 	
impact	of	the	UK	leaving	the	European	Union.	There	are	three	main 	
areas	on	which	Brexit	may	impact	our	business:	changes	in	consumer 	
confidence;	changes	in	employment	and	immigration	laws;	and	the 	
impact	on	input	costs.	Without	clarity	on	the	terms	of	exit,	the	impact 	
of	the	first	two	remains	relatively	unknown	and	we	continue	to	closely 	
follow	developments	in	these	areas.	Input	costs	will	continue	to	be 	
impacted	by	changes	in	the	value	of	sterling.	While	the	fall	in	the	value 	
of	the	currency	since	the	EU	referendum	has	been	profit	dilutive	we 	
do	have	a	strong	track	record	of	partially	mitigating	input	costs	inflation 	
through	 procurement	 initiatives.
We	believe	that	success	in	our	evolving	market	requires	quality	brands, 	
offering	great	experiences	at	the	right	price	and	with	high	amenity	levels, 	
to	generate	sufficient	sales	growth	to	mitigate	cost	headwinds.

Value proposition
We	create	value	for	our	various	stakeholders	through	the	delivery 	
of	eating	and	drinking	experiences	to	our	guests.	Every	year	we	serve 	
more	than	130	million	meals	and	400	million	drinks	across	our	brands, 	
providing	us	with	the	opportunity	to	engage	with	guests	on	a	daily	basis. 	
With	our	focus	on	guest	experience,	we	currently	collect	more	than 	
46,000	individual	pieces	of	feedback	per	month	providing	us	with	insight 	
to	develop	our	brands	and	offers	across	the	business,	ensuring	that	we 	
provide	the	range	of	experiences	our	guests	are	looking	for.
In	the	long	term,	we	aim	to	maximise	the	opportunity	from	these	guest 	
experiences	through	the	use	of	our	largely	freehold-backed	estate ,	
the	teams	of	people 	working	within	the	Company,	and	the	high-quality 	
practices	which	we	adopt.
Estate
In	total	we	trade	from	more	than	1,750	pubs	and	restaurants,	of	which 	
over	80%	are	owned	under	a	freehold	or	long-leasehold.	The	estate 	
is	predominantly	UK-based,	and	is	nationwide	although	most	heavily 	
concentrated	in	London	and	the	South	East,	the	West	Midlands	and 	
the	North	West. 	
This	array	of	high-quality	locations,	matched	with	our	diverse	brand 	
portfolio,	enables	us	to	match	the	right	concept	to	the	right	trading	asset, 	
as	well	as	offering	a	strong	pipeline	for	future	conversions	as	growth 	
concepts	are	identified.	Our	property	has	a	value	of	£4.4bn	as	at	the	end 	
of	FY	2017 ,	offering	a	stable	and	long-term	opportunity	for	value	creation.
People
We	have	46,000	employees	across	our	pubs	and	restaurants	and	in 	
our	Retail	Support	Centre,	who	are	critical	to	delivering	outstanding 	
experiences	to	our	guests.	Being	in	the	hospitality	sector	our	people	are 	
key	to	delivery	and	evolution	of	our	business	and	also	provide	us	with 	
a	key	point	of	differentiation	from	our	competitors.	Our	people	include 	
those	with	strong	business	and	sector	experience,	as	well	as	new	and 	
enthusiastic	young	talent	who	we	look	to	develop	through	our 	
apprenticeship	programme.	Adopting	a	structured	approach	to 	
recruitment,	driving	high	levels	of	engagement	with	our	existing	teams 	
and	offering	development	and	learning	opportunities	are	key	elements 	
of	our	people	strategy. 	
Practices
Practices	refer	to	the	way	in	which	we	operate	to	best	generate	value 	
throughout	the	business.	This	encompasses	our	use	of	scale	for 	
purchasing	and	operational	efficiency;	sharing	of	ideas	between	similar 	
brands	and	concepts	within	the	portfolio;	adherence	to	the	highest 	
operational	standards;	and	an	increasing	use	of	technology	to	enhance 	
guest	experiences.	We	continuously	strive	to	move	forward	in	all	of 	
these	areas	in	order	to	maximise	the	value	of	the	Company.

 MAXIMISING  
 RETURNS
Our	strategy	aims	to	deliver	long-term 	
sustainable	shareholder	value	through 	
organic	growth.	Our	priority	is	to	maximise 	
the	return	generated	from	our	existing 	
assets,	through	ensuring	we	have	a	balanced 	
estate;	instilling	a	more	commercial	culture; 	
and	growing	through	innovation	and	use 	
of	technology. 	
 1 BUILD A  
 MORE BALANCED  
 BUSINESS
Rationale
•	 To	generate	maximum	value	from	our	estate	of	largely	freehold-
backed	properties.
•	 To	ensure	we	are	exposed	to	the	right	market	segments	by	having 	
the	correct	trading	brand	or	concept	in	each	outlet,	based	on 	
location,	site	characteristics	and	local	demographics.
•	 To	maintain	the	amenity	level	of	the	estate	such	that	we	operate 	
safely	and	remain	competitive	to	guests,	alongside	meeting	cash 	
flow	commitments.
FY 2017 progress
•	 Implementation	of	the	results	of	the	full	estate	review	completed 	
in	FY	2016	which	provided	a	plan	for	each	individual	site	by	year, 	
until	2020.
•	 Invested	in	growth	concepts:	Miller	&	Carter	increased	from	52	to 	
84	sites	through	conversion	and	acquisition	with	average	EBITDA 	
returns	of	more	than	40%,	and	we	converted	46	sites	to	our 	
Stonehouse	format.
•	 Enhanced	the	amenity	through	our	remodel	programme	with 	
Harvester	evolution	investment	delivering	sales	uplifts	of	10% 	
post	 investment.	
•	 Completed	sufficient	projects	to	remain	on	track	to	achieve 	
a	six	to	seven	year	investment	cycle.
•	 Accelerated	the	level	of	investment	in	capital	activity	to	£169m 	
(FY	2016	£167m).
•	 We	acquired	13	sites	and	disposed	of	79	sites	which	did	not	fit 	
into	our	estate	strategy.
FY 2018 priorities
•	 Continue	to	increase	the	premium	element	of	the	estate. 	
•	 Remain	on	course	for	a	six	to	seven	year	investment	cycle	through 	
our	investment	in	remodels	and	conversions.
•	 Make	further	selective	acquisitions	where	we	feel	they	add	value 	
to	the	estate,	and	disposals	where	we	feel	we	have	extracted 	
maximum	value.

MORE COMMERCIAL  
 CULTURE
Rationale
•	 To	ensure	we	focus	on	the	delivery	of	profitable	sales.
•	 To	engage	our	teams	in	delivering	outstanding	guest	experiences.
•	 To	act	quickly	and	decisively	to	remain	competitive	in	our	fast-
changing	 marketplace.
FY 2017 progress
•	 Embedded	the	new	organisational	structure,	consisting	of	four 	
operational	divisions,	each	of	which	is	represented	by	a	Divisional 	
Director	on	the	Executive	Committee.
•	 Progress	made	on	KPIs	of	all	identified	workstreams	which	were 	
set	up	in	order	to	speed	up	decision	making.
•	 Mitigation	of	£26m	of	cost	headwinds	through	efficiency,	removal 	
of	non-guest	facing	costs,	and	pricing	and	promotional	initiatives 	
with	time	and	attendance	and	updated	stock	control	systems 	
introduced	in	the	year.
•	 Focus	on	guest	engagement	through	launch	of	online	feedback 	
consolidation	tool,	with	online	responses	up	from	59%	to	83% 	
in	the	year,	and	engagement	from	managers,	with	net	promoter 	
score	up	7 .8	percentage	points.
•	 Food	safety	and	health	and	safety	improved	with	97 .5%	of	our	sites 	
rated	good	or	very	good	for	food	hygiene,	the	highest	for	a	national 	
pub	company.
FY 2018 priorities
•	 Expand	sales	channels,	including	the	extension	of	home	delivery 	
with	partners,	and	takeaway. 	
•	 Continue	to	focus	on	guest	engagement	and	to	build	on	the 	
benefits	gained	using	the	online	feedback	consolidation	tool.
•	 Continue	to	focus	on	mitigating	cost	headwinds	through	efficiency, 	
the	removal	of	non-guest	impacting	costs	and	pricing	and 	
promotional	 initiatives.

 BUILDING A  
 MORE BALANCED  
 BUSINESS
Last year we completed a full estate review 
of our nearly 1,700 managed predominantly 
freehold sites and we now have a comprehensive 
plan for each of our businesses to ensure we 
have the right brand in the right location. 
Our	aim	is	to	invest	in	each	of	our	sites	every	6-7	years 	
to	ensure	we	upgrade	and	maintain	the	look	and	feel 	
in	an	ever	more	competitive	market. 	
We	therefore	completed	252	projects	in	the	year	with	32 	
Miller	&	Carter	new	sites	as	well	as	34	Harvester	remodels 	
bringing	a	fresh,	contemporary	design	to	the	brand. 	
Inevitably	the	plan	discovered	that	certain	sites	did	not 	
offer	long-term	growth	potential.	We	therefore	sold	79 	
sites	in	the	year	with	limited	long-term	growth	potential.

 INSTILLING  
 A MORE  
 COMMERCIAL  
 CULTURE
Engaged people with the right skills to delight 
guests and deliver long-term growth are 
essential to our strategy.
Last	year	we	introduced	four	new	operating	divisions 	
containing	similar	customer	types	and	brands.	These	have 	
greatly	improved	our	guest	focus.	This,	coupled	with	the 	
workstreams	we	put	in	place	to	support	our	strategy, 	 have	
contributed	to	the	growth	in	like-for-like	 sales	 and	 market	
outperformance	during	the	year.	This	improvement	is 	
evidenced	by	net	promoter	score	growing	by	almost 	
8	percentage	points	in	the	year.
We	are	continuing	our	focus	on	the	delivery 	
of	efficiencies.	This	focus	will	remain	given	the	continuing 	
significant	external	cost	pressures	on	the	business.
26 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017  DRIVING  
 AN INNOVATION  
 AGENDA
We maintained our focus on the delivery of our 
digital strategy over the last year. 
For	example,	significant	progress	has	been	made	on	our 	
mobile	order	at	table	facility,	enabling	guests	to	order	food 	
and	drinks	from	their	devices.
Our	social	media	consolidation	tool,	reputation.com, 	
introduced	last	year	has	started	to	benefit	our	General 	
Managers	and	guests	with	83%	of	online	comments	now 	
being	responded	to,	an	improvement	of	24	percentage 	
points	versus	last	year. 	
We	have	also	increased	the	number	of	sites	with 	
food	delivery	capability	with	61	now	using	Deliveroo, 	
whilst	Harvester	and	Toby	Carvery	are	trialling	JustEat 	
as	well	as	offering	click	and	collect.

Definition 
The	number	of	leavers	in	our	retail	businesses,	expressed	as	a 	
percentage	of	average	retail	employees.	This	like-for-like	measure 	
excludes	site	management.
FY 2017 performance
Retail	staff	turnover	decreased	by	4ppts	to	83%.
Increased	engagement,	recruitment	of	1,300	people	onto	our	apprentice 	
scheme	and	the	launch	of	a	new	online	training	platform	were	all	factors 	
that	contributed	to	the	improvement	in	our	staff	turnover	measure.
Definition 
The	net	promoter	score	for	a	pub	is	defined	as	the	percentage	of 	
responses	where	we	score	9	or	10	out	of	10,	less	the	percentage 	
of	responses	where	we	score	0	to	6	out	of	10	based	on	the	question 	
“How	likely	are	you	to	recommend	this	pub	to	a	friend	and/or	relative?” .
FY 2017 performance
Net	promoter	score	for	FY	2017	was	59,	which	has	increased	from	a	score 	
of	51	in	the	final	quarter	of	FY	2016.
During	FY	2016	we	optimised	our	guest	survey	platform	which	resulted 	
in	a	rebasing	of	the	measurement.
The	improvement	in	the	score	has	been	driven	by	increased 	
engagement	with	our	guests,	with	the	introduction	of	reputation.com, 	
an	online	feedback	consolidation	tool,	enabling	83%	of	comments	online 	
to	be	responded	to	by	our	managers.

The food and drink we serve
As	one	of	the	largest	managed	pub	and	restaurant	operators	in	the	UK, 	
serving	millions	of	meals	and	drinks	every	year,	our	guests	trust	us	to 	
serve	great	food,	at	the	right	price	which	is	safely	prepared	and	cooked; 	
and	to	serve	alcohol	responsibly.
•	 	 We	procure	100%	shell-on	eggs	produced	from	free	range	hens, 	
achieving	this	status	six	months	ahead	of	our	original	target.
•	 	 We	are	a	member	of	a	‘Leadership	Group’	of	companies	preparing 	
a	Code	of	Conduct	for	sugar	reduction	in	the	‘out	of	home’	sector.
•	 	 M&B	named	Food	Service	Operator	of	the	year	at	the	British 	
Poultry	Awards	for	the	fourth	consecutive	year.
•	 	 In	January	2017	Browns	restaurants	began	serving	guests	with 	
100%	British	Red	Tractor	Farm	Assured	beef,	produced	through 	
their	very	own	Browns	Integrated	Beef	Supply	programme.
•	 	 We’re	a	major	funder	of	the	Drinkaware	Trust.
•	 	 We	operate	a	Challenge	21	policy	in	all	our	businesses	across 	
England	and	Wales;	and	a	Challenge	25	policy	in	our	Scottish 	
businesses.
Food sourcing
At	Mitchells	&	Butlers	we	understand	that	our	priority	is	to	procure 	
quality	products,	at	a	competitive	price,	in	guaranteed	quantities. 	
We	want	to	make	sure	that	our	guests	can	make	a	dish	selection	which 	
is	right	for	them,	whatever	the	occasion.	An	important	part	of	this 	
process	is	that	our	guests	trust	us	to	be	honest	about	what	is	in	our	food 	
so	that	they	are	able	to	make	an	informed	choice	and	we	aim	to	make 	
this	information	as	clear	as	possible.	We	also	have	a	responsibility	to 	
our	guests	to	ensure	that	the	food	we	source	has	been	produced	in 	
a	sustainable	and	ethical	manner,	taking	due	regard	for	high	standards 	
of	animal	welfare.
Our	Sourcing	Policy	has	been	developed	to	ensure	that	the	procurement 	
of	all	meat,	poultry	and	finfish	used	within	our	business	is	carried	out	in 	
accordance	with	the	Company’s	ethical	standards	that	operate	across 	
all	our	brands.	Working	closely	with	our	suppliers,	we	aim	to	optimise 	
welfare	standards 	to 	meet 	business 	needs 	and 	satisfy 	guest 	requirements. 	
Guest	insight	research	that	we	conducted,	highlighted	key	areas	that 	
matter	to	our	guests	in	terms	of	animal	welfare,	environmental	impact 	
and	social	equity.	Our	sourcing	policy	sets	out	to	address	these	issues 	
and	confirms	our	intention	to	achieve	the	optimal	standards	possible 	
for	each	of	our	brands.	Led	by	a	cross-functional	team,	reporting	directly 	
to	the	Executive	Committee,	the	sourcing	policy	continues	to	evolve	and 	
is	reviewed	on	a	regular	basis,	to	incorporate	any	changes	in	legislation, 	
procurement	policies	or	business	needs.
Our key achievements in FY 2017:
•	 We	procured	100%	shell-on	eggs	produced	from	free	range	hens, 	
achieving	this	status	six	months	ahead	of	our	original	target.	The 	
business	received	a	Compassion	in	World	Farming	(CIWF)	award 	
in	recognition	of	the	Company’s	commitment	to	the	welfare	of	laying 	
hens,	by	sourcing	cage-free	birds.
•	 The	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Antibiotics	Policy	has	been	agreed,	outlining 	
our	objectives	concerning	the	use	of	antibiotics	in	livestock	production.
•	 Our	sourcing	policy	has	been	integrated	within	the	Company 	
Technical	Guide	for	Food	Suppliers,	recognising	the	importance 	
of	animal	welfare	within	our	food	production	standards.
•	 A	cross-functional	working	party	has	been	established	to	collate	data 	
from	suppliers	regarding	the	current	status	of	the	welfare	standards	in 	
operation	for	farmed	fish,	wild	caught	fish	and	crustaceans	purchased 	
for	use	within	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	estate.
•	 In	January	2017 ,	25	Browns	restaurants	began	serving	guests	with 	
100%	British	Red	Tractor	Farm	Assured	beef,	produced	through	their 	
own	Browns	Integrated	Beef	Supply	programme.	In	recognition	of 	
the	great	quality	beef	produced	from	this	scheme,	Browns	won	both 	
a	Silver	and	Bronze	award	at	the	World	Steak	Challenge	2017 .

30 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Allergens
We	are	committed	to	ensuring	that	customers	who	suffer	from	allergies 	
are	provided	with	the	information	they	need	to	make	an	informed	choice 	
about	the	suitability	of	the	food	we	serve	for	their	own	circumstances. 	
We	have	improved	the	format	of	the	allergen	information	provided	on 	
our	websites	and	included	filters	so	that	customers	can	see	the	dishes 	
that	do	not	contain	an	allergen	as	an	ingredient.	We	continually	review 	
our	service	cycle	and	retail	staff	training	on	allergens	to	improve	the 	
customer	 experience.
Salt
Over	two	years	ago	our	brands	replaced	standard	salt	used	in	salt 	
shakers	on	the	tables	in	restaurants	and	to	season	food	back	of	house, 	
with	a	mineral	salt	containing	15%	less	sodium	than	standard	salt	and 	
which	is	high	in	magnesium,	thereby	delivering	on	our	commitment 	
to	the	Government	Responsibility	Deal	pledge	to	support	and	enable 	
consumers	to	reduce	their	dietary	salt	intake.
Sugar
We	continue	to	actively	engage	with	Public	Health	England	and	our 	
trade	association,	the	British	Hospitality	Association,	to	determine	the 	
best	way	to	meet	the	objectives	of	the	UK	Government’s	Childhood 	
Obesity	Strategy	within	our	sector.
Nutrition
We	continue	to	look	for	the	most	effective	way	to	present	nutritional 	
information	to	our	guests	across	our	portfolio	of	brands.	By	using	our 	
guest	insight	to	understand	better	our	guests’	preferences	and	priorities, 	
we	can	develop	our	nutritional	messaging	to	ensure	it	remains	effective. 	
We	believe	our	focus	should	be	on	communicating	ingredients,	healthy 	
cooking	techniques,	the	freshness	of	our	food	and	providing	healthier 	
options	to	enable	our	guests	to	make	an	informed	choice	when	eating 	
with	us.
We	publish	the	nutritional	information	for	our	menus	on	our	websites 	
for	All	Bar	One,	Ember	Inns,	Harvester,	Premium	Country	Pubs,	Toby 	
Carvery,	Suburban	Pubs	and	Vintage	Inns.	For	example,	this	year	we 	
launched	specific	menus	in	All	Bar	One	for	Veganuary	and	Browns 	
has	developed	a	special	gluten	free	menu.
Nutritional	information	is	provided	as	a	guide	and	values	are	calculated 	
using	detailed	recipes	that	include	weights	and	measures, 	
manufacturers’	nutrition	data	and	laboratory	data	where	required. 	
We	have	invested	significantly	in	technical	processes	and	systems	to 	
incorporate	the	requirements	of	Regulation	(EU)	No.	1169/2011	on	the 	
provision	of	food	information	to	consumers.	We	follow	both	regulatory 	
and	best	practice	advice,	to	ensure	the	information	is	as	accurate	as 	
possible	and	helps	our	guests	make	the	most	informed	choice	to	suit 	
their	dietary	needs	and	preferences. 	
It	is	now	a	mandatory	requirement	for	all	suppliers	to	Mitchells	&	Butlers 	
to	provide	nutritional	information	for	every	food	product,	and	to	follow 	
Company	policy	on	the	provision	of	accurate	nutrition	data.	This	enables 	
our	chefs	to	have	the	detail	required	to	design	and	improve	dishes	that 	
meet	the	specific	nutritional	requirements	of	our	guests.

STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  88  TO  139 OTHER  INFORMATION  140  TO  144 In	addition,	this	year	we	have	committed	to	Public	Health	England’s 	
Sugar	Reduction	Programme	for	our	family	brands	Harvester,	Toby 	
Carvery,	Sizzling	Pubs	and	Stonehouse.	We	are	focusing	on	reducing 	
sugar	in	some	of	our	higher	sugar	desserts	through	dish	reformulation. 	
We	continue	to	support	and	enable	our	customers	to	eat	and	drink	fewer 	
calories	through	product	and	menu	reformulation,	reviewing	portion 	
sizes,	education	and	information.
Children’s menus
In	response	to	the	growing	concern	over	childhood	obesity,	we 	
developed	our	own	Children’s	Food	Standards	that	were	implemented 	
across	all	brands	from	Spring	2016.	We	continue	to	optimise	our 	
children’s	offer	and	update	the	standards	with	new	Public	Health 	
Guidance	following	the	Government’s	Childhood	Obesity	Plan. 	
The	standards	incorporate	best	practice	and	recommendations	from 	
leading	health	charities	such	as	The	Soil	Association	and	have	been 	
developed	in	consultation	with	the	School	Food	Standards,	Government 	
Buying	Standards	and	established	dietary	recommendations	for	children.
Food safety
We	place	great	importance	on	the	Food	Hygiene	Ratings	Scores	of	our 	
pubs,	bars	and	restaurants	and	we	have	made	a	commitment	to	increase 	
the	number	of	our	businesses	that	achieve	a	4	or	5-star	Food	Hygiene 	
Rating,	taking	a	zero-tolerance	approach	to	anything	below.	It	is	pleasing 	
that	at	the	year	end,	97 .5%	of	our	sites	were	rated	either	good	or	very 	
good	for	food	hygiene,	a	higher	proportion	than	any	other	national 	
pub	company.
Signposting healthier options
In	partnership	with	Campden	BRI,	a	food	and	drinks	research	service, 	
we	developed	a	guide	to	help	position	our	brands	as	leaders	in	the 	
industry	for	healthier	options	and	to	enable	guest	communication 	
that	is	on	trend,	truthful,	substantiated	and	legally	compliant.
This	best	practice	guide	translates	the	regulations	and	relevant	codes 	
of	practice	into	user-friendly	language	to	support	the	development	and 	
communication	of	commercially	viable	healthier	options	that	comply 	
with	all	relevant	regulations	and	do	not	mislead	the	guest.
Several	of	our	brands	have	increased	their	range	of	healthier	options, 	
and	supported	these	with	nutrition	and	health	information,	to	make 	
them	easily	identifiable	to	the	health-conscious	guest.	Examples	include: 	
Toby	Carvery’s	signposting	of	a	range	of	menu	options	which	are	low	in 	
saturated	fat	and	contain	500	calories	or	fewer;	and	All	Bar	One’s	range 	
of	calorie	controlled	options,	with	the	energy	content	published	on	the 	
menu	copy,	whilst	dishes	high	in	protein,	omega-3	and	‘lighter’	options 	
are	also	signposted.
Responsibility Deal partnership 
We	are	committed	partners	of	the	Government’s	Responsibility	Deal, 	
and	remain	focused	on	delivering	our	pledges	relating	to	artificial 	
trans	fats	and	salt	reduction,	which	is	now	under	the	remit	of	Public 	
Health	England.

engagement	 scores.	
Diversity 
We	are	committed	to	providing	equal	opportunities	for	all	of	our 	
employees.	Our	employee	Diversity	Policy	ensures	that	every	employee, 	
without	exception,	is	treated	equally	and	fairly	and	that	all	employees	are 	
aware	of	their	responsibilities.
The	policy	confirms	that	there	will	be	no	direct	or	indirect	discrimination 	
in	respect	of	age,	disability,	religious	belief,	gender,	sexual	orientation, 	
race,	colour,	marital	status,	political	belief	and	nationality,	or	any	other 	
category	defined	by	law	in	all	aspects	of	employment	including 	
recruitment,	promotion,	and	opportunities	for	training,	pay	and	benefits.
The	following	table	sets	out	our	diversity	balance	as	between	men	and 	
women	at	the	end	of	FY	2017 .

Mitchells	&	Butlers	is	fully	engaged	with	the	Food	Standards	Agency 	
and	supports	the	Regulating	Our	Future	initiative.	The	Company’s	Head 	
of	Safety	has	been	appointed	to	the	Expert	Advisory	Panel	(Industry) 	
for	the	Food	Standards	Agency	as	part	of	this	project	and	is	assisting 	
the	agency	as	it	develops	a	future	model	for	Food	Safety	Enforcement 	
in	England,	Wales	and	Northern	Ireland.
The	Company’s	Head	of	Safety	also	chairs	the	British	Hospitality 	
Association	(BHA)	Food	Group	and	earlier	this	year	was	instrumental	in	the 	
publication	by	the	BHA	of	the	Industry	Guide	to	Good	Hygiene	Practice.
The	Company	supports	the	development	of	the	BHA	Assured	Catering 	
Scheme	and	wishes	to	see	a	robust,	fair	and	sustainably	funded	scheme 	
that	informs	Food	Hygiene	Ratings	standards.
Food Crime 
The	Company	is	aware	of	the	risks	from	food	crime	and	is	working	on 	
a	research	project	with	Birmingham	University	on	the	use	of	technology 	
(NIR	Spectroscopy)	to	screen	products	for	authenticity.
Serving alcohol responsibly
The	responsible	operation	of	our	pubs	and	restaurants	is	central	to	the 	
culture	of	our	business.	Our	Alcohol	&	Social	Responsibility	Policy	has 	
now	been	in	place	for	over	a	decade,	and	lays	down	best	practice	about 	
serving	alcohol	responsibly	in	England	and	Wales,	and	Scotland 	
including	team	training,	responsible	pricing	and	promotions.
Mitchells	&	Butlers	operates	the	Challenge	21	policy	in	all	our	businesses 	
across	England	and	Wales	(and	a	Challenge	25	policy	in	our	Scottish 	
businesses).	The	policy	requires	that	any	guest	attempting	to	buy	alcohol 	
who	appears	under	the	age	of	21,	must	provide	an	acceptable	form	of 	
proof	of	age	ID	to	confirm	that	they	are	over	18,	before	they	can	be 	
served.	This	policy	forms	part	of	our	regular	training	for	our	employees 	
on	their	responsibilities	for	serving	alcohol.
This	highly	responsible	approach	has	resulted	in	our	businesses	winning 	
a	number	of	Best	Bar	None	awards.	These	awards	are	supported	by	the 	
Home	Office	and	aim	to	promote	responsible	management	and 	
operation	of	alcohol	licensed	premises.
We’re	a	major	funder	of	Drinkaware	Trust.	The	Trust’s	aim	is	to	promote 	
responsible	drinking	by	finding	innovative	ways	to	challenge	the	national 	
drinking	culture.	In	turn,	this	helps	reduce	alcohol	misuse	and	minimise 	
alcohol-related	 harm.

STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  88  TO  139 OTHER  INFORMATION  140  TO  144 Rewarding and recognising our people 
We	acknowledge	the	importance	of	rewards	and	how	important	these 	
tools	are	in	recognising	the	hard	work	and	dedication	of	our	people. 	
Pickaperk,	our	benefits	platform,	continues	to	be	popular	with	our 	
employees,	with	a	spend	on	discounted	goods	of	£1.6m	in	FY	2017 , 	
an	increase	of	£300k	from	the	previous	year.
Many	of	our	employees	continue	to	enjoy	the	‘Dine	with	Us’	programme, 	
where	they	can	access	their	employee	discount	digitally	when	they	eat 	
in	one	of	our	businesses.	Discount	remains	at	33%	for	the	employee	and 	
up	to	five	of	their	guests.
Over	14,820	employees	have	received	an	award	recognising	their 	
service	to	the	business.	Awards	are	made	to	employees	for	achieving 	
service	milestones	between	one	year	and	45	years.	Around	a	further 	
5,230	have	been	recognised	across	the	year	with	specific,	ad	hoc 	
acknowledgements	for	their	contribution	for	a	job	well	done.
Nurturing and developing young talent
In	2017 ,	we	have	continued	to	evolve	our	youth	attraction	strategy	which 	
aims	to	increase	the	quantity	of	young	people	of	16	and	over	joining	the 	
business.	We	are	achieving	this	through	our	partnership	with	Believe 	
in	Young	People	by	recruiting	young	people	for	our	work	experience 	
opportunities	and	working	with	HeadStart	in	local	communities	as	part 	
of	their	programme	to	drive	social	integration	and	youth	employability. 	
These	activities	are	enabling	us	to	position	Mitchells	&	Butlers	as	a 	
credible,	potential	employer	to	a	younger	audience. 	
Our apprenticeships
We	are	proud	to	offer	apprenticeships	nationwide	in	all	our	managed 	
pubs	and	restaurants.	We	have	developed	a	series	of	learning	pathways, 	
which	mean	our	apprentices	can	gain	a	nationally	recognised 	
qualification,	transferable	career	skills	and	on	the	job	training.	Hospitality 	
is	one	of	the	few	industries	where	you	can	very	quickly	progress	from 	
an	apprenticeship	into	a	position	of	management,	therefore	helping 	
us	develop	a	talent	pipeline	and	growing	our	apprenticeship	scheme 	
to	support	our	business	today	and	for	years	to	come.
To	support	our	strategy	internally,	in	FY	2017	Mitchells	&	Butlers 	
launched	Chefs’	Academy,	the	business’	primary	apprenticeship	route 	
to	grow	team	member	culinary	capability;	117	learners	were	attracted	in 	
the	first	year	of	which	50%	will	move	into	next	level	roles.	We	are	already 	
looking	forward	to	recruitment	for	next	year,	with	180	new	learners 	
already	committed	to	the	programme.	The	growth	of	this	programme 	
will	ensure	that	kitchen	employees	at	Mitchells	&	Butlers	have	an 	
apprenticeship	opportunity	that	can	help	elevate	them	to	future	Head 	
Chef	roles	and	provide	the	business	with	confidence	in	our	highly 	
capable	food	workforce.
In	addition,	a	further	1,300	young	people	have	joined	our	business 	
on	hospitality	apprenticeships	this	year	and	over	750	of	our	current 	
employees	have	enrolled	onto	one	of	the	apprenticeship	opportunities 	
open	to	them.	We	are	also	delighted	to	see	over	460	employees 	
successfully	complete	their	first	apprenticeship	in	2017 .	M&B	now 	
has	c. 1,600	active	apprentices	within	the	organisation	and,	whilst	this 	
represents	significant	progress,	we	are	aspiring	to	add	a	further	2,500 	
apprenticeship	starters	in	2018. 	
M&B	now	offer	apprenticeship	opportunities	from	Level	2	through 	
to	Level	5,	which	allows	a	16-year-old	school	leaver	to	join	us	on	an 	
intermediate	apprenticeship	and	progress	through	a	range	of 	
qualifications	culminating	in	a	BA	(Hons)	degree.	We	understand	that 	
there	is	not	one	learning	pathway	which	fits	all	and	therefore	we	are 	
confident	that	we	offer	a	true	alternative	to	a	traditional	academic	route; 	
and	that	we	have	the	building	blocks	in	place	to	help	produce	our 	
business’	leaders	of	the	future. 	
 COMMUNITIES
Local and national fundraising initiatives
•	 	 Over	7 ,700	meals	donated	to	military	personnel	on	Armed 	
Forces	 Day.	
•	 	 Raised	over	£10,000	for	Birmingham	Children’s	Hospital.
•	 	 Nicholson’s	pubs	partnered	with	the	RNLI	Water	Safety	Campaign.
We	are	committed	to	being	a	good	neighbour	and	a	responsible 	
contributor	to	society,	locally	and	nationally,	by	supporting	our 	
communities	with	both	our	time	and	expertise.	We	support	our 	
employees	and	businesses	across	a	spectrum	of	charitable	activity	and 	
fundraising,	enabling	us	to	build	strong	relationships	with	our	guests, 	
our	colleagues	and	our	neighbours	while	giving	back	to	the	communities 	
in	which	we	trade.
Employee donations programme
The	employee	donations	programme	helps	individual	Mitchells	& 	
Butlers’	employees	(and	retired	employees)	support	a	personal	charity 	
event	or	challenge	of	their	choice.	This	year	we	have	donated	around 	
£12,000	through	this	initiative,	to	a	large	number	of	local	and	national 	
causes	including	Cancer	Research	UK,	Great	Ormond	Street	Hospital, 	
Sheffield	Mind,	Parkinson’s	UK,	MS	UK	and	many	more. 	
Payroll Giving
We	have	re-launched	our	Payroll	Giving	programme	with	a	new 	
provider,	which	enables	employees	to	donate	to	their	chosen	charity 	
direct	from	their	pay.	The	Company	has	committed	to	paying	the 	
administration	fee	to	process	each	employee’s	donation,	so	each	charity 	
gets	the	benefit	of	the	full	donation	amount.	Employees	receive	tax	relief 	
on	the	donation. 	
Supporting Marie Curie Care 
Once	again,	businesses	across	our	Nicholson’s,	Vintage	Inns,	Toby 	
Carvery	and	Ember	Inns	brands	worked	together	to	support	the	Marie 	
Curie	Great	Daffodil	Appeal	during	March.	The	restaurants	and	pubs 	
sold	the	famous	daffodil	pins	and	raised	more	than	£6,000	for	the	charity. 	
Big hearted brands, proud to serve those who serve
We	have	continued	to	raise	funds	for	Cancer	Research	UK.	Up	and 	
down	the	country	our	teams	have	been	busy	holding	fundraising	events, 	
all	of	which	have	helped	to	raise	over	£26,000	for	the	charity	this	year.
Vintage	Inns	are	delighted	to	have	joined	forces	with	the	NSPCC	this 	
year	and	are	supporting	the	charity	through	special	discounts	for	its 	
supporters	and	taking	part	in	the	Go	Green	for	Halloween	initiative.
Corporate social responsibility continued
34 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 In	June,	Toby	Carvery	showed	their	support	for	the	armed	forces	by 	
offering	all	military	personnel	a	free	carvery	meal	on	Armed	Forces	Day. 	
The	offer	was	open	to	all	military	personnel,	from	serving	troops	and 	
reserves	to	veterans	and	cadets	and	around	7 ,700	meals	were	donated 	
by	Toby	Carvery	teams	across	the	country. 	
This	summer 	the 	RNLI 	and 	Nicholson’s 	pubs 	joined 	forces 	to 	promote 	the 	
charity’s	Respect	the	Water	campaign.	Across	their	78	sites,	Nicholson’s 	
helped	to	spread	the	safety	messages	as	well	as	donating	money	to	the 	
RNLI	during	the	brand’s	Fish	Festival.	Nicholson’s	developed	a	limited-
edition	fish	menu	just	for	the	partnership	with	50p	from	every	dish	sold 	
being	donated	to	the	RNLI.
All	Bar	One	has	been	working	with	Shelter	since	2016	to	help	support 	
the	charity’s	work	with	millions	of	people	every	year	struggling	with 	
bad	housing	or	homelessness	through	their	advice,	support	and	legal 	
services.	All	Bar	One	supported	Shelter	with	donations	at	Christmas 	
donating	50p	from	every	limited-edition	festive	dish	sold,	as	well	as	other 	
in-bar	activity	during	the	year,	such	as	donations	from	breakfast	items 	
sold.	This	has	resulted	in	£20,000	being	raised	for	Shelter	so	far.
Once	again,	we	supported	the	Royal	British	Legion	Poppy	Appeal 	
selling	thousands	of	poppies	to	raise	funds	for	thousands	of	serving	and 	
ex-Service	people.	Toby	Carvery	has	also	made	the	Royal	British	Legion 	
its	official	charity	partner	for	2017-2018.
Support for Birmingham Children’s Hospital
The	Company	continues	to	support	a	local	charity,	close	to	many 	
colleagues’	hearts,	Birmingham	Children’s	Hospital.	Over	the	past	two 	
years	the	Retail	Support	Centre	Social	Committee	has	organised	a	series 	
of	fundraising	events	for	Birmingham	Children’s	Hospital	including 	
sponsoring	a	bear	as	part	of	the	Midlands’	wide	Big	Sleuth	fundraising 	
activity	which	saw	over	100	bear	sculptures	in	the	city’s	streets,	parks 	
and	open	spaces.	Money	has	also	been	raised	through	a	sky	dive,	a	mud 	
run,	abseils,	leg	waxing,	and	cake	sales.	Over	the	course	of	FY	2017 	
M&B	has	so	far	raised	over	£15,000	and	we	are	looking	forward	to 	
starting	our	third	year	of	fundraising	for	this	cause.
Our environment
•	 	 Energy	efficient	lighting	in	every	pub	and	restaurant.
•	 	 We	recycle	our	cardboard,	glass,	plastic	and	aluminium	waste.
•	 A	network	of	dedicated	energy	champions	across	the	business.
As	a	business	we	successfully	manage	our	energy,	waste	and	water 	
in	a	way	which	is	cost	effective	to	the	business	and	reduces	our	impact 	
on	the	environment.
Energy champions
We	have	dedicated	energy	champions	in	every	district,	who	drive 	
down	consumption	through	proactive	energy	management	from	within 	
our	businesses. 	
Lighting
Our	whole	estate	is	fitted	with	energy	efficient	lighting.	This	has	helped 	
us	to	make	considerable	savings	on	energy	consumption	as	well	as 	
improving	lighting	levels	for	our	guests.
Innovative energy equipment
Smart	meters	are	installed	in	almost	all	our	businesses,	along	with	heat 	
recovery	units	which	have	been	fitted	in	a	number	of	our	cellars.	This	has 	
not	only	allowed	the	recovery	of	heat,	but	also	reduced	maintenance	costs 	
by	allowing	other	equipment	in	the	cellars	to	operate	in	cooler	conditions. 	
We	also	use	free	cellar	air	cooling	systems,	which	draw	in	cool	air	from 	
outside	when	temperatures	drop	below	8˚C	and	turn	off	the	traditional 	
cellar	cooling	process,	saving	a	huge	amount	of	energy	every	day. 	
Many	of	our	kitchens	use	technology	to	control	our	extract	and	air 	
supply	fans	to	ensure	that	they	always	run	at	the	lowest	speed	to 	
minimise	energy	usage.	We	have	added	smart	heating	controls	to 	
compatible	sites	that	allow	for	better	time	and	temperature	control	of 	
our	businesses,	demonstrating	how	the	reduction	of	our	consumption 	
of	energy	is	now	a	fundamental	part	of	our	everyday	business.
Waste management
We	continue	to	drive	successfully	our	waste	disposal	strategy,	focused 	
on	reducing,	re-using	and	effectively	recycling	the	waste	generated	by 	
our	restaurants	and	pubs.	This	captures	recycling	cardboard,	glass,	food 	
and	cooking	oil.	We	are	currently	trialling	the	use	of	‘Too	Good	to	Go’ 	
–	an	initiative	where	surplus	food,	normally	thrown	away	by	one	of	our 	
kitchens,	is	sold	at	a	discounted	rate	to	ensure	it	is	not	wasted.
We	also	use	other	simple	but	effective	products	to	reduce	the	volume 	
of	water	used	in	our	toilets	such	as	Hippo	Bags.

 KEEPING RISK  
 IN CONTROL
36 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Overview 
Risk	management	is	critical	to	our	corporate	responsibilities	and	to	the 	
delivery	of	shareholder	value.	Risk	is	at	the	heart	of	everything	we	do 	
as	an	organisation.	Therefore,	the	process	for	identifying	and	assessing 	
risks	and	opportunities	is	an	integral	and	inseparable	part	of	the 	
management	skills	and	processes	which	are	the	core	of	our	business. 	
There	is	an	established	Risk	Committee	in	place	which	continues 	
to	meet	on	a	quarterly	basis	to	review	the	key	risks	facing	the	business. 	
Key	risks	identified	are	reviewed	and	assessed	by	the	Risk	Committee 	
in	terms	of	their	likelihood	and	impact,	within	the	Group’s	‘Key	Risk	Heat 	
Map’,	in	conjunction	with	associated	risk	mitigation	plans.	The	processes 	
that	are	used	to	identify	and	manage	risks	are	described	in	the	Internal 	
Control	and	Risk	Management	statement	on	pages	60	and	61.
Management	support,	involvement	and	enforcement	is	fundamental 	
to	the	success	of	our	risk	management	framework	and	each	member 	
of	the	Executive	Committee	takes	responsibility	for	the	management 	
of	the	specific	risks	associated	with	their	function.	Our	Group	risk 	
register	clearly	outlines	the	alignment	of	each	key	risk	to	an	Executive 	
Committee	member	and	an	‘action	owner’,	to	ensure	responsibilities 	
are	formally	aligned. 	
Therefore,	there	is	a	robust	and	transparent	process	in	place	to	provide 	
an	appropriate	level	of	direction	and	support	in	the	identification, 	
assessment	and	management	of	those	aspects	of	the	business	which 	
have	the	potential	to	damage	seriously	our	financial	position,	shareholder 	
value,	our	responsibilities	to	our	staff	and	customers,	our	reputation	and 	
our	relationship	with	key	stakeholders.
 1 MARKET RISKS
Risk category and description Controls/mitigating activities Movement
Declining sales performance
This risk falls into three main categories:
Sales:	There	is	a	risk	that	declining	sales, 	
concerns	around	consumer	confidence, 	
increased	personal	debt	levels,	squeezes 	
on	disposable	income	and	rising	inflation 	
together	may	adversely	affect	our	market 	
share	and	profitability,	reducing	headroom 	
against	securitisation	tests.
Consumer and market insight:	If	M&B 	
fails	to	manage	and	develop	its	existing 	
(and	new)	brands	in	line	with	consumer 	
needs	and	market	trends	due	to	failure 	
to	obtain	or	use	sufficient	insight	in	a 	
timely	manner,	this	may	lead	to	a	decline 	
in	revenues	and	profits.
Pricing and market changes:	If	price 	
changes	are	not	intelligently	applied 	
due	to	a	lack	of	appreciation	of	market 	
sensitivities	and	elasticities,	this	may 	
result	in	decreased	revenue	and	profit.
•	 Right	team	and	structure	in	place.	Brand	alignment	ensures	the	right 	
research	gets	done	and	is	acted	on. 	
•	 Daily,	weekly	and	periodic	sales	reporting,	monitoring	and	scrutiny 	
activity	is	in	place.
•	 Our	Eat	Drink	Share	panel	provides	robust,	quick	and	cost	effective 	
research.	This	is	our	own	panel	of	27 ,000	M&B	guests	whom	we 	
can	use	for	research	purposes	for	quick	and	cost	effective	insights. 	
•	 Primary	research	in	partnership	with	brand/category	teams. 	
•	 Working	with	suppliers	to	tap	into	their	research.
•	 Each	brand	has	its	own	pricing	strategy.
•	 Price	promotions	are	in	line	with	the	agreed	strategy.
•	 Sales	training	for	Management.
•	 Consumer/insight	led	innovation	process	and	development 	
for	new	brands.
•	 Reduce	customer	complaints	by	improving	the	local	management 	
of	social	media	responses	(e.g.	TripAdvisor). 	
•	 Increased	digital	marketing	activity.
•	 Online	guest	satisfaction	survey	to	collect	guest	feedback.	This 	
feedback	together	with	the	results	of	research	studies	is	monitored 	
and	evaluated	by	a	dedicated	guest	insight	team	to	ensure	that	the 	
relevance	to	guests	of	the	Company’s	brands	is	maintained.

Cost of goods price increases 
Food:	The	price	of	goods	increases	due 	
to	increases	in	demand	and	uncertainty 	
of	supply,	leading	to	decreased	profits.
Drinks:	The	price	of	drinks	goods 	
increases	due	to	changes	in	demand, 	
legislation,	exchange	rates	and	production 	
costs,	leading	to	decreased	profits.
Goods not for resale:	Increases	in	the 	
price	of	goods	not	for	resale	and	utilities 	
costs	as	a	result	of	increases	in	global 	
demand	and	uncertainty	of	supply	in 	
producing	nations	can	have	a	significant 	
impact	on	the	cost	base,	consequently 	
impacting	 margins.
Overall,	price	increases	are	mitigated	as	Mitchells	&	Butlers	leverages	its 	
scale	to	drive	competitive	cost	advantage	and	collaborates	with	suppliers 	
to	increase	efficiencies	in	the	supply	chain.	The	fragmented	nature	of	the 	
food	supply	industry	on	the	world	commodity	markets	gives	the	Company 	
the	opportunity	to	source	products	from	a	number	of	alternative	suppliers 	
in	order	to	drive	down	cost.	Key	mitigating	activities	for	food	and	drink	are 	
detailed	below:
Food: 
•	 A	Food	Procurement	Strategy	is	in	place. 	
•	 Full	reviews	have	been	carried	out	on	key	categories	to	ensure	optimum 	
value	is	achieved	in	each	category.
•	 A	full	range	review	was	completed	in	2017	ensuring	the	correct	number 	
of	products/suppliers.
•	 Regular	reporting	of	current	and	projected	inflation. 	
•	 Good	relationships	with	key	suppliers. 	
Drinks:
•	 Each	drinks	category	has	a	clearly	defined	strategic	sourcing	plan 	
to	ensure	Company	scale	is	leveraged,	supply	base	is	rationalised 	
and	consumer	needs	are	met.
•	 Good	relationships	with	key	suppliers.
•	 Supplier	collaboration	programmes	are	in	place.

People planning and development 
Mitchells	&	Butlers	has	a	strong	guest 	
focus,	and	as	such	it	is	important	that 	
it	is	able	to	attract,	retain,	develop	and 	
motivate	the	best	people	with	the	right 	
capabilities	throughout	the	organisation. 	
There	is	a	risk	that	without	the	right 	
people	our	customer	service	levels 	
would	be	affected.
•	 The	Company	makes	significant	investment	in	training	to	ensure	that 	
its	people	have	the	right	skills	to	perform	their	jobs	successfully. 	
•	 Furthermore,	an	employee	survey	is	conducted	annually	to	establish 	
employee	satisfaction	and	engagement	and	this	is	compared	with	other 	
companies,	as	well	as	previous	surveys.	Where	appropriate,	changes	in 	
working	practices	are	made	in	response	to	the	findings	of	these	surveys. 	
•	 Remuneration	packages	are	benchmarked	to	ensure	that	they	remain 	
competitive	and	a	talent	review	process	is	used	to	provide	structured 	
succession	planning.

Business continuity and crisis 
management 
Mitchells	&	Butlers	relies	on	its	food	and 	
drink	supply	chain	and	the	key	IT	systems 	
underlying	the	business	to	serve	its	guests 	
efficiently	and	effectively.	Supply	chain 	
interruption,	IT	system	failure	or	crises 	
such	as	terrorist	activity	or	the	threat 	
of	disease	pandemic	might	restrict	sales 	
or	reduce	operational	effectiveness.
•	 The	Company	has	in	place	crisis	and	continuity	plans	that	are	tested 	
and	refreshed	regularly.	The	Company’s	third-party	back-up	facility, 	
for	Retail	Support	Centre	employees,	has	been	successfully	tested 	
to	ensure	critical	business	systems	are	able	to	function	in	the	event 	
of	a	disaster. 	
•	 In	addition,	during	FY	2017 ,	departmental	Business	Continuity	Plans 	
have	been	revised,	updated	and	reviewed	by	the	Risk	Committee.

Information security and 
disaster recovery 
There	is	a	risk	that	inadequate	disaster 	
recovery	plans	and	information	security 	
processes	are	in	place	to	mitigate	against 	
a	system	outage,	or	failure	to	ensure 	
appropriate	back-up	facilities	(covering 	
key	business	systems	and	the	recovery 	
of	critical	data)	and	loss	of	sensitive	data. 	
•	 In	FY	2017	a	further	review	of	information	security,	disaster	recovery 	
and	IT	resilience	was	performed	in	order	to	highlight	any	gaps	and 	
address	any	challenges	that	had	been	presented	in	exploring	the 	
viability	of	a	disaster	recovery	test	for	our	business	critical	applications. 	
During	the	year	a	number	of	improvements	have	been	made,	including:
	 − Further	development	of	the	information	security	steering	group.
	 − Group	Assurance	follow-up	review	of	information	security	controls.
	 − Review	and	implementation	of	appropriate	cyber	security 	
governance	policy	and	procedures.
	 − Ongoing	security	awareness	initiatives	have	been	and	continue 	
to	be	undertaken.
	 − Penetration	 testing.

Wage cost inflation 
There	is	a	risk	that	increased	costs 	
associated	with	the	introduction	of	the 	
National	Living	Wage	may	adversely 	
impact	upon	overall	operational	costs. 	
•	 A	detailed	review	of	the	risks	associated	with	successfully	implementing 	
the	National	Living	Wage	has	been	completed.	This	review	has	been 	
undertaken	at	a	strategic	level	and	seeks	to	ensure	that	appropriate 	
mitigating	actions	are	in	place,	some	of	which	are	in	relation	to	how	the 	
Group	carefully	manages	productivity	and	efficiency	across	the	estate. 	
Implementation	of	the	National	Living	Wage	will	continue	to	remain 	
an	area	of	focus	in	FY	2018.	We	have	successfully	implemented	a	new 	
Time	and	Attendance	system	to	improve	the	management	controls 	
and	reporting	of	staff	hours.

Long-term viability statement
In	accordance	with	the	Corporate	Governance	Code,	the	Directors	have	undertaken	an	assessment,	including	sensitivity	analyses,	of	the	prospects	of 	
the	Group,	for	a	period	of	three	years	to	September	2020.	This	assessment	has	been	made	taking	account	of	the	current	financial	position,	compliance 	
with	covenants,	Company	strategy,	budget	planning	process	and	the	key	risks	and	uncertainties,	as	detailed	within	the	Annual	Report.
The	Group’s	strategy	provides	a	long-term	direction	and	is	reviewed	on	at	least	an	annual	basis,	including	three	year	forecasts,	detailing	the	expected 	
financial	impact.
The	Directors	have	therefore	concluded,	based	upon	the	extent	of	the	financial	planning	assessment,	sensitivity	analysis	and	current	financial	position 	
that	there	is	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Group	has	adequate	resources	and	will	be	able	to	continue	in	operation	and	meet	all	its	liabilities	as	they 	
fall	due	over	the	three	year	period	of	assessment.

Separately disclosed items
Separately	disclosed	items	are	items	that	are	identified	due	to	their 	
nature	or	materiality	to	help	the	reader	form	a	better	view	of	overall 	
and	adjusted	trading. 	
A	£51m	charge	was	recognised	relating	to	the	downward	valuation 	
movements	on	selected	sites	in	the	property	portfolio	resulting	from 	
the	revaluation	(FY	2016	£80m). 	
A	£17m	charge	for	impairment	of	short	leaseholds	and	unlicensed 	
properties	(FY	2016	£8m)	was	recognised	as	a	result	of	our	annual 	
review	of	asset	carrying	values. 	
A	£4m	impairment	charge	was	recognised	in	relation	to	assets	held 	
for	sale	at	the	half	year	and	disposed	of	prior	to	the	year	end. 	
During	the	year	we	completed	a	review	focusing	on	the	challenges 	
around	sites	not	currently	generating	an	economic	return,	the	majority 	
of	which	are	short	leasehold	sites	in	retail	and	leisure	park	locations. 	
With	lower	footfall	on	many	of	these	parks	and	an	uncertain	economic 	
outlook,	alongside	increased	cost	pressures	such	as	living	wage, 	
business	rates,	apprenticeship	levy,	sugar	tax	and	food	price	inflation 	
we	believe	that	a	number	of	sites	will	now	be	challenged	to	achieve	a 	
breakeven	performance.	We	have	therefore	extended	both	the	number 	
of	sites	for	which	a	provision	is	made	and	the	period	recognised. 	
In	addition,	we	have	reduced	the	discount	rate	used	to	calculate	the 	
present	value	of	the	provision	to	an	estimation	of	the	risk	free	rate. 	
The	impact	of	these	judgements	is	a	charge	of	£35m	in	the	year.
Operating margins
Inflationary	cost	pressures	have	continued	to	impact	the	business	and 	
have	driven	a	year-on-year	operating	margin	reduction.	Cost	increases 	
for	the	year	have	impacted	labour,	utilities,	property	costs,	duty,	and 	
food	and	drink	costs.	Adjusted	operating	margins
a
	for	the	full	year	were 	
0.8ppts	lower	than	last	year	at	14.4%. 	
Adjusted	operating	profit
a
	of	£308m	was	3. 1%	lower	than	last	year	as 	
a	result	of	the	inflationary	cost	pressures	outlined	above	partially	offset 	
by	mitigating	cost	reductions	and	the	improvement	we	have	made	in	both 	
the	invested	and	uninvested	estates’	sales	performance	in	the	period.
Internal rent
A	regime	of	internal	rent	is	in	place	to	enable	greater	internal 	
transparency	around	the	performance	of	freehold	and	long	leasehold 	
properties.	Operating	performance	is	monitored	on	a	regular	basis 	
through	a	system	of	profit	reviews	through	all	levels	of	the	Group.	Estate 	
management	is	primarily	undertaken	and	monitored	by	the	Portfolio 	
Development	 Committee.	
Financial review continued
42 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Property
In	line	with	our	property	valuation	policy,	a	red	book	valuation	of	the 	
freehold	and	long	leasehold	estate	has	been	completed	in	conjunction 	
with	the	independent	property	valuer,	CBRE.	In	addition,	the	Group	has 	
conducted	an	impairment	review	on	short	leasehold	and	unlicensed 	
properties.	The	overall	property	portfolio	has	increased	by	£2m	(FY	2016 	
increase	of	£128m)	reflecting	a	£72m	separately	disclosed	charge	in	the 	
income	statement	and	a	£74m	increase	in	the	revaluation	reserve. 	
Pensions
During	the	year	the	Company	reached	agreement	on	the	2016	triennial 	
pensions	valuation	with	the	scheme	trustees.	The	agreed	deficit	of 	
£451m	as	at	31	March	2016	(2013	£572m)	will	be	funded	by	an 	
unchanged	level	of	cash	contributions	(of	£46m	pa	indexed)	to	2023, 	
as	per	the	agreement	reached	in	2013. 	
In	2024	an	additional	payment	of	£13m	will	be	made	into	escrow, 	
should	such	further	funding	be	required	at	that	time.
Dividend policy
Payment	of	dividends	is	recognised	as	an	important	element	of	overall 	
shareholder	return	where	this	can	be	achieved	sustainably	and	without 	
undue	risk	to	the	ongoing	and	future	health	of	the	business.	To	that	end 	
in	determining	the	affordable	level	of	dividend	in	any	year	a	number	of 	
factors	are	taken	into	account.	Namely:
•	 The	level	of	dividend	cover	both	in	the	current	year	and	looking 	
forward.	The	Board	considers	cash	flow,	rather	than	earnings, 	
to	currently	be	the	more	constraining	factor	on	assessing	dividends.
•	 The	future	investment	requirements	of	the	business	and	the 	
availability	and	attractiveness	of	potential	strategic	opportunities.
•	 The	maintenance	of	a	degree	of	headroom	or	prudence	against 	
assumptions,	particularly	with	regard	to	the	principal	risks	as	identified 	
in	our	Annual	Report.
•	 The	assessment	of	the	ongoing	prospects	of	the	business,	having 	
notice	of	the	macroeconomic	and	sector	outlook	and	the	anticipated 	
business	performance	within	that.
•	 The	level	of	available	distributable	reserves	in	the	parent	company. 	
The	Board	keeps	its	dividend	policy	in	constant	review	in	the	context	of 	
its	capital	allocation	policies,	capital	structure,	and	inherent	visibility	on 	
trading.	We	do	not	expect	to	declare	an	interim	dividend	in	the	current 	
financial	year	but	will	make	an	assessment	of	pay-out	at	the	end	of	the 	
year	based	on	a	full	year	of	trading	and	development	of	the	sector 	
outlook,	using	the	criteria	set	out	above.
For	the	FY	2017	financial	year	the	Board	has	recommended	a	final 	
dividend	of	5.0p	per	share	(full	year	7 .5p	per	share)	which	will	be	paid	on 	
6	February	2018	to	shareholders	on	the	register	at	the	close	of	business 	
on	15	December	2017 .	The	Board	intends	to	make	a	scrip	dividend 	
alternative	available	to	shareholders,	details	of	the	procedure	to	access 	
this	alternative	are	available	on	the	Company	website. 	
 
Tim Jones
Finance Director
a.		 The	Directors	use	a	number	of	alternative	performance	measures	(APMs)	that	are 	
considered	critical	to	aid	understanding	of	the	Group’s	performance.	Key	measures 	
are	explained	on	pages	140	to	142	of	this	report. 	
Neither	of	these	items	results	in	a	direct	charge	against	earnings 	
in	the	Income	Statement.	As	such	Group	capital	allocation	decisions, 	
particularly	across	capital	expenditure	(both	on	the	existing	estate 	
and	new	sites),	short-term	borrowings	and	dividends	to	shareholders, 	
are	assessed	on	a	cash	rather	than	an	earnings	basis.	In	making	these 	
choices	the	Board	considers	investment	to	maintain	the	condition	and 	
competitiveness	of	the	existing	estate	to	be	of	primary	importance	for 	
the	long-term	health	of	the	business.
Cash	flow	to	the	parent	company	is	derived	from	dividends	from 	
subsidiaries,	including	the	securitised	estate.	To	the	extent	that	cash	flow 	
to	the	parent	company	in	any	given	year,	having	met	all	other	obligations, 	
is	insufficient	to	fund	dividend	payments	then	this	must	be	financed	by 	
short-term	facilities.	During	the	year	the	parent	company	renewed	its 	
committed	short-term	facilities	of	£150m,	now	expiring	in	December 	
2020.	These	were	only	marginally	drawn	at	the	balance	sheet	date. 	
The	Board	views	the	holding	of	these	facilities	as	a	necessary	buffer	to 	
accommodate	volatility	in	its	cash	usage	and	requirements.	It	does	not 	
see	them	as	a	substitute	for	longer-term	debt	or	as	a	means	to	fund	an 	
ongoing	dividend	stream.	As	such,	when	assessing	dividends,	the	Board 	
would	not	expect	to	see	a	structural,	or	permanent,	increase	in	the	usage 	
of	these	facilities.
Capital expenditure
Total	maintenance	and	infrastructure	capex	of	£53m	was	£28m 	
lower	than	the	prior	year,	due	to	increased	remodel	and	conversion 	
activity	supported	by	initiatives	to	improve	the	cost	efficiency	of 	
maintenance	work.
During	the	year	we	completed	252	remodels	and	conversions	(FY	2016 	
252	sites)	and	opened	13	new	sites	(FY	2016	8	sites)	with	investment 	
of	return	generating	capital	increasing	by	£30m.	Acquisitions	were 	
primarily	focused	on	premiumisation	with	the	opening	of	six	new	Miller 	
&	Carter	sites,	including	one	purpose-built	restaurant,	and	five	new	All 	
Bar	Ones.	Similarly,	the	higher	proportion	of	Miller	&	Carter	conversions 	
resulted	in	the	average	spend	per	project	increasing,	a	reflection	of	the 	
premiumisation	 strategy.	
The	EBITDA	return	across	all	conversion	and	acquisition	capital	invested 	
since	FY	2014	is	18%,	with	projects	since	the	start	of	the	financial	year 	
returning	22%.	Recent	remodel	performance	has	been	encouraging, 	
delivering	sales	uplifts	in	excess	of	10%.

Non-Executive Chairman
Dear fellow shareholder
It gives me great pleasure to update you on our progress 
in corporate governance over the past year.
One	of	the	key	roles	for	the	Board	of	Directors	at	Mitchells	&	Butlers 	
is	to	provide	leadership	for	around	46,000	employees	and	maintain 	
the	highest	possible	standards	of	corporate	governance.	The	Board 	
continues	to	monitor	developments	in	corporate	governance	and 	
reporting	regulations.	The	Strategic	report	on	pages	1	to	43	includes 	
the	Group’s	strategy,	progress	and	performance	for	the	year. 	
There	have	been	no	Board	changes	during	the	year	and	the	Board	as 	
a	whole	has	continued	to	work	together	to	implement	the	Company’s 	
strategy	in	a	cohesive	way.	Our	broad	range	of	Board	talent	covers	a 	
variety	of	professional	skills	and	our	diverse	group	of	Non-Executive 	
Directors	continue	to	bring	much	experience	and	challenge	to	the	Board. 	
My	focus	continues	to	be	on	maintaining	a	strong	team,	with	a	broad 	
range	of	professional	backgrounds	and	skills	to	drive	further 	
improvements	where	possible.
For	2017	we	carried	out	an	internal	review	of	the	Board’s	effectiveness, 	
and	the	results	of	this	can	be	found	on	page	61.
The	remainder	of	this	report	contains	the	narrative	reporting	required 	
by	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code,	the	Listing	Rules	and	the 	
Disclosure	Guidance	and	Transparency	Rules.	I	hope	that	you	find	this 	
report	to	be	informative	and	helpful	in	relation	to	this	important	topic. 	
We	are	committed	to	maintaining	an	active	dialogue	with	all	our 	
shareholders,	and	we	continue	to	offer	our	institutional	investors	access 	
to	key	senior	management	and	our	Investor	Relations	team	via	our 	
Investor	Roadshow	programme.	I	would	like	to	encourage	shareholders 	
to	attend	our	Annual	General	Meeting,	details	of	which	are	set	out	in	the 	
separate	Notice	of	AGM	sent	out	with	this	Annual	Report.	The	use	of	our 	
Retail	Support	Centre	in	Birmingham	as	a	venue	for	our	AGM	has	proved	
to	be	a	success	(as	well	as	a	cost	saving)	and	so	we	intend	to	use	the 	
same	facility	for	the	2018	AGM	and	we	look	forward	to	welcoming	you, 	
where	I	hope	you	will	take	the	opportunity	of	meeting	our	Executive	and 	
Non-Executive	Board	Directors.
I	look	forward	to	the	year	ahead,	confident	in	the	knowledge	that	the 	
Company	is	led	by	a	highly	competent,	professional	and	motivated	team. 	
I	also	look	forward	to	the	support	of	you,	our	shareholders,	as	our	senior 	
management	team	continues	to	focus	on	driving	future	profit	growth	and 	
creating	additional	shareholder	value.

Directors’ report
48 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Piedmont.	Having	taken	into	account	the	Financial	Reporting	Council’s 	
report	of	August	2014	‘Towards	Clear	&	Concise	Reporting’	and	the 	
views	expressed	previously	by	certain	of	the	investor	representative 	
bodies,	the	Board	considers	that	such	an	agreement	would	be	merely 	
one	of	form	rather	than	substance	and	not	in	the	interests	of 	
shareholders	generally.	As	a	result,	the	Board	does	not	propose	currently 	
that	the	Company	should	enter	into	such	an	agreement	with	Elpida,	and 	
Elpida	has	not	to	date	sought	such	an	agreement.	The	Board	considers

principles	in	working	with	our	significant	long-term	shareholders	towards 	
our	common	goals	and	the	achievement	of	the	Company’s	strategy,	with 	
continued	stability	at	Board	level.
Directors’ indemnity
As	permitted	by	the	Articles	of	Association,	each	of	the	Directors	has 	
the	benefit	of	an	indemnity,	which	is	a	qualifying	third-party	indemnity 	
as	defined	by	Section	234	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.	The	indemnity 	
was	in	force	throughout	the	tenure	of	each	Director	during	the	last 	
financial	year,	and	is	currently	in	force.	The	Company	also	purchased 	
and	maintained	throughout	the	financial	year	Directors’	and	Officers’ 	
liability	insurance	in	respect	of	itself	and	its	Directors.	No	indemnity 	
is	provided	for	the	Company’s	auditor. 	
Articles of Association
The	Articles	of	Association	may	be	amended	by	special	resolution 	
of	the	shareholders	of	the	Company.
Conflicts of interest
The	Company’s	Articles	of	Association	permit	the	Board	to	consider 	
and,	if	it	sees	fit,	authorise	situations	where	a	Director	has	an	interest 	
that	conflicts,	or	may	possibly	conflict,	with	the	interests	of	the 	
Company	(‘Situational	Conflicts’).	The	Board	has	a	formal	system 	
in	place	for	Directors	to	declare	Situational	Conflicts	to	be	considered 	
for	authorisation	by	those	Directors	who	have	no	interest	in	the	matter 	
being	considered.	In	deciding	whether	to	authorise	a	Situational	Conflict, 	
the	non-conflicted	Directors	are	required	to	act	in	the	way	they	consider 	
would	be	most	likely	to	promote	the	success	of	the	Company	for	the 	
benefit	of	all	shareholders,	and	they	may	impose	limits	or	conditions 	
when	giving	authorisation,	or	subsequently,	if	they	think	this	is	appropriate. 	
The	Board	believes	that	the	systems	it	has	in	place	for	reporting	and 	
considering	Situational	Conflicts	continue	to	operate	effectively.
Related party transactions
Internal	controls	are	in	place	to	ensure	that	any	related	party	transactions 	
involving	Directors	or	their	connected	persons	are	carried	out	on	an 	
arm’s-length	basis	and	are	properly	recorded.
Interests in voting rights
As	at	the	date	of	this	report,	the	Company	was	aware	of	the	following

to	the	Board	of	Directors	during	the	year	nor	subsequent	to	the	year	end, 	
up	to	the	date	of	this	report.
The	Company	is	governed	by	its	Articles	of	Association	and	the 	
Companies	Act	2006	and	related	legislation	in	relation	to	the 	
appointment	and	removal	of	Directors.	The	powers	of	the	Company’s 	
Directors	are	set	out	in	the	Company’s	Articles	of	Association. 	
In	accordance	with	the	Company’s	Articles	of	Association	(which	are 	
in	line	with	best	practice	guidance	of	the	UK	Corporate	Governance 	
Code),	all	the	Directors	will	retire	at	the	AGM	and	will	offer	themselves 	
for	re-election.
Under	a	Deed	of	Appointment	between	Piedmont	Inc.	and	the 	
Company,	Piedmont	Inc.	has	the	right	to	appoint	two	shareholder 	
Directors	to	the	Board	whilst	it	owns	22%	or	more	of	the	issued	share 	
capital	of	the	Company,	and	the	right	to	appoint	one	shareholder 	
Director	to	the	Board	whilst	it	owns	more	than	16%	of	the	Company 	
but	less	than	22%.	In	the	event	that	Piedmont	Inc.	owns	less	than	16% 	
of	the	Company	any	such	shareholder	Directors	would	be	required 	
to	resign	immediately.
The	Company’s	two	largest	shareholders,	Piedmont	Inc.	and	Elpida 	
Group	Limited,	have	nominated	representatives	on	the	Board. 	
Piedmont’s	appointment	rights	are	formalised	in	the	Deed	of 	
Appointment	referred	to	in	this	report	but	there	is	no	equivalent 	
agreement	in	place	between	the	Company	and	Elpida.	The	Elpida 	
representatives	were	appointed	with	the	approval	of	the	Board	in	March 	
2012	and	September	2016.	The	Board	has	carefully	considered	whether 	
it	would	be	appropriate	to	enter	into	a	formal	agreement	with	Elpida	that 	
is	similar	to	the	existing	agreement	between	the	Company	and

Employee engagement 
Mitchells	&	Butlers	engages	with	its	employees	continuously	and	in 	
a	number	of	ways	to	suit	their	different	working	patterns.	This	includes:
•	line	manager	briefings;
•	communications	forums	and	roadshows	held	by	functions	or	brands 	
across	the	Company;
•	a	dedicated	intranet	for	the	Retail	Support	Team;
•	‘Mable’,	the	M&B	online	learning	system;
•	email	news	alerts;
•	focus	groups;
•	weekly	bulletins	–	specifically	targeted	at	retail	house	managers 	
and	mobile	workers;
•	employee	social	media	groups;	and
•	a	monthly	magazine	poster,	Frontline	News,	for	the	retail	estate.
Details	of	the	financial	and	economic	factors	affecting	the	performance 	
of	the	Company	are	shared	with	all	employees	at	the	appropriate	time 	
using	the	methods	listed	above. 	
We	provide	opportunities	for	employees	to	give	their	feedback 	
to	the	Company	in	a	number	of	ways,	from	team	or	shift	meetings 	
in	restaurants	and	pubs	and	engagement	surveys	for	all	employees 	
to	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	annual	Business	Forum.	Business	Forum 	
representatives	collect	questions	from	employees	across	the	Company 	
and	put	them	to	members	of	the	Executive	Committee.	The	questions 	
and	answers	are	published	in	Frontline	News	and	online.
Since	Mable	was	launched	in	July	2017 ,	the	STAR	programme,	a 	
universal	training	needs	analysis	and	learning	resource	for	all	retail	roles, 	
has	now	been	used	by	over	8,800	new	team	members	as	an	integral	part 	
of	the	businesses	induction	process.	STAR	is	supported	by	coaching 	
material	that	has	been	produced	for	every	technical	task	associated	with 	
a	job	in	hospitality,	the	visual	training	library	enables	our	teams	to	access 	
up	to	date	and	relevant	information	from	any	hand	held	or	desk	top 	
device,	and	a	progress	report	enables	every	member	of	the	organisation 	
to	understand	the	skills	and	progress	of	our	people.	The	introduction	of 	
Mable,	the	business’s	social	learning	platform,	has	enabled	the	business 	
to	direct	key	training	messages	contained	within	STAR	quickly	and 	
efficiently	to	the	front	line. 	
Mitchells	&	Butlers	operates	the	Challenge	21	policy	in	all	our	businesses 	
across	England	and	Wales	(and	a	Challenge	25	policy	in	our	Scottish 	
businesses).	The	policy	requires	that	any	guest	attempting	to	buy	alcohol 	
who	appears	under	the	age	of	21,	must	provide	an	acceptable	form	of 	
proof	of	age	ID	to	confirm	that	they	are	over	18,	before	they	can	be 	
served.	This	policy	forms	part	of	our	regular	training	for	our	employees 	
on	their	responsibilities	for	serving	alcohol.
Change of control provisions
There	are	no	significant	agreements	which	contain	provisions	entitling 	
other	parties	to	such	agreements	to	exercise	termination	or	other	rights 	
in	the	event	of	a	change	of	control	of	the	Company. 	
There	are	no	provisions	in	the	Directors’	or	employees’	service 	
agreements	providing	for	compensation	for	loss	of	office	or	employment 	
occurring	because	of	a	takeover. 	
The	trustee	of	the	Company’s	SIP	will	invite	participants	on	whose	behalf 	
it	holds	shares	to	direct	it	how	to	vote	in	respect	of	those	shares,	and, 	
if	there	is	an	offer	for	the	shares	or	other	transaction	which	would	lead 	
to	a	change	of	control	of	the	Company,	participants	may	direct	it	to

50 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Going concern 
The	financial	statements	which	appear	on	pages	88	to	139	have	been 	
prepared	on	a	going	concern	basis.	The	Directors	have	reviewed	the 	
Group’s	objectives,	policies	and	processes	for	managing	its	capital; 	
its	financial	risk	management	objectives;	its	financial	instruments	and 	
hedging	activities;	and	its	exposures	to	credit	risk	and	liquidity	risk. 	
The	Group’s	financing	is	based	on	securitised	debt	and	unsecured	bank 	
facilities	and,	within	this	context,	a	robust	review	has	been	undertaken 	
of	projected	performance	against	all	financial	covenants.	As	a	result	of 	
this	review	the	Directors	have	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Group 	
has	adequate	resources	to	continue	in	operational	existence	for	the 	
foreseeable	future.	See	section	1	of	the	financial	statements	on	page	101 	
for	the	Company’s	going	concern	statement,	and	page	40	for	the 	
Company’s	long-term	viability	statement.
Annual General Meeting
The	notice	convening	the	Annual	General	Meeting	is	contained	in 	
a	circular	sent	to	shareholders	with	this	report	and	includes	full	details 	
of	the	resolutions	proposed.
Auditor
Deloitte	LLP	has	expressed	its	willingness	to	continue	in	office	as	auditor 	
of	the	Company	and	its	reappointment	will	be	put	to	shareholders	at 	
the	AGM.
Post-balance sheet events
There	are	no	post-balance	sheet	events	to	report.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Having	made	the	requisite	enquiries,	so	far	as	the	Directors	are	aware, 	
there	is	no	relevant	audit	information	(as	defined	by	Section	418(3)	of	the 	
Companies	Act	2006)	of	which	the	Company’s	auditor	is	unaware	and 	
each	Director	has	taken	all	steps	that	ought	to	have	been	taken	to	make 	
themselves	aware	of	any	relevant	audit	information	and	to	establish	that 	
the	Company’s	auditor	is	aware	of	that	information. 	
Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions statement 
The	Group	generates	GHG	emissions	throughout	its	estate	of	bars 	
and	restaurants	for	heating,	cooling,	lighting	and	catering	including 	
the	refrigeration	and	preparation	of	food	and	drink.
GHG	emissions	per	£m	turnover	were	reduced	by	8. 1%	during	the 	
2016/17	tax	year	in	comparison	to	2015/16	in	response	to	a	range	of 	
behavioural	change	activities.	This	reduction	has	been	achieved	despite 	
increasing	sales	although	it	should	be	noted	that	conversion	factors	have 	
also	reduced,	particularly	for	grid	supplied	electricity	due	to	a	reduction 	
in	coal	generation	which	has	been	balanced	by	an	increase	in	cleaner	gas 	
and	renewables	generation.
Mitchells	&	Butlers	is	keen	to	encourage	greater	employee	involvement 	
in	the	Group’s	performance	through	share	ownership.	It	operates	two 	
HMRC	approved	all-employee	plans,	which	are	the	2013	Sharesave 	
Plan	and	the	Share	Incentive	Plan	(which	includes	Partnership	shares). 	
The	Company	also	operates	two	other	plans	on	a	selective	basis,	which 	
are	the	2013	Performance	Restricted	Share	Plan	and	the	2013	Short	Term 	
Deferred	Incentive	Plan.	Further	details	on	the	plans	are	set	out	in	the 	
Report	on	Directors’	remuneration.
During	the	year,	the	Company	has	remained	within	its	headroom	limits 	
for	the	issue	of	new	shares	for	share	plans	as	set	out	in	the	rules	of	the 	
above	plans.	The	Company	uses	an	employee	benefit	trust	to	acquire 	
shares	in	the	market	when	appropriate	to	satisfy	share	awards	in	order 	
to	manage	headroom	under	the	plan	rules.	No	shares	in	the	Company 	
were	purchased	by	the	employee	benefit	trust	during	FY	2017 .
Political donations
The	Company	made	no	political	donations	during	the	year	and	intends 	
to	maintain	its	policy	of	not	making	such	payments.	It	will,	however, 	
as	a	precautionary	measure	to	avoid	inadvertent	breach	of	the	law, 	
seek	shareholder	authority	at	its	2018	AGM	to	make	limited	donations 	
or	incur	limited	political	expenditure,	although	it	has	no	intention	of 	
using	the	authority.
Funding and liquidity risk 
In	order	to	ensure	that	the	Group’s	long-term	funding	strategy	is	aligned 	
with	its	strategic	objectives,	the	Treasury	Committee	regularly	assesses 	
the	maturity	profile	of	the	Group’s	debt,	alongside	the	prevailing	financial 	
projections	and	three	year	plan.	This	enables	it	to	ensure	that	funding 	
levels	are	appropriate	to	support	the	Group’s	plans.
The	current	funding	arrangements	of	the	Group	consist	of	the 	
securitised	notes	issued	by	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Finance	plc	(and 	
associated	liquidity	facility)	and	£150m	of	unsecured	committed	bank 	
facilities.	Further	information	regarding	these	arrangements	is	included 	
in	note	4.2	to	the	financial	statements	on	page	118.	The	terms	of	the 	
securitisation	and	the	bank	facilities	contain	a	number	of	financial	and 	
operational	covenants.	Compliance	with	these	covenants	is	monitored 	
by	Group	Treasury.
The	Group	prepares	a	rolling	daily	cash	forecast	covering	a	six-week 	
period	and	an	annual	cash	forecast	by	period.	These	forecasts	are 	
reviewed	and	used	to	manage	the	investment	and	borrowing 	
requirements	of	the	Group.	A	combination	of	cash	pooling	and	zero 	
balancing	agreements	is	in	place	to	ensure	the	optimum	liquidity	position 	
is	maintained.	Committed	facilities	outside	of	the	securitisation	are	sized 	
to	ensure	that	the	Group	can	meet	its	medium-term	anticipated	cash 	
flow	requirements.

Scope General	classifications	of	greenhouse	gas	emissions	scopes	based	on	the 	
GHG	protocol	and	ISO14064-1:2006	within	the	context	of	the	Group’s 	
operations	are	as	follows:
Scope 1	–	direct	greenhouse	gas	emissions	from	sources	that	are	owned 	
or	controlled	by	the	Group,	e.g.	fuel	combustion	of	varying	types,	occurs 	
during	kitchen	activity	and	to	generate	heating	and	domestic	hot	water	most 	
commonly	through	natural	grid	supplied	gas,	but	also	some	LPG	(Liquefied 	
Petroleum	Gas)	and	oil.	Real	fires	fuelled	by	logs	or	coal	are	also	used	to 	
supplement	customer	comfort	and	enhance	ambience.
Scope 2 –	GHG	emissions	from	the	generation	of	purchased	electricity	used 	
during	kitchen	activity	and	for	lighting,	heating	and	cooling.
Scope 3 –	indirect	emissions	as	a	consequence	of	the	activities	of	the	Group, 	
but	occurring	from	sources	not	owned	or	controlled	by	the	Group.
This	assessment	focuses	on	scope	1	and	2	emissions	only	(scope	3	is	optional 	
under	the	current	regulations).
Consistency with the financial statements Scope	1	and	2	emissions	are	reported	for	the	2016/17	and	2015/16	tax	years 	
to	retain	consistency	with	reporting	of	our	carbon	emissions	under	the 	
Carbon	Reduction	Commitment	(‘CRC’)	Energy	Efficiency	Scheme.
Scope	1	and	2	emissions	from	sites	with	‘landlord	supplies’	are	not	included 	
in	the	CRC	submission.
Franchise	sites	are	excluded	as	they	are	responsible	for	arranging	and	paying 	
for	their	own	energy.
Alex	sites	in	Germany	are	included.	Emissions	are	based	on	UK	average 	
emissions	multiplied	by	the	number	of	Alex	sites.
Exclusions Scope 1	–	Vehicle	fleet	emissions	are	excluded	as	they	have	been	calculated 	
to	account	for	<1%	total	emissions	which	falls	below	the	materiality	threshold.
Scope 1	–	Fugitive	emissions	within	refrigeration	and	cooling	equipment	are 	
not	included	as	detailed	records	are	not	yet	held.
Outside of scope	–	Logs	are	‘outside	of	scope’	because	the	scope	1	impact 	
of	these	fuels	has	been	determined	to	be	a	net	‘0’.	However,	the	CO
2
e	value	
of	logs	has	been	calculated	to	be	<1%	and	would	be	excluded	in	any	case	as 	
this	falls	below	the	materiality	threshold.
Emission factor data source All	carbon	emission	factors	used	are	taken	from	the	Government	emission 	
conversion	factors	for	greenhouse	gas	company	reporting	published	by	BEIS 	
(formerly	DEFRA).
The	2016	version	of	the	factors	has	been	applied	to	the	2016/2017 	
consumption	data	set	and	the	2015	version	has	been	applied	to	the 	
2015/2016	consumption	data	set.
Assessment methodology Defra	Environmental	Guidelines	2013.
Materiality threshold All	emission	types	estimated	to	contribute	>1%	of	total	emissions	are	included.
Intensity threshold Emissions	are	stated	in	tonnes	CO
2
e	per	£m	revenue.	This	intensity	ratio	puts 	
emissions	into	context	given	the	scale	of	the	Group’s	activities	and	enables 	
comparison	with	prior	year	performance.
Target Emissions	during	the	2015/16	tax	year	are	provided	for	comparative	purposes.
It	should	be	noted	that	the	2015/16	emissions	have	been	re-calculated	with 	
electricity	transmission	and	distribution	losses	removed	as	these	are	now 	
classed	as	Scope	3	emissions.

statements	unless	they	are	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view 	
of	the	state	of	affairs	of	the	Company	and	of	the	profit	or	loss	of	the 	
Company	for	that	period. 	
In	preparing	the	parent	company	financial	statements,	the	Directors 	
are	required	to:
•	select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	are	reasonable 	
and	prudent;
•	state	whether	Financial	Reporting	Standard	101	Reduced	Disclosure 	
Framework	has	been	followed,	subject	to	any	material	departures 	
disclosed	and	explained	in	the	financial	statements;	and
•	prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concern	basis	unless	it 	
is	inappropriate	to	presume	that	the	Company	will	continue	in	business.
In	preparing	the	Group	financial	statements,	International	Accounting 	
Standard	1	requires	that	Directors:
•	properly	select	and	apply	accounting	policies;
•	present	information,	including	accounting	policies,	in	a	manner	that 	
provides	 relevant,	 reliable,	 comparable	 and	 understandable	 information;	
•	provide	additional	disclosures	when	compliance	with	the	specific 	
requirements	in	IFRSs	are	insufficient	to	enable	users	to	understand 	
the	impact	of	particular	transactions,	other	events	and	conditions 	
on	the	entity’s	financial	position	and	financial	performance;	and
•	make	an	assessment	of	the	Company’s	ability	to	continue	as	a 	
going	concern.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	keeping	adequate	accounting	records 	
that	are	sufficient	to	show	and	explain	the	Company’s	transactions	and 	
disclose	with	reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	the	financial	position	of 	
the	Company	and	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	financial	statements 	
comply	with	the	Companies	Act	2006.	They	are	also	responsible	for 	
safeguarding	the	assets	of	the	Company	and	hence	for	taking	reasonable 	
steps	for	the	prevention	and	detection	of	fraud	and	other	irregularities.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	the	maintenance	and	integrity	of	the 	
corporate	and	financial	information	included	on	the	Company’s	website. 	
Legislation	in	the	United	Kingdom	governing	the	preparation	and 	
dissemination	of	financial	statements	may	differ	from	legislation 	
in	other	jurisdictions.
We	confirm	that	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge:
•	the	financial	statements,	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	relevant 	
financial	reporting	framework,	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	assets, 	
liabilities,	financial	position	and	profit	or	loss	of	the	Company	and	the 	
undertakings	included	in	the	consolidation	taken	as	a	whole;
•	the	Strategic	report	includes	a	fair	review	of	the	development	and 	
performance	of	the	business	and	the	position	of	the	Company	and	the 	
undertakings	included	in	the	consolidation	taken	as	a	whole,	together 	
with	a	description	of	the	principal	risks	and	uncertainties	that	they 	
face;	and
•	the	Annual	Report	and	financial	statements,	taken	as	a	whole,	are	fair, 	
balanced	and	understandable	and	provide	the	information	necessary 	
for	shareholders	to	assess	the	Company’s	position	and	performance, 	
business	model	and	strategy.
This	responsibility	statement	was	approved	by	the	Board	of	Directors 	
on	22	November	2017	and	is	signed	on	its	behalf	by:

Directors’ responsibilities statement
54 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 The	Board	is	committed	to	high	standards	of	corporate	governance.	I	am 	
delighted	to	be	able	to	report	that	the	Board	considers	that	the	Company 	
has	complied	throughout	the	year	ended	30	September	2017	with	all 	
the	provisions	and	best	practice	guidance	of	the	Code	except	those	in 	
respect	of	Board	composition	and	the	constitution	of	Board	Committees. 	
This	corporate	governance	statement	addresses	the	small	number	of 	
areas	where,	for	reasons	specific	to	Mitchells	&	Butlers,	there	are 	
divergences	from	the	Code	as	described	below. 	
The	Audit	Committee	report	and	Nomination	Committee	report	which 	
are	set	out	on	pages	62	to	65	and	page	58	respectively	of	the	Annual 	
Report	also	form	part	of	this	corporate	governance	statement	and	they 	
should	all	be	considered	together.
The	Board	recognises	the	importance	of	good	corporate	governance 	
in	creating	a	sustainable,	successful	and	profitable	business	and	details 	
are	set	out	in	this	statement	of	the	Company’s	corporate	governance 	
procedures	and	application	of	the	principles	of	the	Code.	There	are, 	
however,	a	small	number	of	areas	where,	for	reasons	specifically	related 	
to	the	Company,	the	detailed	provisions	of	the	Code	were	not	fully 	
complied	with	in	FY	2017 .	These	areas	are	kept	under	regular	review. 	
A	fundamental	aspect	of	the	Code	is	that	it	contains	best	practice 	
recommendations	in	relation	to	corporate	governance	yet	acknowledges 	
that,	in	individual	cases,	these	will	not	all	necessarily	be	appropriate	for 	
particular	companies.	Accordingly,	the	Code	specifically	recognises	the 	
concept	of	‘Comply	or	Explain’	in	relation	to	divergences	from	the	Code. 	
Compliance with the Code 
Except	for	the	matters	which	are	explained	below	(in	line	with	the 	
‘Comply	or	Explain’	concept),	the	Company	complied	fully	with	the 	
principles	and	provisions	of	the	Code	throughout	the	financial	year 	
in	respect	of	which	this	statement	is	prepared	(and	continues	to	do 	
so	as	at	the	date	of	this	statement).
Explanation for non-compliance with parts of the Code
During	the	year,	there	were	three	divergences	from	full	compliance 	
with	the	Code	as	set	out	below	by	reference	to	specific	paragraphs 	
in	the	Code:
B.1.2 (Composition of the Board), C.3.1 and D.2.1 Constitution 
of Committees
During	the	year,	Code	Provision	B. 1.2,	which	requires	that	at	least 	
half	of	the	Board	be	made	up	of	independent	Non-Executive	Directors 	
(excluding	the	Chairman),	was	not	complied	with.	Accordingly,	this	had 	
consequential	implications	on	the	composition	of	the	Audit	and 	
Remuneration	Committees.	There	were	no	changes	in	Board 	
composition	during	FY	2017 .
While	the	Board	does	not	comply	fully	with	the	requirement	for	at 	
least	half	of	its	members	to	be	independent,	it	recognises	and	values 	
the	presence	of	representatives	of	its	major	shareholders	on	the	Board 	
and	welcomes	the	interest	shown	by	them	in	the	Company	as	a	whole. 	
The	Board	will	continue	to	work	closely	with	the	representatives	of	its 	
major	shareholders	to	further	the	interests	of	the	Company.
The	possibility	of	appointing	a	further	independent	Non-Executive 	
Director	remains	a	matter	for	the	Nomination	Committee	to	review 	
and	is	considered	regularly.	Throughout	FY	2017 ,	the	Company	had 	
(and	continues	to	have)	fully	functioning	Nomination,	Audit	and 	
Remuneration	Committees	as	required	by	the	Code.	The	Audit	and 	
Remuneration	Committees	are	not	fully	compliant	with	the	relevant 	
provisions	of	paragraphs	C.3. 1	and	D.2. 1	of	the	Code	in	that	they	include 	
the	presence	of	representatives	of	major	shareholders.	Nevertheless, 	
the	Board	values	the	contribution	of	those	shareholder	representatives 	
on	those	Committees,	does	not	consider	this	to	be	an	impediment	to 	
good	governance	and	looks	forward	to	continuing	to	work	with	them 	
on	matters	affecting	the	Group	and	its	activities	in	the	future.
Corporate governance statement
This corporate governance statement sets out 
our report to shareholders on the status of our 
corporate governance arrangements.
	
The	Board	is	responsible	for	ensuring	that	the	activities	of	the 	
Mitchells	&	Butlers	Group	and	its	various	businesses	are	conducted 	
in	compliance	with	the	law,	regulatory	requirements	and	rules,	good 	
practices,	ethically	and	with	appropriate	and	proper	governance	and 	
standards.	This	includes	reviewing	internal	controls,	ensuring	that 	
there	is	an	appropriate	balance	of	skills	and	experience	represented 	
on	the	Board	and	compliance	with	the	UK	Corporate	Governance 	
Code	(the	‘Code’),	which	is	issued	by	the	Financial	Reporting	Council 	
and	which	is	available	at	www.frc.org.uk,	and	for	maintaining 	
appropriate	relations	with	shareholders.
In	2016,	the	Company	reported	against	the	2014	version	of	the	Code. 	
In	September	2015,	the	FRC	published	a	consultation	on	revisions	to 	
Ethical	and	Auditing	Standards,	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code 	
and	related	Guidance	on	Audit	Committees	and,	as	a	result	of	this 	
consultation,	the	FRC	issued	an	updated	UK	Corporate	Governance 	
Code	and	associated	Guidance	on	Audit	Committees.
The	Company	is	therefore	reporting	against	the	2016	edition	of	the 	
Code	which	came	into	effect	for	accounting	periods	beginning	on	or 	
after	17	June	2016.	Key	changes	between	the	2014	and	2016	Codes 	
relate	to	a	requirement	for	competence	of	audit	committees	relevant 	
to	the	sector	in	which	the	company	operates,	a	deletion	of	the 	
requirement	for	FTSE	350	companies	to	put	the	external	audit 	
contract	out	to	tender	at	least	every	ten	years,	and	a	requirement	for 	
the	Audit	Committee	report	to	include	advance	notice	of	any	external 	
audit	retendering	plans.	During	the	year,	the	Audit	Committee 	
reviewed	its	Terms	of	Reference	(including	the	section	dealing	with	the 	
Group	Policy	for	the	Provision	of	Non-Audit	Services	by	the	External 	
Auditor),	and	further	details	are	included	in	the	Audit	Committee 	
report	on	page	62.
 The latest financial information for Mitchells & Butlers and its 
group of companies is included in the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts (of which this corporate governance statement forms 
part) and which are available online at :	www.mbplc.com/investors

Board composition
The	Board	started	and	ended	the	year	with	eleven	Directors	and 	
the	table	opposite	lists	the	composition	of	the	Board	during	the	year. 	
The Board
The	Board	is	responsible	to	all	stakeholders,	including	its	shareholders, 	
for	the	strategic	direction,	development	and	control	of	the	Group. 	
It	approves	strategic	plans	and	annual	capital	and	revenue	budgets. 	
It	reviews	significant	investment	proposals	and	the	performance	of 	
past	investments	and	maintains	an	overview	and	control	of	the	Group’s 	
operating	and	financial	performance.	It	monitors	the	Group’s	overall 	
system	of	internal	controls,	governance	and	compliance	and	ensures 	
that	the	necessary	financial,	technical	and	human	resources	are	in	place 	
for	the	Company	to	meet	its	objectives.	Our	website	includes	a	schedule 	
of	matters	which	have	been	reserved	for	the	main	Board.
During	FY	2016	there	were	ten	scheduled	Board	meetings.	There 	
were	also	four	meetings	of	the	Audit	Committee,	five	meetings	of 	
the	Remuneration	Committee	and	one	meeting	of	the	Nomination 	
Committee.	The	table	shows	attendance	levels	at	the	Board	and 	
Committee	meetings	held	during	the	year;	the	numbers	in	brackets 	
confirm	how	many	meetings	each	Director	was	eligible	to	attend 	
during	the	year.
Where	a	Director	was	unable	to	attend	a	meeting	(whether	of	the 	
Board	or	one	of	its	Committees),	they	were	provided	with	all	the	papers 	
and	information	relating	to	that	meeting	and	were	able	to	discuss	issues 	
arising	directly	with	the	Chairman	of	the	Board	or	Chair	of	the	relevant 	
Committee.	In	addition,	the	Board	members	meet	more	informally 	
approximately	four	times	a	year	and	the	Chairman	and	the	Non-Executive 	
Directors	meet	without	the	Executive	Directors	twice	a	year. 	
There	are	ten	Board	meetings	currently	planned	for	FY	2018. 	
The	Company	Secretary’s	responsibilities	include	ensuring	good 	
information	flows	to	the	Board	and	between	senior	management	and 	
the	Non-Executive	Directors.	The	Company	Secretary	is	responsible, 	
through	the	Chairman,	for	advising	the	Board	on	all	corporate 	
governance	matters	and	for	assisting	the	Directors	with	their	professional 	
development.	This	includes	regular	corporate	governance	and	business 	
issues	updates,	as	well	as	the	use	of	operational	site	visits	and	the 	
provision	of	external	courses	where	required.	The	Company	Secretary 	
facilitates	a	comprehensive	induction	for	newly	appointed	Directors, 	
tailored	to	individual	requirements	and	including	guidance	on	the 	
requirements	of,	and	Directors’	duties	in	connection	with,	the	Code	and 	
the	Companies	Act	2006	as	well	as	other	relevant	legislation.	In	FY	2017 , 	
the	Company	Secretary	also	co-ordinated	an	internal	performance 	
evaluation	of	the	Board.	The	appointment	and	removal	of	the	Company 	
Secretary	is	a	matter	reserved	for	the	Board.

Corporate governance statement continued
56 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 At	the	start	and	end	of	the	year,	the	Board	was	made	up	of	ten	male 	
and	one	female	members.	There	were	no	changes	to	the	Board	during 	
the	year.
The	Executive	Directors	have	service	contracts	which	are	summarised 	
on	pages	76	and	77 .	The	Chairman	and	each	of	the	Non-Executive 	
Directors	have	letters	of	appointment.	Copies	of	the	respective	service 	
contracts	or	letters	of	appointment	of	all	the	members	of	the	Board 	
are	available	on	the	Company’s	website.	In	addition,	they	are	available 	
for	inspection	at	the	registered	office	of	the	Company	during	normal 	
business	hours	and	at	the	place	of	the	Annual	General	Meeting	from 	
at	least	15	minutes	before	and	until	the	end	of	the	meeting.
All	the	Company’s	Directors	are	required	to	stand	for	annual	re-election 	
at	the	Company’s	Annual	General	Meeting	in	accordance	with	the 	
Company’s	Articles	of	Association.	Their	biographical	details	as	at 	
22	November	2017	are	set	out	on	pages	46	and	47 ,	including	their	main 	
commitments	outside	the	Company.
The	Executive	Directors	may	be	permitted	to	accept	one	external 	
Non-Executive	Director	appointment	with	the	Board’s	prior	approval 	
and	as	long	as	this	is	not	likely	to	lead	to	conflicts	of	interest.
Division of responsibilities between Chairman and Chief Executive
In	accordance	with	provision	A.2. 1	of	the	Code,	the	roles	of	Chairman 	
and	Chief	Executive	should	not	be	exercised	by	the	same	individual. 	
The	division	of	responsibilities	between	the	Chairman	and	the	Chief 	
Executive	are	clearly	established	and	set	out	in	writing	and	agreed	by 	
the	Board.	In	particular,	it	has	been	agreed	in	writing	that	the	Chairman 	
shall	be	responsible	for	running	the	Board	and	shall	provide	advice	and 	
assistance	to	the	Chief	Executive.	He	also	chairs	the	Nomination 	
Committee,	is	a	member	of	the	Remuneration	Committee	and	attends, 	
by	invitation,	meetings	of	the	Audit	Committee.	He	also	chairs	the 	
Market	Disclosure	Committee,	the	Property	Committee	and	the 	
Pensions	Committee.	
It	is	also	agreed	in	writing	that	the	Chief	Executive	has	responsibility	for 	
all	aspects	of	the	Group’s	overall	commercial,	operational	and	strategic 	
development.	He	chairs	the	Executive	Committee	(details	of	which 	
appear	on	page	59)	and	attends	the	Nomination,	Remuneration	and 	
Audit	Committee	by	invitation,	not	necessarily	for	the	entirety	of	such 	
meetings	depending	upon	the	subject	matter.	He	is	also	a	member	of 	
the	Market	Disclosure	Committee,	the	Property	Committee	and	the 	
Pensions	Committee.	
All	other	Executive	Directors	(currently	just	the	Finance	Director)	and	all 	
other	members	of	the	Executive	Committee	report	to	the	Chief	Executive.
Chairman
The	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code	provides	that	the	Chairman 	
should,	on	appointment,	meet	the	independence	criteria	set	out	in 	
provision	B. 1. 1	of	that	Code.	Bob	Ivell	met	these	independence	criteria 	
on	appointment.
Bob	Ivell	was	appointed	to	the	role	of	Executive	Chairman	on	26	October 	
2011	on	the	departure	of	the	then	Chief	Executive	and	reverted	to	the 	
role	of	Non-Executive	Chairman	on	12	November	2012. 	
The	Chairman	ensures	that	appropriate	communication	is	maintained 	
with	shareholders.	He	ensures	that	all	Directors	are	fully	informed	of 	
matters	relevant	to	their	roles. 	
Chief Executive
Phil	Urban	was	appointed	Chief	Executive	on	27	September	2015. 	
He	has	responsibility	for	implementing	the	strategy	agreed	by	the	Board 	
and	for	the	executive	management	of	the	Group.
Senior Independent Director
Stewart	Gilliland	was	appointed	to	the	role	of	Senior	Independent 	
Director	on	2	February	2015.
The	Senior	Independent	Director	supports	the	Chairman	in	the	delivery 	
of	the	Board’s	objectives	and	ensures	that	the	views	of	all	major 	
shareholders	and	stakeholders	are	conveyed	to	the	Board.	Stewart 	
Gilliland	is	available	to	all	shareholders	should	they	have	any	concerns 	
if	the	normal	channels	of	Chairman,	Chief	Executive	or	Finance	Director 	
have	failed	to	resolve	them,	or	for	which	such	contact	is	inappropriate. 	
The	Senior	Independent	Director	also	meets	with	Non-Executive 	
Directors,	without	the	Chairman	present,	at	least	annually,	and	conducts 	
the	annual	appraisal	of	the	Chairman’s	performance	and	provides 	
feedback	to	the	Chairman	on	the	outputs	of	that	appraisal.
Non-Executive Directors 
The	Company	has	experienced	Non-Executive	Directors	on	its	Board. 	
Bob	Ivell	was	considered	to	be	independent	upon	his	appointment	on 	
9	May	2011	in	that	he	was	free	from	any	business	or	other	relationship 	
with	the	Company	which	could	materially	influence	his	judgement	and 	
he	continues	to	represent	a	strong	source	of	advice	and	independent 	
challenge.	Since	his	appointment	as	Chairman	on	14	July	2011	the 	
independence	test,	as	set	out	in	the	Code,	is	no	longer	applicable 	
to	his	current	position. 	
Ron	Robson	and	Josh	Levy	were	appointed	to	the	Board	as 	
representatives	of	one	of	the	Company’s	largest	shareholders,	Piedmont 	
Inc.,	and	were	therefore	not	regarded	as	independent	in	accordance 	
with	the	Code. 	
Eddie	Irwin	and	Keith	Browne	were	appointed	to	the	Board	as 	
representatives	of	another	of	the	Company’s	largest	shareholders, 	
Elpida	Group	Limited	and	were	therefore	not	regarded	as	independent 	
in	accordance	with	the	Code.
There	are	currently	four	independent	Non-Executive	Directors	on	the 	
Board:	Stewart	Gilliland,	Colin	Rutherford,	Imelda	Walsh	and	Dave	Coplin.
Other	than	their	fees,	and	reimbursement	of	taxable	expenses	which 	
are	disclosed	on	page	80,	the	Non-Executive	Directors	received	no 	
remuneration	from	the	Company	during	the	year. 	
When	Non-Executive	Directors	are	considered	for	appointment, 	
the	Board	takes	into	account	their	other	responsibilities	in	assessing 	
whether	they	can	commit	sufficient	time	to	their	prospective	directorship. 	
On	average,	the	Non-Executive	Directors	spend	two	to	three	days	per 	
month	on	Company	business,	but	this	may	be	more	depending	on	the

All	Directors	are	briefed	by	the	use	of	comprehensive	papers	circulated 	
in	advance	of	Board	meetings	and	by	presentations	at	those	meetings,	in 	
addition	to	receiving	minutes	of	previous	meetings.	Their	understanding 	
of	the	Group’s	business	is	enhanced	by	business	specific	presentations 	
and	operational	visits	to	the	Group’s	businesses.	Separate	strategy 	
meetings	and	meetings	with	senior	executives	and	representatives	of 	
specific	functions,	brands	or	business	units	are	also	held	throughout 	
the	year.	
The	training	needs	of	Directors	are	formally	considered	on	an	annual 	
basis	and	are	also	monitored	throughout	the	year	with	appropriate 	
training	being	provided	as	required,	including	corporate	social 	
responsibility	and	corporate	governance	as	well	as	the	environmental 	
impacts	of	the	Company’s	activities.
Committees
Each	Board	Committee	has	written	terms	of	reference	approved	by 	
the	Board,	which	are	available	on	the	Company’s	website.	Those	terms 	
of	reference	are	each	reviewed	annually	by	the	relevant	Committee 	
to	ensure	they	remain	appropriate.
Audit Committee
Details	of	the	Audit	Committee	and	its	activities	during	the	year	are

incorporated	by	reference	into	this	statement.
Remuneration Committee
Details	of	the	Remuneration	Committee	and	its	activities	during	the	year 	
are	included	in	the	Report	on	Directors’	remuneration	on	pages	66	to	87 .
Nomination Committee
The	Nomination	Committee	is	responsible	for	nominating,	for	the 	
approval	of	the	Board,	candidates	for	appointment	to	the	Board.	It	is	also 	
responsible	for	succession	planning	for	the	Board	and	the	Executive 	
Committee	and	reviewing	the	output	of	the	Board	effectiveness	review. 	
During	the	year,	the	Nomination	Committee	considered	the	composition 	
of	the	Board	and	commissioned	the	internally -facilitated	Board	
effectiveness	review.
The	Nomination	Committee	agrees	the	importance	of	having	diversity 	
on	the	Board,	including	female	representation	and	individuals	with 	
different	experiences,	skill	sets	and	expertise,	so	as	to	maintain	an 	
appropriate	balance	within	the	Company	and	on	the	Board.
Board Diversity Policy
The	Board	has	approved	a	Board	Diversity	Policy.	The	key	statement 	
and	objectives	of	that	policy	are	as	follows:
Statement:
The	Board	recognises	the	benefits	of	diversity.	Diversity	of	skills, 	
background,	knowledge,	international	and	industry	experience,	and 	
gender,	amongst	many	other	factors,	will	be	taken	into	consideration 	
when	seeking	to	appoint	a	new	Director	to	the	Board.	Notwithstanding 	
the	foregoing,	all	Board	appointments	will	always	be	made	on	merit.
Objectives:
•	The	Board	should	ensure	an	appropriate	mix	of	skills	and	experience 	
to	ensure	an	optimum	Board	and	efficient	stewardship.	All	Board 	
appointments	will	be	made	on	merit	while	taking	into	account 	
individual	competence,	skills	and	expertise	measured	against 	
identified	objective	criteria	(including	consideration	of	diversity).
•	The	Board	should	ensure	that	it	comprises	Directors	who	are 	
sufficiently	experienced	and	independent	of	character	and	judgement.
•	The	Nomination	Committee	will	discuss	and	agree	measurable 	
objectives	for	achieving	diversity	on	the	Board	with	due	regard	being 	
given	to	the	recommendations	set	out	in	the	Davies	Report,	the 	
Hampton-Alexander	Review	and	the	UK	Corporate	Governance 	
Code	2016.	These	will	be	reviewed	on	an	annual	basis.
Progress against the policy:
The	Board	continues	to	monitor	progress	against	this	policy.	In	terms 	
of	Board	diversity,	the	proportion	of	women	on	the	Board	was	9%	as 	
at	the	year	ended	30	September	2017 .	Any	future	appointments	will 	
always	be	made	on	merit	and	will	continue	to	take	into	account	diversity, 	
not	only	in	terms	of	gender,	but	also	in	terms	of	the	appropriate	mix	of 	
skills	and	experience. 	
Details	of	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Diversity	Policy,	which	applies	to 	
diversity	in	relation	to	employees	of	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Group,	can 	
be	found	in	the	corporate	social	responsibility	section	on	pages	30	to	35.
A	detailed	description	of	the	duties	of	the	Nomination	Committee 	
is	set	out	within	its	terms	of	reference	which	can	be	viewed	at

Corporate governance statement continued
58 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Market Disclosure Committee
The	EU	Market	Abuse	Regulation	(MAR)	which	took	effect	in	July	2016, 	
brought	about	substantial	changes	relating	to	announcements	of	material	
information	about	the	Company	and	its	affairs,	and	relating	to	dealings 	
in	shares	or	other	securities	by	Directors	and	other	senior	managers, 	
including	tighter	controls	on	permitted	‘dealings’	during	closed	periods 	
and	the	handling	of	information	relating	to	the	Company.	MAR	requires 	
companies	to	keep	a	list	of	people	affected	and	the	previous	compliance 	
regime	and	timeframe	were	enhanced.
As	a	result,	a	formal	standing	Committee	of	the	Board	was	established, 	
called	the	Market	Disclosure	Committee,	which	is	comprised	of	the 	
Chairman,	the	Chief	Executive,	the	Finance	Director	and	an	independent	
Non-Executive	Director,	currently	Colin	Rutherford. 	
Executive Committee
The	Executive	Committee,	which	is	chaired	by	the	Chief	Executive, 	
consists	of	the	Executive	Directors	and	certain	other	senior	executives, 	
namely	Gary	John	(Group	Property	Director),	Susan	Martindale 	
(Group	HR	Director),	Greg	McMahon	(Company	Secretary	and 	
General	Counsel),	Chris	Hopkins	(Commercial	and	Marketing	Director) 	
and	Susan	Chappell,	Nick	Crossley,	Dennis	Deare	and	Rob	Pitcher 	
(all	Divisional	Directors).
The	Executive	Committee	meets	at	least	every	six	weeks	and	has 	
day-to-day	responsibility	for	the	running	of	the	Group’s	business.	It 	
develops	the	Group’s	strategy	and	annual	revenue	and	capital	budgets 	
for	Board	approval.	It	reviews	and	recommends	to	the	Board	any 	
significant	investment	proposals.	This	Committee	monitors	the	financial 	
and	operational	performance	of	the	Group	and	allocates	resources 	
within	the	budgets	agreed	by	the	Board.	It	considers	employment	issues, 	
ensures	the	Group	has	an	appropriate	pool	of	talent	and	develops	senior 	
management	manpower	planning	and	succession	plans.	A	note	of	the 	
actions	agreed	by,	and	the	principal	decisions	of,	the	Executive 	
Committee	are	supplied	to	the	Board	for	information	in	order	that 	
Board	members	can	keep	abreast	of	operational	developments.
Phil	Urban	has	ultimate	responsibility	for	employment	related	issues 	
and	he	also	oversees	matters	relating	to	human	rights	including	the 	
implementation	of	the	Modern	Slavery	Act	throughout	the	Group.
General Purposes Committee
The	General	Purposes	Committee	comprises	any	two	Executive 	
Directors	or	any	one	Executive	Director	together	with	a	senior	officer 	
from	an	agreed	and	restricted	list	of	senior	Executives.	It	is	always 	
chaired	by	an	Executive	Director.	It	attends	to	business	of	a	routine 	
nature	and	to	the	administration	of	matters,	the	principles	of	which	have 	
been	agreed	previously	by	the	Board	or	an	appropriate	Committee.
Property Committee
The	Property	Committee	reviews	property	transactions	which	have 	
been	reviewed	and	recommended	by	the	Portfolio	Development 	
Committee,	without	the	need	for	submission	of	transactions	to	the	full 	
Board.	The	Property	Committee	agrees	to	the	overall	strategic	direction 	
for	the	management	of	the	Group’s	property	portfolio	on	a	half-yearly 	
basis	and	may	decide	that	a	particular	transaction	should	be	referred 	
to	the	Board	for	consideration	or	approval.	The	Property	Committee 	
comprises	Bob	Ivell	(Committee	Chair),	Phil	Urban,	Tim	Jones,	Josh	Levy, 	
Keith	Browne,	Colin	Rutherford,	Stewart	Gilliland	and	Gary	John.
Portfolio Development Committee
The	executive	review	of	property	transactions	and	capital	allocation	to 	
significant	property	matters	such	as	site	remodel	and	conversion	plans 	
and	the	Company’s	real	estate	strategy	is	carried	out	by	the	Portfolio 	
Development	Committee.	This	is	not	a	formal	Board	Committee	but 	
is	comprised	of	the	Chief	Executive,	the	Finance	Director,	the	Group 	
Property	Director	and	the	Company	Secretary	and	General	Counsel. 	
It	has	delegated	authority	to	approve	certain	transactions	up	to	agreed 	
financial	limits	and,	above	those	authority	levels,	it	makes 	
recommendations	to	the	Board	or	the	Property	Committee.
Pensions Committee
The	Board	has	established	a	Pensions	Committee	to	supervise	and 	
manage	the	Company’s	relationship	with	its	various	pension	schemes 	
and	their	trustees. 	
The	Pensions	Committee	members	are	Bob	Ivell	(Committee	Chair), 	
Colin	Rutherford,	Imelda	Walsh,	Tim	Jones,	Phil	Urban,	Keith	Browne 	
and	Josh	Levy.
Throughout	FY	2017	the	work	of	the	Pensions	Committee	focused 	
primarily	on	the	negotiations	with	the	Trustee	of	the	Group’s	two 	
principal	defined	benefit	pension	schemes,	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers 	
Pension	Plan	and	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Executive	Pension	Plan, 	
to	agree	the	triennial	valuations	of	those	schemes	as	at	31	March	2016. 	
The	successful	conclusion	of	those	triennial	valuations	was	announced 	
by	the	Company	in	its	Third	Quarter	Trading	Update	on	27	July	2017 . 	
Those	valuations	showed	an	agreed	deficit	of	£451m	(which	was	a 	
reduction	from	the	deficit	of	£572m	as	disclosed	by	the	2013	triennial 	
valuations)	which	will	be	funded	by	an	unchanged	level	of	cash 	
contribution	(of	£46m	p.a.,	indexed)	to	2023.
The	discussions	and	negotiations	between	the	Trustee	of	the	Group’s 	
two	defined	benefit	plans	and	the	Pensions	Committee	were	led	on	the 	
Pension	Committee’s	behalf	by	Colin	Rutherford,	one	of	the	Company’s 	
independent	Non-Executive	Directors.	This	process	was	complicated 	
and	necessarily	highly	detailed.	To	reflect	the	very	significant	amount 	
of	time	and	effort	which	Mr	Rutherford	committed	to	this	process	during 	
FY	2017 ,	the	Board	approved	a	one-off	additional	fee	for	Mr	Rutherford 	
of	£75,000.	The	Board	does	not	expect	that	there	will	be	any	further 	
fee	of	this	nature	in	FY	2018.
Treasury Committee 
The	treasury	operations	of	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Group	are	operated 	
on	a	centralised	basis	under	the	control	of	the	Group	Treasury 	
department.	Although	not	a	formal	Board	Committee,	the	Treasury 	
Committee,	which	reports	to	the	Finance	Director	but	is	subject	to 	
oversight	from	the	Audit	Committee	and,	ultimately,	the	Board, 	
has	day-to-day	responsibility	for:
•	liquidity	management;	
•	investment	of	surplus	cash; 	
•	funding,	cash	and	banking	arrangements; 	
•	interest	rate	and	currency	risk	management; 	
•	guarantees,	bonds,	indemnities	and	any	financial	encumbrances 	
including	charges	on	assets;	and 	
•	relationships	with	Banks	and	other	market	counterparties	such 	
as	credit	rating	agencies.

STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 The	Treasury	Committee	also	works	closely	with	the	financial	accounting 	
department	to	review	the	impact	of	changes	in	relevant	accounting 	
practices	and	to	ensure	that	treasury	activities	are	disclosed	appropriately	
in	the	Company’s	accounts.
The	Board	delegates	the	monitoring	of	treasury	activity	and 	
compliance	to	the	Treasury	Committee.	It	is	responsible	for	monitoring 	
the	effectiveness	of	treasury	policies	and	making	proposals	for	any 	
changes	to	policies	or	in	respect	of	the	utilisation	of	new	instruments. 	
The	approval	of	the	Board,	or	a	designated	committee	thereof, 	
is	required	for	any	such	proposals. 	
Independent advice
Members	of	the	Board	may	take	independent	professional	advice	in 	
the	furtherance	of	their	duties	and	the	Board	has	agreed	a	formal	process 	
for	such	advice	to	be	made	available.	Members	of	the	Board	also	have 	
access	to	the	advice	and	services	of	the	Company	Secretary	and	General 	
Counsel,	the	Company’s	legal	and	other	professional	advisers	and	its 	
external	auditor.	The	terms	of	engagement	of	the	Company’s	external 	
advisers	and	its	external	auditor	are	regularly	reviewed	by	the	Company 	
Secretary	and	General	Counsel.
Code of Ethics 
The	Company	has	implemented	business	conduct	guidelines	describing 	
the	standards	of	behaviour	expected	from	those	working	for	the 	
Company	in	the	form	of	a	code	of	ethics	(the	‘Ethics	Code’).	The	Ethics 	
Code	was	reviewed	and	re-communicated	to	all	employees	in	FY	2017 	
to	ensure	it	was	kept	clearly	in	focus.	Its	aim	is	to	promote	honest	and 	
ethical	conduct	throughout	our	business.	The	Ethics	Code	requires:
•	compliance	with	all	applicable	rules	and	regulations	that	apply	to	the 	
Company	and	its	officers	including	compliance	with	the	requirements 	
of	the	Bribery	Act	2010;
•	the	ethical	handling	of	actual	or	apparent	conflicts	of	interest	between 	
internal	and	external,	personal	and	professional	relationships;	and
•	that	any	hospitality	from	suppliers	must	be	approved	in	advance 	
by	appropriate	senior	management,	with	a	presumption	against 	
its	acceptance.
The	Company	takes	a	zero	tolerance	approach	to	bribery	and	has 	
developed	an	extensive	Bribery	Policy	which	is	included	in	the	Ethics 	
Code.	The	Ethics	Code	requires	employees	to	comply	with	the 	
Bribery	Policy.
The	Company	also	offers	an	independently	administered,	confidential 	
whistleblowing	hotline	for	any	employee	wishing	to	report	any	concern 	
that	they	feel	would	be	inappropriate	to	raise	with	their	line	manager. 	
All	whistleblowing	allegations	are	reported	to,	and	considered	by,	the 	
Executive	Committee	and	a	summary	report	(with	details	of	any	major 	
concerns)	is	supplied	to,	and	considered	by,	the	Audit	Committee	at 	
each	meeting.
The	Board	takes	regular	account	of	social,	environmental	and	ethical 	
matters	concerning	the	Company	through	regular	reports	to	the	Board 	
and	presentations	to	the	Board	at	its	strategy	meetings.	The	Company’s 	
compliance	statement	in	relation	to	the	Modern	Slavery	Act	can	be 	
viewed	on	the	Company’s	website	www.mbplc.com
Directors’	training	includes	environmental,	social	and	governance	(‘ESG’) 	
matters	and	the	Company	Secretary	is	responsible	for	ensuring	that 	
Directors	are	made	aware	of	and	receive	regular	training	in	respect	of 	
these	important	areas.	The	Chief	Executive,	Phil	Urban,	is	ultimately 	
responsible	for	ESG	matters. 	
The	Board	is	responsible	for	the	Company’s	internal	risk	management 	
system,	in	respect	of	which	more	details	can	be	found	in	the	‘Risks 	
and	uncertainties’	section	of	this	report,	and	in	the	following	section 	
of	this	statement. 	
Internal control and risk management 
The	Board	has	overall	responsibility	for	the	Group’s	system	of	internal 	
control	and	risk	management	and	for	reviewing	its	effectiveness.	In	order 	
to	discharge	that	responsibility,	the	Board	has	established	the	procedures	
necessary	to	apply	the	Code	for	the	year	under	review	and	to	the	date	of 	
approval	of	the	Annual	Report.	Such	procedures	are	regularly	reviewed 	
by	the	Audit	Committee.
The	key	features	of	the	Group’s	internal	control	and	risk	management 	
systems	include:
•	Processes,	including	monitoring	by	the	Board,	in	respect	of: 	
i.	 financial	performance	within	a	comprehensive	financial	planning, 	
accounting	and	reporting	framework;
ii.	 strategic	plan	achievement;
iii.	 capital	investment	and	asset	management	performance,	with 	
detailed	appraisal,	authorisation	and	post-investment	reviews;	and
iv.	 consumer	insight	data	and	actions	to	assess	the	evolution	of 	
brands	and	formats	to	ensure	that	they	continue	to	be	appealing 	
and	relevant	to	the	Group’s	guests.
•	An	overall	governance	framework	including:
i.	 clearly	defined	delegations	of	authority	and	reporting	lines; 	
ii.	 a	comprehensive	set	of	policies	and	procedures	that	employees 	
are	required	to	follow;	and
iii.	 the	Group’s	Ethics	Code,	in	respect	of	which	an	annual 	
confirmation	of	 compliance	 is	 sought	 from	 all	 corporate	 employees.
•	The	Risk	Committee,	a	sub-committee	of	the	Executive	Committee, 	
which	assists	the	Board,	the	Audit	Committee	and	the	Executive 	
Committee	in	managing	the	processes	for	identifying,	evaluating, 	
monitoring	and	mitigating	risks.	The	Risk	Committee,	which	continues 	
to	meet	quarterly,	is	chaired	by	the	Company	Secretary	and	General 	
Counsel	and	comprises	Executive	Committee	members	and	other 	
members	of	senior	management	from	a	cross-section	of	functions. 	
Its	primary	responsibilities	are	to:
i.	 advise	the	Executive	Committee	on	the	Company’s	overall 	
risk	appetite	and	risk	strategy,	taking	account	of	the	current 	
and	prospective	operating,	legal,	macroeconomic	and 	
financial	environments;
ii.	 advise	the	Executive	Committee	on	the	current	and	emerging 	
risk	exposures	of	the	Company	in	the	context	of	the	Board’s 	
overall	risk	appetite	and	risk	strategy;
iii.	 promote	the	management	of	risk	throughout	the	organisation;
iv.	 review	and	monitor	the	Company’s	capability	and	processes 	
to	identify	and	manage	risks;
v.	 consider	the	identified	key	risks	faced	by	the	Company	and 	
new	and	emerging	risks	and	consider	the	adequacy	of	mitigation 	
plans	in	respect	of	such	risks;	and
vi.	 where	mitigation	plans	are	inadequate,	recommend 	
improvement	actions.
Corporate governance statement continued
60 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 The	Group’s	risks	identified	by	the	processes	that	are	managed	by 	
the	Risk	Committee	are	described	in	‘Risks	and	uncertainties’	on	pages 	
36	to	40.	More	details	of	the	work	of	the	Risk	Committee	are	included 	
in	the	Audit	Committee	report	on	pages	62	to	65.
•	Examination	of	business	processes	on	a	risk	basis	including	reports 	
from	the	internal	audit	function,	known	as	Group	Assurance,	which 	
reports	directly	to	the	Audit	Committee.
The	Group	also	has	in	place	systems,	including	policies	and	procedures, 	
for	exercising	control	and	managing	risk	in	respect	of	financial	reporting 	
and	the	preparation	of	consolidated	accounts.	These	systems,	policies 	
and	procedures:
•	govern	the	maintenance	of	accounting	records	that,	in	reasonable 	
detail,	accurately	and	fairly	reflect	transactions;
•	require	reported	information	to	be	reviewed	and	reconciled, 	
with	monitoring	by	the	Audit	Committee	and	the	Board;	and
•	provide	reasonable	assurance	that	transactions	are	recorded	as 	
necessary	to	permit	the	preparation	of	financial	statements	in 	
accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(‘IFRS’) 	
or	UK	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice,	as	appropriate.
In	accordance	with	the	Code,	during	the	year	the	Audit	Committee 	
completed	(and	reported	to	the	Board	its	conclusions	in	respect	of)	its 	
annual	review	of	the	effectiveness	of	the	Group’s	risk	management	and 	
internal	control	systems,	including	financial,	operational	and	compliance 	
controls.	The	system	of	internal	control	is	designed	to	manage,	rather 	
than	eliminate,	the	risk	of	failure	to	achieve	business	objectives	and,	as 	
such,	it	can	only	provide	reasonable	and	not	absolute	assurance	against 	
material	misstatement	or	loss.	In	that	context,	in	the	opinion	of	the	Audit 	
Committee,	the	review	did	not	indicate	that	the	system	was	ineffective 	
or	unsatisfactory	and	to	the	extent	that	weaknesses	in	internal	controls 	
were	identified,	the	Audit	Committee	confirmed	that	necessary	remedial 	
action	plans	were	in	place.	The	Audit	Committee	is	not	aware	of	any 	
change	to	this	status	up	to	the	date	of	approval	of	this	Annual	Report.
With	regard	to	insurance	against	risk,	it	is	not	practicable	to	insure	against	
every	risk	to	the	fullest	extent.	The	Group	regularly	reviews	both	the 	
type	and	amount	of	external	insurance	that	it	buys	with	guidance	from 	
an	external	independent	broker,	bearing	in	mind	the	availability	of	such 	
cover,	its	cost	and	the	likelihood	and	magnitude	of	the	risks	involved.
Shareholder relations
The	Board	recognises	that	it	is	accountable	to	shareholders	for	the 	
performance	and	activities	of	the	Company.	The	Company	regularly 	
updates	the	market	on	its	financial	performance,	at	the	half	year	and 	
full	year	results	in	May	and	November	respectively,	and	by	way	of	other 	
announcements	as	required.	The	content	of	these	updates	is	available 	
by	webcast	on	the	Company’s	website,	together	with	general 	
information	about	the	Company	so	as	to	be	available	to	all	shareholders. 	
The	Company	has	a	regular	programme	of	meetings	with	its	larger 	
shareholders	which	provides	an	opportunity	to	discuss,	on	the	basis 	
of	publicly	available	information,	the	progress	of	the	business. 	
On	a	more	informal	basis,	the	Chairman,	Chief	Executive	and	the	Finance	
Director	regularly	report	to	the	Board	the	views	of	larger	shareholders 	
about	the	Company,	and	the	other	Non-Executive	Directors	are	available 	
to	meet	shareholders	on	request	and	are	offered	the	opportunity	to 	
attend	meetings	with	larger	shareholders. 	
The	AGM	provides	a	useful	interface	with	shareholders,	many	of 	
whom	are	also	guests	in	our	pubs,	bars	and	restaurants.	All	proxy	votes 	
received	in	respect	of	each	resolution	at	the	AGM	are	counted	and	the 	
balance	for	and	against,	and	any	votes	withheld,	are	indicated.

During	FY	2017 ,	the	Nomination	Committee	commissioned	an	internal 	
self-evaluation	review	in	which	the	Board	continued	to	review	the 	
effectiveness	of	individual	Directors.	The	conclusions	of	that	review 	
have	been	reported	on	to	the	Board	and	appropriate	actions	relating 	
to	adjustments	and	improvements	to	the	way	in	which	the	Directors, 	
the	Board	and	its	Committees	interact	have	been	agreed	upon.	None 	
of	these	constitute	significant	changes	to	the	pre-existing	operational 	
practices	of	the	Board	or	its	Committees	but,	rather,	fall	within	the	ambit 	
of	continuous	review	and	evolution.
In	summary,	the	principal	outputs	of	that	review	were	that:
•	The	Board	should	continue	to	keep	under	close	review	the	evolution 	
of,	and	emerging	trends	across,	the	leisure	and	hospitality	industry, 	
which	it	was	noted	is	still	developing	rapidly,	as	well	as	monitoring 	
current	operations;
•	There	was	a	continued	need	for	up	to	date	succession	plans	with 	
particular	reference	to	diversity;	and
•	The	Board	should	have	the	opportunity	to	spend	time	in	the	Group’s 	
businesses	to	ensure	continued	familiarity	with	the	delivery	of	the 	
Group’s	goods	and	services	and	the	operational	environment.
All	 of	 these	 matters	 have	 been	 built	 into	 the	 Board’s	 timetable	 for	 FY	 2018.
The	Senior	Independent	Director,	Stewart	Gilliland,	has	led	the	process 	
for	the	annual	appraisal	of	the	Chairman’s	performance	with	the 	
independent	Non-Executive	Directors	(without	the	Chairman	present) 	
and	the	conclusions	were	fed	back	to	the	Chairman.
Annual	reviews	of	the	Chairman’s	performance	will	continue	to	be 	
conducted	as	required	by	the	Code.	Further,	the	Board	Effectiveness 	
Review	included	an	assessment	of	the	Chairman	and	his	fulfilment 	
of	his	role.

STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 Membership and remit of the Audit Committee 
The	main	purpose	of	the	Audit	Committee	is	to	review	and	maintain 	
oversight	of	Mitchells	&	Butlers’	corporate	governance,	particularly	with 	
respect	to	financial	reporting,	internal	control	and	risk	management. 	
The	Audit	Committee’s	responsibilities	also	include:
•	reviewing	the	processes	for	detecting	fraud,	misconduct	and	internal 	
control	weaknesses;
•	reviewing	the	effectiveness	of	the	Group	Assurance	function;	and
•	overseeing	the	relationship	with	the	external	and	internal	auditors. 	
At	the	date	of	the	2017	Annual	Report,	the	Audit	Committee	comprises 	
four	independent	Non-Executive	Directors:	Colin	Rutherford	(Chair), 	
Imelda	Walsh,	Stewart	Gilliland	and	Dave	Coplin,	and	two	further 	
Non-Executive	Directors	nominated	by	substantial	shareholders, 	
Ron	Robson	and	Eddie	Irwin.	In	accordance	with	Code	provision	C.3. 1 	
the	Board	considers	that	Colin	Rutherford	has	significant,	recent	and 	
relevant	financial	experience.	Biographies	of	all	of	the	members	of	the 	
Audit	Committee,	including	a	summary	of	their	respective	experience, 	
appear	on	pages	46	and	47 . 	
Following	the	appointment	of	three	Independent	Non-Executive 	
Directors	in	April	and	May	2013,	Committee	members	were	appointed 	
with	effect	from	11	July	2013,	and	revised	terms	of	reference	were 	
established,	in	order	to	comply	with	Code	requirements.	Those	terms 	
of	reference	are	reviewed	annually.
The	Audit	Committee	continued	to	meet	quarterly	during	FY	2017 . 	
In	each	case,	appropriate	papers	were	distributed	to	the	Committee 	
members	and	other	invited	attendees,	including,	where	and	to	the 	
extent	appropriate,	representatives	of	the	external	audit	firm	and 	
the	internal	Group	Assurance	function. 	
When	appropriate,	the	Audit	Committee	augments	the	skills	and 	
experience	of	its	members	with	advice	from	internal	and	external	audit 	
professionals,	for	example,	on	matters	such	as	developments	in	financial 	
reporting.	Audit	Committee	meetings	are	also	attended,	by	invitation, 	
by	other	members	of	the	Board	including	the	Chief	Executive	and	the 	
Finance	Director,	the	Company	Secretary	and	General	Counsel,	the 	
Group	Risk	Director	and	representatives	of	the	external	auditor,	Deloitte 	
LLP .	The	Audit	Committee	also	meets	privately	not	less	than	twice	a	year, 	
without	any	member	of	management	present,	in	relation	to	audit 	
matters,	with	the	external	auditor. 	
The	remuneration	of	the	members	of	the	Audit	Committee	is	set	out 	
in	the	Report	on	Directors’	remuneration	on	page	80.
Introduction from the Audit 
Committee Chairman
I am delighted to present, on behalf of the 
Board, the report of its Audit Committee for 
the financial year ended 30 September 2017 .
	
Over	the	previous	year	we	continued	to	have	the	benefit	of	spending 	
valuable	time	with	our	Group	Risk	Director	and	those	key	individuals 	
throughout	the	Group,	who	collectively	provide	an	appreciation	and 	
rigorous	insight	into	how	our	Group	functions	and	reports.	These 	
interactions	are	extremely	valuable	and	the	Committee	are	grateful 	
for	the	instruction	they	provide.	These	activities	also	significantly 	
assist	towards	the	promotion	and	efficient	execution	of	the 	
Committee’s	oversight	role.
Engagement with auditors and third parties
The	Committee	continued	to	engage	formally,	regularly	and	at 	
an	appropriate	level	of	detail	with	our	external	auditors,	internal 	
auditors	(also	externally	resourced),	and	other	third-party	advisers	as 	
necessary.	This	has	enabled	the	Committee	to	maintain	an	appropriate 	
understanding	of	how	our	auditors	and	third-party	advisers	interact 	
with	our	assurance	and	risk	function.	In	turn	this	enabled	these 	
essential	authorities	to	provide	comprehensive	coverage	of	audit 	
process	and	third-party	assurance	and	risk,	and	this	helped	augment 	
our	Committee’s	confidence	in	their	respective	and	collective 	
fieldwork	conclusions.
It	is	also	important	to	note	our	Committee’s	role	in	overseeing 	
the	well-considered	provision	of	adequate	resources	by	the	Group, 	
towards	ensuring	that	any	additional	non-audit	services	required 	
over	the	year	were	obtained	where	necessary,	and	in	dealing	with 	
the	increasing	role	of	the	FRC	and	its	incumbent	reporting	demands.
Effectiveness of internal controls and Group assurance 
and risk function
The	above	efforts	provided	the	Committee	with	a	clear	and	detailed 	
understanding	of	the	principal	operations	at	all	levels	over	the	year. 	
The	Committee	continued	to	focus	on	challenging	the	effectiveness 	
of	the	Group’s	internal	controls,	the	robustness	of	Group	Assurance 	
and	Risk	Management	processes	and	in	assessing	the	importance	of, 	
and	acting	as	required	upon,	all	reported	information	received	from 	
our	auditors	and	third-party	advisers.
We	remain	committed	to	maintaining	an	open	and	constructive 	
dialogue	with	our	shareholders	on	audit	matters.	Therefore,	if	you 	
have	any	comments	or	questions	on	any	element	of	the	report,	please

62 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Summary terms of reference
A	copy	of	the	Audit	Committee’s	terms	of	reference	is	publicly 	
available	within	the	Investor	section	of	the	Company’s	website: 	
www.mbplc.com/pdf/audit_committee_terms.pdf
The	Audit	Committee’s	terms	of	reference	were	approved	by	the 	
Committee	and	adopted	by	the	plc	Board	in	2013.	Those	terms	of 	
reference	specifically	provide	that	they	will	be	reviewed	annually. 	
They	have	been	reviewed	each	year	since	and	no	changes	were	felt 	
to	be	needed	in	FY	2017 .	At	the	time	of	re-adoption	of	the	Company’s 	
Corporate	Governance	Compliance	Statement	in	July	2016,	as	updated 	
to	reflect	changes	required	to	give	effect	to	the	introduction	of	the 	
Market	Abuse	Regulation	(MAR),	any	changes	to	the	Company’s 	
governance	arrangements	to	reflect	the	requirements	of	MAR	were 	
introduced.	Other	than	those	MAR	related	amendments,	which	related 	
to	consequential	changes	to	regulatory	references	(e.g.	the	UKLA’s 	
Disclosure	and	Transparency	Rules	are	now	known	as	the	Disclosure 	
Guidance	and	Transparency	Rules),	there	have	been	no	material	changes 	
to	these	Terms	of	Reference	since	the	last	review	in	2015.	Accordingly, 	
in	FY	2017	no	changes	were	made	to	the	terms	of	reference	of	the	Audit 	
Committee,	and	the	work	of	the	Audit	Committee	is	kept	under	review 	
with	the	expectation	that	any	such	matters	which	come	to	light	are 	
included	in	the	review	scheduled	for	FY	2018. 	
The	Audit	Committee	is	authorised	by	the	Board	to	review	any	activity 	
within	the	business.	It	is	authorised	to	seek	any	information	it	requires 	
from,	and	require	the	attendance	at	any	of	its	meetings	of,	any	Director 	
or	member	of	management,	and	all	employees	are	expected	to 	
co-operate	with	any	request	made	by	the	Audit	Committee. 	
The	Audit	Committee	is	authorised	by	the	Board	to	obtain,	at	the 	
Company’s	expense,	outside	legal	or	other	independent	professional 	
advice	and	secure	the	attendance	of	outsiders	with	relevant	experience 	
and	expertise,	if	it	considers	this	necessary.	The	Chair	of	the	Audit 	
Committee	reports	to	the	subsequent	Board	meeting	on	the	Committee’s 	
work	and	the	Board	receives	a	copy	of	the	minutes	of	each	meeting. 	
The	role	and	responsibilities	of	the	Audit	Committee	are	to:
•	review	the	Company’s	public	statements	on	internal	control, 	
risk	management	and	corporate	governance	compliance;
•	review	the	Company’s	processes	for	detecting	fraud,	misconduct 	
and	control	weaknesses	and	to	consider	the	Company’s	response 	
to	any	such	occurrence;
•	review	management’s	evaluation	of	any	change	in	internal	controls 	
over	financial	reporting;
•	review	with	management	and	the	auditor,	Company	financial	statements 	
required	under	UK	legislation	before	submission	to	the	Board;
•	establish,	review	and	maintain	the	role	and	effectiveness	of	the	internal 	
audit	function,	known	as	Group	Assurance,	whose	objective	is	to 	
provide	independent	assurance	over	the	Group’s	significant	processes 	
and	controls,	including	those	in	respect	of	the	Group’s	key	risks;
•	assume	direct	responsibility	for	the	appointment,	compensation, 	
resignation,	dismissal	and	the	overseeing	of	the	auditor,	including 	
review	of	the	external	audit,	its	cost	and	effectiveness;
•	pre-approve	non-audit	work	to	be	carried	out	by	the	auditor	and	the 	
fees	to	be	paid	for	that	work	together	with	the	monitoring	of	the	external 	
auditor’s	independence;
•	oversee	the	process	for	dealing	with	complaints	received	by	the 	
Group	regarding	accounting,	internal	accounting	controls	or	auditing 	
matters	and	any	confidential,	anonymous	submission	by	employees	of 	
concerns	regarding	questionable	accounting	or	auditing	matters;	and
•	adopt	and	oversee	a	specific	Code	of	Ethics	for	all	corporate 	
employees	which	is	consistent	with	the	Company’s	overall	statement 	
of	business	ethics.
Key activities of the Audit Committee
Audit	matters	are	reviewed	at	quarterly	Audit	Committee	meetings 	
throughout	the	year	at	which	detailed	reports	are	presented	for	review. 	
The	Audit	Committee	commissions	reports	from	external	advisers, 	
the	Group	Risk	Director	or	Company	management,	either	after 	
consideration	of	the	Company’s	major	risks	or	in	response	to	developing 	
issues.	During	the	year,	in	order	to	fulfil	the	roles	and	responsibilities	of 	
the	Audit	Committee,	the	following	matters	were	considered:
•	the	suitability	of	the	Group’s	accounting	policies	and	practices; 	
•	half	year	and	full	year	financial	results;
•	the	scope	and	cost	of	the	external	audit;
•	the	auditor’s	half	year	and	full	year	reports; 	
•	reappointment	and	evaluation	of	the	performance	of	the	auditor, 	
including	recommendations	to	the	Board,	for	approval	by 	
shareholders,	on	the	reappointment	of	the	Company’s	auditor 	
and	on	the	approval	of	fees	and	terms	of	engagement;
•	non-audit	work	carried	out	by	the	auditor	and	trends	in	the	non-audit 	
fees	in	accordance	with	the	Committee’s	policy	to	ensure	the 	
safeguarding	of	audit	independence;		
•	the	co-ordination	of	the	activities	and	the	work	programmes	of	the 	
internal	and	external	audit	functions;
•	the	arrangements	in	respect	of	Group	Assurance	including	its 	
resourcing,	external	support,	the	scope	of	the	annual	internal	audit 	
plan	for	FY	2017	regarding	the	level	of	achievement	and	the	scope 	
of	the	annual	internal	audit	plan	for	FY	2018;
•	periodic	internal	control	and	assurance	reports	from	Group	Assurance;
•	the	Group’s	risk	management	framework	for	the	identification	and 	
control	of	major	risks,	its	risk	and	assurance	mitigation	plan	and	the 	
annual	assessment	of	effectiveness	of	controls;
•	compliance	with	the	Company’s	Code	of	Ethics;
•	corporate	governance	developments;
•	the	status	of	material	litigation	involving	the	Group;	and

a	summary	of	reports	received	during	FY	2017 .
Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 63
STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 During	FY	2017 ,	15	audit	reports	were	issued	by	the	Group	Assurance 	
function	and	reviewed	by	the	Board	or	the	Audit	Committee.	Internal 	
audit	recommendations	are	closely	monitored	through	to	closure	via	a 	
web-based	recommendation	tracking	system,	introduced	in	FY	2013 	
and	updated	in	FY	2017 ,	which	has	significantly	improved	the	overall 	
monitoring	of	internal	audit	recommendations	to	ensure	these	are 	
successfully	implemented	in	a	timely	manner.	A	summary	of	the	status	of 	
the	implementation	of	internal	audit	recommendations	is	made	monthly 	
to	the	Executive	Committee	and	quarterly	to	the	Audit	Committee.
Risk management framework
As	disclosed	in	the	‘Risk	and	uncertainties’	section	on	pages	36	to	40 	
the	Risk	Committee	continues	to	meet	on	a	quarterly	basis	to	review 	
the	key	risks	facing	the	business.	Membership	of	the	Risk	Committee, 	
which	includes	representation	from	each	of	the	key	business	functions, 	
is	detailed	below:
•	Company	Secretary	and	General	Counsel	(Chairman)
•	Group	Finance	Director
•	Commercial	and	Marketing	Director 	
•	Divisional	Director	(Operations)	
•	Group	HR	Director
•	Director	of	Business	Change	&	Technology
•	Group	Risk	Director 	
•	Senior	Legal	Counsel 	
Key	risks	identified	are	reviewed	and	assessed	on	a	quarterly	basis	in 	
terms	of	their	likelihood	and	impact,	within	the	Group’s	‘Key	Risk	Heat 	
Map’,	in	conjunction	with	associated	risk	mitigation	plans.	In	addition, 	
the	Risk	Committee	review	includes	an	assessment	of	the	material 	
relevance	of	emerging	risks	and	the	continued	relevance	of	previously 	
identified	risks.	During	FY	2017 ,	Risk	Committee	meetings	continued 	
to	include	a	cross-functional,	detailed	review	of	the	Group’s	key	risks. 	
This	process,	which	was	introduced	in	FY	2016,	continues	to	prove	to	be 	
effective	and	adds	value	to	the	continued	development	and	progression 	
of	the	Group’s	approach	to	evaluating	new	and	existing	risks,	supported 	
by	robust	mitigation	plans. 	
Actions	arising	from	Risk	Committee	meetings	are	followed	up	by	the 	
Group	Risk	Director.	The	Audit	Committee	reviews	the	Risk	Committee 	
minutes,	in	addition	to	undertaking	a	quarterly	review	of	the	Group’s 	
‘Key	Risk	Heat	Map’.
Confidential reporting 
The	Group’s	whistleblowing	policy	enables	staff,	in	confidence,	to	raise 	
concerns	about	possible	improprieties	in	financial	and	other	matters	and 	
to	do	so	without	fear	of	reprisal.	Details	of	the	policy	are	set	out	in	the 	
Company’s	Code	of	Ethics.	The	Audit	Committee	receives	quarterly 	
reports	on	whistleblowing	incidents	and	remains	satisfied	that	the 	
procedures	in	place	are	satisfactory	to	enable	independent	investigation 	
and	follow	up	action	of	all	matters	reported.	No	major	issues	have	been 	
reported	in	FY	2017	(major	issues	being	defined	for	this	purpose	as 	
matters	having	a	financial	impact	of	greater	than	£100k). 	
Disclosure of significant issues considered 
The	Audit	Committee	has	reviewed	the	key	judgements	applied	in	the 	
preparation	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements,	which	are	described 	
in	the	relevant	accounting	policies	and	detailed	notes	to	the	financial 	
statements	on	pages	88	to	139. 	
The	Audit	Committee’s	review	included	consideration	of	the	following 	
key	accounting	judgements:
•	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	Valuation	–	the	assumptions	used	by 	
management	to	value	the	long	leasehold	and	freehold	estate	including 	
estimated	fair	maintainable	trading	levels,	brand	multiples	and	use	of 	
spot	valuations	to	ensure	a	consistent	valuation	methodology	is	in 	
place.	A	number	of	key	judgements	are	also	applied	in	calculating 	
short	leasehold	impairment	such	as	trading	levels	and	the	use	of 	
an	appropriate	discount	rate; 	
•	Valuation	of	onerous	lease	provisions	–	as	currently	calculated 	
the	onerous	lease	provision	(including	the	key	matters	considered, 	
e.g.	lease	term,	rental	commitments,	operating	performance	and 	
turnaround	plans)	has	increased	in	FY	2017 ,	resulting	in	a	separately 	
disclosed	charge;	and 	
•	Pension	deficit	–	the	pension	liability	is	sensitive	to	the	actuarial 	
assumptions	applied	in	measuring	future	cash	outflows.	The	use 	
of	assumptions	such	as	the	discount	rate	and	inflation	which	have 	
an	impact	on	the	valuation	of	the	defined	benefit	pension	scheme 	
was	assessed	by	the	Audit	Committee.
Effectiveness of internal audit 
The	Audit	Committee	is	responsible	for	monitoring	and	reviewing 	
the	effectiveness	of	the	Company’s	internal	audit	function.	The	Audit 	
Committee	meets	regularly	with	management	and	with	the	Group	Risk 	
Director	and	the	auditor,	to	review	the	effectiveness	of	internal	controls 	
and	risk	management	and	receives	reports	from	the	Group	Risk	Director 	
on	a	quarterly	basis. 	
The	annual	internal	audit	plan	is	approved	by	the	Audit	Committee 	
and	kept	under	review	on	a	monthly	basis,	by	the	Group	Risk	Director, 	
in	order	to	reflect	the	changing	business	needs	and	to	ensure	new	and 	
emerging	risks	are	considered.	The	Audit	Committee	is	informed	of	any 	
amendments	made	to	the	audit	plan	on	a	quarterly	basis.	The	FY	2017 	
internal	audit	plan	was	developed	through	a	review	of	formal	risk 	
assessments	(in	conjunction	with	the	Risk	Committee	and	the	Group’s 	
Executive	Committee)	together	with	consideration	of	the	Group’s 	
key	business	processes	and	functions	that	could	be	subject	to	audit. 	
A	similar	approach	has	been	employed	in	relation	to	the	FY	2018 	
internal	audit	plan.
The	principal	objectives	of	the	internal	audit	plan	for	FY	2017	were, 	
and	remain	for	FY	2018:
•	to	provide	confidence	that	existing	and	emerging	key	risks	are	being 	
managed	effectively;
•	to	confirm	that	controls	over	core	business	functions	and	processes 	
are	operating	as	intended	(‘core	assurance’);	and
•	to	confirm	that	major	projects	and	significant	business	change 	
programmes	are	being	adequately	controlled.
Audit Committee report continued
64 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 External auditor appointment
Deloitte	LLP	was	appointed	as	the	auditor	in	2011,	following	a	formal 	
tender	process.	The	Audit	Committee	has	considered	the	recent 	
guidance	in	relation	to	rotation	including	the	proposed	transition	rules 	
which	will	be	considered	when	recommending	the	appointment	of	the 	
auditor	in	future	years.	The	Company	has	complied	throughout	the 	
reporting	year	with	the	provisions	of	The	Statutory	Audit	Services	for 	
Large	Companies	Market	Investigation	(Mandatory	Use	of	Competitive 	
Tender	Processes	and	Audit	Committee	Responsibilities)	Order	2014. 	
Under	the	terms	of	that	Order,	the	Committee	expects	to	carry	out	a 	
competitive	audit	tender	by	no	later	than	2020	in	respect	of	the	financial 	
year	ending	in	2021	to	ensure	the	continued	objectivity,	independence 	
and	value	for	money	of	the	statutory	audit.	It	may	choose	to	do	so	at 	
an	earlier	time.
The	Audit	Committee	considers	that	the	relationship	with	the	auditor	is 	
working	well	and	is	satisfied	with	its	effectiveness	and	has	not	considered 	
it	necessary	to	require	Deloitte	LLP	to	re-tender	for	the	external	audit 	
work.	There	are	no	contractual	obligations	restricting	the	Company’s 	
choice	of	auditor.	Following	its	appointment	as	auditor,	Deloitte	LLP 	
was	replaced	in	respect	of	the	provision	of	internal	audit	services	by 	
PricewaterhouseCoopers	LLP .
External auditor’s independence
The	external	auditors	should	not	provide	non-audit	services	where 	
it	might	impair	their	independence	or	objectivity	to	do	so.	The	Audit 	
Committee	has	established	a	policy	to	safeguard	the	independence 	
and	objectivity	of	the	Group’s	auditor	as	set	out	in	below.	That	policy 	
has	been	reviewed	in	FY	2017	and	a	copy	of	it	is	appended	to	the	Audit 	
Committee’s	terms	of	reference	and	is	available	on	the	Company’s 	
website.	Pursuant	to	that	policy	the	following	services	have	been 	
pre-approved	by	the	Audit	Committee	provided	that	the	fees	for	such 	
services	do	not	exceed	in	any	year	more	than	70%	of	the	average	audit 	
fee	paid	to	that	audit	firm	over	the	past	three	years: 	
•	audit	services,	including	work	related	to	the	annual	Group	financial 	
statements,	and	statutory	accounts;	and
•	certain	specified	tax	services,	including	tax	compliance,	tax	planning 	
and	tax	advice.
Acquisition	and	vendor	due-diligence	may	only	be	provided	if	it	is 	
specifically	approved	by	the	Committee	on	a	case	by	case	basis	in 	
advance	of	the	engagement	commencing.	Any	other	work	for	which 	
management	wishes	to	utilise	the	external	auditor	must	be	approved 	
as	follows:
•	services	with	fees	less	than	£50,000	may	be	approved	by	the	Finance 	
Director;	and
•	engagements	with	fees	over	£50,000	may	be	approved	by	the	Audit 	
Committee	or	its	Chair.
The	Audit	Committee	remains	confident	that	the	objectivity	and 	
independence	of	the	auditor	are	not	in	any	way	impaired	by	reason 	
of	the	non-audit	services	which	they	provide	to	the	Group. 	
That	policy	also	includes	an	extensive	list	of	services	which	the	audit 	
firm	may	not	provide	or	may	only	provide	in	very	limited	circumstances 	
where	the	Company	and	the	audit	firm	agree	that	there	would	be	no 	
impact	on	the	impartiality	of	the	audit	firm.	Details	of	the	remuneration 	
paid	to	the	auditor,	and	the	split	between	audit	and	non-audit	services, 	
are	set	out	at	note	2.3	of	the	financial	statements	on	page	107 .
External audit annual assessment 
The	Audit	Committee	assesses	annually	the	qualification,	expertise, 	
resources	and	independence	of	the	Group’s	auditor	and	the	overall 	
effectiveness	of	the	audit	process.	The	Finance	Director,	Company 	
Secretary	and	General	Counsel,	Audit	Committee	Chairman	and	Group 	
Risk	Director	meet	with	the	auditor	to	discuss	the	audit,	significant	risks 	
and	any	key	issues	included	on	the	Audit	Committee’s	agenda	during 	
the	year.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement 
One	of	the	key	governance	requirements	of	the	Group’s	financial 	
statements	is	for	the	report	and	accounts	to	be	fair,	balanced	and 	
understandable.	Therefore,	upon	review	of	the	financial	statements, 	
the	Audit	Committee	and	the	Board	have	confirmed	that	they	are 	
satisfied	with	the	overall	fairness,	balance	and	clarity	of	the	Annual 	
Report,	which	is	underpinned	by	the	following:
•	formal	minutes	of	the	year	end	working	group	comprised	of	relevant 	
internal	functional	representatives	and	appropriate	external	advisers;
•	clear	guidance	being	issued	to	all	contributors	to	ensure	a	consistent 	
approach;	and	
•	formal	review	processes	at	all	levels	to	ensure	the	Annual	Report 	
is	factually	correct.

STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 Background and business context 
Total	sales	over	the	financial	year	grew	by	£94m,	with	like-for-like	sales 	
growth	of	1.8%,	consistently	ahead	of	the	market.	This	strong	sales 	
performance	is	a	result	of	our	continued	focus	on	our	three	priority	areas:	
building	a	more	balanced	business;	instilling	a	more	commercial	culture; 	
and	driving	an	innovation	agenda. 	
Over	250	capital	investment	projects	have	been	undertaken	during	the 	
year,	which	have	been	focused	on	the	premiumisation	of	the	estate	and 	
the	improvement	of	amenity.	The	rapid	expansion	of	the	Miller	&	Carter 	
brand	to	over	80	locations,	primarily	through	the	conversion	of	existing 	
sites,	is	a	good	example.	The	remodel	programme	in	Harvester	has 	
prioritised	higher	levels	of	amenity,	demonstrating	that	a	fresh	and 	
contemporary	design	improves	investment	returns.	The	Company	has 	
reduced	the	redevelopment	cycle	from	11	to	12	years	for	each	business	to 	
6	to	7	years,	an	important	factor	in	a	fast	moving	consumer	environment. 	
As	we	have	reviewed	the	estate	79	businesses	were	identified	as	not 	
offering	long-term	growth	potential,	and	these	were	sold	during	the	year. 	
The	four	new	operating	divisions	introduced	in	2016	have	improved	our 	
guest	focus	and	across	all	businesses	Net	Promoter	Score	has	increased 	
and	customer	complaints	have	reduced.	The	use	of	social	media	by	our 	
guests	to	provide	feedback	is	becoming	ever	more	prevalent	and 	
therefore	managing	on-line	reputation	is	important.	Our	Managers	now 	
have	access	to	an	online	feedback	consolidation	tool	that	allows	them 	
to	communicate	directly	and	rapidly	with	our	guests. 	
Progress	has	been	made	in	improving	operational	effectiveness	through 	
the	introduction	of	a	time	and	attendance	system,	and	the	next	stage	of 	
roll	out	will	enable	team	members	to	swap	shifts	and	to	share	resource 	
across	businesses.	The	second	system	that	has	been	upgraded	is	our 	
stock	management	system	which	improves	stock	control	and	halves	the 	
time	taken	to	complete	stock	counts.	Further	enhancements	to	both	of 	
these	systems	are	planned,	and	we	anticipate	that	further	benefits	will 	
be	seen	in	FY	2018.
Our	guests	also	expect	technology	to	evolve	and	enhance	their 	
experiences	with	us,	and	during	the	year	a	mobile	order	at	table	facility 	
has	been	developed	and	trialled.	The	expectation	that	food	can	be 	
delivered	to	guests	at	home	continues	to	increase	and	during	the	year 	
the	number	of	sites	offering	Deliveroo	has	increased	to	around	60	and 	
trials	with	JustEat	have	also	been	successful,	with	delivery	and	click	and 	
collect	now	available	from	many	Harvester	and	Toby	Carvery	businesses.
Our	people	are	fundamental	to	the	delivery	of	great	guest	experiences 	
and	where	we	have	consistently	high	employee	engagement, 	
sales	growth	is	strongest.	It	is	pleasing	therefore	that	our	employee 	
engagement	scores	have	improved	by	2ppts	and	that	retail	team 	
member	turnover	has	reduced	by	4. 1ppts	over	the	year.	This	reduction 	
in	team	turnover	also	delivers	a	significant	saving	when	the	cost	of 	
recruitment,	training	and	induction	is	taken	into	account.	Providing	a 	
pipeline	of	future	talent	is	also	vitally	important	and	over	the	year	a	further 	
1,300	apprentices	have	joined	our	various	programmes,	and	our	new 	
on-line	learning	platform	provides	more	flexibility	for	employees	to	learn 	
and	develop	in	a	way	that	suits	them	and	their	lifestyle. 	
Despite	the	good	progress	made	across	a	number	of	areas,	the	macro 	
environment	in	which	the	business	operates	has	been	challenging, 	
with	unprecedented	cost	headwinds	impacting	the	industry	as	a	whole. 	
The	actions	taken	over	the	year	have	enabled	a	sustained	return	to	sales 	
growth	and	made	it	possible	to	mitigate	a	significant	proportion	of	the 	
previously	identified	cost	headwinds,	nevertheless	the	cumulative 	
impact	of	these	costs	has	resulted	in	adjusted	Operating	Profit	falling 	
by	1.3%	to	£314m. 	
Remuneration Policy Review
The	current	remuneration	policy	for	Directors	was	approved	by 	
shareholders	in	January	2015	and	therefore	is	due	for	renewal	at	the 	
forthcoming	AGM.	The	Committee	has	undertaken	a	thorough	review 	
of	the	existing	Directors’	remuneration	policy,	taking	full	account	of	the 	
strategic	priorities	of	Mitchells	&	Butlers,	and	the	latest	developments	in 	
the	external	pay	environment.	The	Committee	has	concluded	that	the 	
current	structure,	comprising	a	base	salary,	benefits,	pension,	annual 	
bonus	and	long-term	incentive	awards	delivered	in	shares,	and	the 	
level	of	quantum,	remains	fit	for	purpose.	However,	the	Committee 	
has	determined	that	some	amendments	to	the	policy	are	appropriate 	
to	ensure,	primarily,	that:	(i)	our	incentive	arrangements	continue 	
to	support	the	long-term	success	of	the	Company	through	a	period 	
of	market	uncertainty;	(ii)	the	policy	is	sufficiently	flexible	to	remain 	
applicable	over	the	next	policy	period;	and	(iii)	the	alignment	between 	
Executive	Directors	and	shareholders	is	further	strengthened. 	
The	key	changes	are	set	out	below:
Increased flexibility in selection of bonus measures.	We	are 	
proposing	to	allow	greater	flexibility	in	the	selection	of	annual	bonus 	
measures,	to	enable	us	to	respond	better	to	evolving	priorities	over	the 	
policy	period.	The	current	policy	states	that	at	least	75%	will	be	based 	
on	financial	metrics	with	the	balance	based	on	non-financial	or	personal 	
business	metrics.	Under	the	proposed	new	policy	at	least	50%	will	be 	
based	on	financial	objectives	giving	more	scope	to	include	strategic 	
measures	if	appropriate.	However,	for	2018,	70%	will	be	based	on 	
financial	objectives	–	see	further	detail	below.
Introduction of a long-term incentive plan post-vesting holding 
period.	A	post-vesting	holding	period	will	be	introduced	for	future 	
long-term	incentive	awards	requiring	the	Executive	Directors	to	hold 	
the	after-tax	value	of	shares	until	at	least	five	years	from	grant.	This	is 	
intended	to	strengthen	alignment	between	executives	and	shareholders 	
and	to	reflect	best	practice	in	this	area.
More stringent share ownership guidelines.	The	Committee	believes 	
that	the	achievement	and	maintenance	of	a	significant	level	of	share 	
ownership	plays	an	important	role	in	aligning	the	interests	of	Directors 	
and	shareholders.	The	guideline	will	be	increased	to	200%	of	salary	for 	
the	CEO	and	150%	for	all	other	Directors	(up	from	150%	for	the	CEO	and 	
100%	for	other	directors).	Directors	will	continue	to	be	required	to	retain 	
all	vested	shares	(net	of	tax)	until	the	share	ownership	guideline	is	met. 	
This	will	apply	to	vested	deferred	bonus	shares	as	well	as	shares	vesting 	
from	any	long-term	incentive	plans.
2017 remuneration 
The	2017	annual	bonus	plan	had	two	elements,	Adjusted	Operating 	
Profit	(Operating	Profit
1
)	and	Guest	Service.	Operating	Profit	of	£314m, 	
Report on Directors’ remuneration
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report in respect of the financial 
year, which ended on 30 September 2017 .
Imelda Walsh
Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee
66 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 was	above	the	threshold	level	of	£310m	required	for	bonus	under	this 	
element	to	begin	accruing	and,	as	a	result,	3%	of	salary	(out	of	75%	of 	
salary)	under	this	element	was	earned. 	
The	primary	measure	of	Guest	Service	was	Net	Promoter	Score	(‘NPS’), 	
which	is	used	as	a	survey	to	measure	guest	satisfaction.	Good	progress 	
has	been	made	and	an	NPS	score	of	59%	was	achieved,	well	above	the 	
maximum	of	53%	required	to	trigger	a	full	pay-out	under	this	element 	
and	as	a	result	25%	of	salary	under	this	element	was	earned.	In	addition, 	
as	I	outlined	in	my	statement	last	year,	the	Committee	intended	to	review 	
performance	against	other	guest	metrics,	such	as	TripAdvisor	and	guest 	
complaints,	and	I	am	pleased	to	confirm	that	good	progress	has	also 	
been	made	in	these	areas.	For	example,	the	average	TripAdvisor	score 	
increased	from	3.5	to	3.7	and	the	number	of	complaints	received	also 	
fell	by	over	7%.	During	the	year	the	Company	has	also	reviewed	its 	
approach	to	the	measurement	of	guest	satisfaction,	recognising	that 	
guests	are	increasingly	choosing	to	provide	feedback	via	other	channels 	
and	in	particular	social	media.	To	this	end	a	new	social	media	monitoring 	
tool	has	been	introduced	which	enables	all	social	media	reviews, 	
including	TripAdvisor,	Facebook	and	Google,	to	be	combined	into 	
a	single	review	score,	and	now	over	80%	of	reviews	are	responded 	
to	by	the	management	team	in	the	business,	increasing	their	direct 	
engagement	with	their	guests.
This	resulted	in	full	bonuses	being	earned	under	this	element	which 	
reflected	not	only	the	strong	actual	NPS	outcome	but	also	the	good 	
progress	in	guest	service	overall	made	during	2017 . 	
The	Committee	reviewed	the	results	against	the	Operating	Profit 	
measure	and	guest	service	and	noted	the	considerable	impact	of	the 	
cost	headwinds	experienced	by	the	Company	in	FY	2017	and	decided 	
that	awarding	a	bonus	of	28%	of	salary	reflected	overall	performance 	
in	the	period. 	
The	2015-2017	Performance	Restricted	Share	Plan	(‘PRSP’)	performance 	
condition	also	had	two	elements,	growth	in	adjusted	earnings	per	share 	
(‘EPS
1
’)	and	total	shareholder	return	(‘TSR’),	with	each	element	weighted 	
equally.	Over	the	performance	period	EPS	growth	was	2.3	p.a.,	below 	
the	threshold	level	of	performance	required	for	vesting	(8%	p.a.).	TSR 	
performance	was	also	below	the	median	threshold	required	for	vesting. 	
As	a	result,	the	awards	under	both	elements	lapsed. 	
Approach for FY 2018
Salary 
No	salary	increase	will	apply	for	any	Executive	Director.	Phil	Urban’s 	
salary	will	remain	at	£510,000	and	Tim	Jones’	at	£426,500.	Phil	Urban’s 	
salary	has	not	increased	since	his	appointment	in	September	2015	and 	
Tim	Jones’	salary	was	last	increased	in	January	2015.
Annual Bonus
For	2018,	70%	of	bonus	will	be	based	on	Operating	Profit.	The	remaining 	
30%	 will	 be	 based	 on	 non-profit	 elements	 linked	 to	 the	 business	 scorecard	
(15%	Guest	Health,	10%	Employee	Engagement	and	5%	Safety),	which 	
applies	to	all	managers	across	Mitchells	&	Butlers. 	
Operating	Profit	(70%)
•	Half	of	the	bonus	opportunity	will	be	payable	for	achieving	a 	
demanding	Operating	Profit	target.	The	threshold	at	which	bonus	will 	
begin	to	accrue	has	been	set	at	95%	of	target	and	full	payment	for	this 	
element	would	require	very	strong	performance,	well	in	excess	of 	
current	market	consensus.
Non-Profit	Elements	(30%)
•	The	remaining	30%	of	the	annual	bonus	plan	will	be	allocated	against 	
the	business	scorecard	as	follows:
	 − 15%	for	Guest	Health
	 − 10%	for	Employee	Engagement
	 − 5%	for	Safety 	
•	The	non-profit	elements	will	only	be	payable	if	a	threshold	level	of 	
financial	performance	is	achieved.	For	2018	this	will	be	set	at	97 .5%	of 	
the	Operating	Profit	target,	which	is	higher	than	the	threshold	required 	
for	payment	under	the	Operating	Profit	element.
•	Since	2015	the	leading	measure	of	Guest	Health	has	been	NPS	and 	
in	2017	a	new	social	media	monitoring	tool	was	introduced	enabling 	
all	social	media	reviews,	including	TripAdvisor,	Facebook	and	Google, 	
to	be	combined	into	a	single	review	score.
•	In	addition,	there	has	been	an	increased	focus	on	improving	the	speed 	
at	which	guest	complaints	are	resolved,	alongside	a	commitment	to 	
reducing	the	overall	number	of	complaints	received. 	
•	With	this	in	mind,	for	2018	the	Guest	Health	measure	will	comprise 	
a	combination	of	all	three	elements,	NPS,	a	combined	social	media 	
review	score	and	guest	complaints.	Each	element	will	have	equal 	
weighting	and	to	achieve	a	maximum	payment	performance	will	need 	
to	exceed	target	on	at	least	two	elements	and	be	at	target	or	better	for 	
the	third	element.	This	rounded	assessment	ensures	that	guest	service 	
improvements	are	reviewed	comprehensively	and	are	not	solely 	
based	on	one	metric.
•	Mitchells	&	Butlers	has	measured	employee	engagement	for 	
a	number	of	years,	and	a	clear	correlation	has	been	established 	
between	employee	engagement	and	guest	satisfaction,	which	in	turn 	
has	a	positive	impact	on	sales.	For	this	reason,	the	Committee	felt	that 	
employee	engagement	should	form	part	of	the	bonus	scheme. 	
•	Food	safety	will	always	be	a	key	priority	and	including	a	measure 	
based	on	the	proportion	of	our	businesses	that	achieve	a	high	National 	
Food	Hygiene 	Rating 	reflects 	our 	continued 	focus 	on 	the 	safe 	operation	
of	our	businesses.	As	an	additional	check,	overall	workplace	safety 	
performance	will	also	be	taken	into	account	when	determining	the 	
bonus	safety	outcome.
•	More	broadly,	the	Committee	will	continue	to	consider	the	overall 	
performance	of	the	Company,	not	just	the	outcome	of	each	individual 	
measure.
Long-term incentives
The	market	is	ever	more	challenging	and	uncertain,	and	the	Committee 	
wants	to	take	account	of	the	further	work	the	CEO	is	undertaking	in 	
defining	plans	that	will	further	improve	sales	and	increase	efficiencies, 	
in	line	with	our	three	strategic	priorities.	Therefore,	the	Committee	did 	
not	consider	it	appropriate	to	determine	measures	or	agree	targets	for 	
a	long-term	incentive	plan	at	this	time.	This	will	be	a	matter	that	the 	
Committee	considers	over	the	next	few	months	and	does	not	expect 	
to	make	an	award	until	after	the	2018	AGM.	We	will	consult	with	major 	
shareholders	prior	to	making	any	award.	The	performance	conditions 	
will	be	disclosed	in	full	at	the	time	of	grant.

AT A GLANCE
This section briefly summarises the principles that 
underpin our remuneration policy, highlights performance 
and remuneration outcomes for FY 2017, and our approach

Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
68 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 POLICY REPORT
This section of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ 
remuneration policy that will be put forward for approval 
in a binding vote of shareholders at the 2018 AGM on 
23 January 2018. The policy will take formal effect from 
that date, subject to shareholder approval. It is intended 
that the policy will formally apply for the three years 
beginning on the date of approval.
Key considerations when determining the Directors’ 
remuneration policy
The	primary	objective	of	the	Directors’	remuneration	policy	is	to	promote 	
the	long-term	success	of	the	business	whilst	ensuring	that	the	Company 	
does	not	pay	more	than	is	necessary.	In	seeking	to	achieve	this	objective, 	
the	Committee	is	mindful	of	the	views	of	a	broad	range	of	stakeholders 	
in	the	business	and	accordingly	takes	account	of	a	number	of	factors 	
when	setting	remuneration	policy	including	market	conditions,	pay 	
and	benefits	in	relevant	comparator	organisations,	terms	and	conditions 	
of	employment	across	the	Group,	the	Company’s	risk	appetite,	the 	
expectations	of	institutional	investors	and	feedback	from	shareholders 	
and	other	stakeholders.
Shareholder views
The	Board	remains	committed	to	shareholder	dialogue	and	the 	
Remuneration	Committee	will	consult	extensively	with	major 	
shareholders	when	considering	any	significant	changes	to	our 	
remuneration	arrangements.	The	Committee	also	considers	shareholder 	
feedback	received	in	relation	to	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	each	
year	following	the	AGM.	This,	together	with	any	additional	feedback 	
received	from	shareholders	and	other	stakeholders	from	time	to	time, 	
is	then	considered	as	part	of	the	Committee’s	annual	review	of 	
remuneration	policy	and	its	implementation.	The	Committee	also 	
actively	monitors	developments	in	the	expectations	of	institutional 	
investors	and	their	representative	bodies.
Employment conditions
The	Committee	is	regularly	updated	throughout	the	year	on	pay	and 	
conditions	applying	to	Group	employees.	Where	significant	changes 	
are	proposed	to	employment	conditions	elsewhere	in	the	Group,	these 	
are	highlighted	for	the	attention	of	the	Committee	at	an	early	stage. 	
The	Committee	is	informed	of	the	base	pay	review	budget	applicable 	
to	other	employees	and	is	cognisant	of	changes	to	the	National	Living 	
Wage	and	the	National	Minimum	Wage	when	considering	the	pay 	
of	Executive	Directors. 	
Employees	are	not	specifically	consulted	on	Executive	remuneration. 	
All	employees	are,	however,	invited	to	take	part	in	our	annual	Your	Say 	
employee	engagement	survey	in	which	they	have	an	opportunity	to 	
provide	anonymous	feedback	on	a	wide	range	of	topics	of	interest	or 	
concern	to	them.	The	results	of	the	survey	are	reviewed	by	the	Board; 	
any	significant	concerns	over	remuneration	would	be	considered 	
separately	by	the	Committee	and,	if	appropriate,	taken	into	account 	
when	determining	the	remuneration	policy.	In	addition,	each	year	an 	
employee	forum	is	held,	which	gives	the	opportunity	for	employees 	
to	ask	questions	of	senior	management,	via	elected	representatives. 	
The	Remuneration	Committee	Chair	will	attend	the	forum	on	an 	
annual	basis	to	answer	questions	raised	by	employee	representatives 	
concerning	Executive	pay. 	
The	Committee	considers	a	broad	range	of	reference	points	when 	
determining	policy	and	pay	levels;	these	include	external	market 	
benchmarks	as	well	as	internal	reference	points.	Any	such	reference 	
points	are	set	in	an	appropriate	context	and	are	not	considered	in	isolation.
The	remuneration	policy	for	Executive	Directors,	which	is	set	out 	
over	the	following	pages	supports	the	business	needs	of	the	Company, 	
ensuring	it	promotes	long-term	success	whilst	enabling	it	to	attract, 	
retain	and	motivate	senior	Executives	of	a	high	calibre.	The	Committee 	
is	satisfied	that	the	remuneration	policy	supports	the	Company’s	strategy 	
of	growing	long-term	shareholder	value	and	appropriately	balances	fixed 	
and	variable	remuneration.	With	a	high	proportion	of	reward	delivered 	
in	the	form	of	equity,	this	ensures	that	Executives	have	a	strong	alignment 	
with	shareholders	through	the	Company’s	share	price.
Changes to the previous Directors’ remuneration policy
The	Committee	has	undertaken	a	thorough	review	of	the	existing 	
Directors’	remuneration	policy,	taking	full	account	of	the	strategic 	
objectives	of	Mitchells	&	Butlers	and	the	latest	developments	in	the 	
external	pay	environment.	The	Committee	has	concluded	that	the 	
current	structure,	comprising	a	base	salary,	benefits,	pension,	annual 	
bonus	and	long-term	incentive	awards	delivered	in	shares,	and	the 	
overall	level	of	quantum,	remains,	largely,	fit	for	purpose.	However, 	
the	Committee	has	determined	that	some	important	amendments 	
to	the	policy	are	appropriate	to	ensure,	primarily,	that:	(i)	our	incentive 	
arrangements	continue	to	support	the	long-term	success	of	the 	
Company	through	a	period	of	market	uncertainty;	(ii)	the	policy	is 	
sufficiently	flexible	to	remain	applicable	over	the	next	policy	period; 	
and	(iii)	the	alignment	between	Executive	Directors	and	shareholders 	
is	further	strengthened. 	
The	key	changes	are	set	out	below:
•	Increased flexibility in selection of bonus measures.	We	are 	
proposing	to	allow	greater	flexibility	in	the	selection	of	annual	bonus 	
measures,	to	enable	us	to	better	respond	to	evolving	priorities	over	the 	
policy	period.	The	current	policy	states	that	at	least	75%	will	be	based 	
on	financial	metrics	with	the	balance	based	on	non-financial	or 	
personal	business	metrics.	It	is	proposed	that	the	new	policy	requires 	
that	at	least	50%	is	based	on	financial	objectives	giving	us	more	scope 	
to	include	strategic	measures	if	appropriate.	At	the	present	time,	the 	
Committee	intends	that	70%	of	the	bonus	opportunity	will	be	based 	
on	financial	metrics. 	
•	Introduction of a long-term incentive plan post-vesting holding 
period.	A	post-vesting	holding	period	will	be	introduced	for	future 	
long-term	incentive	awards	requiring	the	Executive	Directors	to	hold 	
the	after-tax	value	of	shares	until	at	least	five	years	from	grant.	This	is 	
intended	to	strengthen	alignment	between	Executives	and	shareholders 	
and	to	reflect	best	practice	in	this	area.
•	More stringent share ownership guidelines. The 	Committee	
believes	that	the	achievement	and	maintenance	of	a	significant	level 	
of	share	ownership	plays	an	important	role	in	aligning	the	interests	of 	
Directors	and	shareholders.	The	guideline	will	be	increased	to	200% 	
of	salary	for	the	CEO	and	150%	for	all	other	Directors	(up	from	150% 	
for	the	CEO	and	100%	for	other	Directors).	Directors	will	continue 	
to	be	required	to	retain	all	vested	shares	(net	of	tax)	until	the	share 	
ownership	guideline	is	met.	However,	this	will	now	also	apply	to 	
vested	deferred	bonus	shares.

Base salary
Provides	a	sound	basis	on 	
which	to	attract	and	retain 	
Executives	of	appropriate 	
calibre	to	deliver	the	strategic 	
objectives	of	the	Group.
To	reflect	the	market	value	of 	
the	role,	personal	contribution, 	
experience	and	competence.
Salaries	are	normally	subject	to 	
annual	review,	typically	effective 	
from	1	January.
Salary	levels	may	be	influenced	by:
•	 role,	experience	or	performance;
•	 Group	profitability	and	prevailing 	
market	conditions;	and
•	 periodic	external	benchmarking	
of	similar	roles	at	comparable 	
companies	by	size	and	sector.
Payable	four-weekly	throughout 	
the	year.	
Pensionable.
The	general	policy	is	to	set	salaries 	
broadly	around	mid-market	levels 	
with	increases	(in	percentage	terms) 	
typically	in	line	with	that	of	the 	
Company’s	UK	workforce.
Percentage	increases	beyond	those 	
granted	to	the	wider	workforce 	
may	be	awarded	in	certain 	
circumstances	such	as	when	there 	
is	a	change	in	the	individual’s	role 	
or	responsibility	or	where	there	has 	
been	a	fundamental	change	in	the 	
scale	or	nature	of	the	Company.
In	addition,	a	higher	increase	may 	
be	made	where	an	individual	had 	
been	appointed	to	a	new	role	at 	
below	market	salary	while	gaining 	
experience.	Subsequent	
demonstration	of	strong 	
performance	may	result	in	a	salary 	
increase	that	is	higher	than	for	the 	
wider	workforce.
There	may	also	be	circumstances 	
where	the	Committee	agrees	to	pay 	
above	mid-market	levels	to	secure 	
or	retain	an	individual	who	is 	
considered,	in	the	judgement	of	the 	
Committee,	to	possess	significant 	
and	relevant	experience	which 	
is	required	to	enable	the	delivery 	
of	the	Company’s	strategy. 	
Executive	Directors’	performance 	
is	a	factor	considered	when 	
determining	salaries.	
Performance	is	reviewed	in	line	with 	
the	established	performance	review 	
process	in	place	across	the	Group.
No	recovery	or	withholding 	
provisions	apply.

Annual Performance Bonus (cash and shares)
Provides	a	direct	link	between 	
annual	performance	and 	
reward.	Incentivises	the 	
achievement	of	key	measures 	
linked	to	Company	strategy.
Deferred	bonus,	awarded 	
in	shares,	provides	a	retention 	
element	and	additional 	
alignment	of	interests 	
to	shareholders.
The	Committee	determines	bonus	
payment	level	after	the	year-end 	
by	reference	to	performance	targets 	
previously	set	by	the	Committee.
The	cash	element	of	the 	
bonus	is	normally	payable	in 	
December	following	the	end 	
of	the	financial	year.
Up	to	half	of	any	bonus	award 	
is	payable	in	cash.	At	least	half 	
of	any	bonus	award	is	deferred 	
as	shares	under	the	terms	of	the 	
Short	Term	Deferred	Incentive 	
Plan	(‘STDIP’)	below.
Key	terms	of	the	STDIP	are:
•	 Deferred	bonus	share 	
awards	are	normally	released 	
in	two	equal	amounts	12	and 	
24	months	after	deferral	subject 	
to	continued	employment 	
(or	good	leaver	status). 	
•	 At	the	discretion	of	the	Committee 	
dividends	paid	between	grant 	
and	vesting	may	accrue	on 	
vested	shares.
•	 Shares,	which	vest,	after	the 	
settlement	of	income	tax	and 	
national	insurance	must	be 	
retained	until	the	relevant 	
shareholding	guideline	has 	
been	met.
Non-pensionable.
Currently	the	normal	maximum 	
payment	is	100%	of	salary.
At	the	discretion	of	the	Committee, 	
the	maximum	earnings	potential 	
may	be	increased	in	line	with	the 	
plan	rules	up	to	150%	of	salary. 	
The	majority	of	the	bonus	outcome 	
will	be	based	on	financial	measures. 	
This	may	be	a	single	measure	or	a 	
mix	of	metrics	as	determined	by 	
the	Committee.
The	remainder	may	be	based	on 	
non-financial	measures	or	personal 	
business	objectives.
The	bonus	measures	are	reviewed 	
annually	and	the	Committee	has 	
the	discretion	to	vary	the	mix	of 	
measures	or	to	introduce	new 	
measures	taking	into	account	the 	
strategic	focus	of	the	Company. 	
No	bonus	is	payable	under 	
the	financial	element(s)	unless 	
a	demanding	threshold	level 	
of	performance	is	achieved. 	
As	the	bonus	is	subject	to 	
performance	conditions,	any 	
deferred	bonus	is	not	subject	to 	
further	performance	conditions 	
but	remains	subject	to	recovery 	
and	withholding	provisions.
The	Committee	may	alter	the 	
bonus	outcome	if	it	considers	that 	
the	payout	is	inconsistent	with	the 	
Company’s	overall	performance 	
taking	account	of	any	factors	it 	
considers	relevant.	This	will	help 	
ensure	that	payouts	reflect	overall 	
Company	performance	during	the 	
period.	The	Committee	will	consult 	
with	leading	investors	if	appropriate 	
before	any	exercise	of	its	discretion 	
to	increase	the	bonus	outcome. 	
Recovery	and	withholding 	
provisions	apply	where	there 	
has	been	a	misstatement	of	the 	
accounts,	or	other	data,	or	a	serious 	
misdemeanour	or	serious 	
misconduct	by	the	participant 	
has	occurred	prior	to	payment 	
or	vesting	or	within	two	years 	
of	payment	or	vesting	of	shares.

Long Term Incentive Plan (Performance Restricted Share Plan, ‘PRSP’)
To	align	the	interests	of	senior 	
Executives	with	sustained 	
long-term	value	creation. 	
Incentivises	participants	
to	grow	the	business	for 	
the	long	term	in	line	with

To	provide	an	element 	
of	retention	through 	
and	beyond	the 	
performance	period.
Discretionary	awards	may	be	made 	
each	year,	normally	taking	the	form 	
of	nil	or	nominal	cost	options. 	
Awards	normally	have	a	three	year 	
performance	and	vesting	period.
At	the	discretion	of	the	Committee 	
vested	options	may	attract 	
Dividend	Accrued	Shares	between 	
award	and	the	end	of	the	vesting 	
or	holding	period.
A	two	year	post-vesting	holding 	
period	applies	which	requires 	
awards	to	be	retained	for	a	period 	
of	two	years	from	the	end	of	the 	
vesting	period,	except	for	shares 	
sold	to	pay	income	tax	and	national 	
insurance	upon	exercise/vesting.
Shares,	which	vest,	after	the 	
settlement	of	income	tax	and 	
national	insurance,	must	be 	
retained	until	the	relevant 	
shareholding	guideline	has 	
been	met.
Under	the	rules	of	the	PRSP , 	
conditional	share	awards	may 	
also	be	granted	although	there 	
is	currently	no	plan	to	grant 	
such	awards.
Non-pensionable.
Currently	the	normal	maximum 	
annual	award	is	up	to	200% 	
of	salary.
The	PRSP	rules	include	an	annual 	
award	limit	of	250%	of	salary.	Any 	
increase	to	the	normal	maximum 	
of	200%	of	salary,	other	than	in 	
exceptional	circumstances	such	
as	recruitment,	would	be	subject 	
to	prior	consultation	with	leading 	
investors,	if	appropriate. 	
Performance	is	normally 	
measured	over	no	less	than 	
three	financial	years.
Awards	will	be	subject	to 	
the	achievement	of	stretching 	
targets	designed	to	incentivise 	
performance	in	support	of 	
the	Group’s	strategy	and 	
business	objectives.
The	Committee	has	the	flexibility 	
to	vary	the	mix	of	measures	or 	
to	introduce	new	measures	for 	
each	award,	taking	into	account 	
business	priorities	at	the	time 	
of	grant.
For	TSR	and	financial	measures, 	
up	to	25%	of	that	element	may 	
vest	for	threshold	performance. 	
The	Committee	may	alter	the 	
vesting	outcome	if	it	considers	that 	
the	level	of	vesting	is	inconsistent 	
with	the	Company’s	overall 	
performance	taking	account	of 	
any	factors	it	considers	relevant. 	
This	will	help	ensure	that	vesting 	
reflects	overall	Company 	
performance	during	the	period. 	
The	Committee	would	seek	to 	
consult	with	leading	investors	if 	
appropriate,	before	any	exercise 	
of	its	discretion	to	increase	the 	
vesting	outcome.
Recovery	and	withholding 	
provisions	apply	where	there 	
has	been	a	misstatement	of	the 	
accounts,	or	other	data,	or	a 	
serious	misdemeanour	or	serious 	
misconduct	by	the	participant	has

Discount	vouchers	are	provided 	
on	the	same	basis	to	all	employees 	
and	can	be	redeemed	in	any	of 	
our	managed	businesses	provided 	
the	purchase	is	a	personal,	not	a 	
business,	expense.
Executive	Directors	may 	
participate	in	any	of	the	Company’s 	
all-employee	share	schemes	(e.g. 	
Sharesave	and	SIP)	on	the	same 	
basis	as	all	other	employees	and 	
in	line	with	prevailing	HMRC	limits.
Relocation	or	the	temporary 	
provision	of	accommodation	may 	
be	offered	where	the	Company 	
requires	a	Director	to	relocate. 	
Expatriate	allowances	may	be

In	line	with	market	practice, 	
the	value	of	benefits	may	vary 	
from	year	to	year	depending 	
on	the	cost	to	the	Company 	
from	third-party	suppliers.
No	performance	metrics	apply. No	recovery	or	withholding 	
provisions	apply	other	than	if 	
relocation	costs	were	provided. 	
A	proportion	of	any	relocation 	
costs	may	be	recovered	where	a 	
Director	leaves	the	employment 	
of	the	Group	within	two	years	of 	
appointment	or	date	of	relocation.
Shareholding policy
To	align	the	interests	of	the 	
Executive	Directors	with 	
shareholders	and	promote 	
a	long-term	approach	to 	
risk	management.
The	Chief	Executive	is	expected 	
to	hold	and	maintain	Mitchells	& 	
Butlers’	shares	to	the	value	of	a 	
minimum	of	200%	of	base	salary.
Other	Executive	Directors	are 	
expected	to	hold	and	maintain 	
Mitchells	&	Butlers’	shares	to 	
the	value	of	a	minimum	of	150% 	
of	base	salary.
Except	for	those	sold	to	cover	the 	
acquisition	cost	together	with	the 	
associated	income	tax	and	National 	
Insurance	contributions,	Executive	
Directors	will	be	required	to	retain 	
shares	arising	from	share	schemes 	
until	the	minimum	level	of	ownership 	
required	has	been	achieved.
Only	shares	owned	outright	by	the

Selection of performance measures and targets
The	choice	of	performance	metrics	applicable	to	the	annual	bonus	scheme	reflect	the	Committee’s	belief	that	any	incentive	compensation	should 	
be	appropriately	challenging	and	tied	to	both	the	delivery	of	key	financial	targets	and	individual	and/or	strategic	performance	measures	intended	to 	
ensure	that	Executive	Directors	are	incentivised	to	deliver	across	a	range	of	objectives	for	which	they	are	accountable.	The	Committee	has	retained 	
some	flexibility	on	the	specific	measures	which	will	be	used	to	ensure	that	any	measures	are	fully	aligned	with	the	strategic	imperatives	prevailing 	
at	the	time	they	are	set. 	
The	choice	of	the	performance	conditions	applicable	to	the	PRSP	awards	will	be	aligned	with	the	Company’s	objective	of	delivering	superior	levels	of 	
long-term	value	to	shareholders.	The	Committee	has	retained	flexibility	on	the	measures,	which	will	be	used	for	future	award	cycles	to	ensure	that	the 	
measures	are	fully	aligned	with	the	strategy	prevailing	at	the	time	the	awards	are	granted.	Notwithstanding	this,	the	Committee	would,	if	appropriate, 	
seek	to	consult	with	major	shareholders	in	advance	of	any	material	change	to	the	choice	or	weighting	of	the	PRSP	performance	measures. 	
The	Committee	will	review	the	calibration	of	targets	applicable	to	the	annual	bonus	and	the	PRSP	annually	to	ensure	they	remain	appropriate	and 	
sufficiently	challenging,	taking	into	account	the	Company’s	strategic	objectives	and	the	interests	of	shareholders.
Differences in remuneration policy between Executive Directors and other employees
The	overall	approach	to	reward	for	employees	across	the	workforce	is	a	key	reference	point	when	setting	the	remuneration	of	the	Executive	Directors. 	
When	reviewing	the	salaries	of	the	Executive	Directors,	the	Committee	pays	close	attention	to	pay	and	employment	conditions	across	the	wider 	
workforce	and	in	normal	circumstances	the	increase	for	Executive	Directors	will	be	no	higher	than	the	average	increase	for	the	general	workforce.
The	key	difference	between	the	remuneration	of	Executive	Directors	and	that	of	our	other	employees	is	that,	overall,	at	senior	levels,	remuneration 	
is	increasingly	long	term,	and	‘at	risk’	with	an	emphasis	on	performance-related	pay	linked	to	business	performance	and	share-based	remuneration. 	
This	ensures	that	remuneration	at	senior	levels	will	increase	or	decrease	in	line	with	business	performance	and	provides	alignment	between	the 	
interests	of	Executive	Directors	and	shareholders.	In	particular,	long-term	incentives	are	provided	only	to	the	most	senior	Executives,	as	they	are 	
reserved	for	those	considered	to	have	the	greatest	potential	to	influence	overall	levels	of	performance.
The	Company	operates	HMRC-approved	all-employee	share	plans	(Sharesave	and	SIP)	enabling	all	our	employees	to	become	shareholders 	
in	the	Company.
Legacy arrangements
For	the	avoidance	of	doubt,	the	Committee	may	approve	payments	to	satisfy	commitments	agreed	prior	to	the	approval	of	this	remuneration	policy, 	
for	example,	those	outstanding	and	unvested	incentive	awards	which	have	been	disclosed	to	shareholders	in	previous	remuneration	reports. 	
The	Committee	may	also	approve	payments	outside	of	this	remuneration	policy	in	order	to	satisfy	legacy	arrangements	made	to	an	employee	prior 	
to	(and	not	in	contemplation	of)	promotion	to	the	Board	of	Directors.
All	historic	awards	that	were	granted	but	remain	outstanding,	remain	eligible	to	vest	based	on	their	original	award	terms.
Incentive plan discretions
The	Committee	will	operate	the	incentive	plans	described	in	the	policy	table	according	to	their	respective	rules,	the	policy	set	out	above	and 	
in	accordance	with	the	Listing	Rules,	applicable	legislation	and	HMRC	guidance	where	relevant.	The	Committee,	consistent	with	market	practice, 	
retains	discretion	over	a	number	of	areas	relating	to	the	operation	and	administration	of	these	plans.	These	include	(but	are	not	limited	to)	the	following: 	
•	who	participates	in	the	plans;
•	the	timing	of	grant	of	award	and/or	payment;
•	the	size	of	award	and/or	payment,	subject	to	policy	limits;
•	the	choice	of	(and	adjustment	of)	performance	measures	and	targets	for	each	incentive	plan	in	accordance	with	the	policy	set	out	above	and	the 	
rules	of	each	plan;
•	discretion	relating	to	the	measurement	of	performance	in	the	event	of	a	change	of	control	or	reconstruction;
•	determination	of	a	good	leaver	(in	addition	to	any	specified	categories)	for	incentive	plan	purposes	based	on	the	rules	of	each	plan	and	the 	
appropriate	treatment	under	the	plan	rules;	and
•	adjustments	required	in	certain	circumstances	(e.g.	rights	issues,	corporate	restructuring,	on	a	change	of	control	and	special	dividends).
Any	use	of	the	above	discretions	would,	where	relevant,	be	explained	in	the	annual	report	on	Directors’	remuneration	and	may,	as	appropriate, 	
be	the	subject	of	consultation	with	the	Company’s	major	shareholders.

Fees
To	attract	and	retain 	
Non-Executive	Directors	
of	appropriate	calibre 	
and	experience.
Payable	in	cash,	four-weekly 	
throughout	the	year.
Fees	are	normally	reviewed	annually 	
with	any	increase	usually	taking 	
effect	from	1	January	each	year.
The	Chairman’s	fee	is	reviewed 	
annually	by	the	Committee 	
(without	the	Chairman	present).
Fee	levels	for	the	Non-Executive 	
Directors	are	determined	by 	
the	Company	Chairman	and 	
Executive	Directors	by	reference 	
to	companies	of	similar	size	and 	
sector	as	well	as	time	commitment 	
and	responsibilities.	
Non-Executive	Directors	receive 	
an	additional	fee	for	chairing 	
a	committee.
Where	a	Non-Executive 	
Director	undertakes	additional 	
responsibilities,	other	than	
the	chairing	of	a	committee, 	
additional	fees	may	be	set. 	
Travel,	accommodation	and	other 	
related	expenses	incurred	in 	
carrying	out	the	role	will	be	paid	by 	
the	Company	including,	if	relevant, 	
any	gross-up	for	tax.
Current	fee	levels	are	shown	in 	
the	annual	report	on	remuneration. 	
Fee	levels	may	be	increased,	taking 	
into	account	factors	such	as	the	time 	
commitment	of	the	role	and	market 	
levels	in	companies	of	comparable 	
size	and	complexity.
In	exceptional	circumstances,	
if	there	is	a	temporary	yet	material 	
increase	in	the	time	commitments 	
for	Non-Executive	Directors,	the 	
Board	may	pay	extra	fees	to 	
recognise	the	additional	workload.
No	performance	metrics	apply. No	recovery	or	withholding	applies.
Non-Executive	Directors	do	not	participate	in	the	Company’s	bonus	arrangements,	share	schemes,	benefit	schemes	(other	than	the	all-employee 	
discount	voucher	scheme)	or	pension	plans.
Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
A	key	principle	of	the	Group’s	remuneration	policy	is	that	variable	short-	and	long-term	reward	should	be	linked	to	the	financial	performance	of	the 	
Group.	The	charts	below	show	the	composition	of	the	remuneration	of	the	CEO	and	Finance	Director	at	minimum,	on-target	and	maximum	levels

STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 The	performance	scenarios	demonstrate	the	proportion	of	maximum	remuneration	which	would	be	payable	in	respect	of	each	remuneration	element 	
at	each	of	the	performance	levels.	In	developing	these	scenarios	the	following	assumptions	have	been	made:
Minimum
Only	the	fixed	elements	of	remuneration	are	payable.	The	fixed	element	consists	of	base	salary,	benefits	and	pension.	Base	salary	is	the	salary	effective 	
from	1	January	2018.	Benefits	are	based	on	actual	FY	2017	figures	and	include	company	car,	healthcare	and	taxable	expenses.	Pension	is	the	cash 	
allowance	and/or	Company	pension	contribution	payable	in	respect	of	base	salary	from	1	January	2018. 	
On-target 
In	addition	to	the	minimum,	this	reflects	the	amount	payable	for	on-target	performance	under	the	short-	and	long-term	incentive	plans:
•	50%	of	maximum	(50%	of	base	salary	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	Finance	Director)	is	payable	under	the	short-term	incentive	plan;	and 	
•	25%	of	the	award	(50%	of	base	salary	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	35%	of	base	salary	for	the	Finance	Director)	is	payable	under	the	long-term 	
incentive	plan.
Maximum
In	addition	to	the	minimum,	maximum	payment	is	achieved	under	both	the	short-	and	long-term	incentive	plans	such	that: 	
•	100%	of	base	salary	is	payable	under	the	short-term	incentive	plan	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	Finance	Director;	and
•	200%	of	base	salary	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	140%	of	base	salary	for	the	Finance	Director	is	payable	under	the	long-term	incentive	plan.
A	breakdown	of	the	elements	included	in	the	illustrations	of	application	of	remuneration	policy	is	shown	in	the	table	below:
Fixed (£000) Short-term plan (£000) Long-term plan (£000)
Base pay Benefits Pension Total fixed On-target Maximum On-target Maximum

Note:	The	value	received	under	the	short-term	plan	is	the	gross	value	of	awards	before	50%	is	deferred	into	shares.	The	values	received	under	the	short-term	plan	and	long-term	incentive 	
plan	do	not	take	into	account	dividend	accrued	shares	that	are	payable	on	the	vesting	of	awards	nor	any	changes	in	share	price.
Service contracts
Executive Directors’ contracts
The	table	below	summarises	key	elements	of	the	service	contracts	applicable	to	Executive	Directors:
Notice period •	 Executive	Directors	are	employed	under	service	contracts	that	may	be	terminated	at	any	time	on	up	to	one	year’s	notice	from	the	Company	and 	
on	a	minimum	of	six	months’	notice	from	the	Executive	Director.
•	 Any	payment	made	in	lieu	of	notice	would	comprise	base	salary	only
a
	and	may	be	payable	in	instalments	in	line	with	the	established	salary	payment 	
dates	until	the	expiry	of	the	notice	period	or,	if	earlier,	may	be	the	date	on	which	alternative	employment	or	other	engagement	is	secured	with	the	same 	
or	higher	base	salary.	If	employment	is	secured	at	a	lower	rate	of	base	salary,	subsequent	instalments	of	the	payment	in	lieu	of	notice	may	be	reduced 	
by	the	value	of	alternative	income.
•	 Service	contracts	contain	a	provision	enabling	the	Company	to	put	the	Executive	Director	on	garden	leave	after	notice	to	terminate	the	service	contract 	
has	been	given	by	either	party.	During	this	period,	the	Executive	will	be	entitled	to	base	salary	only.
•	 There	is	no	enhanced	provision	on	a	change	of	control.
Termination •	 If	an	Executive	Director’s	employment	with	the	Group	ends	during	the	financial	year,	normally	any	entitlement	to	bonus	for	that	year	is	forfeited. 	
However,	if	the	individual	leaves	by	reason	of	ill-health,	injury,	disability,	retirement,	redundancy,	death	or	sale	of	the	employing	business	or	company	or 	
if	the	Committee	so	decides	in	any	other	case,	at	the	Committee’s	discretion	the	Executive	Director	may	receive	a	bonus	pro-rated	to	time	employed	in 	
the	year	or	to	such	later	date	as	the	Committee	may	decide.	In	such	circumstances,	the	Committee	may	decide,	at	its	discretion,	to	pay	all	the	bonus	in	cash.
•	 If	an	Executive	Director	ceases	employment	following	the	end	of	the	financial	year	but	before	payment	of	the	bonus	in	respect	of	that	year,	there	is	no 	
entitlement	to	a	bonus	but	the	Committee	may,	at	its	discretion,	pay	a	bonus	for	that	year.	Any	such	bonus,	at	the	Committee’s	discretion,	may	be	all	in	cash.
•	 If	an	Executive	Director	ceases	employment	prior	to	the	release	of	Bonus	Award	Shares	under	the	STDIP	for	the	same	specified	good	leaver	reasons 	
as	set	out	above,	the	Committee,	at	its	discretion,	may	release	the	Bonus	Award	Shares	(and	associated	Dividend	Accrued	Shares)	at	the	date	of 	
termination.	Otherwise,	the	shares	will	be	released	on	the	normal	release	date.	If	the	Director	leaves	for	any	other	reason,	his	entitlement	to	Bonus 	
Award	Shares	(and	associated	Dividend	Accrued	Shares)	is	forfeited,	unless	the	Committee	decides	otherwise.
•	 If	an	Executive	Director	dies	before	an	Award	under	the	PRSP	has	vested,	vesting	of	the	award	(and	associated	Dividend	Accrued	Shares)	will	occur 	
as	soon	as	practicable	based	on	performance	and	on	a	time	pro-rated	basis.
•	 If	the	Executive	Director	ceases	employment	for	the	same	defined	good	leaver	reasons	as	are	specified	above,	the	PRSP	Award	(and	associated 	
Dividend	Accrued	Shares)	will	vest	following	the	end	of	the	normal	performance	period	and	on	a	time	pro-rated	basis.	If	employment	ceases	for	any 	
other	reason,	the	Award	will	normally	lapse,	unless	the	Committee	decides	otherwise	(except	that	if	employment	ceases	by	reason	of	gross	misconduct 	
the	PRSP	Award	(and	associated	Dividend	Accrued	Shares)	must	lapse).
•	 The	Committee	has	no	discretion	in	relation	to	shares	or	options	held	under	the	all-employee	share	plans	(SIP	and	Sharesave);	on	termination	these	will 	
vest,	become	exercisable	or	lapse	in	accordance	with	the	legislation.
a.	 	 This	arrangement	applies	to	Phil	Urban	and	any	future	Executive	Director	appointments.	Any	payments	in	lieu	of	notice	in	respect	of	Tim	Jones,	who	is	employed	on	a	legacy	contract, 	
will	comprise	base	salary	and	contractual	benefits	only.
Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
76 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 In	the	event	that	the	Company	terminates	an	Executive	Director’s	service	contract	other	than	in	accordance	with	the	terms	of	his	contract,	the 	
Committee	will	act	in	the	best	interests	of	the	Company,	and	ensure	there	is	no	reward	for	failure.	When	determining	what	compensation,	if	any,	is	to 	
be	paid	to	the	departing	Executive	Director,	the	Committee	will	give	full	consideration	to	the	circumstances	of	the	termination,	the	Executive	Director’s 	
performance,	the	terms	of	the	service	contract	relating	to	notice	and	payments	in	lieu	of	notice,	and	the	obligation	of	that	Executive	Director	to	mitigate 	
any	loss	which	may	be	suffered	as	a	result. 	
Although	the	Company	would	seek	to	minimise	termination	costs,	the	Committee	may	in	appropriate	circumstances	provide	other	elements	in	a 	
leaving	Director’s	termination	package,	including	(without	limitation):	compensation	for	the	waiver	of	statutory	rights	in	exchange	for	the	Director 	
executing	a	settlement	agreement;	payment	of	the	leaving	Director’s	legal	fees	in	connection	with	his	termination	arrangements;	and	payment	of 	
outplacement	fees.	In	addition,	the	Committee	may	determine	that	the	Director	should	continue	to	be	engaged	by	the	Company	on	consultancy 	
or	other	terms	following	cessation	of	his	directorship.
External directorships
Executive	Directors	may	accept	one	external	Non-Executive	appointment	with	the	Company’s	prior	approval,	as	long	as	this	is	not	likely	to	lead 	
to	conflicts	of	interest. 	
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive	Directors,	including	the	Company	Chairman,	do	not	have	service	contracts	but	serve	under	letters	of	appointment.	Non-Executive 	
Directors’	appointments	are	terminable	without	notice	and	with	no	entitlement	to	compensation.	Payment	of	fees	will	cease	immediately	on	termination. 	
Ron	Robson	and	Josh	Levy	were	appointed	to	the	Board	pursuant	to	the	terms	of	the	Piedmont	Deed	of	Appointment,	information	on	which	is	set	out 	
on	page	49. 	
Copies	of	both	the	individual	letters	of	appointment	for	Non-Executive	Directors	and	the	service	contracts	for	Executive	Directors	are	available	at 	
the	Registered	Office	of	the	Company	during	normal	business	hours	and	on	our	website.	Copies	will	also	be	available	for	shareholders	to	view	at	the 	
2018	AGM.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
Where	it	is	necessary	to	appoint	a	replacement	or	additional	Executive	Director,	the	Committee	will	set	a	base	salary	appropriate	to	the	calibre, 	
experience	and	responsibilities	of	the	new	appointee	and	in	line	with	our	policy	set	out	on	page	70.
The	maximum	level	of	variable	pay	is	400%	of	base	salary	(150%	in	relation	to	annual	cash	bonus/STDIP	and	250%	in	relation	to	the	PRSP). 	
Depending	on	the	timing	and	responsibilities	of	the	appointment,	it	may	be	necessary	to	set	different	annual	bonus/STDIP	performance	measures 	
and	targets	than	those	applicable	to	other	Executive	Directors.
Benefits	(including	pension,	Company	vehicle	or	cash	allowance,	healthcare,	life	assurance,	health	check	and,	where	applicable,	relocation	assistance) 	
would	be	consistent	with	the	principles	of	the	policy	as	set	out	on	pages	72	and	73.
For	an	internal	appointment,	his	or	her	existing	pension	arrangements	may	continue	to	operate	(which	may	include	participation	as	an	employee 	
deferred	member	in	the	defined	benefit	plan,	which	is	closed	to	future	accrual)	and	any	variable	pay	element	awarded	in	respect	of	the	prior	role 	
would	be	allowed	to	pay	out	according	to	its	terms,	adjusted	as	relevant	to	take	into	account	the	appointment.	In	addition,	any	other	previously 	
awarded	entitlements	would	continue,	and	be	disclosed	in	the	next	annual	report	on	Directors’	remuneration.
In	addition	to	the	above,	the	Committee	may	offer	additional	cash	and/or	share-based	elements	in	order	to	‘buy-out’	remuneration	relinquished	on 	
leaving	a	former	employer.	In	the	event	that	such	a	buy-out	is	necessary	to	secure	the	services	of	an	Executive	Director	then	the	structure	of	any	award 	
or	payment	will	mirror,	as	far	as	is	possible,	the	arrangements	in	place	at	the	incoming	Executive	Director’s	previous	employer.	Any	share	awards	made 	
in	this	regard	may	have	no	performance	conditions,	or	different	performance	conditions,	or	a	shorter	vesting	period	compared	to	the	Company’s 	
existing	plans,	as	appropriate.	Shareholders	will	be	informed	of	any	buy-out	arrangements	at	the	time	of	the	Executive	Director’s	appointment. 	
Recruitment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive	Directors’	fees	are	set	by	the	Chairman	and	Executive	Directors;	and	the	Chairman’s	fee	is	set	by	the	Remuneration	Committee.
Chairman 
The	Committee	will	recommend	to	the	Board	a	fee	appropriate	to	the	calibre,	experience	and	responsibilities	of	the	new	appointee.
Other Non-Executive Directors
The	fee	will	be	set	in	line	with	the	fee	structure	for	Non-Executive	Directors	in	place	at	the	date	of	appointment.

a	competitive	tender	in	2014.	NBS	is	a	signatory	to	the	Remuneration	Consultants	Group	Code	of	Conduct	and	any	advice	received	is	governed	by

on	a	potential	insurance	product,	but	no	fees	have	been	paid	in	respect	of	such	advice	in	FY	2017 . 	
Advice	was	also	received	from	the	Company’s	legal	advisers,	Freshfields	Bruckhaus	Deringer	LLP ,	on	the	operation	of	the	Company’s	employee	share 	
schemes	and	on	corporate	governance	matters.	Clifford	Chance	LLP	also	provided	advice	in	relation	to	pension	schemes. 	
The	Committee	is	satisfied	that	the	advice	received	from	its	advisers	was	objective	and	independent.

to	attend	meetings	on	remuneration	matters	where	appropriate.	They	are	not	present	when	matters	affecting	their	own	remuneration	arrangements 	
are	decided.	The	Company	Chairman	does	not	attend	Board	or	Committee	meetings	when	his	remuneration	is	under	review.	Phil	Urban	and	Tim 	
Jones	were	present	at	meetings	where	the	Company’s	long	and	short-term	incentive	arrangements	and	share	schemes	were	discussed.	However, 	
each	declared	an	interest	in	the	matters	under	review.

Operating profit
In	determining	the	Operating	Profit	target	range	the	Committee	took	into	consideration	a	range	of	factors,	such	as	the	general	economic	and	market 	
outlook,	an	assessment	of	the	significant	future	cost	headwinds	facing	the	business	and	internal	plans.	These	cost	headwinds	included	increases 	
to	national	living	wage,	an	increase	in	business	rates,	the	impact	of	the	depreciation	of	sterling	following	the	result	of	the	referendum	on	the	UK’s 	
membership	of	the	European	Union	on	food	and	drink	costs,	the	in-year	cost	of	the	capital	plan	and	the	planned	mitigating	actions.	Target	was	set 	
broadly	in	line	with	the	2016	out-turn	and	market	consensus,	with	an	award	towards	the	maximum	level	requiring	significant	outperformance	over 	
and	above	the	Company’s	business	plan. 	
The	Group	delivered	Operating	Profit	of	£314m	which	was	above	the	threshold	level	of	performance	required	for	bonus	to	begin	accruing	under	this 	
element	and	has	resulted	in	a	pay-out	of	3%	of	base	salary.	The	Operating	Profit	outcome	reflected	strong	sales	performance	over	the	year	with	total 	
sales	increasing	by	£94m	to	£2,180m.	Like-for-like	sales	growth	of	1.8%	consistently	outperformed	the	market	with	noticeable	improvements	across 	
almost	our	entire	brand	portfolio.	The	actions	taken	under	each	of	our	strategic	priorities	have	not	only	seen	a	return	to	sustained	sales	growth	but	have 	
also	enabled	a	significant	proportion	of	the	cost	headwinds	to	be	mitigated,	and	as	a	result	the	fall	in	Operating	Profit	was	limited	to	£10m	in	the	year 	
(on	a	52	week	basis),	a	credible	performance	in	the	circumstances. 	
Guest Health
NPS	was	the	lead	measure	of	Guest	Health	in	2017	with	progress	against	other	guest	metrics	such	as	Trip	Advisor	and	complaints	also	taken	into 	
consideration	to	ensure	a	rounded	and	more	comprehensive	assessment. 	
Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
80 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 The	NPS	targets	were	set	at	the	start	of	the	financial	year	and	were	based	on	a	new	survey	that	included	a	more	robust	method	of	collecting	data	and 	
therefore	result	validity.	The	old	survey	required	team	members	to	encourage	guests	to	leave	feedback	at	the	end	of	their	visit.	The	new	survey	solicits 	
feedback	from	guests	in	several	ways,	for	example	via	e-mail	after	booking	on	line	or	through	one	of	our	brand	apps.	This	means	that	surveys	are	more 	
likely	to	be	completed	away	from	the	business	and	after	a	period	of	time	has	elapsed,	which	can	impact	how	the	survey	is	answered.	It	also	means	that 	
significantly	more	surveys	are	completed;	each	week	c.25,000	guests	are	invited	to	leave	feedback.
At	the	point	the	targets	were	set,	the	new	survey	had	been	in	place	for	a	relatively	short	period	and	therefore	historic	data	was	limited.	The	51	to	53 	
target	range	set	by	the	Committee	was	stretching	based	on	this	historic	data	and	insights	from	the	data	provider.	The	actual	achievement	for	the	year 	
was	a	score	of	59	and	therefore	significantly	ahead	of	the	maximum	target	set.	With	the	benefit	now	of	a	year’s	worth	of	data,	the	Committee	looked 	
carefully	at	the	original	targets	and	the	significant	degree	of	outperformance	achieved.	Therefore,	the	Committee	viewed	as	particularly	important 	
a	more	comprehensive	review	of	Guest	Health	measures	whilst	acknowledging	a	substantial	year-on-year	improvement	in	NPS	has	been	delivered. 	
The	progress	made	in	overall	Guest	Health	is	demonstrated	by	an	improvement	in	TripAdvisor	scores	from	3.5	in	2016	to	3.7	by	the	end	of	2017 	
(and	a	37	point	increase	in	TripAdvisor	response	rates,	an	increase	of	over	70,000	responses),	and	a	7%	reduction	in	the	number	of	complaints	received. 	
During	the	year	the	Company	has	also	reviewed	its	approach	to	the	measurement	of	guest	satisfaction,	recognising	that	Guests	are	increasingly 	
choosing	to	provide	feedback	via	other	channels	and	in	particular	social	media.	To	this	end,	a	new	social	media	monitoring	tool	has	been	introduced 	
which	enables	all	social	media	reviews,	including	TripAdvisor,	Facebook	and	Google,	to	be	combined	into	a	single	review	score,	and	now	over	80% 	
of	reviews	are	responded	to	directly	by	pub	and	restaurant	management	teams.
The	Committee	believes	the	bonus	outcome	under	the	Guest	Health	element	reflects	the	NPS	outcome,	when	considered	alongside	the	good 	
progress	made	in	other	measures	of	Guest	Health.
As	a	result,	bonus	payments	equivalent	to	28%	of	base	salary	are	due	to	be	paid	to	Executive	Directors	(£145,546	in	respect	of	Phil	Urban	and 	
£121,717	in	respect	of	Tim	Jones). 	
In	line	with	our	policy,	half	of	the	bonus	award	will	be	deferred	into	shares	under	the	STDIP ,	which	will	be	released	in	two	equal	amounts	after	12	and 	
24	months,	and	shares	must	be	retained	until	the	relevant	shareholding	guideline	has	been	met.
Long-term incentives vesting during the year
During	FY	2015	awards	were	made	to	Tim	Jones	and	the	former	CEO,	Alistair	Darby,	under	the	terms	of	the	PRSP	to	the	value	of	140%	and	200% 	
of	their	respective	base	salaries.	The	performance	condition	had	two	independent	elements;	compound	annual	adjusted	EPS	growth	and	TSR 	
performance	against	a	group	of	sector	peers,	measured	over	the	three	year	performance	period	ending	30	September	2017 . 	
The	table	below	summarises	performance	against	each	element	of	the	performance	condition.

the	FY	2015	plan	awards	will	lapse	in	full.
Long-term incentive awards made in FY 2017
An	award	was	made	to	the	Chief	Executive	and	Finance	Director	in	November	2016	in	accordance	with	the	rules	of	the	PRSP	and	within	the	approved 	
Directors’	remuneration	policy. 	
The	independent	elements	of	the	performance	measure	for	this	award,	each	of	which	accounts	for	50%	of	the	award,	are	summarised	below:

to	the	upper	quartile	of	the	comparator	group.
*		 Between	threshold	and	maximum,	vesting	under	each	measure	is	on	a	straight-line	basis.	Below	threshold	the	award	will	lapse.
**		Comprises	the	constituents	of	the	FTSE	All	Share	Travel	&	Leisure	group. 	
The	EPS	and	TSR	conditions	are	measured	over	three	years	from	the	start	of	the	financial	year	in	which	they	are	granted,	i.e.	the	three	financial	years 	
from	25	September	2016,	ending	in	September	2019. 	
As	set	out	in	last	year’s	report,	the	EPS	target	range	has	a	threshold	level	of	performance	set	at	4%	growth	p.a.	and	maximum	set	at	8%	growth	p.a. 	
The	Committee	believed	that	this	target	range	was	demanding	in	the	context	of	the	earnings	forecast	at	the	time	of	the	award,	given	the	significant 	
cost	challenges	the	business	faced. 	
The	TSR	element	of	the	award	is	also	subject	to	a	share	price	underpin	and	awards	may	only	be	exercised	where	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	share	price 	
has	equalled	or	exceeded	the	share	price	at	the	date	of	award	within	six	months	of	the	vesting	date.	If	this	condition	is	not	met,	then	the	TSR-related 	
awards	will	lapse.

Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
82 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Update on forecast performance of other PRSP awards
2016-2018 PRSP 
Based	on	current	earnings	forecasts	and	TSR	performance	to	the	end	of	FY	2017 ,	the	Committee	does	not	anticipate	that	there	will	be	any	vesting 	
at	the	end	of	the	2018	financial	year.
2017-2019 PRSP
With	two	performance	years	remaining,	the	position	could	change	but	specifically	in	relation	to	the	EPS	measure,	the	significant	additional	cost 	
challenges	and	a	more	detailed	assessment	of	the	timing	and	impact	of	investment,	result	in	a	forecast	level	of	vesting	below	the	threshold	level.
Directors’ interests
Executive	Directors	are	expected	to	hold	Mitchells	&	Butlers	shares	in	line	with	the	shareholding	guideline	set	out	in	the	Remuneration	Policy	report.
The	proposed	remuneration	policy	has	a	share	ownership	guideline	that	requires	the	Chief	Executive	to	accumulate	Mitchells	&	Butlers	shares	to 	
the	value	of	a	minimum	of	200%	of	salary	(150%	of	salary	for	other	Executive	Directors)	through	the	retention	of	shares	arising	from	share	schemes 	
(on	a	net	of	tax	basis)	or	through	market	purchases.	Phil	Urban’s	shareholding	at	30	September	2017	was	24.9%	of	his	basic	annual	salary	and 	
Tim	Jones’s	shareholding	was	45.2%	of	his	basic	annual	salary. 	
The	interests	of	the	Directors	in	the	ordinary	shares	of	the	Company	as	at	30	September	2017	and	at	24	September	2016	are	as	set	out	below:

Change in remuneration of the CEO
Salary (£) Taxable benefits (£) Bonus (£)

CEO 510,000 510,000 0 15,134 15,098 0.2 145,546 – –
Salaried	employees	 31,572 31,763 -0.6 704 725 -2.9 2,739 2,525 8.5
The	change	in	CEO	remuneration	is	compared	to	the	change	in	average	remuneration	of	all	full	time	salaried	employees,	which	includes	house 	
managers,	assistant	managers	and	kitchen	managers	employed	in	our	businesses. 	
Salaried	employees	with	part-year	service	in	either	FY	2016	or	FY	2017	have	been	excluded	from	the	comparison	figures.	Retail	staff	employees	have 	
been	excluded	from	the	comparator	group	as	they	are	hourly	paid,	largely	part	time	and	do	not	participate	in	any	bonus	plans.	The	CEO	figures	do	not 	
include	LTIP	awards	or	pension	benefits	that	are	disclosed	in	the	single	figure	table.
CEO pay ratios 
Last	year	the	Committee	decided	to	include	the	pay	ratio	between	the	CEO	and	the	median	pay	of	other	employees,	reflecting	emerging	best 	
practice.	Since	then	the	Government	has	responded	to	its	consultation	on	corporate	governance	and	will	seek	to	introduce	secondary	legislation 	
that	will	require	quoted	companies	to	publish	the	ratio	of	their	CEO’s	pay	to	that	of	the	workforce.	The	Committee	awaits	the	Government’s	precise 	
method	of	calculation. 	
However,	given	our	decision	to	publish	a	ratio	last	year	and	using	the	same	approach,	based	on	the	CEO	single	figure	set	out	on	page	79,	the	ratio	of 	
pay	to	the	median	of	all	other	employees	is	1:63	(2016	1:44).	The	increase	in	the	ratio	between	the	pay	of	the	CEO	and	other	employees	largely	reflects 	
the	annual	bonus	payable	to	the	CEO	in	2017;	in	2016	no	bonus	was	paid. 	
Although	wages	and	salaries	have	increased	for	all	employee	groups,	overall	earnings	have	fallen,	as	a	result	of	fewer	hours	being	worked	on 	
average	each	week,	as	the	Company	improves	scheduling	efficiency	across	all	sites.	In	assessing	our	pay	ratio	versus	likely	ratios	from	industry	peers, 	
we	believe	that	we	are	towards	the	lower	end	of	the	range	but	note	that	annual	and	long-term	incentive	payments	have	varied	considerably	amongst 	
this	group.	In	our	case,	the	CEO	single	figure	comprises	fixed	pay	and	bonus	only	given	that	no	long-term	incentive	vested	in	respect	of	performance 	
ending	in	FY	2017 .	We	also	recognise	that	ratios	will	be	influenced	by	levels	of	employee	pay,	and	in	the	hospitality	sector,	despite	significant	increases 	
over	the	past	year,	employee	pay	will	be	lower	than	in	many	other	sectors	of	the	economy.
Annual report and accounts 2017 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | 85
STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 43 GOVERNANCE  44  TO  87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 88 TO 139 OTHER INFORMATION 140 TO 144 Employee	pay	includes	base	salary,	incentive	payments,	employer’s	pension	contributions	and	benefits.	Employees	with	part-year	service	have	been 	
excluded	from	the	comparison	figures.	Employee	pay	does	not	include	earnings	from	tips	and	service	charge,	from	which	many	employees	benefit. 	
It	is	Mitchells	and	Butlers	policy	to	pass	all	earnings	from	tips	and	service	charge	on	to	employees	in	full. 	
In	addition	to	the	elements	of	pay	included	in	the	above	pay	ratio	calculation	the	Company	also	invests	in	employees	in	other	ways.	Our	employees	are 	
fundamental	to	the	delivery	of	great	guest	experiences	and	therefore	a	truly	engaged	workforce	is	important.	For	over	a	decade,	Mitchells	and	Butlers 	
has	sought	the	views	of	employees	though	our	annual	‘Your	Say’	employee	engagement	survey.	What	this	survey	consistently	tells	us	is	that	whilst	pay 	
is	a	very	important	element	of	the	overall	employee	proposition,	there	are	other	factors	that	are	also	important	to	our	employees.	The	opportunity	to 	
learn	and	develop	is	one	of	these	and	the	Company	has	invested	heavily	in	this	area	in	the	past	year.	Over	1,250	employees	are	now	undertaking	an 	
apprenticeship	with	us,	over	a	number	of	programmes,	from	guest	service	to	culinary	skills	through	to	management.	Underpinning	all	of	our	learning 	
and	development	activity	is	the	new	learning	system	introduced	during	the	year,	which	provides	an	innovative	and	interactive	way	for	employees	to 	
learn	and	develop,	both	on	job	and	on-line,	in	a	way	that	is	convenient	and	flexible.
Another	important	factor	is	employee	recognition,	which	can	take	many	forms,	and	the	Company	supports	employees	in	a	number	of	ways,	such	as 	
our	recognition	programme	which	allows	managers	to	reward	great	performance	in	the	moment	and	also	service	milestones,	from	one	year	of	service 	
upwards.	In	addition,	all	employees	can	benefit	from	a	generous	employee	discount	and	become	shareholders	through	our	Share	Incentive	Plans.

Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive	Directors,	including	the	Company	Chairman,	do	not	have	service	contracts	but	serve	under	letters	of	appointment	which	provide	that 	
they	are	initially	appointed	until	the	next	AGM	when	they	are	required	to	stand	for	election.	In	line	with	the	Company’s	Articles,	all	Directors,	including 	
Non-Executive	Directors,	will	stand	for	re-election	at	the	2018	AGM.	This	is	also	in	line	with	the	recommendations	set	out	in	paragraph	B.7 . 1	of	the 	
Code.	Non-Executive	Directors’	appointments	are	terminable	without	notice	and	with	no	entitlement	to	compensation.	Payment	of	fees	will	cease

Executive Directors’ salary review
No	salary	increase	will	apply	for	any	Executive	Director.	Phil	Urban’s	salary	will	remain	at	£510,000	and	Tim	Jones’	at	£426,500.	Phil	Urban’s	salary 	
has	not	increased	since	his	appointment	in	September	2015	and	Tim	Jones’	salary	was	last	increased	in	January	2015. 	
Annual performance bonus
The	maximum	bonus	opportunity	will	be	100%	of	salary	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	Finance	Director	with	70%	of	bonus	to	be	based	on	Operating 	
Profit	and	the	remaining	30%	on	non-profit	elements	linked	to	the	business	scorecard. 	
Weighting Details
Operating	Profit 70% Bonus	will	begin	to	accrue	at	threshold	with	half	of	the	bonus	payable	for	on-target	performance,	reflecting 	
the	demanding	nature	of	the	targets	set	by	the	Committee.	Full	payment	would	require	very	strong 	
performance,	well	in	excess	of	current	market	consensus.
Guest	Health 15% Guest	Health	will	comprise	three	measures,	each	with	an	equal	weighting:
•	NPS	–	a	well-established	measure	of	Guest	Health,	will	continue	to	be	assessed	in	FY	2018.
•	Social media	–	The	social	media	monitoring	tool,	introduced	in	2017	enables	all	social	media	reviews, 	
including	TripAdvisor,	Facebook	and	Google,	to	be	combined	into	a	single	review	score.
•	Guest complaints	–	There	has	been	an	increased	focus	on	improving	the	speed	at	which	guest 	
complaints	are	resolved,	alongside	a	commitment	to	reducing	the	overall	number	of	complaints	received. 	
Therefore,	an	assessment	of	guest	complaints	will	be	included	in	assessing	Guest	Health.
Combining	NPS	with	an	assessment	of	social	media	reviews	and	guest	complaints	provides	a	more	holistic 	
review	of	Guest	Health.	To	achieve	a	maximum	payment,	performance	will	need	to	exceed	target	on	at	least 	
two	elements,	and	be	at	target	or	better,	for	the	third	element. 	
Employee	engagement 10% Mitchells	&	Butlers	has	measured	employee	engagement	for	a	number	of	years,	and	a	clear	correlation	has 	
been	established	between	employee	engagement	and	guest	satisfaction,	which	in	turn	has	a	positive	impact 	
on	sales.	For	this	reason,	the	Committee	has	decided	to	include	employee	engagement	in	the	bonus 	
scheme.
Safety 5% Food	safety	will	always	be	a	key	priority	and	including	a	measure	based	on	the	proportion	of	our	businesses 	
that	achieve	a	high	National	Food	Hygiene	Rating	reflects	our	continued	focus	on	the	safe	operation	of	our 	
businesses.	An	agreed	food	safety	score	must	be	achieved	for	this	part	of	the	bonus	to	pay	out	and,	as	an 	
additional	check,	overall	workplace	safety	will	also	be	taken	into	account	when	determining	the	outcome.
The	non-profit	elements	will	only	become	payable	if	a	certain	level	of	Operating	Profit	has	been	achieved.	For	2018,	this	has	been	increased	to	97 .5% 	
of	target	which	is	ahead	of	the	threshold	required	for	payment	under	the	Operating	Profit	measure.
More	broadly,	the	Committee	will	continue	to	consider	the	overall	performance	of	the	Company,	not	just	the	outcome	of	each	individual	measure. 	
All	bonus	targets	are	considered	to	be	commercially	sensitive	and	will	not	be	disclosed	in	advance.	However,	retrospective	disclosure	of	targets	and 	
performance	against	them	will	be	provided	in	next	year’s	Directors’	remuneration	report. 	
The	bonus	structure	for	all	Managers	across	Mitchells	&	Butlers	is	linked	to	the	above	business	scorecard.
Performance Restricted Share Plan (PRSP)
PRSP	awards	with	a	face	value	of	200%	and	140%	of	base	salary	will	be	made	to	the	Chief	Executive	and	Finance	Director	respectively.	The	measures 	
and	targets	for	the	award	to	be	made	for	the	2018-20	cycle	are	still	being	determined	as	set	out	in	the	Chair’s	statement	at	the	beginning	of	this	report. 	
Measures	and	targets	will	be	subject	to	consultation	with	major	shareholders	and	will	be	disclosed	in	full	at	the	time	of	grant.
Reflecting	good	practice	in	this	area,	a	two-year	post-vesting	holding	period	will	be	introduced	for	the	PRSP	awards	to	be	made	in	2018	and	for	all	future 	
long-term	incentive	awards,	thereby	strengthening	alignment	between	executives	and	shareholders.
Share ownership guideline 
The	guideline	has	been	increased	to	200%	of	salary	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	150%	of	salary	for	the	Finance	Director.	Consistent	with	the	previous 	
policy,	Directors	will	be	required	to	retain	all	vested	shares	(net	of	tax)	until	the	share	ownership	guideline	is	met.
Non-Executive Directors’ fee review
There	will	be	no	change	to	the	Chairman	and	Non-Executive	Director	fee	levels	in	2018.

Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The	key	audit	matters	that	we	identified	in	the	current	year	were:
•	Valuation	of	the	pub	estate;	and	
•	Onerous	lease	provisions.	
With	the	exception	of	extending	the	Onerous	lease	provisions	key	audit	matter	to	include	the	fact	that	
the	charge	for	the	year	is	included	as	a	separately	disclosed	item,	there	have	been	no	changes	in	the	
key	audit	matters	included	in	our	audit	report	since	2016.	This	is	consistent	with	the	fact	that	the	
operations	of	the	Group	are	largely	unchanged	from	the	previous	year.	
Materiality The	materiality	that	we	used	in	the	current	year	was	£8.8m	which	is	approximately	5%	of	profit	before	
tax	before	separately	disclosed	items.	
Scoping A	full	scope	audit	has	been	performed	in	respect	of	the	UK	business,	consistent	with	2016.
Significant changes in our approach In	2016,	we	adopted	an	audit	approach	which	tested	the	operating	effectiveness	of	controls	relating	
to	revenue	and	food	and	drink	expenditure.	In	2017 ,	we	have	tested	the	operating	effectiveness	of	
controls	relating	to	revenue,	food	and	drink	expenditure	and,	in	addition,	property,	plant	and	equipment.

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement 
We	have	reviewed	the	Directors’	statement	regarding	the	
appropriateness	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	contained	
within	Section	1	to	the	financial	statements	and	the	Directors’	statement	
on	the	longer-term	viability	of	the	Group	contained	within	the	Strategic	
report	on	page	40.
We	are	required	to	state	whether	we	have	anything	material	to	add	
or	draw	attention	to	in	relation	to:
•	the	disclosures	on	pages	36	to	40	that	describe	the	principal	risks	
and	explain	how	they	are	being	managed	or	mitigated;
•	the	Directors’	confirmation	on	page	37	that	they	have	carried	out	
a	robust	assessment	of	the	principal	risks	facing	the	Group,	including	
those	that	would	threaten	its	business	model,	future	performance,	
solvency	or	liquidity;
•	the	Directors’	statement	in	Section	1	to	the	financial	statements	
about	whether	they	considered	it	appropriate	to	adopt	the	going	
concern	basis	of	accounting	in	preparing	them	and	their	identification	
of	any	material	uncertainties	to	the	Group	and	the	Company’s	ability	
to	continue	to	do	so	over	a	period	of	at	least	12	months	from	the	date	
of	approval	of	the	financial	statements;
•	the	Directors’	explanation	on	page	40	as	to	how	they	have	assessed	
the	prospects	of	the	Group,	over	what	period	they	have	done	so	and	
why	they	consider	that	period	to	be	appropriate,	and	their	statement	
as	to	whether	they	have	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Group	will	
be	able	to	continue	in	operation	and	meet	its	liabilities	as	they	fall	due	
over	the	period	of	their	assessment,	including	any	related	disclosures	
drawing	attention	to	any	necessary	qualifications	or	assumptions;	or
•	whether	the	Directors’	statements	relating	to	going	concern	and	the	
prospects	of	the	Company	required	in	accordance	with	Listing	Rule	
9.8.6R(3)	are	materially	inconsistent	with	our	knowledge	obtained	
in	the	audit.
We	confirm	that	we	have	nothing	material	to	add	or	draw	attention	
to	in	respect	of	these	matters.
We	agreed	with	the	Directors’	adoption	of	the	going	concern	basis	
of	accounting	and	we	did	not	identify	any	such	material	uncertainties.	
However,	because	not	all	future	events	or	conditions	can	be	predicted,	
this	statement	is	not	a	guarantee	as	to	the	Group’s	ability	to	continue	
as	a	going	concern.
Key audit matters
Key	audit	matters	are	those	matters	that,	in	our	professional	judgement,	were	of	most	significance	in	our	audit	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	
current	period	and	include	the	most	significant	assessed	risks	of	material	misstatement	(whether	or	not	due	to	fraud)	that	we	identified.	These	matters	
included	those	which	had	the	greatest	effect	on:	the	overall	audit	strategy,	the	allocation	of	resources	in	the	audit;	and	directing	the	efforts	of	the	
engagement	team.
These	matters	were	addressed	in	the	context	of	our	audit	of	the	financial	statements	as	a	whole,	and	in	forming	our	opinion	thereon,	and	we	do	not	
provide	a	separate	opinion	on	these	matters.

Valuation of the pub estate
As	set	out	in	section	3. 1	the	value	of	the	estate	
is	£4,429m	(2016	£4,423m).
Freehold and long leasehold
The	accounting	policy	adopted	and	judgements	
used	are	described	in	section	3. 1	to	the	financial	
statements.
This	is	considered	to	be	a	key	audit	matter	due	
to	the	judgements	inherent	within	the	valuation	
exercise	and	the	range	of	acceptable	judgements.	
The	total	net	book	value	of	revalued	properties	as	
at	30	September	2017	is	£4,230m	(2016	£4,217m).	
The	revaluation	exercise	performed	in	the	year	has	
resulted	in	a	net	increase	of	£23m	versus	carrying	
value	(2016	£136m),	which	includes	an	impairment	
charge	of	£51m	(2016	£80m)	recognised	in	the	
income	statement.	The	Group’s	accounting	policy	
sets	out	that	the	market	value	is	determined	using	
factors	such	as	estimated	fair	maintainable	trading	
levels	and	estimated	multiples	which	are	derived	
for	each	of	the	Group’s	trading	brands.	20%	of	the	
freehold	and	long	leasehold	estate	has	been	
inspected	by	the	Group’s	external	valuers,	with	
the	result	of	the	inspection	informing	the	brand	
standard	multiples	which	are	then	extrapolated	
across	the	remainder	of	the	estate.	
In	specific	circumstances	where	this	approach	
does	not	fairly	represent	the	underlying	value	of	
the	property,	for	example	if	a	site	is	loss	making,	
a	spot	valuation	is	applied.	
Where	sites	have	been	impacted	by	expansionary	
capital	investment	in	the	preceding	12	months,	
the	valuation	of	those	properties	is	held	at	the	
24	September	2016	valuation	plus	capital	
expenditure	less	depreciation	in	2017 .	Sites	that	
have	been	open	for	more	than	three	periods	
(2016	six	periods)	are	reviewed	for	impairment.
Short leasehold
The	accounting	policy	adopted	and	judgements	
used	are	described	in	section	3. 1	to	the	financial	
statements.	
The	total	value	of	short	leasehold	properties	
as	at	30	September	2017	is	£170m	(2016	£177m).	
Judgements	in	relation	to	expected	trading	levels,	
whether	the	site	has	the	potential	to	be	turned	
around	and	discount	rates	are	applied	when	
calculating	short	leasehold	property	impairments.	
The	Group	recorded	an	impairment	charge	of	
£17m	(2016	£8m)	in	the	year.
We	worked	with	our	property	valuation	specialists	and	management’s	
external	advisors	to	challenge	the	methodology	and	underlying	
assumptions	used	in	the	freehold	and	long	leasehold	pub	estate	
valuation.	This	included:	
•	discussing	and	challenging	the	appropriateness	of	the	valuation	
methodology	adopted	with	management’s	external	advisors;
•	benchmarking	valuations	to	transaction	activity	in	the	licensed	retail	
property	market,	in	order	to	confirm	whether	the	multiples	being	
proposed	were	appropriate;
•	confirming	that	the	sites	inspected	by	the	Group’s	valuer	were	
representative	of	the	pub	estate	as	a	whole,	in	terms	of	brand	and	
geography,	to	determine	that	the	application	of	the	multiple	derived	
from	the	valuation	of	the	inspected	properties	to	the	rest	of	the	pub	
estate	was	appropriate;
•	confirming	that	the	fair	maintainable	trading	levels	used	in	the	
revaluation	exercise	were	consistent	with	the	Group’s	policy	and	
challenging	the	use	of	historical	trading	results	rather	than	forecasts	
in	the	determination	of	fair	maintainable	trade;
•	reviewing	the	future	projected	income	used	in	the	impairment	
reviews	for	the	sites	which	have	had	expansionary	capital	
investment	in	the	preceding	12	months;	
•	obtaining	evidence	to	support	the	valuation	of	a	sample	of	
properties	to	which	a	spot	valuation	has	been	applied,	for	example,	
through	comparison	to	sales	proceeds	achieved	for	similar	recent	
sales	transactions.	In	addition,	we	performed	a	retrospective	review	
of	prior	year	sites	which	were	spot	valued;	
•	testing	the	integrity	of	the	data	used	in	the	valuations	by	agreeing	
a	sample	to	source	data;	
•	using	analytical	tools	to	test	the	integrity	of	the	revaluation	model;	
and
•	assessing	the	competence,	independence	and	integrity	
of	management’s	external	advisers.
Additionally	we:	
•	assessed	the	design	and	implementation	and	tested	the	operating	
effectiveness	of	controls	in	relation	to	the	valuation	of	the	freehold	
and	long	leasehold	estate.	
We	are	in	
agreement	with	
the	methodology	
chosen	and	the	
assumptions	
adopted	to	revalue	
the	pub	estate	and	
conclude	there	
appears	to	be	no	
bias	in	the	valuation.	
The	multiples	
adopted	across	the	
estate	are	within	a	
reasonable	range.	
We	concur	that	the	
valuations	are	
suitable	for	inclusion	
in	the	financial	
statements.

Focus areas
Given	the	amounts	capitalised	and	the	risk	
associated	across	the	freehold,	long	leasehold	
and	short	leasehold	sites	we	have	focused	our	
procedures	on	the	assessment	made	by	
management	of:
•	the	appropriateness	of	the	fair	maintainable	
trading	levels	and	brand	multiple	assumptions	
applied	to	the	freehold	and	long	leasehold	estate	
on	a	site	by	site	basis;
•	the	valuation	of	freehold	and	long	leasehold	sites	
impacted	by	expansionary	capital,	challenging	
the	need	for	any	impairment	of	property,	plant	
and	equipment	required	at	an	individual	outlet	
level;	and
•	the	requirement	for	any	impairment	in	respect	
of	the	property,	plant	and	equipment	held	in	
the	short	leasehold	estate	at	an	individual	
outlet	level.
In	addition,	due	to	the	level	of	subjective	
judgements	involved	in	respect	of	multiple	and	
fair	maintainable	trade	assumptions	which	are	
inherently	uncertain,	we	have	identified	a	potential	
risk	of	fraud	in	this	key	audit	matter.
We	challenged	the	assumptions	used	by	management	within	the	
impairment	reviews	performed	for	the	short	leasehold	estate	and	
freehold	and	long	leasehold	sites	impacted	by	expansionary	capital.	
This	included:
•	obtaining	evidence	to	support	management’s	assertion	that	short	
leasehold	properties	can	be	successfully	turned	around	where	
properties	have	not	been	impaired	due	to	management’s	
expectation	that	the	performance	of	the	properties	will	improve.	
This	included	obtaining	evidence	to	support	management’s	
turnaround	plans	and	performance	of	a	retrospective	review	
considering	the	success	of	historic	turnaround	plans;
•	obtaining	evidence	to	support	management’s	expected	
performance	of	sites	post	investment	of	expansionary	capital	
and	a	retrospective	review	of	prior	year	sites	where	expansionary	
capital	was	incurred;	
•	testing	the	integrity	of	the	information	used	within	the	model	
by	agreeing	inputs	back	to	source	data	including	historical	results	
and	lease	terms;	and
•	assessing	the	appropriateness	of	the	discount	rate	through	
recalculation	and	performing	sensitivity	analysis.	
Additionally,	we	assessed	the	design	and	implementation	and	tested	
the	operating	effectiveness	of	controls	in	relation	to	the	short	
leasehold	impairment	review.
Onerous lease provisions
As	set	out	in	section	3.3,	property	provisions	are	
£42.4m	(2016	£9.3m)	of	which	£41.9m	(2016	£8.8m)	
relates	to	onerous	lease	provisions.	The	accounting	
policy	for	provisions	is	set	out	in	section	3.3.	£35m	
(2016	£nil)	of	the	property	provisions	provided	in	
the	period	have	been	included	as	a	separately	
disclosed	item	in	the	income	statement.
Loss-making	short	leasehold	properties	are	
reviewed	by	management	to	determine	whether	
an	onerous	lease	provision	is	required.	Judgements	
in	relation	to	expected	trading	levels,	the	
appropriate	lease	term	over	which	to	provide,	the	
potential	opportunity	to	exit	the	leases	early	and	
the	appropriate	discount	rate	to	use	are	applied	
when	assessing	the	level	of	onerous	lease	provision	
required.	Therefore	we	have	identified	a	potential	
risk	of	fraud	in	this	key	audit	matter.
Focus areas
Given	the	size	of	the	leasehold	estate	there	is	a	risk	
that	where	a	site	is	underperforming	the	cash	flows	
may	not	be	adequate	to	cover	future	lease	
obligations,	resulting	in	the	requirement	for	an	
onerous	lease	provision	for	the	unavoidable	cash	
flow.	We	focused	on	the	completeness	of	the	
onerous	lease	provision	both	in	terms	of	the	sites	
where	a	provision	has	not	been	recognised	on	the	
basis	that	management	have	a	turnaround	plan	in	
place	or	opportunity	to	exit	and	where	there	is	a	
provision,	the	judgements	used	in	arriving	at	the	
level	of	the	provision	for	each	site.	
In	addition	and	in	a	change	to	prior	years	we	
focused	on	the	presentation	of	part	of	the	charge	
in	the	year	as	a	separately	disclosed	item.
•	We	assessed	the	appropriateness	of	the	classification	of	the	£35m	
of	property	provisions	provided	in	the	period	as	a	separately	disclosed	
item	in	accordance	with	IAS	1	Presentation	of	Financial	Statements;
•	We	checked	that	all	leasehold	sites	were	considered	in	
management’s	process	to	identify	sites	which	were	potentially	
subject	to	onerous	leases;
•	Where	onerous	lease	provisions	have	not	been	recognised,	
despite	historical	results	indicating	that	a	provision	may	be	required,	
we	obtained	evidence	to	support	management’s	assertion	that	
properties	can	be	successfully	turned	around.	This	included	
assessing	the	success	of	previous	actions	undertaken	by	
management	to	turnaround	similar	sites;
•	We	tested	a	sample	of	loss-making	short	leasehold	and	unlicensed	
properties	to	create	an	expectation	of	the	appropriate	level	of	
onerous	lease	provision	for	each	property	within	our	sample	and	
compared	our	expectation	with	the	level	of	onerous	lease	provision	
for	each	property;	
•	We	tested	the	integrity	of	the	information	used	within	the	onerous	
lease	provision	calculation	by	agreeing	inputs	back	to	source	data	
including	historical	results,	and	rental	commitments;	and
•	We	assessed	the	appropriateness	of	the	risk-free	discount	rate	
used	through	comparison	to	appropriate	external	benchmarks.	
Additionally,	we	assessed	the	design	and	implementation	and	tested	
the	operating	effectiveness	of	controls	in	relation	to	the	calculation	
of	the	onerous	lease	provision.
We	agree	that	the	
level	of	onerous	
lease	provision	is	
appropriate	and	
that	the	classification	
of	the	£35m	of	
property	provisions	
provided	in	the	
period	as	separately	
disclosed	is	
reasonable	in	
accordance	with	
IAS	1	Presentation	
of	Financial	
Statements.
In	arriving	at	
£41.9m	of	onerous	
lease	provisions,	
management	have	
had	to	make	a	
number	of	
judgements	
regarding	the	
performance	
of	the	sites	and	
the	period	to	exit.	
In	considering	the	
judgements	made,	
we	consider	that	the	
provision	is	within	a	
reasonable	range.

92 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Our application of materiality
We	define	materiality	as	the	magnitude	of	misstatement	in	the	financial	statements	that	makes	it	probable	that	the	economic	decisions	of	a	reasonably	
knowledgeable	person	would	be	changed	or	influenced.	We	use	materiality	both	in	planning	the	scope	of	our	audit	work	and	in	evaluating	the	results	
of	our	work.	
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £8.8m	(2016	£8.7m)
Basis for determining materiality Approximately	5%	(2016	5%)	of	profit	before	tax	adjusted	for	net	profit	arising	on	property	disposals,	
movements	in	the	valuation	of	the	property	portfolio	and	short	leasehold	impairment	and	the	
separately	disclosed	onerous	lease	provision	charge	(2016	profit	before	tax	after	the	onerous	lease	
provision	charge	but	before	separately	disclosed	items).
Rationale for the benchmark applied Profit	before	tax	before	separately	disclosed	items	is	a	key	measure	used	by	the	Group	in	reporting	its	
results	to	allow	a	better	understanding	of	the	adjusted	trading	of	the	Group	and	is	also	a	key	measure	
considered	by	analysts.

We	agreed	with	the	Audit	Committee	that	we	would	report	to	the	
Committee	all	audit	differences	in	excess	of	£437 ,500	(2016	£435,000),	
as	well	as	differences	below	that	threshold	that,	in	our	view,	warranted	
reporting	on	qualitative	grounds.	We	also	report	to	the	Audit	Committee	
on	disclosure	matters	that	we	identified	when	assessing	the	overall	
presentation	of	the	financial	statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our	Group	audit	was	scoped	by	obtaining	an	understanding	of	the	Group	
and	its	environment,	including	Group-wide	controls,	and	assessing	the	
risks	of	material	misstatement	at	the	Group	level.	Based	on	that	
assessment,	we	performed	a	full	scope	audit	in	respect	of	the	UK	retail	
operating	business	and	the	UK	property	business	together	accounting	
for	99%	(2016	99%)	of	the	Group’s	total	assets,	97%	(2016	97%)	of	revenue	
and	98%	(2016	98%)	of	operating	profit.	This	audit	work	was	performed	
directly	by	the	Group	audit	engagement	team,	who	also	tested	the	
consolidation	process.	Given	the	relative	size	of	the	German	business	
(‘ALEX’)	we	consider	the	UK	business	provides	sufficient	audit	assurance	
over	the	Group	balances.	This	approach	is	consistent	with	2016.
In	responding	to	the	assessed	risks	of	material	misstatement,	the	audit	
engagement	team	sought	to	place	reliance	on	the	operating	effectiveness	
of	the	Group’s	controls	in	relation	to	revenue,	food	and	drink	expenditure	
and	property,	plant	and	equipment.	
Our	audit	work	on	the	UK	business	was	executed	at	levels	of	materiality	
applicable	to	each	individual	entity	which	were	lower	than	Group	
materiality	and	ranged	from	£0.27m	to	£8.7m	(2016	£0.25m	to	£8.68m).

misstatement	in	the	financial	statements	or	a	material	misstatement	of	
the	other	information.	If,	based	on	the	work	we	have	performed,	we	
conclude	that	there	is	a	material	misstatement	of	this	other	information,	
we	are	required	to	report	that	fact.
In	this	context,	matters	that	we	are	specifically	required	to	report	to	you	
as	uncorrected	material	misstatements	of	the	other	information	include	
where	we	conclude	that:
•	Fair, balanced and understandable	–	the	statement	given	by	the	
Directors	that	they	consider	the	Annual	Report	and	financial	statements	
taken	as	a	whole	is	fair,	balanced	and	understandable	and	provides	
the	information	necessary	for	shareholders	to	assess	the	Group’s	
performance,	business	model	and	strategy,	is	materially	inconsistent	
with	our	knowledge	obtained	in	the	audit;	or
•	Audit Committee reporting	–	the	section	describing	the	work	
of	the	Audit	Committee	does	not	appropriately	address	matters	
communicated	by	us	to	the	Audit	Committee;	or
•	Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code	–	the	parts	of	the	Directors’	statement	required	
under	the	Listing	Rules	relating	to	the	Company’s	compliance	with	
the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code	containing	provisions	specified	
for	review	by	the	auditor	in	accordance	with	Listing	Rule	9.8. 10R(2)	
do	not	properly	disclose	a	departure	from	a	relevant	provision	of	the	
UK	Corporate	Governance	Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	Directors’	responsibilities	statement,	the	
Directors	are	responsible	for	the	preparation	of	the	financial	statements	
and	for	being	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view,	and	for	such	
internal	control	as	the	Directors	determine	is	necessary	to	enable	the	
preparation	of	financial	statements	that	are	free	from	material	
misstatement,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error.
In	preparing	the	financial	statements,	the	Directors	are	responsible	for	
assessing	the	Group’s	and	the	Company’s	ability	to	continue	as	a	going	
concern,	disclosing	as	applicable,	matters	related	to	going	concern	and	
using	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	unless	the	Directors	either	
intend	to	liquidate	the	Group	or	the	Company	or	to	cease	operations,	
or	have	no	realistic	alternative	but	to	do	so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our	objectives	are	to	obtain	reasonable	assurance	about	whether	
the	financial	statements	as	a	whole	are	free	from	material	misstatement,	
whether	due	to	fraud	or	error,	and	to	issue	an	auditor’s	report	that	
includes	our	opinion.	Reasonable	assurance	is	a	high	level	of	assurance,	
but	is	not	a	guarantee	that	an	audit	conducted	in	accordance	with	ISAs	
(UK)	will	always	detect	a	material	misstatement	when	it	exists.	
Misstatements	can	arise	from	fraud	or	error	and	are	considered	material	
if,	individually	or	in	the	aggregate,	they	could	reasonably	be	expected	
to	influence	the	economic	decisions	of	users	taken	on	the	basis	of	these	
financial	statements.
A	further	description	of	our	responsibilities	for	the	audit	of	the	financial	
statements	is	located	on	the	Financial	Reporting	Council’s	website	at:	
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.	This	description	forms	part	
of	our	auditor’s	report.
Use of our report
This	report	is	made	solely	to	the	Company’s	members,	as	a	body,	
in	accordance	with	Chapter	3	of	Part	16	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.	
Our	audit	work	has	been	undertaken	so	that	we	might	state	to	the	
Company’s	members	those	matters	we	are	required	to	state	to	them	
in	an	auditor’s	report	and	for	no	other	purpose.	To	the	fullest	extent	
permitted	by	law,	we	do	not	accept	or	assume	responsibility	to	anyone	
other	than	the	Company	and	the	Company’s	members	as	a	body,	
for	our	audit	work,	for	this	report,	or	for	the	opinions	we	have	formed.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In	our	opinion	the	part	of	the	Directors’	remuneration	report	to	be

•	the	Strategic	report	and	the	Directors’	report	have	been	prepared	
in	accordance	with	applicable	legal	requirements.
In	the	light	of	the	knowledge	and	understanding	of	the	Group	and	or	
the	Company	and	their	environment	obtained	in	the	course	of	the	audit,	
we	have	not	identified	any	material	misstatements	in	the	Strategic	report	
or	the	Directors’	report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under	the	Companies	Act	2006	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,

•	we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	require	
for	our	audit;	or
•	adequate	accounting	records	have	not	been	kept	by	the	Company,	or	
returns	adequate	for	our	audit	have	not	been	received	from	branches	
not	visited	by	us;	or
•	the	Company	financial	statements	are	not	in	agreement	with	the	
accounting	records	and	returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration

is	not	in	agreement	with	the	accounting	records	and	returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

100 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 General information
Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc	(the	Company)	is	a	public	limited	company	limited	
by	shares	and	is	registered	in	England	and	Wales.	The	Company’s	shares	
are	listed	on	the	London	Stock	Exchange.	The	address	of	the	Company’s	
registered	office	is	shown	on	page	143.
The	principal	activities	of	the	Company	and	its	subsidiaries	(the	Group)	
and	the	nature	of	the	Group’s	operations	are	set	out	in	note	2. 1	and	in	the	
Strategic	report	on	pages	1	to	43.	
Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc,	along	with	its	subsidiaries	(together	‘the	Group’),	
is	required	to	prepare	its	consolidated	financial	statements	in	accordance	
with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	
the	European	Union	and	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	Act	2006.
The	Group’s	accounting	reference	date	is	30	September.	The	Group	
draws	up	its	financial	statements	to	the	Saturday	directly	before	or	
following	the	accounting	reference	date,	as	permitted	by	section	390	(3)	
of	the	Companies	Act	2006.	The	period	ended	30	September	2017	
includes	53	trading	weeks	and	the	period	ended	24	September	2016	
includes	52	trading	weeks.
The	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	on	the	historical	cost	basis	
as	modified	by	the	revaluation	of	properties,	pension	obligations	and	
financial	instruments.
The	Group’s	accounting	policies	have	been	applied	consistently.
Basis of consolidation
The	consolidated	financial	statements	incorporate	the	financial	
statements	of	Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc	(‘the	Company’)	and	entities	
controlled	by	the	Company	(its	subsidiaries).	The	financial	statements	
of	the	subsidiaries	are	prepared	for	the	same	financial	reporting	period	
as	the	Company.	Intercompany	transactions,	balances	and	unrealised	
gains	and	losses	on	transactions	between	Group	companies	are	
eliminated	on	consolidation.
The	results	of	subsidiaries	acquired	during	the	period	are	included	
in	the	consolidated	income	statement	from	the	date	of	acquisition.
Going concern
The	Group’s	business	activities,	together	with	the	factors	likely	to	affect	
its	future	development,	performance	and	position	are	set	out	in	the	
Strategic	report	and	Business	review	on	pages	1	to	43.	The	financial	
position	of	the	Group,	its	cash	flows,	liquidity	position	and	borrowing	
facilities	are	also	described	within	the	Business	review.
In	addition,	note	4.4	to	the	financial	statements	includes	the	Group’s	
objectives,	policies	and	processes	for	managing	its	capital;	its	financial	
risk	management	objectives;	details	of	its	financial	instruments	and	
hedging	activities;	and	its	exposures	to	credit	risk	and	liquidity	risk.	
As	highlighted	in	note	4.2	to	the	financial	statements,	the	Group’s	
financing	is	based	upon	securitised	debt.	
The	Directors	have,	at	the	time	of	approving	the	financial	statements,	a	
reasonable	expectation	that	the	Company	and	the	Group	have	adequate	
resources	to	continue	in	operational	existence	for	the	foreseeable	future.	
Thus	they	continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	in	
preparing	the	financial	statements.	
Foreign currencies
Transactions	in	foreign	currencies	are	recorded	at	the	exchange	rates	
ruling	on	the	dates	of	the	transactions.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	
denominated	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	into	the	functional	
currency	at	the	relevant	rates	of	exchange	ruling	at	the	balance	sheet	
date.	Foreign	exchange	differences	arising	on	translation	are	recognised	
in	the	income	statement.	Non-monetary	assets	and	liabilities	are	measured	
at	cost	using	the	exchange	rate	on	the	date	of	the	initial	transaction.
The	consolidated	financial	statements	are	presented	in	pounds	sterling	
(rounded	to	the	nearest	million),	being	the	functional	currency	of	the	
primary	economic	environment	in	which	the	parent	and	most	
subsidiaries	operate.	On	consolidation,	the	assets	and	liabilities	of	the	
Group’s	overseas	operations	are	translated	into	sterling	at	the	relevant	
rates	of	exchange	ruling	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	The	results	of	
overseas	operations	are	translated	into	sterling	at	average	rates	of	
exchange	for	the	period.	Exchange	differences	arising	from	the	
translation	of	the	results	and	the	retranslation	of	opening	net	assets	
denominated	in	foreign	currencies	are	taken	directly	to	the	Group’s	
translation	reserve.	When	an	overseas	operation	is	sold,	such	exchange	
differences	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement	as	part	of	the	gain	
or	loss	on	sale.
The	results	of	overseas	operations	have	been	translated	into	sterling	at	
the	weighted	average	euro	rate	of	exchange	for	the	period	of	£1	=	€1.16	
(2016	£1	=	€1.28),	where	this	is	a	reasonable	approximation	to	the	rate	at

Recent accounting developments
The	International	Accounting	Standards	Board	(IASB)	and	International	Financial	Reporting	Interpretations	Committee	(IFRIC)	have	issued	the	following	
standards	and	interpretations	which	have	been	adopted	by	the	Group	in	these	financial	statements	for	the	first	time:
Accounting standard Requirement Impact on financial statements
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 
and IAS 28 Investment Entities: 
Applying the Consolidation 
Exception
The	amendments	clarify	that	the	exemption	from	preparing	consolidated	
financial	statements	is	available	to	a	parent	entity	that	is	a	subsidiary	of	
an	investment	entity,	even	if	the	investment	entity	measures	all	its	
subsidiaries	at	fair	value	in	accordance	with	IFRS	10.	
As	the	Company	is	not	an	investment	entity	and	does	not	
have	any	holding	company,	subsidiary,	associate	or	joint	
venture	that	qualifies	as	an	investment	entity,	the	adoption	
of	the	amendments	has	had	no	impact	on	the	Group’s	
financial	statements.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting 
for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations 
The	Group	has	adopted	the	amendments	for	the	first	time	in	the	current	
period.	The	amendments	provide	guidance	on	how	to	account	for	the	
acquisition	of	a	joint	operation	that	constitutes	a	business	as	defined	in	
IFRS	3	Business	Combinations.	Specifically,	the	amendments	state	that	
the	relevant	principles	of	accounting	for	business	combinations	in	IFRS	3	
and	other	standards	should	be	applied.	The	same	requirements	should	
be	applied	to	the	formation	of	a	joint	operation	if	and	only	if	an	existing	
business	is	contributed	to	the	joint	operation	by	one	of	the	parties	that	
participate	in	the	joint	operation.
A	joint	operator	is	also	required	to	disclose	the	relevant	information	
required	by	IFRS	3	and	other	standards	for	business	combinations.
The	adoption	of	these	amendments	has	had	no	impact	
on	the	Group’s	consolidated	financial	statements.
Amendments to IAS 1 The	Group	has	adopted	the	amendments	to	IAS	1	Disclosure	Initiative	
for	the	first	time	in	the	current	period.	The	amendments	clarify	that	
an	entity	need	not	provide	a	specific	disclosure	required	by	an	IFRS	if	
the	information	resulting	from	that	disclosure	is	not	material,	and	give	
guidance	on	the	aggregation	and	disaggregation	of	information	for	
disclosure	purposes.	However,	the	amendments	reiterate	that	an	entity	
should	consider	providing	additional	disclosures	when	compliance	
with	the	specific	requirements	in	IFRS	is	insufficient	to	enable	users	of	
financial	statements	to	understand	the	impact	of	particular	transactions,	
events	and	conditions	on	the	entity’s	financial	position	and	performance.
In	addition,	the	amendments	clarify	that	an	entity’s	share	of	the	other	
comprehensive	income	of	associates	and	joint	ventures	accounted	for	
using	the	equity	method	should	be	presented	separately	from	those	
arising	from	the	Group,	and	should	be	separated	into	the	share	of	
items	that,	in	accordance	with	other	IFRSs:	(i)	will	not	be	reclassified	
subsequently	to	profit	or	loss;	and	(ii)	will	be	reclassified	subsequently	
to	profit	or	loss	when	specific	conditions	are	met.
The	amendments	also	address	the	structure	of	the	financial	statements	
by	providing	examples	of	the	systematic	ordering	or	grouping	of	the	notes.
The	adoption	of	these	amendments	has	not	resulted	
in	any	impact	on	the	financial	performance	or	position	
of	the	Group.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 
Clarification of Acceptable Methods 
of Depreciation and Amortisation
The	Group	has	adopted	the	amendments	for	the	first	time	in	the	current	
period.	The	amendments	prohibit	entities	from	using	a	revenue-based	
depreciation	method	for	items	of	property,	plant	and	equipment.	
The	amendments	to	IAS	38	introduce	a	rebuttable	presumption	that	
revenue	is	not	an	appropriate	basis	for	amortisation	of	an	intangible	
asset.	This	presumption	can	only	be	rebutted	in	the	following	two	
limited	circumstances:
(a)	 	 When	the	intangible	asset	is	expressed	as	a	measure	of	revenue;	or
(b)	 	 When	it	can	be	demonstrated	that	revenue	and	consumption	of	the	
economic	benefits	of	the	intangible	asset	are	highly	correlated.
As	the	Group	already	uses	the	straight-line	method	for	
depreciation	and	amortisation	for	its	property,	plant	and	
equipment	and	intangible	assets,	the	adoption	of	these	
amendments	has	had	no	impact	on	the	Group’s	consolidated	
financial	statements.
Amendments to IAS 27 Equity 
Method in Separate Financial 
Statements
The	Group	has	adopted	the	amendments	for	the	first	time	in	the	current	
period.	The	amendments	focus	on	separate	financial	statements	and	
allow	the	use	of	the	equity	method	in	such	statements.	Specifically,	the	
amendments	allow	an	entity	to	account	for	investments	in	subsidiaries,	
associates	and	joint	ventures	in	its	separate	financial	statements:
•	 at	cost;
•	 in	accordance	with	IFRS	9;	or
•	 using	the	equity	method	as	described	in	IAS	28	Investments	in	
Associates	and	Joint	Ventures.
The	same	accounting	must	be	applied	to	each	category	of	investments.
The	amendments	also	clarify	that	when	a	parent	entity	ceases	to	be	
an	investment	entity,	or	becomes	an	investment	entity,	it	should	account	
for	the	change	from	the	date	when	the	change	in	status	occurs.
The	adoption	of	the	amendments	has	had	no	impact	on	the	
Company’s	separate	financial	statements	as	the	Company	
accounts	for	investments	in	subsidiaries	and	associates	at	
cost	and	is	not	an	investment	entity.
102 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Accounting standard Requirement Impact on financial statements
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 
2012 to 2014 Cycle
The	amendments	to	IFRS	5	Non-current	Assets	Held	for	Sale	introduce	
specific	guidance	for	when	an	entity	reclassifies	an	asset	(or	disposal	
group)	from	held	for	sale	to	held	for	distribution	to	owners	(or	vice	versa).	
The	amendments	clarify	that	such	a	change	should	be	considered	as	a	
continuation	of	the	original	plan	of	disposal	and	hence	requirements	set	
out	in	IFRS	5	regarding	the	change	of	sale	plan	do	not	apply.	The	
amendments	also	clarify	the	guidance	for	when	held	for	distribution	
accounting	is	discontinued.
The	amendments	to	IFRS	7	Financial	Instruments:	Disclosures	provide	
additional	guidance	to	clarify	whether	a	servicing	contract	is	continuing	
involvement	in	a	transferred	asset	for	the	purpose	of	the	disclosures	
required	in	relation	to	transferred	assets.
The	adoption	of	these	amendments	has	had	no	impact	on	the	
Group’s	consolidated	financial	statements.
The	amendments	to	IAS	19	Employee	Benefits	clarify	that	the	rate	used	
to	discount	post-employment	benefit	obligations	should	be	determined	
by	reference	to	market	yields	on	high-quality	corporate	bonds.	The	
assessment	of	the	depth	of	a	market	for	high-quality	corporate	bonds	
should	be	at	the	currency	level	(i.e.	the	same	currency	as	the	benefits	
are	to	be	paid).	For	currencies	for	which	there	is	no	deep	market	in	such	
high-quality	corporate	bonds,	the	market	yields	at	the	end	of	the	reporting	
period	on	government	bonds	denominated	in	that	currency	should	be	
used	instead.
The	Group	uses	a	discount	rate	that	is	determined	with	
reference	to	market	yields	on	high-quality	corporate	bonds	
to	discount	the	defined	benefit	obligations.	Further	details	
are	provided	in	note	4.5.
The	IASB	and	IFRIC	have	issued	the	following	standards	and	interpretations	which	could	impact	the	Group,	with	an	effective	date	for	financial	periods	
beginning	on	or	after	the	dates	disclosed	below:
Accounting standard Effective date
IAS 7 (amendments) Disclosure Initiative 1	January	2017	(subject	to	EU	endorsement)
IAS 12 (amendments) Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses
1	January	2017	(subject	to	EU	endorsement)
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1	January	2018	
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1	January	2018
IFRS 2 (amendments) Classification and Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions
1	January	2018	(subject	to	EU	endorsement)
The	Directors	do	not	expect	that	the	adoption	of	the	standards	listed	above	will	have	a	material	impact	on	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	in	future	
periods.	Beyond	this,	it	is	not	practicable	to	provide	a	reasonable	estimate	of	the	effect	of	these	standards	until	a	detailed	review	has	been	completed.
Accounting standard Effective date
IFRS 16 Leases 1	January	2019	(subject	to	EU	endorsement)
The	standard	replaces	IAS	17	Leases	and	requires	lessees	to	recognise	assets	and	
liabilities	for	all	leases	unless	the	lease	term	is	12	months	or	less	or	the	underlying	asset	is	
of	low	value.
The	above	standard	reflects	a	significant	change	in	the	accounting	and	reporting	of	leases	for	lessees	as	it	provides	a	single	lessee	accounting	model,	
and	as	such,	requires	lessees	to	recognise	assets	and	liabilities	for	all	leases	unless	the	underlying	asset	has	a	low	value	or	the	lease	term	is	12	months	
or	less.	Accounting	requirements	for	lessors	is	substantially	unchanged	from	IAS	17 .	As	shown	in	note	2.3,	the	Group	has	lease	commitments	of	£693m	
at	30	September	2017	across	more	than	300	leases	of	varying	remaining	length	and	age.	The	impact	of	the	standard	on	the	Group	is	currently	being	
assessed	and	it	is	not	yet	practicable	to	quantify	the	effect	of	IFRS	16	on	these	consolidated	financial	statements.	There	is	no	impact	on	cash	flow.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The	preparation	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements	requires	management	to	make	judgements,	estimates	and	assumptions	in	the	application	
of	accounting	policies	that	affect	reported	amounts	of	assets,	liabilities,	income	and	expense.
Estimates	and	judgements	are	periodically	evaluated	and	are	based	on	historical	experience	and	other	factors	including	expectations	of	future	events	
that	are	believed	to	be	reasonable	under	the	circumstances.	Actual	results	may	differ	from	these	estimates.	Details	of	the	Group’s	critical	accounting	
judgements	and	estimates	are	described	within	the	relevant	accounting	policy	section	in	each	of	the	notes	to	the	financial	statements.
Critical	judgements	are	described	in	each	section	listed	below:
•	Note	2.2	Separately	disclosed	items	
•	Note	3. 1	Property,	plant	and	equipment
•	Note	3.3	Provisions
•	Note	4.5	Pensions

Accounting policies
Operating segments
IFRS	8	Operating	Segments	requires	operating	segments	to	be	based	on	the	Group’s	internal	reporting	to	its	Chief	Operating	Decision	Maker	
(CODM).	The	CODM	is	regarded	as	the	Chief	Executive	together	with	other	Board	members.	The	CODM	uses	EBITDA	and	profit	before	interest	
and	adjusted	items	(operating	profit	pre-adjustments)	as	the	key	measures	of	the	segment	results.	Group	assets	are	reviewed	as	part	of	this	process	
but	are	not	presented	on	a	segment	basis.
The	retail	operating	business	operates	all	of	the	Group’s	retail	operating	units	and	generates	all	of	its	external	revenue.	The	property	business	
holds	the	Group’s	freehold	and	long	leasehold	property	portfolio	and	derives	all	of	its	income	from	the	internal	rent	levied	against	the	Group’s	retail	
operating	units.	At	a	macro	level,	rent	is	set	on	a	market-based	measure	with	this	being	reviewed	on	a	five	yearly	basis.	The	internal	rent	charge	is	
eliminated	at	the	total	Group	level.

104 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 2.2 Separately disclosed items 
Accounting policy
In	addition	to	presenting	information	on	an	IFRS	basis,	the	Group	also	presents	adjusted	profit	and	earnings	per	share	information	that	excludes	
separately	disclosed	items	and	the	impact	of	any	associated	tax.	This	adjusted	information	is	disclosed	to	allow	a	better	understanding	of	the	
adjusted	trading	performance	of	the	Group	and	is	consistent	with	the	Group’s	internal	management	reporting.	
Separately	disclosed	items	are	those	which	are	separately	identified	by	virtue	of	their	size	or	incidence	and	include	movements	in	the	valuation	of	
the	property	portfolio	as	a	result	of	the	annual	revaluation	exercise,	impairment	review	of	short	leasehold	and	unlicensed	properties,	movements	
in	the	onerous	lease	provision,	restructuring	costs	and	effects	of	corporation	tax	rate	change.	
Critical accounting judgements 
Judgement	is	used	to	determine	those	items	which	should	be	separately	disclosed	to	allow	a	better	understanding	of	the	adjusted	trading	
performance	of	the	Group.	This	judgement	includes	assessment	of	whether	an	item	is	of	sufficient	size	or	of	a	nature	that	is	not	consistent	
with	normal	trading	activities.
Separately	disclosed	items	are	identified	as	follows:
•		 Profit/(loss)	arising	on	property	disposals	–	property	disposals	are	disclosed	separately	as	they	are	not	considered	to	be	part	of	adjusted	trade	
performance	and	there	is	volatility	in	the	size	of	the	profit/(loss)	in	each	accounting	period.
•		 Movement	in	the	valuation	of	the	property	portfolio	–	this	is	disclosed	separately,	due	to	the	size	of	the	movement	in	property	valuation	each	
period.	This	movement	is	also	not	considered	to	be	part	of	the	adjusted	trade	performance	of	the	Group.
•		 Onerous	lease	provision	–	this	provision	is	calculated	on	a	site	by	site	basis,	with	the	majority	of	the	additions	for	the	current	period	being	
disclosed	separately.	This	increase	is	the	result	of	a	full	review	of	estate	strategy.	In	addition,	the	discount	rate	applied	in	calculating	the	provision	
has	been	changed	in	the	current	period.	Due	to	the	size	of	the	resulting	increase	in	the	provision,	this	has	been	disclosed	separately.
•	Tax	rate	change	–	the	change	in	tax	rate	is	not	part	of	normal	trade	and	due	to	the	size	in	any	given	period,	this	is	disclosed	separately.
The	items	identified	in	the	current	period	are	as	follows:

on	retail	and	leisure	parks.	The	losses	are	now	considered	unavoidable	for	the	remaining	committed	lease	term.	In	addition,	the	discount	rate	applied	in	the	calculation	has	been	updated.	
As	a	result,	the	onerous	lease	provision	has	been	increased	significantly	with	the	majority	of	this	increase	recognised	as	a	separately	disclosed	item.	See	note	3.3	for	further	details.

2.3 Revenue and operating costs
Accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenue	is	the	fair	value	of	goods	and	services	sold	to	third	parties	as	part	of	the	Group’s	trading	activities,	after	deducting	sales-based	taxes,	
coupons	and	discounts.
The	majority	of	revenue	comprises	food	and	beverages	sold	in	the	Group’s	businesses.	This	revenue	is	recognised	at	the	point	of	sale	to	the	customer.	
Operating profit
Operating	profit	is	stated	after	charging	adjusted	items	but	before	investment	income	and	finance	costs.
Supplier incentives
Supplier	incentives	and	rebates	are	recognised	within	operating	costs	as	they	are	earned.	The	accrued	value	at	the	reporting	date	is	included	
in	other	receivables.
Operating leases – Group as lessee
Leases	in	which	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	are	retained	by	the	lessor	are	classified	as	operating	leases.	Payments	made	
under	operating	leases	and	sub-leases	are	charged	to	the	income	statement	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	period	of	the	lease.	Lease	incentives	
are	recognised	as	a	liability	and	a	subsequent	reduction	in	the	rental	expense	over	the	lease	term	on	a	straight-line	basis.
Premiums	paid	on	acquiring	a	new	lease	are	spread	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term.	Such	premiums	are	classified	in	the	balance	sheet	
as	current	or	non-current	prepayments,	with	the	current	portion	being	the	element	which	relates	to	the	following	period.
The	Group’s	policy	is	to	account	for	land	held	under	both	long	and	short	leasehold	contracts	as	operating	leases,	since	it	has	no	expectation	that	
title	will	pass	on	expiry	of	the	lease	contracts.
Operating leases – Group as lessor
Rental	income	from	operating	leases	is	recognised	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	term	of	the	lease.

Operating leases
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The	vast	majority	of	the	Group’s	leases	are	industry	standard	UK	pub	or	commercial	property	leases	which	provide	for	periodic	rent	reviews	to	open	
market	value	and	enjoy	statutory	rights	to	renewal	on	expiry.	Generally	they	do	not	contain	conditions	relating	to	rent	escalation,	rights	to	purchase,	
concessions,	residual	values	or	other	material	provisions	of	an	unusual	nature.

2.4 Taxation
Accounting policies
The	income	tax	expense	represents	both	the	income	tax	payable,	based	on	profits	for	the	period,	and	deferred	tax	and	is	calculated	using	tax	
rates	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	Taxable	profit	differs	from	net	profit	as	reported	in	the	income	statement	because	
it	excludes	items	of	income	or	expense	which	are	not	taxable.	Income	tax	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement	except	when	it	relates	to	items	that	
are	charged	or	credited	in	other	comprehensive	income	or	directly	in	equity,	in	which	case	the	income	tax	is	also	charged	or	credited	in	other	
comprehensive	income	or	directly	in	equity.
Deferred	tax	is	recognised	on	all	temporary	differences	between	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	for	financial	reporting	purposes	
and	the	amount	of	their	tax	bases.	Deferred	tax	is	not	recognised	in	respect	of	temporary	differences	associated	with	investments	in	subsidiaries,	
where	the	timing	of	the	reversal	of	the	temporary	difference	can	be	controlled	and	it	is	probable	that	the	temporary	difference	will	not	reverse	in	
the	foreseeable	future.	The	amount	of	deferred	tax	provided	is	based	on	the	expected	manner	of	realisation	or	settlement	of	the	carrying	amount	
of	assets	and	liabilities.

Unrecognised tax allowances
At	the	balance	sheet	date	the	Group	had	unused	tax	allowances	of	£80m	in	respect	of	unclaimed	capital	allowances	(2016	£66m)	available	for	offset	
against	future	profits.	
A	deferred	tax	asset	has	not	been	recognised	on	tax	allowances	with	a	value	of	£14m	(2016	£11m)	because	it	is	not	certain	that	future	taxable	profits	
will	be	available	in	the	company	where	these	tax	allowances	arose	against	which	the	Group	can	utilise	these	benefits.	These	tax	credits	can	be	carried	
forward	indefinitely.
Factors which may affect future tax charges
The	Finance	(No.2)	Act	2015	was	enacted	on	18	November	2015	and	reduced	the	main	rate	of	corporation	tax	from	20%	to	19%	from	1	April	2017 .	
The	Finance	Act	2016	was	substantively	enacted	on	15	September	2016	and	reduced	the	main	rate	of	corporation	tax	to	17%	from	1	April	2020.	
The	effect	of	these	changes	has	been	reflected	in	the	closing	deferred	tax	balances	at	24	September	2016	and	30	September	2017 .
2.5 Earnings per share
Basic	earnings	per	share	(EPS)	has	been	calculated	by	dividing	the	profit	or	loss	for	the	period	by	the	weighted	average	number	of	ordinary	shares	
in	issue	during	the	period,	excluding	own	shares	held	by	employee	share	trusts.	
For	diluted	earnings	per	share,	the	weighted	average	number	of	ordinary	shares	is	adjusted	to	assume	conversion	of	all	dilutive	potential	ordinary	shares.
Adjusted	earnings	per	ordinary	share	amounts	are	presented	before	adjusted	items	(see	note	2.2)	in	order	to	allow	a	better	understanding	of	the	
adjusted	trading	performance	of	the	Group.

Section	3	–	Operating	assets	and	liabilities
3.1 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
The	majority	of	the	Group’s	freehold	and	long	leasehold	licensed	land	and	buildings	are	revalued	annually	and	are	therefore	held	at	fair	value	
less	depreciation.	
Short	leasehold	buildings	(leases	with	an	unexpired	lease	term	of	less	than	50	years),	unlicensed	land	and	buildings	and	fixtures,	fittings	and	
equipment	are	held	at	cost	less	depreciation	and	impairment.	
All	land	and	buildings	are	disclosed	as	a	single	class	of	asset	within	the	property,	plant	and	equipment	table,	as	we	do	not	consider	the	short	
leasehold	and	unlicensed	buildings	to	be	material	for	separate	disclosure.
Non-current	assets	held	for	sale	are	held	at	their	carrying	value	or	their	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	where	this	is	lower.	
Depreciation
Depreciation	is	charged	to	the	income	statement	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	write	off	the	cost	less	residual	value	over	the	estimated	useful	life	of	an	
asset	and	commences	when	an	asset	is	ready	for	its	intended	use.	Expected	useful	lives	and	residual	values	are	reviewed	each	year	and	adjusted	
if	appropriate.
Freehold	land	is	not	depreciated.	
Freehold	and	long	leasehold	buildings	are	depreciated	so	that	the	difference	between	their	carrying	value	and	estimated	residual	value	is	written	
off	over	50	years	from	the	date	of	acquisition.	The	residual	value	of	freehold	and	long	leasehold	buildings	is	reassessed	each	year	and	is	estimated	
to	be	equal	to	the	fair	value	determined	in	the	annual	valuation	and	therefore	no	depreciation	charge	is	recognised.
Short	leasehold	buildings,	and	associated	fixtures,	fittings	and	equipment,	are	depreciated	over	the	shorter	of	the	estimated	useful	life	and	the	
unexpired	term	of	the	lease.
Fixtures,	fittings	and	equipment	have	the	following	estimated	useful	lives:
	 Information	technology	equipment	 3	to	7	years
	 Fixtures	and	fittings	 3	to	20	years
At	the	point	of	transfer	to	non-current	assets	held	for	sale,	depreciation	ceases.	Should	an	asset	be	subsequently	reclassified	to	property,	plant	and	
equipment,	the	depreciation	charge	is	calculated	to	reflect	the	cumulative	charge	had	the	asset	not	been	reclassified.
Disposals
Profits	and	losses	on	disposal	of	property,	plant	and	equipment	are	calculated	as	the	difference	between	the	net	sales	proceeds	and	the	carrying	
amount	of	the	asset	at	the	date	of	disposal.
Revaluation
The	revaluation	utilises	valuation	multiples,	which	are	determined	via	third-party	inspection	of	20%	of	the	sites	such	that	all	sites	are	individually	
valued	approximately	every	five	years;	and	estimates	of	fair	maintainable	trade	(FMT);	and	estimated	resale	value	of	tenant’s	fixtures	and	fittings.	
Properties	are	valued	as	fully	operational	entities,	to	include	fixtures	and	fittings	but	excluding	stock	and	personal	goodwill.	The	value	of	tenant’s	
fixtures	and	fittings	is	then	removed	from	this	valuation	via	reference	to	its	associated	resale	value.	Where	sites	have	been	impacted	by	
expansionary	capital	investment	in	the	preceding	12	months,	the	prior	year	FMT	is	considered	to	represent	the	most	appropriate	maintainable	
profit	of	the	site	as	the	current	year	trading	performance	includes	a	period	of	closure.	
Valuation	multiples	derived	via	third-party	inspections	determine	brand	standard	multiples	which	are	then	used	to	value	the	remainder	of	the	
non-inspected	estate	via	an	extrapolation	exercise,	with	the	output	of	this	exercise	reviewed	at	a	high	level	by	the	Directors	and	the	third-
party	valuer.
Surpluses	which	arise	from	the	revaluation	exercise	are	included	within	other	comprehensive	income	(in	the	revaluation	reserve)	unless	they	are	
reversing	a	revaluation	adjustment	which	has	been	recognised	in	the	income	statement	previously;	in	which	case	an	amount	equal	to	a	maximum	
of	that	recognised	in	the	income	statement	previously	is	recognised	in	income.	Where	the	revaluation	exercise	gives	rise	to	a	deficit,	this	is	reflected	
directly	within	the	income	statement,	unless	it	is	reversing	a	previous	revaluation	surplus	against	the	same	asset;	in	which	case	an	amount	equal	to	
the	maximum	of	the	revaluation	surplus	is	recognised	within	other	comprehensive	income	(in	the	revaluation	reserve).	
Impairment
Short	leasehold	and	unlicensed	properties	are	reviewed	on	an	outlet	basis	for	impairment	if	events	or	changes	in	circumstances	indicate	that	the	
carrying	amount	may	not	be	recoverable.	An	impairment	loss	is	recognised	whenever	the	carrying	amount	of	an	outlet	exceeds	its	recoverable	
amount.	The	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	of	an	outlet’s	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	value	in	use.	Any	changes	in	outlet	earnings,	or	cash	
flows,	the	discount	rate	applied	to	those	cash	flows,	or	the	estimate	of	sales	proceeds	could	give	rise	to	an	additional	impairment	loss.
Where	an	impairment	loss	subsequently	reverses,	the	carrying	amount	of	the	asset	is	increased	to	the	revised	estimate	of	its	recoverable	amount,	
but	only	so	that	the	increased	carrying	amount	does	not	exceed	the	carrying	amount	that	would	have	been	determined	had	no	impairment	loss	
been	recognised	for	the	asset	in	prior	periods.	A	reversal	of	an	impairment	loss	is	recognised	as	income	immediately.	An	impairment	reversal	is	only	
recognised	where	there	is	a	change	in	the	estimates	used	to	determine	recoverable	amounts,	not	where	it	results	from	the	passage	of	time.

3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued
Critical accounting judgements
The	revaluation	methodology	is	determined	using	management	judgement,	with	advice	from	third-party	valuers.	The	application	of	a	valuation	
multiple	to	the	fair	maintainable	trade	of	each	site	is	considered	the	most	appropriate	method	for	the	Group	to	determine	the	fair	value	of	licensed	
land	and	buildings.	Where	the	value	of	land	and	buildings	derived	purely	from	a	multiple	applied	to	the	fair	maintainable	trade	misrepresents	the	
underlying	asset	value,	due	to	low	levels	of	income	or	location	characteristics,	a	spot	valuation	is	applied.
Management	also	use	judgement	to	determine	the	most	appropriate	method	of	reviewing	short	leasehold	and	unlicensed	properties	for	
impairment.	When	a	review	for	impairment	is	conducted,	the	recoverable	amount	is	determined	based	on	value	in	use	calculations	by	applying	
growth	rates	to	determine	future	cash	flows	and	discounting	at	an	appropriate	rate.	
Critical accounting estimates
The	application	of	the	valuation	methodology	requires	two	critical	accounting	estimates;	the	estimation	of	valuation	multiples,	which	are	
determined	via	third-party	inspections;	and	an	estimate	of	fair	maintainable	trade,	including	reference	to	historic	and	future	projected	income	
levels.	A	sensitivity	analysis	of	changes	in	valuation	multiples	and	FMT,	in	relation	to	the	properties	to	which	these	estimates	apply,	is	provided	
on	page	113.	The	carrying	value	of	properties	to	which	these	estimates	apply	is	£4,230m	(2016	£4,217m).

The	market	value	has	been	determined	having	regard	to	factors	such	as	current	and	future	projected	income	levels,	taking	account	of	location,	
quality	of	the	pub	restaurant	and	recent	market	transactions	in	the	sector.	
Sensitivity analysis
Changes	in	either	the	FMT	or	the	multiple	could	materially	impact	the	valuation	of	the	freehold	and	long	leasehold	properties.	It	is	estimated	that,	
given	the	multiplier	effect,	a	2.5%	change	in	the	EBITDA	of	the	freehold	or	long	leasehold	properties	would	generate	an	approximate	£70m	movement	
in	their	valuation.	It	is	estimated	that	a	0. 1	change	in	the	multiple	would	generate	an	approximate	£31m	movement	in	valuation.
Impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties
Short	leasehold	and	unlicensed	properties	(comprising	land	and	buildings	and	fixtures,	fittings	and	equipment)	which	are	not	revalued	to	fair	market	
value,	are	reviewed	for	impairment	by	comparing	site	value	in	use	calculations	to	their	carrying	values.	The	value	in	use	calculation	uses	forecast	
trading	performance	cash	flows,	which	are	discounted	by	applying	a	pre-tax	discount	rate	of	7%	(2016	7%).	Any	resulting	impairment	relates	to	sites	
with	poor	trading	performance,	where	the	output	of	the	value	in	use	calculation	is	insufficient	to	justify	their	current	net	book	value.
Current	year	valuations	have	been	incorporated	into	the	financial	statements	and	the	resulting	revaluation	adjustments	have	been	taken	to	the	
revaluation	reserve	or	income	statement	as	appropriate.	The	impact	of	the	revaluations/impairments	described	above	is	as	follows:

Accounting policy
Inventories	are	stated	at	the	lower	of	cost	and	net	realisable	value.	Cost	is	calculated	using	the	weighted	average	method.	Work	in	progress	
is	in	respect	of	property	development	activities	and	includes	the	direct	costs	of	the	developments	and	associated	professional	fees.

Trade and other receivables
Accounting policy
Trade	and	other	receivables	are	recognised	and	carried	at	original	cost	less	an	allowance	for	any	uncollectable	amounts.

All	amounts	fall	due	within	one	year.
Trade	and	other	receivables	are	non-interest	bearing	and	are	classified	as	loans	and	receivables	and	are	therefore	held	at	amortised	cost.	Trade	and	
other	receivables	past	due	and	not	impaired	are	immaterial	and	therefore	no	further	analysis	is	presented.	The	Directors	consider	that	the	carrying	
amount	of	trade	and	other	receivables	approximately	equates	to	their	fair	value.

equates	to	their	fair	value.
3.3 Provisions 
Accounting policy
Provisions	are	recognised	when	the	Group	has	a	present	legal	or	constructive	obligation	as	a	result	of	past	events;	it	is	more	likely	than	not	that	an	
outflow	of	resources	will	be	required	to	settle	the	obligation;	and	the	amount	can	be	reliably	estimated.	Provisions	are	measured	using	the	Directors’	
best	estimate	of	the	expenditure	required	to	settle	the	obligation	at	the	balance	sheet	date	and	are	discounted	to	present	value	where	the	effect	
is	material.
Onerous	property	provisions	represent	the	expected	unavoidable	losses	on	onerous	and	vacant	property	leases	and	comprise	the	lower	of	the	net	
rent	payable	or	the	operating	loss	after	rental	costs.	The	provision	is	calculated	on	a	site	by	site	basis	with	a	provision	being	made	for	the	remaining	
lease	term,	where	a	lease	is	considered	to	be	onerous.	Other	contractual	dilapidations	costs	are	also	recorded	as	provisions	as	appropriate.
Critical accounting judgements
Determination	of	whether	a	loss	is	unavoidable	requires	areas	of	judgement	such	as	consideration	of	potential	future	investment	decisions,	
local	conditions	which	may	be	impacting	on	current	performance	and	the	opportunity	to	surrender	a	lease	back	to	the	landlord.

3.3 Provisions continued
Critical accounting estimates
In	relation	to	onerous	property	provisions,	estimates	are	required	in	determining	the	future	EBITDA	performance	of	each	site	and	the	potential	to	
exit	leases	earlier	than	the	expiry	date.	A	sensitivity	analysis	of	changes	in	these	estimates	is	provided	below.	The	value	of	provisions	to	which	these	
estimates	apply	is	£42m	(2016	£9m).
Provisions
The	provision	for	unavoidable	losses	on	onerous	property	leases	has	been	set	up	to	cover	rental	payments	of	vacant	or	loss-making	properties.	
Payments	are	expected	to	continue	on	these	properties	for	periods	of	1	to	19	years.

a.		 Releases	in	the	period	primarily	relate	to	property	disposals.	This	has	been	recognised	within	adjusted	profit	to	reflect	where	the	charge	for	these	properties	was	originally	recognised.
b.			 During	the	period,	a	full	review	of	estate	strategy	in	relation	to	managed	leasehold	properties	has	been	completed,	with	specific	focus	on	the	challenges	around	loss-making	sites	and	those	
located	on	retail	and	leisure	parks.	With	lower	footfall	on	many	of	these	parks	and	the	continued	uncertain	economic	outlook,	alongside	increased	cost	pressures	such	as	living	wage,	
business	rates	review,	apprenticeship	levy,	sugar	tax	and	food	price	inflation,	a	number	of	short	leasehold	sites	are	now	challenged	when	striving	to	achieve	a	break-even	profit	
performance.	As	a	result,	the	losses	are	now	considered	unavoidable	for	the	remaining	committed	lease	term	for	managed	properties.	In	addition,	the	discount	rate	applied	in	the	
calculation	has	been	updated.	As	a	result	of	these	changes,	a	£35m	increase	in	the	provision	which	has	been	included	as	a	separately	disclosed	item	(see	note	2.2).
	 	 The	remaining	increase	of	£1m	is	recognised	within	adjusted	profit,	as	this	represents	unavoidable	losses	on	unlicensed	properties.	There	is	no	change	in	approach	for	these	sites	from	
the	prior	period.
Sensitivity analysis
Changes	in	the	EBITDA	performance	of	each	site	could	impact	on	the	value	of	the	provision.	It	is	estimated	that,	a	10%	decline	in	the	EBITDA	
performance	of	the	sites	included	in	the	provision	would	generate	an	additional	provision	of	£2m.
It	is	also	estimated	that,	should	all	leases	with	more	than	ten	years	remaining	on	the	committed	lease	term	be	exited	two	years	ahead	of	expiry,	
the	provision	would	reduce	by	£3m.
3.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Accounting policies
Business combinations and goodwill
Acquisitions	of	subsidiaries	and	businesses	are	accounted	for	using	the	acquisition	method.	The	consideration	for	each	acquisition	is	measured	
at	the	aggregate	of	the	fair	values	of	assets	given	and	liabilities	incurred	or	assumed	by	the	Group	in	exchange	for	control	of	the	acquiree.	
Acquisition-related	costs	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement	as	incurred.	
At	the	acquisition	date,	the	identifiable	assets	acquired	and	the	liabilities	assumed	are	recognised	at	their	fair	value	at	the	acquisition	date,	except	that:
•		 deferred	tax	assets	or	liabilities	and	liabilities	or	assets	related	to	employee	benefit	arrangements	are	recognised	and	measured	in	accordance	
with	IAS	12	Income	Taxes	and	IAS	19	Employee	Benefits	(revised)	respectively;	and
•		 assets	(or	disposal	groups)	that	are	classified	as	held	for	sale	in	accordance	with	IFRS	5	Non-Current	Assets	Held	for	Sale	and	Discontinued	
Operations	are	measured	in	accordance	with	that	standard.
Intangible	assets	acquired	in	a	business	combination	and	recognised	separately	from	goodwill	are	initially	recognised	at	their	fair	value	at	the	
acquisition	date.
Goodwill	is	measured	as	the	excess	of	the	sum	of	the	consideration	transferred,	the	amount	of	any	non-controlling	interests	in	the	acquiree,	and	the	
fair	value	of	the	acquirer’s	previously	held	equity	interest	in	the	acquiree	over	the	net	of	the	identifiable	assets	acquired	and	the	liabilities	assumed	at	
the	acquisition	date.	If,	after	reassessment,	the	net	of	the	identifiable	assets	acquired	and	liabilities	assumed	at	the	acquisition	date	exceeds	the	sum	
of	the	consideration	transferred,	the	amount	of	any	non-controlling	interests	in	the	acquiree	and	the	fair	value	of	the	acquirer’s	previously	held	
interest	in	the	acquiree,	the	excess	is	recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement	as	a	bargain	purchase.
When	the	consideration	transferred	by	the	Group	in	a	business	combination	includes	assets	or	liabilities	resulting	from	a	contingent	consideration	
arrangement,	the	contingent	consideration	is	measured	at	its	acquisition	date	fair	value	and	included	as	part	of	the	contingent	consideration	
116 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 transferred	in	a	business	combination.	Changes	in	fair	value	of	the	contingent	consideration	that	qualify	as	measurement	period	adjustments	are	
adjusted	retrospectively,	with	corresponding	adjustments	against	goodwill.	Measurement	period	adjustments	are	adjustments	that	arise	from	
additional	information	obtained	during	the	‘measurement	period’	(which	cannot	exceed	one	year	from	the	acquisition	date)	about	facts	and	
circumstances	that	existed	at	the	acquisition	date.
The	subsequent	accounting	for	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	contingent	consideration	that	do	not	qualify	as	measurement	period	adjustments	
depends	on	how	the	contingent	consideration	is	classified.	Contingent	consideration	that	is	classified	as	equity	is	not	re-measured	at	subsequent	
reporting	dates	and	its	subsequent	settlement	is	accounted	for	within	equity.	Contingent	consideration	that	is	classified	as	an	asset	or	a	liability	
is	re-measured	at	subsequent	reporting	dates,	at	fair	value,	with	the	corresponding	gain	or	loss	being	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
When	a	business	combination	is	achieved	in	stages,	the	Group’s	previously-held	interests	in	the	acquired	entity	is	re-measured	to	its	acquisition	
date	fair	value	and	the	resulting	gain	or	loss,	if	any,	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.	Amounts	arising	from	interests	in	the	acquiree	prior	to	the	
acquisition	date	that	have	previously	been	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income	are	reclassified	to	profit	or	loss,	where	such	treatment	would	
be	appropriate	if	that	interest	were	disposed	of.
If	the	initial	accounting	for	a	business	combination	is	incomplete	by	the	end	of	the	reporting	period	in	which	the	combination	occurs,	the	Group	
reports	provisional	amounts	for	the	items	for	which	the	accounting	is	incomplete.	Those	provisional	amounts	are	adjusted	during	the	measurement	
period,	or	additional	assets	or	liabilities	are	recognised,	to	reflect	new	information	obtained	about	facts	and	circumstances	that	existed	as	of	the	
acquisition	date	that,	if	known,	would	have	affected	the	amounts	recognised	as	of	that	date.	
Goodwill	is	not	amortised,	but	is	reviewed	for	impairment	annually	or	more	frequently	if	events	or	changes	in	circumstances	indicate	that	the	
carrying	value	may	be	impaired.	For	the	purpose	of	impairment	testing,	goodwill	is	allocated	to	each	of	the	Group’s	cash-generating	units	expected	
to	benefit	from	the	synergies	of	the	combination.	The	impairment	review	requires	management	to	consider	the	recoverable	value	of	the	business	
to	which	the	goodwill	relates,	based	on	either	the	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	or	the	value	in	use.	Value	in	use	calculations	require	management	to	
consider	the	net	present	value	of	future	cash	flows	generated	by	the	business	to	which	the	goodwill	relates.	Fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	is	based	
on	management’s	estimate	of	the	net	proceeds	which	could	be	generated	through	disposing	of	that	business.	If	the	recoverable	amount	of	the	
cash-generating	unit	is	less	than	the	carrying	amount	of	the	unit,	the	impairment	loss	is	allocated	first	to	reduce	the	carrying	amount	of	any	goodwill	
allocated	to	the	unit	and	then	to	the	other	assets	of	the	unit	pro-rata	on	the	basis	of	the	carrying	amount	of	each	asset	in	the	unit.	An	impairment	
loss	is	recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement	and	is	not	subsequently	reversed.	
On	disposal	of	a	subsidiary,	the	attributable	amount	of	goodwill	is	included	in	the	determination	of	the	profit	or	loss	on	disposal.
Computer software
Computer	software	and	associated	development	costs,	which	are	not	an	integral	part	of	a	related	item	of	hardware,	are	capitalised	as	an	intangible	
asset	and	amortised	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	their	useful	life.	The	period	of	amortisation	ranges	between	three	and	seven	years	with	the	
majority	being	five	years.

4.2 Borrowings
Accounting policy 
Borrowings,	which	include	the	Group’s	secured	loan	notes,	are	stated	initially	at	fair	value	(normally	the	amount	of	the	proceeds)	net	of	issue	costs.	
Thereafter	they	are	stated	at	amortised	cost	using	an	effective	interest	basis.	Finance	costs,	which	are	the	difference	between	the	net	proceeds	
and	the	total	amount	of	payments	to	be	made	in	respect	of	the	instruments,	are	allocated	over	the	term	of	the	debt	using	the	effective	interest	
method.	Borrowing	costs	are	not	attributed	to	the	acquisition	or	construction	of	assets	and	therefore	no	costs	are	capitalised	within	property,	
plant	and	equipment.
Borrowings	can	be	analysed	as	follows:

The	notes	are	secured	on	the	majority	of	the	Group’s	property	and	future	income	streams	therefrom.	All	of	the	floating	rate	notes	are	hedged	using	
interest	rate	swaps	which	fix	the	interest	rate	payable.

The	overall	cash	interest	rate	payable	on	the	loan	notes	is	6. 1%	(2016	6. 1%)	after	taking	account	of	interest	rate	hedging	and	the	cost	of	the	provision	
of	a	financial	guarantee	provided	by	Ambac	in	respect	of	the	Class	A	and	AB	notes.
The	securitisation	is	governed	by	various	covenants,	warranties	and	events	of	default,	many	of	which	apply	to	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Limited,	the	
Group’s	main	operating	subsidiary.	These	include	covenants	regarding	the	maintenance	and	disposal	of	securitised	properties	and	restrictions	on	its	
ability	to	move	cash,	by	way	of	dividends	for	example,	to	other	Group	companies.	At	30	September	2017 ,	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Limited	had	cash	
and	cash	equivalents	of	£97m	(2016	£103m).	Of	this	amount	£1m	(2016	£36m),	representing	disposal	proceeds,	was	held	on	deposit	in	an	account	
over	which	there	are	a	number	of	restrictions.	The	use	of	this	cash	requires	the	approval	of	the	securitisation	trustee	and	may	only	be	used	for	certain	
specified	purposes	such	as	capital	enhancement	expenditure	and	business	acquisitions.

4.4 Financial instruments
Accounting policies
Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	recognised	in	the	Group’s	balance	sheet	when	the	Group	becomes	a	party	to	the	contractual	provisions	
of	the	instrument.
Financial assets
All	financial	assets	are	recognised	or	derecognised	on	a	trade	date	where	the	purchase	or	sale	of	a	financial	asset	is	under	a	contract	whose	terms	
require	delivery	of	the	financial	asset	within	the	timeframe	established	by	the	market	concerned.	Financial	assets	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value,	
plus	transaction	costs,	except	for	those	financial	assets	classified	as	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss,	which	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value.	
Financial	assets	are	classified	into	the	following	specified	categories:	financial	assets	‘at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss’	(FVTPL);	derivative	
instruments	in	designated	hedge	accounting	relationships;	‘held-to-maturity’	investments;	‘available-for-sale’	(AFS)	financial	assets;	and	‘loans	
and	receivables’.	The	classification	depends	on	the	nature	and	purpose	of	the	financial	assets	and	is	determined	at	the	time	of	initial	recognition.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial	assets,	other	than	those	at	FVTPL,	are	assessed	for	indicators	of	impairment	at	each	balance	sheet	date.	Financial	assets	are	impaired	
where	there	is	objective	evidence	that,	as	a	result	of	one	or	more	events	that	occurred	after	the	initial	recognition	of	the	financial	asset,	the	estimated	
future	cash	flows	of	the	instrument	have	been	affected.	
For	listed	and	unlisted	equity	investments	classified	as	AFS,	a	significant	or	prolonged	decline	in	the	fair	value	of	the	security	below	its	cost	
is	considered	to	be	objective	evidence	of	impairment.	
For	all	other	financial	assets,	including	redeemable	notes	classified	as	AFS,	objective	evidence	of	impairment	could	include:
•	significant	financial	difficulty	of	the	issuer	or	counterparty;	or
•	default	or	delinquency	in	interest	or	principal	payments;	or
•	it	becoming	probable	that	the	borrower	will	enter	bankruptcy	or	financial	reorganisation.
120 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 For	certain	categories	of	financial	assets,	such	as	trade	receivables,	assets	that	are	assessed	not	to	be	impaired	individually	are,	in	addition,	assessed	
for	impairment	on	a	collective	basis.	Objective	evidence	of	impairment	for	a	portfolio	of	receivables	could	include	the	Group’s	past	experience	of	
collecting	payments,	an	increase	in	the	number	of	delayed	payments	in	the	portfolio	past	the	agreed	credit	period,	as	well	as	observable	changes	
in	national	or	local	economic	conditions	that	correlate	with	default	on	receivables.
For	financial	assets	carried	at	amortised	cost,	the	amount	of	the	impairment	is	the	difference	between	the	asset’s	carrying	amount	and	the	present	
value	of	estimated	future	cash	flows,	discounted	at	the	financial	asset’s	original	effective	interest	rate.
The	carrying	amount	of	the	financial	asset	is	reduced	by	the	impairment	loss	directly	for	all	financial	assets	with	the	exception	of	trade	receivables,	
where	the	carrying	amount	is	reduced	through	the	use	of	an	allowance	account.	When	a	trade	receivable	is	considered	uncollectable,	it	is	written	
off	against	the	allowance	account.	Subsequent	recoveries	of	amounts	previously	written	off	are	credited	against	the	allowance	account.	Changes	
in	the	carrying	amount	of	the	allowance	account	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.
When	an	AFS	financial	asset	is	considered	to	be	impaired,	cumulative	gains	or	losses	previously	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income	are	
reclassified	to	profit	or	loss	in	the	period.
With	the	exception	of	AFS	equity	instruments,	if,	in	a	subsequent	period,	the	amount	of	the	impairment	loss	decreases	and	the	decrease	can	be	
related	objectively	to	an	event	occurring	after	the	impairment	was	recognised,	the	previously	recognised	impairment	loss	is	reversed	through	profit	
or	loss	to	the	extent	that	the	carrying	amount	of	the	investment	at	the	date	the	impairment	is	reversed	does	not	exceed	what	the	amortised	cost	
would	have	been	had	the	impairment	not	been	recognised.	
In	respect	of	AFS	equity	securities,	impairment	losses	previously	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	are	not	reversed	through	profit	or	loss.	Any	increase	
in	fair	value	subsequent	to	an	impairment	loss	is	recognised	in	other	comprehensive	income.
Financial liabilities
Financial	liabilities	are	classified	as	either	‘borrowings	at	amortised	cost’	or	‘other	financial	liabilities’.
The	borrowings	accounting	policy	is	provided	in	note	4.2.	Other	financial	liabilities	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value,	net	of	transaction	costs.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
The	Group	derecognises	a	financial	asset	only	when	the	contractual	rights	to	the	cash	flows	from	the	asset	expire,	or	when	it	transfers	the	financial	
asset	and	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	of	the	asset	to	another	entity.	If	the	Group	does	not	retain	substantially	all	the	risks	and	
rewards	of	ownership	but	continues	to	control	a	transferred	asset,	the	Group	recognises	its	retained	interest	in	the	asset	and	an	associated	liability	
for	amounts	it	may	have	to	pay.	If	the	Group	retains	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	of	a	transferred	financial	asset,	the	Group	
continues	to	recognise	the	financial	asset	and	also	recognises	a	collateralised	borrowing	for	the	proceeds	received.
The	Group	derecognises	financial	liabilities	when,	and	only	when,	the	Group’s	obligations	are	discharged,	cancelled	or	expired.	The	difference	
between	the	carrying	amount	of	the	financial	liability	discharged	and	the	consideration	paid	and	payable	is	recognised	in	profit	or	loss.
Effective interest method
The	effective	interest	method	is	a	method	of	calculating	the	amortised	cost	of	a	debt	instrument	and	of	allocating	interest	income	over	the	relevant	
period.	The	effective	interest	rate	is	the	rate	that	exactly	discounts	estimated	future	cash	receipts	(including	all	fees	and	points	paid	or	received	that	
form	an	integral	part	of	the	effective	interest	rate,	transaction	costs	and	other	premiums	or	discounts)	through	the	expected	life	of	the	debt	
instrument,	or	where	appropriate,	a	shorter	period,	to	the	net	carrying	amount	on	initial	recognition.	Income	is	recognised	on	an	effective	interest	
basis	for	debt	instruments	other	than	those	financial	assets	classified	as	at	FVTPL.	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The	Group	uses	interest	rate	and	currency	swap	contracts	to	hedge	its	exposure	to	changes	in	interest	rates	and	exchange	rates.	These	contracts	
are	designated	as	cash	flow	hedges	and	hedge	accounting	is	applied	where	the	necessary	criteria	under	IAS	39	Financial	Instruments:	Recognition	
and	Measurement	are	met.	Derivative	financial	instruments	are	not	used	for	trading	or	speculative	purposes.
Derivative	financial	instruments	are	initially	measured	at	fair	value	on	the	contract	date,	and	are	re-measured	to	fair	value	at	subsequent	reporting	
dates.	Fair	value	is	calculated	as	the	present	value	of	the	estimated	future	cash	flows	at	a	rate	that	reflects	the	credit	risk	of	various	counterparties.
Changes	in	the	fair	value	of	derivative	instruments	that	are	designated	and	effective	as	hedges	of	highly	probable	future	cash	flows	are	recognised	
in	equity.	The	cumulative	gain	or	loss	is	transferred	from	equity	and	recognised	in	the	income	statement	at	the	same	time	as	the	hedged	transaction	
affects	profit	or	loss.	The	ineffective	part	of	any	gain	or	loss	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement	immediately.
Movements	in	the	fair	value	of	derivative	instruments	which	do	not	qualify	for	hedge	accounting	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement	immediately.
Hedge	accounting	is	discontinued	when	the	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	terminated,	or	no	longer	qualifies	for	hedge	accounting.	At	that	
point,	the	cumulative	gain	or	loss	in	equity	remains	in	equity	and	is	recognised	in	accordance	with	the	above	policy	when	the	transaction	affects	
profit	or	loss.	If	the	hedged	transaction	is	no	longer	expected	to	occur,	the	cumulative	gain	or	loss	recognised	in	equity	is	recognised	in	the	income	
statement	immediately.
Equity instruments
An	equity	instrument	is	any	contract	that	evidences	a	residual	interest	in	the	assets	of	an	entity	after	deducting	all	liabilities.	Equity	instruments	
issued	by	the	Company	are	recorded	at	the	fair	value	of	the	proceeds	received,	net	of	direct	issue	costs.

Financial risk management
Financial	risk	is	managed	by	the	Group’s	Treasury	function.	The	Group’s	Treasury	function	is	governed	by	a	Board	Approved	Treasury	Policy	
Statement	which	details	the	key	objectives	and	policies	for	the	Group’s	treasury	management.	The	Treasury	Committee	ensures	that	the	Treasury	
Policy	is	adhered	to,	monitors	its	operation	and	agrees	appropriate	strategies	for	recommendation	to	the	Board.	The	Treasury	Policy	Statement	is	
reviewed	annually,	with	recommendations	for	change	made	to	the	Board,	as	appropriate.	The	Group	Treasury	function	is	operated	as	a	cost	centre	
and	is	the	only	area	of	the	business	permitted	to	transact	treasury	deals.	It	must	also	be	consulted	on	other	related	matters	such	as	the	provision	
of	guarantees	or	the	financial	implications	of	contract	terms.
An	explanation	of	the	Group’s	financial	instrument	risk	management	objectives	and	strategies	is	set	out	below.
The	main	financial	risks	which	impact	the	Group	result	from	funding	and	liquidity	risk,	credit	risk,	capital	risk	and	market	risk,	principally	as	a	result	
of	changes	in	interest	and	currency	rates.	Derivative	financial	instruments,	principally	interest	rate	and	foreign	currency	swaps,	are	used	to	manage	
market	risk.	Derivative	financial	instruments	are	not	used	for	trading	or	speculative	purposes.
Funding and liquidity risk
In	order	to	ensure	that	the	Group’s	long-term	funding	strategy	is	aligned	with	its	strategic	objectives,	the	Treasury	Committee	regularly	assesses	
the	maturity	profile	of	the	Group’s	debt,	alongside	the	prevailing	financial	projections.	This	enables	it	to	ensure	that	funding	levels	are	appropriate	
to	support	the	Group’s	plans.
The	current	funding	arrangements	of	the	Group	consist	of	the	securitised	notes	issued	by	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Finance	plc	(and	associated	liquidity	
facility)	along	with	three	committed	unsecured	revolving	credit	facilities	of	£50m	each.	The	terms	of	the	securitisation	and	the	revolving	credit	facilities	
contain	various	financial	covenants.	Compliance	with	these	covenants	is	monitored	by	Group	Treasury.	The	Group	also	has	uncommitted	revolving	
credit	facilities	of	£15m.
The	Group	prepares	a	rolling	daily	cash	forecast	covering	a	six	week	period	and	an	annual	cash	forecast	by	period.	These	forecasts	are	reviewed	
on	a	daily	basis	and	are	used	to	manage	the	investment	and	borrowing	requirements	of	the	Group.	A	combination	of	cash	pooling	and	zero	balancing	
agreements	are	in	place	to	ensure	the	optimum	liquidity	position	is	maintained.	The	Group	maintains	sufficient	cash	balances	or	committed	facilities	
outside	the	securitisation	to	ensure	that	it	can	meet	its	medium-term	anticipated	cash	flow	requirements.
The	maturity	table	below	details	the	contractual	undiscounted	cash	flows	(both	principal	and	interest)	for	the	Group’s	financial	liabilities,	after	taking	
into	account	the	effect	of	interest	rate	swaps.

Credit risk
The	Group	Treasury	function	enters	into	contracts	with	third	parties	in	respect	of	derivative	financial	instruments	for	risk	management	purposes	and	
the	investment	of	surplus	funds.	These	activities	expose	the	Group	to	credit	risk	against	the	counterparties.	To	mitigate	this	exposure,	Group	Treasury	
operates	policies	that	restrict	the	investment	of	surplus	funds	and	the	entering	into	of	derivative	transactions	to	counterparties	that	have	a	minimum	
credit	rating	of	‘A’	(long-term)	and	‘A1’ /‘P1’ /‘F1’	(short-term).	Counterparties	may	also	be	required	to	post	collateral	with	the	Group,	where	their	
credit	rating	falls	below	a	predetermined	level.	The	amount	that	can	be	invested	or	transacted	at	various	ratings	levels	is	restricted	under	the	policy.	
To	minimise	credit	risk	exposure	against	individual	counterparties,	investments	and	derivative	transactions	are	entered	into	with	a	range	of	
counterparties.	The	Group	Treasury	function	reviews	credit	ratings,	as	published	by	Moody’s,	Standard	&	Poor’s	and	Fitch	Ratings,	current	exposure	
levels	and	the	maximum	permitted	exposure	at	given	credit	ratings,	for	each	counterparty	on	a	daily	basis.	Any	exceptions	are	required	to	be	formally	
reported	to	the	Treasury	Committee	on	a	four-weekly	basis.

Capital management
The	Group’s	capital	base	is	comprised	of	its	net	debt	(analysed	in	note	4. 1)	plus	total	equity	(disclosed	on	the	face	of	the	Group	balance	sheet).	
The	objective	is	to	maintain	a	capital	base	which	is	sufficiently	strong	to	support	the	ongoing	development	of	the	business	as	a	going	concern,	including	
the	amenity,	and	cash	flow	generation	of	the	pub	estate.	By	keeping	debt	(see	also	‘Funding	and	liquidity	risk’	above)	and	headroom	against	its	debt	
facilities	at	an	appropriate	level,	the	Group	ensures	that	it	maintains	a	strong	credit	position,	whilst	maximising	value	for	shareholders	and	adhering	to	
its	covenants	and	other	restrictions	associated	with	its	debt	(see	note	4.2).	In	managing	its	capital	structure,	from	time	to	time	the	Group	may	realise	
value	from	non-core	assets,	buy	back	or	issue	new	shares,	initiate	and	vary	its	dividend	payments	and	seek	to	vary	or	accelerate	debt	repayments.	
The	Group’s	policy	is	to	ensure	that	the	maturity	of	its	debt	profile	supports	its	strategic	objectives.	The	Board	considers	the	latest	covenant	compliance,	
headroom	projections	and	projected	balance	sheet	positions	periodically	throughout	the	year,	based	on	the	advice	of	the	Treasury	Committee	which	
meets	on	a	four-weekly	basis.	The	Treasury	Committee	is	chaired	by	the	Group	Treasurer	and	monitors	Treasury	performance	and	compliance	with	
Board-approved	policies.	The	Group	Finance	Director	is	also	a	member	of	the	Committee.

Market risk
The	Group	is	exposed	to	the	risk	that	the	fair	value	of	future	cash	flows	of	its	financial	instruments	will	fluctuate	because	of	changes	in	market	prices.	
Market	risk	comprises	foreign	currency	and	interest	rate	risk.
Foreign currency risk
The	Group	faces	currency	risk	in	two	main	areas:
At	issuance	of	the	Class	A3N	floating	rate	notes,	the	Group	entered	into	a	cross	currency	interest	rate	swap	to	manage	the	foreign	currency	exposure	
resulting	from	both	the	US$	principal	and	initial	interest	elements	of	the	notes.	The	A3N	notes	form	part	of	the	securitised	debt	(see	note	4.2).
Further	to	the	step-up	on	the	A3N	notes	on	15	December	2010,	the	Group	has	additional	foreign	currency	exposure	as	a	result	of	the	increase	in	US$	
finance	costs.	A	movement	of	10%	in	the	US$	exchange	rate	would	have	£nil	(2016	£nil)	impact	on	the	reported	Group	profit	and	£22m	(2016	£25m)	
impact	on	the	reported	Group	net	assets.
The	Group	has	no	significant	profit	and	loss	exposure	as	a	result	of	retranslating	monetary	assets	and	liabilities	at	different	exchange	rates.	As	the	
Group	is	predominantly	UK	based	and	acquires	the	majority	of	its	supplies	in	sterling,	it	has	no	significant	direct	currency	exposure	from	its	operations.
Interest rate risk
The	Group	has	a	mixture	of	fixed	and	floating	interest	rate	debt	instruments	and	manages	the	variability	in	cash	flows	resulting	from	changes	in	interest	
rates	by	using	derivative	financial	instruments.	Where	the	necessary	criteria	are	met,	the	Group	minimises	the	volatility	in	its	financial	statements	through	
the	adoption	of	the	hedge	accounting	provisions	permitted	under	IAS	39.	The	interest	rate	exposure	resulting	from	the	Group’s	£1.9bn	securitisation	
is	largely	fixed,	either	as	a	result	of	the	notes	themselves	being	issued	at	fixed	interest	rates,	or	through	a	combination	of	floating	rate	notes	against	
which	effective	interest	rate	swaps	are	held,	which	are	eligible	for	hedge	accounting.	
The	sensitivity	analysis	below	has	been	calculated	based	on	the	Group’s	exposure	to	interest	rates	for	both	derivative	and	non-derivative	instruments	
as	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	For	floating	rate	liabilities,	which	are	not	hedged	by	derivative	instruments,	the	analysis	has	been	prepared	assuming	that	
the	liability	outstanding	at	the	balance	sheet	date	was	outstanding	for	the	whole	period.	For	interest	income	the	analysis	assumes	that	cash	and	cash	
equivalents	and	other	cash	deposits	that	were	held	in	interest	bearing	accounts	at	the	balance	sheet	date	were	held	for	the	whole	period.	A	100	basis	
point	movement	is	used	when	reporting	interest	rate	risk	internally	to	key	management	personnel	and	represents	management’s	assessment	of	the	
reasonably	possible	change	in	interest	rates.

Cash flow hedges
Changes	in	cash	flow	hedge	fair	values	are	recognised	in	the	hedging	reserve	in	equity	to	the	extent	that	the	hedges	are	effective.	The	cash	flow	
hedges	detailed	below	have	been	assessed	as	being	highly	effective	during	the	period	and	are	expected	to	remain	highly	effective	over	the	remaining	
contract	lives.
During	the	period	a	gain	of	£60m	(2016	loss	of	£116m)	on	cash	flow	hedges	was	recognised	in	equity.	A	loss	of	£53m	(2016	loss	of	£8m)	was	recycled	
from	equity	and	included	in	the	Group	income	statement	for	the	period.
Cash flow hedges – securitised borrowings
At	30	September	2017 ,	the	Group	held	10	(2016	10)	interest	rate	swap	contracts	with	a	nominal	value	of	£963m	(2016	£994m),	designated	as	a	hedge	of	
the	cash	flow	interest	rate	risk	of	£963m	(2016	£994m)	of	the	Group’s	floating	rate	borrowings,	comprising	the	A1N,	A3N,	A4,	AB,	C2	and	D1	loan	notes.
The	cash	flows	on	these	contracts	occur	quarterly,	receiving	a	floating	rate	of	interest	based	on	LIBOR	and	paying	a	fixed	rate	of	4.8558%	(2016	
4.8625%).	The	contract	maturity	dates	match	those	of	the	hedged	item.	The	10	interest	rate	swaps	are	held	on	the	balance	sheet	at	fair	market	value,	
which	is	a	liability	of	£292m	(2016	£404m).
At	30	September	2017	the	Group	held	one	(2016	one)	cross	currency	interest	rate	swap	contract,	with	a	nominal	value	of	£177m	(2016	£189m),	
designated	as	a	hedge	of	the	cash	flow	interest	rate	and	currency	risk	of	the	Group’s	A3N	floating	rate	$297m	(2016	$317m)	borrowings.	The	cross	
currency	interest	rate	swap	is	held	on	the	balance	sheet	at	a	fair	value	asset	of	£43m	(2016	£53m).
The	cash	flows	on	this	contract	occur	quarterly,	receiving	a	floating	rate	of	interest	based	on	US$	LIBOR	and	paying	a	floating	rate	of	interest	at	LIBOR	
in	sterling.
The	cash	flows	arising	from	interest	rate	swap	positions	on	the	same	counterparty	may	be	settled	as	a	net	position.	The	cross	currency	interest	rate	
swap	is	held	under	a	separate	agreement	and	cash	movements	for	this	instrument	are	settled	individually.

The	various	tranches	of	the	securitised	debt	have	been	valued	using	period	end	quoted	offer	prices.	As	the	securitised	debt	is	traded	on	an	active	
market,	the	market	value	represents	the	fair	value	of	this	debt.	The	fair	value	of	interest	rate	and	currency	swaps	is	the	estimated	amount	which	the	
Group	could	expect	to	pay	or	receive	on	termination	of	the	agreements.	These	amounts	are	based	on	quotations	from	counterparties	which	
approximate	to	their	fair	market	value	and	take	into	consideration	interest	and	exchange	rates	prevailing	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	Other	financial	
assets	and	liabilities	are	either	short-term	in	nature	or	their	book	values	approximate	to	fair	values.
Fair value of financial instruments
The	fair	value	of	the	Group’s	derivative	financial	instruments	is	calculated	by	discounting	the	expected	future	cash	flows	of	each	instrument	at	an	
appropriate	discount	rate	to	a	‘mark	to	market’	position	and	then	adjusting	this	to	reflect	any	non-performance	risk	associated	with	the	counterparties	
to	the	instrument.
IFRS	13	Financial	Instruments	requires	the	Group’s	derivative	financial	instruments	to	be	disclosed	at	fair	value	and	categorised	in	three	levels	
according	to	the	inputs	used	in	the	calculation	of	their	fair	value:
•	Level	1	instruments	use	quoted	prices	as	the	input	to	fair	value	calculations;
•	Level	2	instruments	use	inputs,	other	than	quoted	prices,	that	are	observable	either	directly	or	indirectly;
•	Level	3	instruments	use	inputs	that	are	unobservable.

4.5 Pensions
Accounting policy
Retirement	and	death	benefits	are	provided	for	eligible	employees	in	the	United	Kingdom	principally	by	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Pension	Plan	
(MABPP)	and	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Executive	Pension	Plan	(MABEPP).	These	plans	are	funded,	HMRC	approved,	occupational	pension	
schemes	with	defined	contribution	and	defined	benefit	sections.	The	defined	benefit	section	of	the	plans	is	now	closed	to	future	service	accrual.	
The	defined	benefit	liability	relates	to	these	funded	plans,	together	with	an	unfunded	unapproved	pension	arrangement	(the	Executive	Top-Up	
Scheme,	or	MABETUS)	in	respect	of	certain	MABEPP	members.	The	assets	of	the	plans	are	held	in	self-administered	trust	funds	separate	from	
the	Company’s	assets.
In	addition,	Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc	also	provides	a	workplace	pension	plan	in	line	with	the	Workplace	Pensions	Reform	Regulations.	This	automatically	
enrols	all	eligible	workers	into	a	Qualifying	Workplace	Pension	Plan.
The	total	pension	liability	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	in	respect	of	the	Group’s	defined	benefit	arrangements	is	the	greater	of	the	minimum	
funding	requirements,	calculated	as	the	present	value	of	the	agreed	schedule	of	contributions,	and	the	actuarial	calculated	liability.	The	actuarial	
liability	is	the	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation,	less	the	fair	value	of	the	scheme	assets.	The	cost	of	providing	benefits	is	determined	
using	the	projected	unit	credit	method	as	determined	annually	by	qualified	actuaries.	This	is	based	on	a	number	of	financial	assumptions	and	
estimates,	the	determination	of	which	may	be	significant	to	the	balance	sheet	valuation	in	the	event	that	this	reflects	a	greater	deficit	than	that	
suggested	by	the	schedule	of	minimum	contributions.	
There	is	no	current	service	cost	as	all	defined	benefit	schemes	are	closed	to	future	accrual.	The	net	pension	finance	charge,	calculated	by	applying	
the	discount	rate	to	the	pension	deficit	or	surplus	at	the	beginning	of	the	period,	is	shown	within	finance	income	or	expense.	The	administration	
costs	of	the	scheme	are	recognised	within	operating	costs	in	the	income	statement.
Re-measurement	comprising	actuarial	gains	and	losses,	the	effect	of	minimum	funding	requirements,	and	the	return	on	scheme	assets	are	
recognised	immediately	in	the	balance	sheet	with	a	charge	or	credit	to	the	statement	of	comprehensive	income	in	the	period	in	which	they	occur.	
Curtailments	and	settlements	relating	to	the	Group’s	defined	benefit	plan	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement	in	the	period	in	which	the	
curtailment	or	settlement	occurs.
For	the	defined	contribution	arrangements,	the	charge	against	profit	is	equal	to	the	amount	of	contributions	payable	for	that	period.
Critical accounting judgements 
The	calculation	of	the	defined	benefit	liability	requires	management	judgement	to	select	an	appropriate	high-quality	corporate	bond	to	determine	
the	discount	rate.	
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities
Actuarial valuation
The	actuarial	valuations	used	for	IAS	19	(revised)	purposes	are	based	on	the	results	of	the	latest	full	actuarial	valuation	carried	out	at	31	March	2016	
and	updated	by	the	schemes’	independent	qualified	actuaries	to	30	September	2017 .	Scheme	assets	are	stated	at	market	value	at	30	September	2017	
and	the	liabilities	of	the	schemes	have	been	assessed	as	at	the	same	date	using	the	projected	unit	method.	IAS	19	(revised)	requires	that	the	scheme	
liabilities	are	discounted	using	market	yields	at	the	end	of	the	period	on	high-quality	corporate	bonds.
The	principal	financial	assumptions	used	at	the	balance	sheet	date	have	been	updated	to	reflect	changes	in	market	conditions	in	the	period	and	are	
as	follows:
2017 2016
Pensions	increases 3.1% 2.9%
Discount	rate 2.7% 2.2%
Inflation	rate 3.2% 3.0%
The	mortality	assumptions	were	reviewed	following	the	2016	actuarial	valuation.	A	summary	of	the	average	life	expectancies	assumed	is	as	follows:

126 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 Minimum funding requirements
The	results	of	the	2016	actuarial	valuation	showed	a	funding	deficit	of	£451m,	using	a	more	prudent	basis	to	discount	the	scheme	liabilities	than	is	
required	by	IAS	19	(revised).	The	Company	has	subsequently	agreed	recovery	plans	for	both	the	Executive	and	Main	schemes	in	order	to	close	the	
funding	deficit	in	respect	of	its	pension	liabilities.	Agreement	was	reached	with	the	Trustees	in	relation	to	the	Executive	plan	on	30	June	2017	and	the	
Main	plan	on	25	July	2017 .	In	the	intervening	period,	the	Group	continued	to	make	contributions	in	line	with	the	previous	agreements.	The	new	
recovery	plans	show	an	unchanged	level	of	cash	contributions	with	no	extension	to	the	agreed	payment	term	(£45m	per	annum	indexed	with	RPI	from	
1	April	2016	subject	to	a	minimum	increase	of	0%	and	maximum	of	5%,	until	31	March	2023).	Under	IFRIC	14,	an	additional	liability	is	recognised,	such	
that	the	overall	pension	liability	at	the	period	end	reflects	the	schedule	of	contributions	in	relation	to	a	minimum	funding	requirement,	should	this	be	
higher	than	the	actuarial	deficit.
The	employer	contributions	expected	to	be	paid	during	the	financial	period	ending	29	September	2018	amount	to	£47m.
In	2024,	an	additional	payment	of	£13m	will	be	made	into	escrow,	should	such	further	funding	be	required	at	that	time.	This	is	a	contingent	liability	and	
is	not	reflected	in	the	pensions	liability	as	it	is	not	committed.
Sensitivity to changes in actuarial assumptions
The	sensitivities	regarding	principal	actuarial	assumptions,	assessed	in	isolation,	that	have	been	used	to	measure	the	scheme	liabilities	are	set	out	below:

analysis,	the	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	has	been	calculated	using	the	projected	unit	credit	method	at	the	end	of	the	reporting	
period,	which	is	the	same	as	that	applied	in	calculating	the	defined	benefit	obligation	liability	recognised	in	the	statement	of	financial	position.

In	the	53	weeks	ended	30	September	2017	the	Group	paid	£7m	(2016	£6m)	in	respect	of	the	defined	contribution	arrangements,	with	an	additional	
£1m	(2016	£1m)	outstanding	as	at	the	period	end.
At	30	September	2017	the	MABPP	owed	£2m	(2016	£1m)	to	the	Group	in	respect	of	expenses	paid	on	its	behalf.	This	amount	is	included	in	other	
receivables	in	note	3.2.
4.6 Share-based payments
Accounting policy
The	Group	operates	a	number	of	equity-settled	share-based	compensation	plans,	whereby,	subject	to	meeting	any	relevant	conditions,	employees	
are	awarded	shares	or	rights	over	shares.	The	cost	of	such	awards	is	measured	at	fair	value,	excluding	the	effect	of	non	market-based	vesting	
conditions,	on	the	date	of	grant.	The	expense	is	recognised	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	vesting	period	and	is	adjusted	for	the	estimated	effect	
of	non	market-based	vesting	conditions	and	forfeitures,	on	the	number	of	shares	that	will	eventually	vest	due	to	employees	leaving	the	employment	
of	the	Group.	Fair	values	are	calculated	using	either	the	Black-Scholes,	Binomial	or	Monte	Carlo	simulation	models	depending	on	the	conditions	
attached	to	the	particular	share	scheme.
SAYE	share	options	granted	to	employees	are	treated	as	cancelled	when	employees	cease	to	contribute	to	the	scheme.	This	results	in	an	
accelerated	recognition	of	the	expense	that	would	have	arisen	over	the	remainder	of	the	original	vesting	period.
Schemes in operation 
The	net	charge	recognised	for	share-based	payments	in	the	period	was	£2m	(2016	£2m).
The	Group	had	four	equity-settled	share	schemes	(2016	four)	in	operation	during	the	period;	the	Performance	Restricted	Share	Plan	(PRSP);	
Sharesave	Plan;	Share	Incentive	Plan	(SIP)	and	Short	Term	Deferred	Incentive	Plan	(STDIP).	There	were	no	outstanding	awards	for	the	STDIP	plan	
at	the	start	of	the	period	and	no	grants	in	the	current	period,	therefore	no	disclosures	are	presented	below	for	this	scheme.
The	vesting	of	all	awards	or	options	is	generally	dependent	upon	participants	remaining	in	the	employment	of	a	participating	company	during	
the	vesting	period.	Further	details	on	each	scheme	are	provided	in	the	Report	on	Directors’	remuneration	on	pages	66	to	87 .

d.	 The	expected	life	of	the	options	represents	the	average	length	of	time	between	grant	date	and	exercise	date.
The	fair	value	of	awards	under	the	Short	Term	Deferred	Incentive	Plan	and	the	Share	Incentive	Plan	are	equal	to	the	share	price	on	the	date	of	award	
as	there	is	no	price	to	be	paid	and	employees	are	entitled	to	Dividend	Accrued	Shares	to	the	value	of	ordinary	dividends	paid	or	payable	during	the

Incentive	Plan	during	the	period	was	231.0p	(2016	282.7p).

During	the	period,	the	employee	share	trusts	acquired	no	shares	(2016	270,000)	and	subscribed	for	353,025	(2016	268,287)	shares	at	a	cost	of	£nil	
(2016	£1m)	and	released	188,586	(2016	477 ,286)	shares	to	employees	on	the	exercise	of	options	and	other	share	awards	for	a	total	consideration	
of	£nil	(2016	£nil).	The	1,748,942	shares	held	by	the	trusts	at	30	September	2017	had	a	market	value	of	£5m	(24	September	2016	1,584,503	shares	
held	had	a	market	value	of	£4m).	
The	Company	has	established	two	employee	share	trusts:
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) Trust
The	SIP	Trust	was	established	in	2003	to	purchase	shares	on	behalf	of	employees	participating	in	the	Company’s	Share	Incentive	Plan.	Under	this	
scheme,	eligible	employees	are	awarded	free	shares	which	are	normally	held	in	trust	for	a	holding	period	of	at	least	three	years.	After	five	years	
the	shares	may	be	transferred	to	or	sold	by	the	employee	free	of	income	tax	and	National	Insurance	contributions.	The	SIP	Trust	buys	the	shares	
in	the	market	or	subscribes	for	newly	issued	shares	with	funds	provided	by	the	Company.	During	the	holding	period,	dividends	are	paid	directly	
to	the	participating	employees.	At	30	September	2017 ,	the	trustees,	Equiniti	Share	Plan	Trustees	Limited,	held	1,698,880	(2016	1,530,395)	shares	
in	the	Company.	Of	these	shares,	553,839	(2016	474,453)	shares	are	unconditionally	available	to	employees,	272,341	(2016	345,674)	shares	have	
been	conditionally	awarded	to	employees,	842,954	(2016	689,702)	shares	have	been	awarded	to	employees	but	are	still	required	to	be	held	within	
the	SIP	Trust	and	the	remaining	29,746	(2016	20,566)	shares	are	unallocated.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
The	EBT	was	established	in	2003	in	order	to	satisfy	the	exercise	or	vesting	of	existing	and	future	share	options	and	awards	under	the	Executive	Share	
Option	Plan,	Performance	Restricted	Share	Plan,	Short	Term	Deferred	Incentive	Plan	and	the	Sharesave	Plan.	The	EBT	purchases	shares	in	the	market	
or	subscribes	for	newly	issued	shares,	using	funds	provided	by	the	Company,	based	on	expectations	of	future	requirements.	Dividends	are	waived	
by	the	EBT.	At	30	September	2017 ,	the	trustees,	Sanne	Fiduciary	Services	Limited,	were	holding	50,062	(2016	54,108)	shares	in	the	Company.
Hedging reserve
The	hedging	reserve	comprises	the	effective	portion	of	the	cumulative	net	change	in	the	fair	value	of	cash	flow	hedging	instruments	related	to	hedged	
future	cash	flows.
Translation reserve
The	translation	reserve	is	used	to	record	exchange	differences	arising	from	the	translation	of	the	financial	statements	of	foreign	subsidiaries.
Retained earnings
The	Group’s	main	operating	subsidiary,	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Limited,	had	retained	earnings	under	FRS	101	of	£2,157m	at	30	September	2017	
(2016	£2,091m).	Its	ability	to	distribute	these	reserves	by	way	of	dividends	is	restricted	by	the	securitisation	covenants	(see	note	4.2).

136 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 1. Basis of preparation
Basis of accounting
These	financial	statements	were	prepared	in	accordance	with	Financial	Reporting	Standard	101	‘Reduced	Disclosure	Framework’	as	issued	by	the	FRC.
As	permitted	by	FRS	101,	the	Company	has	taken	advantage	of	the	disclosure	exemptions	available	under	that	standard	in	relation	to	share-based	
payments,	financial	instruments,	presentation	of	a	cash	flow	statement,	standards	not	yet	effective,	impairment	of	assets	and	related	party	transactions.
Where	required,	equivalent	disclosures	are	given	in	the	consolidated	financial	statements.
The	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	under	the	historical	cost	convention.	The	Company’s	accounting	policies	have	been	applied	on	a	
consistent	basis	to	those	set	out	in	the	relevant	notes	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements.	There	have	been	no	changes	to	policies	during	the	
period.	The	critical	judgements	and	estimates	of	the	Company	are	considered	alongside	those	of	the	Group.	The	key	critical	judgements	of	the	
Company	are	related	to	the	selection	of	the	discount	rate	for	the	defined	benefit	pension	liability	described	in	note	4.5	of	the	consolidated	financial	
statements	and	the	selection	of	discount	rate	in	the	investment	impairment	review	in	note	5.	The	key	critical	estimate	for	the	Company	is	the	estimate	
of	future	cash	flows	in	the	investment	impairment	review	described	in	note	5.	
Foreign currencies
Transactions	in	foreign	currencies	are	recorded	at	the	exchange	rates	ruling	on	the	dates	of	the	transactions.	Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	
denominated	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	into	sterling	at	the	relevant	rates	of	exchange	ruling	at	the	balance	sheet	date.
In	accordance	with	IAS	39,	the	Company	has	applied	fair	value	accounting	in	order	to	hedge	part	of	its	euro	loan	with	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Germany	
GmbH	against	part	of	its	investment	in	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Germany	GmbH.	On	20	September	2017 ,	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Germany	has	paid	a	dividend	
to	the	Company	which	has	settled	the	euro	loan.	Up	to	the	settlement	date,	foreign	exchange	differences	arising	on	translation	on	both	the	investment	
and	euro	loan	were	taken	to	the	profit	and	loss	account.	At	20	September	2017 ,	the	hedge	has	been	de-designated	and	the	part	of	the	investment	that	
had	been	used	to	hedge	the	loan	was	translated	at	the	exchange	rate	on	that	date.	No	further	hedge	accounting	will	be	required.
Restatement
Following	publication	of	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc	Annual	report	and	accounts	2016,	the	Financial	Reporting	Council	(FRC)	wrote	to	the	Company	
to	determine	whether	an	appropriate	impairment	review	had	been	performed	over	the	Company’s	investments	and	intercompany	receivables	
balances,	following	the	restructuring	activity	during	the	period.	As	a	result	of	this	request,	the	Company	has	performed	a	more	detailed	impairment	
review	in	respect	of	the	prior	period	and	has	determined	that	there	was	an	error	in	the	previous	calculation.	This	has	resulted	in	the	requirement	for	
the	Company	to	impair	its	investment	in	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Holdings	(No.2)	Limited	by	£495m.	The	2016	profit	and	loss	account,	balance	sheet	and	
statement	of	changes	in	equity	have	been	restated	to	reflect	this.	Details	of	the	restatement	are	shown	in	note	5.	This	adjustment	does	not	affect	the	
consolidated	financial	statements.
2. Profit and loss account
Profit and loss account
The	Company	has	not	presented	its	own	profit	and	loss	account,	as	permitted	by	Section	408	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.
The	Company	recorded	a	profit	after	tax	of	£121m	(2016	£918m	(restated	as	described	in	note	1)),	less	dividends	of	£12m	(2016	£31m).
Audit remuneration
Auditors’	remuneration	for	audit	services	to	the	Company	was	£22,000	(2016	£22,000).	This	is	borne	by	another	Group	company,	as	are	any	other	
costs	relating	to	non-audit	services	(see	note	2.3	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements).

Pension liability
At	30	September	2017	the	Company’s	pension	liability	was	£292m	(2016	£337m).	Of	this	amount,	£47m	(2016	£46m)	is	a	current	liability	and	£245m	
(2016	£291m)	is	a	non-current	liability.	
The	Company	is	the	sponsoring	employer	of	the	Group’s	pension	plans.	Information	concerning	the	pension	scheme	arrangements	operated	by	the	
Company	and	associated	current	and	future	contributions	is	contained	within	note	4.5	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements	on	pages	126	to	129.
The	pension	amounts	and	disclosures	included	in	note	4.5	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements	are	equivalent	to	those	applicable	for	the	Company.

a.	 	 During	the	prior	period,	the	Company	acquired	all	of	the	share	capital	of	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Property	Limited	by	way	of	a	dividend	in	specie	of	£1,354m	from	Mitchells	&	Butlers	
Holdings	(No.2)	Limited.	Subsequently,	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Property	Limited	made	a	distribution	of	£501m	to	transfer	an	intercompany	loan	receivable	from	Mitchells	&	Butlers	
Holdings	(No.2)	Limited	to	the	Company.	A	further	dividend	of	£853m	was	also	received	by	the	Company	from	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Property	Limited.	Following	these	distributions,	
the	net	assets	of	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Property	Limited	were	reduced	by	£1,354m	and	the	Company’s	investment	in	Mitchells	&	Butlers	Retail	Property	Limited	was	fully	impaired.
b.	 	 Additions	in	the	period	of	£248m	relate	to	a	capital	contribution,	in	the	form	of	a	loan	waiver,	provided	to	a	subsidiary	company	within	the	Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc	Group.	The	intercompany	
loan	was	tested	for	impairment	prior	to	the	loan	waiver,	with	no	impairment	required.
Mitchells	&	Butlers	plc	is	the	beneficial	owner	of	all	of	the	equity	share	capital	of	companies	within	the	Group,	either	itself	or	through	subsidiary	
undertakings	(see	note	5.2	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements).	
Investments	have	been	tested	for	impairment	using	forecast	cash	flows,	discounted	by	applying	a	pre-tax	discount	rate	of	7 .5%	(2016	8.3%).	
For	the	purposes	of	the	calculation	of	the	recoverable	amount,	the	cash	flow	projections	include	0.0%	(2016	1.0%)	of	growth	per	annum.	
Sensitivity analysis
Changes	in	forecast	cash	flows	or	discount	rate	could	materially	impact	the	recoverability	of	the	investments.	It	is	estimated	that:	a	1%	increase	in	
the	discount	rate	would	generate	an	impairment	of	£286m;	a	10%	reduction	in	future	cash	flows	would	generate	an	impairment	of	£115m;	or	a	1%	
reduction	in	growth	rate	would	generate	an	impairment	of	£326m.

The	performance	of	the	Group	is	assessed	using	a	number	of	Alternative	Performance	Measures	(APMs).
The	Group’s	results	are	presented	both	before	and	after	separately	disclosed	items.	Adjusted	profitability	measures	are	presented	excluding	
separately	disclosed	items	as	we	believe	this	provides	both	management	and	investors	with	useful	additional	information	about	the	Group’s	
performance	and	supports	a	more	effective	comparison	of	the	Group’s	trading	performance	from	one	period	to	the	next.	Adjusted	profitability	
measures	are	reconciled	to	unadjusted	IFRS	results	on	the	face	of	the	income	statement	with	details	of	separately	disclosed	items	provided	in	note	2.2.
The	Group’s	results	are	also	described	using	other	measures	that	are	not	defined	under	IFRS	and	are	therefore	considered	to	be	APMs.	These	APMs	
are	used	by	management	to	monitor	business	performance	against	both	shorter-term	budgets	and	forecasts	but	also	against	the	Group’s	longer-term	
strategic	plans.

The	sales	this	year	compared	to	the	sales	in	the	previous	year	of	all	UK	managed	sites	that	were	trading	in	the	two	periods	being	compared,	expressed	
as	a	percentage.	FY	2017	is	a	53	week	year	and	the	like-for-like	measure	is	presented	on	a	53	week	basis.	This	widely	used	industry	measure	provides
