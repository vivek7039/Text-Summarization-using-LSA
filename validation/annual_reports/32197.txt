LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   3
Introduction 
In my Chairman’s Statement for last year’s Annual report, I wrote that “we also 
face challenges from outside our industry, including yet another year of political 
uncertainty”. It is now clear this was a great understatement and there can be 
few 12-month periods that have produced such a series of political shocks 
culminating in last week General Election. 
Stock markets, however, have brushed off the vote for Brexit and Donald 
Trump becoming US President in January to such an extent that the FTSE 
100 has reached an all-time high in 2017 and we have been experiencing 
the second longest bull market in history. I doubt many people would have 
said this time last year that markets would be where they are today if they had 
known in advance the result of the UK Referendum and the US Presidential 
election even if sterling has depreciated as most commentators expected 
following the Brexit vote.
Now we are faced with a hung Parliament at Westminster with all the political 
uncertainty that this brings, along with the possibility of another General 
Election later this year. Once again, at the time of writing, there has been a 
benign reaction from the stock market in contrast to performance of Sterling.
The last year has been an important reminder of the difficulty of predicting and 
timing market movements and the benefits and value of financial advice and 
long-term investment as opposed to knee-jerk reactions. Economies, markets 
and investors will always be confronted by challenges and potential threats as 
well as opportunities. Therefore, the key for investors is to stay focused on 
what will enable them to achieve their long-term goals rather than obsess over 
intra-day movements in equity markets.
At Liontrust, we have brought together a talented group of fund management 
teams who believe that rigorous investment processes are key to long-
term performance and risk control. They do not get distracted by short-
term events and noise but stay true to their own documented investment 
processes. The success of this disciplined approach is shown by our 
teams’ long-term performance records, which also demonstrate the value 
that active management can deliver for investors. The addition of our new 
European Income and Sustainable Investment teams over the last year have 
strengthened further our fund management capability.
Like investors, asset management businesses are continually confronted by 
potential challenges and threats along with plenty of opportunities. It is easy to 
list the challenges that the industry is or could be facing, whether it is political 
uncertainty, current valuations in equity markets, the growth in flows into 
passive investments or technological disrupters.
None of these are reasons why we cannot continue to grow Liontrust, 
however, as we have done so successfully over the past few years through 
generating net sales and acquisitions. We have shown that sectors do not 
need to be in favour with investors for us to enjoy net positive sales into 
our funds.
This growth has been achieved through strong leadership and management, 
delivering value to investors over the long term and continuing to develop 
our sales and marketing capability. We focus on our strengths in running 
the business and are disciplined in enacting our strategy to grow our AuM, 
earnings and profitability as our Results for the 2016-17 financial year 
demonstrate.
The general election campaign in the UK has highlighted very clearly yet again 
the importance of every individual taking on responsibility for ensuring they 
have sufficient funds for their retirement and to achieve their other financial 
goals. Financial advice and fund management will become increasingly, not 
less, important in the future to help people achieve this.
I would like to thank our shareholders, investors and staff for all their support 
and loyalty to Liontrust. Due to the leadership of the business and the hard 
work of everyone at the Company, we are in a great position to continue to 
overcome any challenges and benefit from the tailwinds behind the industry.
Results
Adjusted profit before tax was £17.235 million (2016: £14.623 million). 
Adjusted profit before tax is disclosed in order to give shareholders an 
indication of the profitability of the Group excluding non-cash (depreciation, 
intangible asset amortisation and share incentivisation related) expenses 
and non-recurring (professional fees relating to acquisition, cost reduction, 
restructuring, share incentivisation and severance compensation related) 
expenses (“Adjustments”), see note 5 below for a reconciliation of adjusted 
profit (or loss) before tax. 
Profit before tax is £9.103 million (2016: £9.404 million).
Dividend
The success in fund performance and distribution has resulted in an increase 
in revenues excluding performance fees of 26% and an 18% increase in 
our adjusted profit before tax to £17.2 million. This has enabled the Board 
to declare a Second Interim dividend of 11.0 pence per share (2016: 9.0 
pence) which will be payable on 19 July 2017 to shareholders who are on the 
register as at 23 June 2017, the shares going ex-dividend on 22 June 2017. 
The total dividend for the financial year ending 31 March 2017 is 15.0 pence 
per share (2016: 12.0 pence per share), an increase of 25% compared with 
last year.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Introduction
The growth of Liontrust over the past seven years has been driven by the 
Company focusing on what we can control and not being distracted by events 
we cannot manage. The core of our strategy has been to generate strong 
investment performance for our investors over the long term, deliver a first-
class service, communicate clearly and frequently with our investors, broaden 
our distribution, deepen our client relationships and engagement, and raise 
our brand awareness and profile. The expansion of the Company over the last 
financial year is evidence of the continued success of this strategy.
We generated gross sales of more than £2 billion and net inflows of 
£482 million in the financial year to 31 March 2017, with our AuM increasing 
by 36% to £6.5 billion. The adjusted profit before tax increased by 18% to 
£17.2 million and revenues were up 15% to £51 million. At a time when the 
ability of asset managers to grow organically is being questioned, these figures 
are especially pleasing.
This is even more so when it is considered that our expansion over the past 
year has been achieved against a challenging background for selling equity 
funds in general and the UK All Companies sector in particular in the UK. The 
Investment Association reported that from April 2016 to March 2017, there 
were net retail outflows from equity funds in eight of the 12 months. The 
Investment Association’s UK All Companies sector was the worst performing 
for net retail sales in seven of these months although it was the best seller in 
March 2017. 
The continued strength of our fund management capability is evidenced by 
our long-term performance. Take the Liontrust Special Situations Fund as an 
example. Since launch on 10 November 2005 to 31 March 2017, the Fund 
generated a total return of 333.28% compared to 118.64% by the FTSE 
All-Share index. Our other teams have delivered strong performance as well. 
The Cashflow Solution’s European Growth Fund has returned 153.24% since 
launch on 15 November 2006 compared to 77.22% by the MSCI Europe 
ex UK index. These returns demonstrate the mistake of dismissing all active 
fund management. 
We have further expanded our fund management capability over the past year 
by completing the acquisition of the Argonaut European Income business and 
announcing the purchase of Alliance Trust Investments Limited (“ATI”). The 
acquisition of ATI was completed on 1 April 2017 and added £2.5 billion to 
take our AuM to £9.1 billion on 3 April. 
The addition of the Sustainable Investment team gives us a strong proposition 
in an area of investment that we believe will only grow in demand and 
significance. According to the European SRI Study of 2016, £11 trillion (£9.5 
trillion) is currently invested in sustainable and responsible investment across 
Europe with £1.5 trillion coming from the UK. 
We now have a presence in many of the core asset classes for UK investors. 
These are UK and continental European growth funds; equity income funds; 
risk-targeted solutions for investors seeking to accumulate wealth and in 
retirement; and sustainable investment. 
We have also strengthened further our distribution capability in the UK and 
internationally. Ian Chimes joined us in February 2017 as Head of Global 
Distribution and he has recruited two regional salesmen for the North of 
England and Scotland and the Midlands. This will enhance our client service 
further through understanding and engaging with a broader range of clients.
The brand awareness and understanding of Liontrust and the engagement 
with the Company has grown among intermediaries and consumers and 
reflects our distinct identity and strong messaging. This is being driven 
particularly by our advertising, press coverage, investor communications and 
sponsorships. Our new website and expanding digital activity will enhance 
further our marketing capability and engagement with intermediaries 
and consumers.

On 31 March 2017, our AuM stood at £6,523 million (2016: £4,791 million)

Outlook
There has been much discussion about the squeezed middle in the asset 
management industry. Companies either have to be global players or niche 
boutiques to survive and prosper, so goes the argument. We believe this is a 
simplistic and incorrect view of the development of the market. 
Liontrust is not alone in showing that you do not have to be a boutique or 
a global group to be able to generate growth year after year. We have also 
delivered value for our investors through strong fund performance over the 
long term. 
Following the investment we have made in the infrastructure of the business 
over the past few years, Liontrust is now both larger and more robust and this 
will enable us to drive forward the next phase of our growth strategy.

Vision and Strategic Objectives
Our Vision
Our vision is to be one of the leading fund management companies in the 
UK and internationally, renowned for consistently adding value to clients’ 
investment portfolios. We will attain this vision by achieving the following 
strategic objectives.
Our Strategic Objectives
Strong long-term performance
One of our key objectives is for all Liontrust funds and portfolios to outperform 
relevant benchmarks and the average returns of their respective peer groups 
over the medium to long term. We achieve this by retaining and recruiting 
fund managers who have excellent track records, expertise in their respective 
asset classes and who use rigorous investment processes that are clearly 
documented. There is an acceptance that no process will work 100% of the 
time but there is also an understanding that processes which are robust and 
scalable have the potential to deliver excellent long-term returns. We provide 
an environment that enables fund managers to focus on managing funds 
according to their own investment processes and market views and not be 
distracted by taking on responsibilities associated with running the business.
Effective distribution
We distribute our funds to as broad a client base in the UK and internationally 
as possible, striving continually to raise awareness and knowledge of Liontrust 
and our funds, widen the number of clients who invest with us, deepen 
our relationships with existing investors and increase our assets under 
management.
Excellent customer service and support
We pride ourselves on providing our investors with exceptional service and 
support and place treating customers fairly as one of our principles for 
business and at the cornerstone of our efforts to ensure customers get a fair 
deal. Treating customers fairly is central to how we conduct business across 
all our departments and functions.
Clear and regular communication
We communicate clearly and frequently with our investors and shareholders, 
regularly updating them on the performance of each of our funds and 
portfolios, the effectiveness of the investment processes applied to each of 
our funds and portfolios and the progress of the business as a whole. This is a 
key part of our objective of being as transparent as possible with all investors 
and stakeholders.
Appropriate risk
Effective management of risk is essential for the Group’s success; Liontrust 
has developed risk frameworks to ensure appropriate levels of risk across all 
areas of the Group including our funds and portfolios.
Running a profitable business
All stakeholders, including investors, members, employees and shareholders, 
benefit from a successful and stable business. We aim to increase profitability 
by growing our revenues faster than our costs through continued expansion 
in assets under management and by increasing margins through the focused 
management and control of costs.
Business model
Our business model operates in the manner to best serve our strategic 
objectives, comprising three interdependent divisions: Fund Management, 
Distribution and Operations.
Fund Management
We have a single fund management division of seven fund management 
teams who manage a range of funds, portfolios and segregated accounts 
using distinct investment processes and a centralised trading team.
Distribution
Our sales and marketing teams distribute our funds and portfolios in the UK and 
internationally. In the UK, we market to institutional investors, wealth managers, 
financial advisers and private investors. Outside the UK, we are focused on the 
wholesale market, primarily family offices, private banks, wealth managers and 
multi-managers in a number of countries, especially the Channel Islands, Ireland, 
Benelux, Malta, Germany, Italy and the Nordic region.
We maintain a consistent brand across all our marketing activities which 
reflects the values and culture of Liontrust. We are an independent business 
with no corporate parent, we are transparent and consistent in everything we 
do and operate with integrity, our fund managers are independent thinkers 
and have the courage of their convictions in making investment decisions, we 
have distinct and rigorous investment processes and we specialise in those 
asset classes where we have particular expertise. We have distinctive branding 
across all our marketing and sales material that features images of lions. This 
ties in with our partnership with ZSL London Zoo to support its campaign to 
protect the last remaining Asiatic lions in India. In addition, as part of being 
Principal Partner of Oxford United football club, we have been developing our 
community engagement programme.
Operations
We have a single Operations division, designed to support a fast growing 
business. Having a single Operations function ensures the fund management 
and distribution divisions have the appropriate tools to be effective, provides 
executive management with the performance and risk monitoring information 
required to manage the business and supports the requirements of external 
stakeholders such as customers, shareholders and regulators.
Key performance measures
Fund management ability and investment performance
The strength of Liontrust’s fund managers is shown by the fact that over the 
period from launch or fund manager appointment to the end of each of the 
last three financial years, on an AuM weighted basis, we have consistently had 
over 80% of our actively managed AuM in first quartile funds (see Figure 1).

Fund Management review
Currently, Liontrust has seven fund management teams each with distinct 
investment processes.
Economic Advantage Team
Anthony Cross, Julian Fosh, Victoria Stevens and Matt Tonge
Anthony Cross and Julian Fosh manage the Liontrust UK Growth and 
Liontrust Special Situations funds while they co-manage the Liontrust UK 
Smaller Companies and Liontrust UK Micro Cap funds with Victoria Stevens 
and Matt Tonge. The team also manages segregated accounts using the 
Economic Advantage investment process. Anthony Cross and Julian Fosh 
have 55 years of combined investment experience. Anthony, who was 
previously at Schroders, has managed the Liontrust Special Situations and 
UK Smaller Companies funds since launch and he started working with 
Julian at Liontrust in 2008. Julian has previously managed money at Scottish 
Amicable Investment Managers, Britannic Investment Managers, Scottish 
Friendly Assurance Society and Saracen Fund Managers. Victoria Stevens 
and Matt Tonge joined the team in 2015 to research and analyse investment 
opportunities primarily across the small cap universe. In Victoria’s previous role 
as deputy head of corporate broking at FinnCap, she built up an extensive 
knowledge of the smaller company investment universe. Matt added trading 
and analytical expertise to the team, having spent the previous nine years on 
the Liontrust dealing desk, latterly winning an industry award for his work in 
mid and small cap stocks.
Anthony, Julian, Victoria and Matt believe the secret to successful investing 
is to identify those few companies with a durable competitive advantage 
(Economic Advantage) that allows them to defy industry competition and 
sustain a higher than average level of profitability for longer than expected. 
This can surprise the market and can lead to strong share price appreciation. 
The Liontrust Economic Advantage process identifies companies which 
possess intangible assets that produce barriers to competition and are  LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   9
capable, in the opinion of the fund managers, of reaping a financial advantage 
in the form of cash flow returns in excess of the cost of capital. In the fund 
managers’ experience, the hardest characteristics for competitors to replicate 
are three classes of intangible asset: intellectual property, strong distribution 
channels and significant recurring business. All smaller companies in the funds 
must have a minimum 3% directors’ equity ownership. Equity ownership 
motivates key employees, helps to secure a company’s competitive edge and 
leads to better corporate performance.
Liontrust Special Situations Fund, for example, is in the first quartile of its 
IA sector over five and 10 years to 31 March 2017 and since launch on 
11 November 2005.
Macro-Thematic Team 
Stephen Bailey and Jamie Clark
Stephen Bailey and Jamie Clark, who manage the Liontrust Macro Equity 
Income and Liontrust Macro UK Growth funds and a segregated account 
using the Macro-Thematic investment process, have 46 years of combined 
investment experience and moved to Liontrust in 2012. Stephen started 
his career in the mid-1980s and joined Walker Crips in 1987 as investment 
director. Jamie joined Walker Crips in 2003 and prior to that was a Junior 
Proprietary Trader at First New York Securities. Stephen is one of only 24 
fund managers who have been named FE Alpha Manager every year since 
the award was created in 2009, including 2017, and has also been named in 
FE’s “Hall of Fame”. Jamie Clark became co-manager of the Macro-Thematic 
funds in 2007.
At the core of the investment philosophy of the Macro-Thematic process lies 
the belief that macro-thematic analysis – the identification and interpretation 
of major economic, political and social developments affecting the UK and 
the rest of the world – offers scope to add long-term investment value. A 
Macro-Theme is defined as an undiscounted, structural change in the process 
of realization, and the related passage to theme-maturity, is the macro-
trend. Macro-Thematic analysis tends to identify long duration investment 
opportunities that persist beyond market cycles. The fund managers believe 
a “top-down” approach is the most appropriate in identifying episodes of 
change, their drivers and the resultant investment opportunities. The process 
consists of four stages: theme discovery, identification of theme-assisted and 
theme-impaired companies, bottom-up analysis of prospective investments 
and portfolio construction and management.
Liontrust Macro Equity Income Fund, for example, was in the first quartile of 
its IA sector since launch on 31 October 2003 to 31 March 2017.
Cashflow Solutions Team
James Inglis-Jones and Samantha Gleave
James Inglis-Jones and Samantha Gleave have 40 years of combined 
experience and first worked together in 1998. James has previously managed 
money at Fleming Investment Management, JP Morgan Fleming and Polar 
Capital while Samantha formerly worked at Sutherlands Limited, Fleming 
Investment Management, Credit Suisse First Boston and Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch. Samantha was in a No 1 ranked equity research sector team 
(Extel & Institutional Investor Surveys) at Credit Suisse and won awards for 
Top Stock Pick and Earnings Estimates at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The Cashflow Solution investment process is based on the belief that the 
most important determinant of shareholder return is company cash flows. 
Cash flows determine the ability of a business to grow in a self-sustaining 
way and to return money to shareholders through dividend yield and share 
buybacks. The fund managers seek to own companies that generate 
significantly more cash than they need to sustain their planned growth, yet 
are lowly valued by investors on that measure. They sell short stocks that are 
expensive, are struggling to generate any cash and are run by management 
investing heavily for future growth. To identify companies’ annual cash flow, 
balance sheet development and valuation efficiently across all equity markets 
the fund managers have developed a simple screen as a starting point for 
further qualitative analysis. The investment screen consists of two cash flow 
ratios that are combined equally to highlight the process characteristics that 
they seek. These cash flow measures are: cash flow relative to operating 
assets and cash flow relative to market value.
Liontrust European Growth Fund, for example, was in the first quartile of 
its IA sector over one year and since launch on 15 November 2006 to 
31 March 2017.
Asia Team
Mark Williams, Carolyn Chan and Shashank Salva
Mark Williams, Carolyn Chan and Shashank Salva manage the Liontrust Asia 
Income and Liontrust GF Asia Income funds. They have more than 60 years 
of combined experience in analysing Asian companies. Mark, with 23 years’ 
experience in investing, has previously run funds at F&C and Occam. While 
managing the F&C Pacific Growth Fund, it was awarded first place in the 
Equity Asia Pacific (ex-Japan) sector over five years (out of 52 funds) by the 
S&P European awards in 2007. Carolyn has 24 years of experience and was 
previously at Hampton Investment Management. Shashank has 13 years of 
experience of experience in financial markets and has also previously worked 
in the Consumer Goods and Telecoms industries.
The investment process is based on the belief that the dominant influences 
on Asian equities will vary as cycles and environments change. The approach 
is also shaped by the fund managers’ view that the region will generate 
long-term growth and companies are increasingly paying dividends back to 
shareholders. While expectations will alter as events unfold across Asia, the 
end aim of the investment process remains constant. The process seeks to 
identify companies that will benefit from the growth in the region, have an 
attractive yield and give a greater chance of expectations being beaten. The 
process aims to avoid those stocks that are likelier to miss expectations. The 
process is also designed to enable the fund managers to compare companies 
on a like-for-like basis across countries and sectors. By targeting at least 1.1 
times the dividend yield of the region across the portfolio, the fund managers 
believe this will ensure the equities they invest in are amongst the more 
conservative, better managed companies. To filter the potential universe of 
stocks and to enable the fund managers to focus resources and time on the 
areas of the Asia Pacific ex-Japan market that they believe will generate the 
greatest returns, the fund managers identify what are likely to be the key 
drivers of equities in the region over the following six to 12 months. They 
then determine the impact and the winners and losers of these drivers before 
selecting companies based on yield, earnings growth and cheap valuations. 10   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

Sustainable Investment Team
Equities Team
Peter Michaelis, Simon Clements and Neil Brown
Peter Michaelis, Simon Clements and Neil Brown are the lead managers of 
a team of 10 experienced investment professionals. The team transferred 
to Liontrust from Alliance Trust Investments (ATI) in April 2017 and were 
previously running the Sustainable Future Fund range at Aviva Investors. 
Peter, with 16 years’ experience in investing, was previously Head of SRI at 
Aviva Investors and has been running the funds since their launch in 2001. 
Simon has been in fund management for 18 years and was previously Head 
of Global Equities at Aviva Investors. Neil has 14 years’ experience in financial 
markets and was an SRI Fund Manager at Aviva Investors.
In a fast changing world, we believe the companies that will survive and 
thrive are those which improve people’s quality of life, be it through medical, 
technological or educational advances; driving improvements in the efficiency 
with which we use increasingly scarce resources; and helping to build a 
more stable, resilient and prosperous economy. The process seeks to invest 
in high-quality organisations with robust business fundamentals, strong 
management and attractive valuations; adaptors and innovators capitalising 
on change, accessing new markets and opportunities and outperforming 
their competitors; and companies that are creating real and lasting value for 
shareholders and society, now and in the future. For the fund managers, high-
quality companies must exhibit the following three characteristics: excellent 
management and core products or services that are making a positive 
contribution to society; strong growth prospects; and the ability to translate 
these into leading returns on equity.
Fixed Income Team
Stuart Steven, Kenny Watson and Aitken Ross have more than 57 years 
of combined investment experience in managing fixed income. The team 
transferred over from ATI in April 2017. Stuart has 25 years of fixed income 
investment experience and was previously Investment Director of Scottish 
Widows Investment Partnership. Kenny has 26 years of fund management 
experience and was formerly at Ignis Asset Management where he was 
responsible for the sub investment grade bond portfolios. Aitken has six years 
of financial experience and started his career in the graduate scheme at ATI.
The process invests in a focused portfolio of bonds that are attractively valued 
and also take into consideration environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
factors by investing in companies that manage these exposures to minimise 
risk. The fund managers believe in a high conviction approach to ensure 
they develop a thorough understanding of their holdings and the factors that 
influence their long-term value. There are two main stages to the process: 
seeking to identify superior bonds and constructing resilient portfolios. The 
fund managers combine credit analysis with in-depth analysis of issuer specific 
factors, including ESG and macro-economic analysis.
European Income Team
Olly Russ
Olly Russ, who joined Liontrust in July 2016, manages the Liontrust European 
Enhanced Income and Liontrust European Income funds. Olly started his 
career at investment boutique Orbitex in 1998, where he worked on European 
Equity and UK Income funds and was responsible for running the Orbitex 
UK Equity Fund from its inception in March 2000. In 2002, Olly moved to 
Invicta Investment Management, a privately owned hedge fund, before joining 
Neptune Investment Management as a fund manager and financial analyst. 
He moved to Argonaut Capital in 2005. Olly has 19 years of investment 
experience.
Olly Russ has three objectives in managing his funds: a yield that is higher 
than the market; an income stream that grows in the long run faster than 
inflation; and long-term capital growth that is at least in line with inflation. Olly 
seeks to achieve these aims through investing in growing companies with 
low capital requirements that pay out expanding dividends. He uses dividend 
growth as a proxy for earnings growth – Olly expects to see dividends rising 
over time as companies increase pay outs to shareholders while earnings 
grow. Since dividends are paid out in cash, companies with increasing pay 
outs will need to produce high-quality cash earnings, with less scope for 
artificial inflation through financial manipulation or lower quality numbers. 
Olly believes a company targeting shareholder pay outs should help improve 
management focus on capital discipline, which can help to sustain higher 
valuations and avoid value-destroying actions. They are typically more 
stable, mature and secure companies, whose asset base and business has 
been built up over many years and is defended by an economic moat – an 
economic edge, competitive advantage or assets that are hard to replicate by 
new entrants, such as a strong brand, niche products or a dominant market 
position. Owning the types of companies described above may not alone 
produce market outperformance. To produce superior risk-adjusted returns, 
Olly looks for companies with these characteristics that are also undervalued. LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   11
Multi-Asset Team
John Husselbee and Paul Kim
John Husselbee and Paul Kim manage the Liontrust Wealth Solutions Service 
(WSS) and Liontrust Managed Portfolio Service (MPS) using the Liontrust 
Multi-Asset investment process. They are two of the most high-profile multi-
asset managers with 62 years of combined investment experience. John 
launched the portfolio management service at Rothschild Asset Management, 
was Director of Multi-Manager at Henderson Global Investors, where he was 
responsible for portfolio construction and fund selection of a range of portfolios 
totalling over £650 million, and founded North Investment Partners. Paul was 
instrumental in setting up Investment Manager Selection Ltd (IMS), was Head 
of Fund Selection and Multi-Manager at Liverpool Victoria Asset Management 
(L VAM) and has also managed portfolios at Capel Cure Myers, Sun Life 
Portfolio Counselling Services (AXA Sun Life), Christie Group Investment 
Management and Spencer Thornton Investment Management Services.
The Liontrust Multi-Asset investment process is designed to achieve two main 
objectives. The first is to target the outcome expected by investors in terms 
of the level of risk, as measured by volatility, of each portfolio. Volatility is a 
statistical measure of variation of returns over time, which is defined as the 
annualised “standard deviation” of monthly investment returns. This can enable 
investors to match the appropriate portfolio to their desired risk profile. The 
second objective is to maximise returns while still targeting the risk profile of 
each portfolio. These two objectives are pursued through a quantitative and 
qualitative approach. The fund managers use a scientific approach to target 
the risk outcome expected but consider the maximisation of returns to require 
an additional element of experience, knowledge and qualitative interpretation. 
There are four key stages to the investment process: strategic asset 
allocation, tactical asset allocation, fund selection and portfolio construction. 
Risk management is central to each of these stages and the portfolios are 
designed to provide diversification across asset classes, geographical regions 
and investment styles to enhance the returns for the level of risk taken. Each 
portfolio targets the appropriate volatility by combining fund selection with the 
strategic asset allocation, adjusted for the short-term tactical weightings. The 
fund managers then examine each portfolio from a top-down perspective to 
ensure that its characteristics are in line with the risk controls.

Distribution review
We have had another successful year in distribution. This has included 
generating gross sales of more than £2 billion and net inflows of £482 million 
for the financial year to 31 March 2017. Our AuM increased by £1.7 billion or 
36% to £6.5 billion and the completion of Alliance Trust Investments Limited 
on 1 April 2017 then added another £2.5 billion to take our AuM on 3 April to 
£9.1 billion.
Our gross sales and net inflows demonstrate the strength of our distribution 
capability through an uncertain political environment. We have continued to 
broaden our client base in the UK and internationally and have enhanced our 
distribution team over the past year. Ian Chimes joined Liontrust in February 
2017 as Head of Global Distribution and Simon Hildrey became Chief 
Marketing Officer, with both reporting to Chief Executive John Ions. 
The strength of our client relationships has once again been shown by the 
attendance at our Annual Investment Conference in January. For the first time, 
we took the Conference on the road, with our fund management teams also 
presenting in Edinburgh, Harrogate, Birmingham, Bristol and Luxembourg. In 
total, the fund managers presented to more than 350 fund buyers. 
We have continued to invest in our internal infrastructure, including the 
integration of our sales and marketing systems, notably through our CRM, 
and developing our digital marketing capability. This is enabling us to use more 
targeted, consistent and structured communications with intermediaries.
The launch of our new website in the 2016-17 financial year is a key part 
of developing our digital marketing capability and communications to clients 
and investors. The objective of the new website is to be accessible to 
and engaging for all types of investors, regardless of their experience and 
knowledge of investment. Most of the content and information is open to all 
investors. We have a section on the website entitled “Benefits of Investing”, 
which includes an introduction to investment, discusses the benefits of long-
term investment and explains common investment and financial words, terms 
and phrases. This section also has a downloadable guide to the world of 
investment and is part of our increasing focus on financial education. 
The website is one part of our focus on engaging with our investors, whether 
they are institutional investors, professional advisers or private investors. This is 
essential if we are really to understand their needs and objectives. 
We have completed the second year as Principal Partner of Oxford United 
football club and continued our partnership with ZSL London Zoo to support its 
conservation work with Asiatic lions in India. Oxford United have enjoyed another 
successful season, which is helping to enhance Liontrust’s profile. Oxford 
reached the FA Cup Fifth Round, having beaten Newcastle United in the Fourth 
Round, and reached the Final of the Checkatrade T rophy at Wembley for the 
second year running while finishing eighth in their first season in League One. 
The effectiveness of our marketing and brand is shown by the relatively high 
recognition and positive awareness figures we gain among intermediaries 
relative to how much we spend compared with competitors.

Operations review
We are focused on maintaining an operations team that is efficient, scalable 
and that gives us the ability to continue our growth whilst delivering returns 
to shareholders. With the growth in our business, we performed a strategic 
review of our Front Office IT infrastructure, and as a result strengthened 
our IT governance arrangements and also restructured and expanded our IT 
support team.
Our three key operations team are:
• IT/Office team, which focuses on the development and implementation of 
a cloud-based server infrastructure, delivery of IT hardware upgrades and 
the maintenance of a higher quality office environment;
• Investment Operations team to continue to improve systems and 
processes and monitor our outsourced providers (for accounting and fund 
valuation services);
• Transfer Agency team to monitor our transfer agency orientated 
outsourced providers.
In the financial year to 31 March 2017, the Operations teams, amongst other 
things, achieved the following:
• Restructured the IT team into two parts, IT Support and IT Infrastructure;
• Successfully integrated the two European income funds acquired from 
Argonaut Capital Partners LLP; and
• Completed a review of out UK third party administrators.

Dividend
The Board has considered current market environment, the financial 
performance for the Group in the current year and its cash generation abilities 
in future years, and is declaring a second interim dividend of 11.0 pence per 
share (2016: 9.0 pence) which will result in total dividends for the financial 
year ending 31 March 2017 of 15.0 pence per share (2015: 12.0 pence) 
(See Figure 9 below). This reflects a dividend margin (dividend per share 
divided by Adjusted diluted earnings per share) of 51%, an increase of 8% on 
last year (See Figures 9 and 10 below).

Dividend policy
Our policy is to grow our dividend progressively in line with our view of 
the underlying adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis (excluding 
performance fees) and cash flow of Liontrust;
When setting the dividend, the Board looks at a range of factors, including:
• the macro environment; 
• the current balance sheet; and
• future plans.
It is our intention that dividends will be declared and paid half yearly.
Statement of viability 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over a longer period than 
the 12 months required by the Going Concern provision. 
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue to operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, up to 31 March 
2020. The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to the 
Group’s current position and strategy, the Group’s risk appetite, the Group’s 
financial forecasts, and the Group’s principal risks and mitigations, as detailed 
in the Strategic Report. 
The three-year period is consistent with the Group’s current strategic forecast 
and ICAAP . The forecast incorporates both the Group’s strategy and principal 
risks. The forecast is approved by the Board at least annually. This formal 
approval is underpinned by regular Board discussions of strategy and risks, in 
the normal course of business. The forecast is updated as appropriate. 
The three-year strategic forecast considers the Group’s profitability, cash 
flows, dividend payments, share purchases, seed capital and other key 
variables. These metrics are subject to sensitivity analysis, which involves 
flexing a number of the main assumptions in the forecast, both individually and 
in unison. Scenario analysis is also performed as part of the Group’s ICAAP , 
which is approved by the Board. 18   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

The Group uses the following APMs:
Adjusted profit before tax
Definition: Profit before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation, share 
incentivisation expenses and non-recurring items.
Reconciliation: Note 7 on page 74.

Principal Risks and mitigations
The Group takes a cautious and pro-active approach to risk management, 
recognising the importance of understanding risks to the business, setting 
and monitoring risk appetite and implementing the systems and controls 
required to mitigate them. A Risk Register is maintained that captures the core 
risks inherent in our business and assesses how those risks are managed 
and mitigated, the key indicators that would suggest if the risk is likely to 
materialise together with an assessment that each risk may have on our 
regulatory capital.
Our Professional Indemnity Insurance covers us for losses, errors, and fraud. 
Our current assessment of our key operational risks and our risk management 
framework suggest that we are not at material risk of breaching our insurance 
limits, although all our risk appetite and prudential planning incorporates the 
scenario of a failure of insurance cover.
In order to help identify, manage and control risk, Liontrust breaks it down into 
four categories. On the basis of disciplined risk assessment, the principal risks 
to the Group’s business are considered. A high level summary is shown below 
with details of any mitigating factors and the risks are also discussed in the 
Risk Management and Internal Controls section of the Directors’ Report on 
page 31.
Credit risk
Credit risk covers the risk of loss due to a debtor’s inability to pay. The 
Liontrust Group maintains a liquidity policy document which identifies the credit 
risks that may affect any area of the business and details how these risks 
are monitored and controlled. These risks include: failure of banks / credit 
institution / significant counterparties; failure of a client to pay fees; failure of 
a client to pay funds for an investment; failure of a fund to pay redemption 
monies. Major counterparties are reviewed at least monthly and this covers, 
for each institution, agency ratings, interest rates currently offered and credit 
default swap spreads (where these measures are applicable or available). 
These are all indicators of any potential problems. If any such issues are 
identified the Group will take action to either move any functions or cash away 
from the institution or closely monitor the institution as per our counterparty 
selection and business continuity policies.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the value of assets will decrease due to the change 
in value of the market risk factors. Common market risk factors include asset 
prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. Liontrust 
as an investment management company is exposed to market risk in several 
forms, these include: seed investments; box management; funds under 
management; and management fee income.
Liontrust has only minor direct exposure to market risk through manager box 
positions and small holdings in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc 
which have been undertaken to aid incorporation and are redeemed when 
funds grow in size. The Group has a regular review process for any assets 
subject to market risk which identifies specific criteria to ensure that these 
remain within agreed limits.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems, or from external events. The management of 
operational risk is formalised in a number of ways including risk assessments  LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   19
and scorecards, documented procedures and compliance manuals, a 
comprehensive compliance monitoring programme (both internal and 
external), issue tracking and a regular assessment of third party providers. 
Liontrust manages its operational risk with a framework based upon the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s paper “Sound Practices for the 
Management and Supervision of Operational Risk” using seven operational 
risk event types that may result in substantial losses including:
Operational Risk 
Event Type Description
Internal Fraud Misappropriation of assets, tax evasion, intentional 
mismarking of positions, bribery
External Fraud Theft of information, hacking damage, third-party 
theft and forgery
Employment Practices 
and Workplace Safety
Discrimination, workers’ compensation, employee 
health and safety
Clients, Products, & 
Business Practice
Market manipulation, antitrust, improper 
trade, product defects, fiduciary breaches, 
account churning
Damage to Physical 
Assets
Natural disasters, terrorism, vandalism
Business Disruption & 
Systems Failures
Utility disruptions, software failures, 
hardware failures
Execution, Delivery, & 
Process Management
Data entry errors, accounting errors, failed 
mandatory reporting, negligent loss of 
client assets
These risk event types are further broken down into 36 sub-categories. Each 
operational department undergoes a risk assessment for each of these risks 
to identify the likelihood of a risk materialising as well as the impact of the risk. 
The impact is the likely effect of a risk crystallising; these are two measures, 
the cost of a typical event as well as the cost of an extreme case. The output 
from the departmental risk assessments or risk registers are co-ordinated with 
the Group’s Risk Register to ensure that we are capturing evolving risks for 
the Group as they emerge. The risk assessment and risk scorecard can then 
be used to create risk maps which visually model and communicate risks and 
their trends.
As we outsource many of our labour intensive operational functions, we 
commit high levels of resource to the management of these third party 
providers. We work hard to ensure that the relationship is a collaborative 
one and that both parties are working together towards the same goals, via 
a dedicated relationship management team and through a comprehensive 
monitoring programme. Failure of any outsource provider presents a real 
threat to the business and our continuity planning incorporates a stepped 
approach to manage and control these risks.
The key operational risks that have been identified as potentially having a 
significant impact on our business or capital are as follows:
• Trading errors
• Failure of key systems
• Failure of key supplier or outsource provider
• Corporate action errors
• Regulatory breaches
• Breach of mandate restrictions
• Business continuity failure
Liontrust has made a number of acquisitions over the last few years and 
during any period of integration (of systems, controls and procedures) there 
is a higher risk of failure of controls due to an increase in counterparties, 
more similar but not identical procedures and changing staff responsibilities. 
Liontrust devotes considerable management time to integrating each 
acquisition and aims to minimise operational risk arising from consolidation.
Liontrust also commissions an external accountancy firm to report on internal 
controls in accordance with AAF 01/06.
Other risks
The firm also faces other risks such as regulatory risk, key employee risk, 
market changes, mis-selling and the underperformance of one, or more, of 
the investment processes.
Regulatory risk and Brexit
The regulatory environment that the Group operates in continues to grow 
more complex. PRIIPS and MiFID II become effective on 1
st
 Jan 2018 
and considerable time and resources are allocated to ensure the business 
meets its new regulatory obligations which will impact both the Group and 
the investment vehicles operated by the Group. Increasing and changing 
regulations bring additional, or increased, risks of errors or omissions which 
can result in financial or other penalties and could result in a loss of confidence 
by our clients. Regulatory changes may also affect the products and services 
the Group offers, to whom or where it may offer them and the fees and 
charges it is able to charge. Liontrust’s Compliance department operates 
a comprehensive compliance monitoring programme to confirm regulatory 
obligations are met and works with industry bodies, lawyers and consultants 
to ensure all regulatory change is appropriately managed. Brexit will also bring 
additional disruption although it is not expected to have a significant impact 
on our business model - we continue to review and plan as we receive more 
clarity on the process.
Competitive Environment
Liontrust operates within a highly competitive environment with both local 
and global businesses, many of which have greater scale and resources. The 
changes to the regulatory and business landscape have resulted in a greater 
focus on fees & charges, a growing importance of brand & marketing and 
distributor relationships. Failure to compete effectively in this environment 
may result in loss of existing clients and a reduced opportunity to capture new 
business which may have a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial 
wellbeing and growth.
Key employee risk
People are a key part of our business and the stability of our investment and 
operational expertise is critical to the success of the business. The Group 
takes appropriate steps to manage expectations and minimise the loss of 
good quality staff. Any departure of significant personnel may result in a 
loss of funds under management, especially the loss of one of our fund 
management teams. Liontrust believes building and maintaining our distinct 
culture is key to the future success of our business and the engagement and 
retention of its staff, therefore, we invest significantly in our people, including 
through training and qualifications.
The development of our business and increasing the diversification of our 
fund management talent is a core objective of the Group and as recently 
demonstrated, the business is willing to finance acquisitions, etc. to achieve 
this diversification where it is prudent to do so while leaving sufficient capital to 
operate the business. 20   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Strategic Report continued
The risk of poor fund performance leading to customer loss
Liontrust provides specialist, actively managed portfolios to its clients aiming 
to produce good relative investment returns over the medium to long term. 
There may be periods where the portfolios have a weaker performance record 
and clients may redeem their investments during these periods potentially 
impacting the Group’s earnings. It is also harder to attract new clients during 
periods of under-performance in a fund, or across the Group’s portfolios which 
may impact the ability for the Group to grow.
Suitability and Conduct risk
It is a key aim of the Group to ensure our clients and customers understand 
the products and services we offer and for us to ensure that the products 
deliver what a client expects. All our investment processes are fully 
documented, which enables clients to understand clearly how we manage 
assets. For private investors investing through intermediaries, the process 
documents are supplemented by simplified monthly fund factsheets, the key 
investor information document and other reports and marketing literature 
available via the website or direct from us, which are clear and concise. For 
our institutional clients, we produce quarterly investment commentaries and 
regular detailed reports. Ensuring that our clients understand the product is a 
core element in treating them fairly. We believe our documented processes, 
detailed reports and literature reduce the likelihood of a product either being 
misunderstood or not delivering the appropriate customer outcomes, this may 
also reduce the risk of client losses in the event of portfolio underperformance.
Client Concentration and the risk of redemptions at short notice
Liontrust has several large, key clients and relationships. Should a large 
client leave (or conversely a new large client be acquired) there is a risk that 
earnings may be impacted. The largest client represents approximately 4% of 
the Group’s assets under management and the concentration is lower than 
this by revenue. Clients are also able to withdraw their assets at short notice. 
The retail funds have daily liquidity and most institutional mandates have no 
lock in periods or liquidity constraints. This may mean that in times of crisis 
assets under management may fall quickly increasing the potential volatility 
of earnings.
Technology and information security risk
Liontrust is dependent on our IT infrastructure and systems. A successful 
cyber-attack could result in the loss of data; disrupt our ability to service our 
customers or in a worst case scenario – a loss of clients’ assets. Liontrust has 
included the management of cyber security into our governance framework 
for a number of years and use specialist external consultants to review and 
test our IT infrastructure and security including penetration testing. Staff 
awareness and training is an important part of our defence against attack. 
Liontrust demands the same commitment to tackling cybersecurity from its 
key outsourced providers.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Liontrust is committed to the principle of Corporate Social Responsibility 
(“CSR”) and intends that it should become embedded, where appropriate, 
into its policies and practices, to the benefit of stakeholders as well as the 
wider community. Liontrust aims to be recognised as an organisation that 
is transparent and ethical in all its dealings as well as making a positive 
contribution to the community in which it operates. The Board and the Health 
and Safety Committee have reviewed the current and potential ESG risks 
and believe that adequate procedures are in place to identify and assess 
these risks.
Liontrust is committed to the following core values in all aspects of its work, 
including the fulfilment of its social responsibility:
• Clear direction and strong leadership;
• Customer focus and treating customers fairly;
• Working to deliver good customer outcomes;
• Open communication and transparency;
• Commitment to the highest ethical standards;
• Respect for people and the development of positive working relationships 
with others; and
• Valuing and harnessing the equality and the diversity of Liontrust members 
and employees.
CSR Strategies
Liontrust seeks to achieve its corporate and social objectives by focusing on 
the following areas:
Equal Opportunities, Diversity, Inclusion and Human Rights
Liontrust has committed to the promotion of equal opportunities and the 
preservation of human rights. Liontrust is vehemently opposed to the use 
of slavery in all forms; cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments; and any 
attempt to control or reduce freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
Liontrust will not knowingly enter into any business arrangement with any 
person, company or organisation which fails to uphold the human rights 
of its workers or who breach the human rights of those affected by the 
organisation’s activities.
Liontrust has put in place a series of policies, including a recruitment policy, 
parental leave policy, and a discipline and grievance policy which aims to 
ensure that all partners/directors, employees and associated persons have 
equal opportunities.The Board recognises the importance of diversity, including 
gender and recognises the benefits it brings to the Board and Group. The 
Board is committed to ensuring its composition is appropriate for the business 
and that members and candidates should possess the broad range of skills, 
expertise, industry knowledge, and other experience necessary for the 
effective oversight and management of the Group.
Liontrust believes that its people should be appointed to their roles based 
on skills, merit and performance and makes all appointments within the 
guidelines of its equal opportunities policy. Fundamental to increasing diversity 
is the development of a pipeline of talented and diverse employees within the 
business. We do not support quotas or to set prescriptive, quantitative diversity 
targets however, we endeavour to have a proactive and coordinated approach 
to attracting, retaining and developing a diverse workforce. As at 31 March 
2016 the gender diversity within the group was as follows:
2016 Male Female
Directors 6 –
Members of LLP’s 28 2
Employees 21 18
Stewardship
Liontrust manages all investments using different proprietary investment 
processes, and the rationale around Environmental, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) issues depends on the underlying investment process. Good 
governance is important to all investment processes and so Liontrust 
are committed to the Financial Reporting Council’s Stewardship Code. 
Liontrust’s response to the stewardship code and how Liontrust complies 
with the responsibilities laid out in the code is available on our website: 
www.liontrust.co.uk. LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   21
Purchasing, Procurement and Bribery
Liontrust is committed to adhering to the highest standards of business 
conduct; compliance with the law and regulatory requirements; and best 
practice. The firm has established an anti-bribery policy to aid Liontrust’s 
partners/directors, employees and associated persons in ensuring that they 
comply at all times with relevant anti-bribery laws. In implementing this policy 
the firm demonstrates its commitment to preventing bribery, and establishing a 
zero-tolerance approach to bribery in all parts of the firm’s operations.
Liontrust is committed to procuring its works, goods and services in an 
ethically and environmentally sensitive way, yet with proper regard to its 
commercial obligations, ensuring that suppliers deliver to agreed timescales, 
quality and cost. Purchasing is undertaken in a manner that encourages 
competition, and offers fair and objective evaluation of offers from all potential 
suppliers. Any significant transaction or agreement is reviewed by the Board.
Environment and Sustainability
Liontrust believes that businesses are responsible for achieving good 
environmental practice and operating in a sustainable manner. We are 
therefore committed to minimising our environmental impact and continually 
improving our environmental performance as an integral and fundamental 
part of our business strategy and operating methods. Liontrust has put in 
place an environmental policy that details the key points of our strategy on 
the environment.
As part of our selection and review process, we encourage our suppliers, 
service providers and all business associates to do the same and where 
appropriate we have obtained the environmental policies of these 
counterparties. Not only is this sound commercial sense for all; it is also a 
matter of delivering on our duty of care towards future generations.
Environmental KPI’s
Commercial Waste
Liontrust aims, to minimise its commercial waste and to recycle as much of its 
commercial waste as possible, with any non-recyclable items being incinerated 
to produce energy. In the year to 31 March 2017, Liontrust recycled 6,030kg 
of materials saving 8,030kg of CO2 (year to 31 March 2016: 5,820kg, 
7,890kg CO2).
Emissions Intensity per member of staff
Using the most recent data available from our landlords, we have identified 
an emissions intensity per member of staff (employees and members) of 
1.6 tC02 per annum (2016: 1.6 tCO2 per annum).
The Health and Safety committee monitor the KPIs as part of their review of 
the ESG policy.
Social Responsibility
We are carrying out our community engagement through two 
major sponsorships, with three key objectives.
• Raise financial awareness and literacy throughout society
• Provide opportunities for vulnerable children and young people through 
sport, education and finance
• Wildlife conservation
Oxford United football club
Liontrust has been the principal partner of Oxford United football club since 
July 2015. We are supporting a wide range of community initiatives via the 
Oxford United Community Trust to work together to improve the lives of the 
people of Oxfordshire and along with the club’s Family Days. We have been 
developing projects to work with Oxford United Community Trust to support its 
four themes for community engagement:
• Sports participation and coaching
• Health and wellbeing
• Education, training and employment
• Social inclusion
ZSL London Zoo
We are proud to be supporting ZSL ’s Asiatic lion campaign, dedicated to 
protecting the last remaining lions that reside as a single population in Western 
India’s Gir National Forest. With Liontrust’s support, ZSL is actively working 
with local partners in a variety of ways to ensure the survival of this population 
of just over 500 Asiatic lions:
• Train zoo keepers and veterinarians at Sakkarbaug Zoo in lion care and 
welfare
• Improve training of local staff so they can safely transport lions and other 
dangerous animals away from populated areas
• Upgrade infrastructure to help care for the lions’ health and wellbeing
• Establish exhibits and education programmes for local communities and 
visitors to learn about lion conservation
• Train and equip rapid response teams to rescue and rehabilitate injured lions
In addition to their work in the field, ZSL opened a brand new conservation 
breeding centre, Land of the Lions, on 17 March 2016 at ZSL London Zoo. 
The exhibit was opened by HM The Queen, and its purpose is to ensure 
a ‘safety net’ against extinction as well as protecting the genetic viability 
of species.

to the maximum number of 4,547,155 Ordinary shares of 1 pence each 
(equivalent to approximately ten per cent of the issued share capital of the 
Company). This authority expires at this year’s Annual General Meeting of 
the Company or 9 December 2017 (whichever is the earlier). The maximum 
price that may be paid for an Ordinary share will be the amount that is equal to 
5 per cent above the average of the middle market prices shown in quotations 
for an Ordinary share in the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for 
the five business days immediately preceding the day on which that Ordinary 
share is purchased. The minimum price which may be paid for an Ordinary 
share is 1 pence.

Risks and uncertainties
A report on principal risks appears in the Strategic Review on pages 18 to 
21 and a report on the risk management and internal controls appear on 
pages 31 to 33.
Corporate social responsibility
Liontrust aims to be recognised as an organisation that is transparent and 
ethical in all its dealings as well as making a positive contribution to the 
community in which it operates. The Board recognises the Group’s impact, 
responsibilities and obligations on and towards society and aims to promote 
equal opportunities and human rights, reduce environmental risk and operate 
in a sustainable manner.
The Group is committed to the highest standards of business conduct. 
Policies and procedures are in place to facilitate the reporting of suspect and 
fraudulent activities, including money laundering and anti-bribery policies.
The Group’s health and safety policy aims, insofar as it is reasonably practical, 
to ensure the health and safety of all employees and other persons who may 
be affected by the Group’s operations and provide a safe and healthy working 
environment. The Group has a good record of safety.
Employees
The Group gives fair consideration to any application for employment 
from disabled persons, where the person can adequately fulfil the job’s 
requirements. Should any existing employee become disabled, the Group 
will aim to ensure, as far as is practicable, to provide continuing employment 
under normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career 
development to disabled employees.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments at 31 March 2017 comprise cash and cash 
equivalents, financial assets and receivable and payable balances that arise 
directly from its daily operations.
Receivables arise principally in respect of fees receivable on funds under 
management, cancellations of units in unit trusts and sales of units in unit 
trusts, title to which are not transferred until settlement is received. The 
Group’s credit risk is assessed as low.
Financial assets comprise assets held at fair value through profit or loss and 
assets held as available-for-sale.
Assets held at fair value through profit or loss are unit trust units held in the 
‘manager’s box’ to ease the calculation of daily creations and cancellations.
Assets held as available-for-sale are shares in the sub-funds of the Liontrust 
Global Funds Plc.
Cash flow is managed on a daily basis, both to ensure that sufficient cash is 
available to meet liabilities and to maximise the return on surplus cash through 
use of overnight and monthly deposits. The Group is not reliant on income 
generated from cash deposits.
Deposit banks are selected on the basis of providing a reasonable level of 
interest on cash deposits together with a strong independent credit rating 
from a recognised agency. Any banks selected for holding cash deposits are 
selected using a detailed counterparty selection and monitoring policy which is 
approved by the Board.
Based on holding the financial instruments as noted above the Group does 
not feel subject to any significant liquidity risks.
Full details of the Group’s financial risk management can be found in note 2 
on page 68.
Post Balance Sheet date event
On 1 April 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of Alliance Trust 
Investments Limited. See note 25 on page 84.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements and the Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and 
Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the company and 
Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and financial statements 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s, 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 24 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge and belief:
• the Group and Company financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group 
and Company; and
• the Strategic Report contained on pages 6 to 21 includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is 
approved:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Group and Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director 
in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Group and Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
28   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Compliance with the provisions of the Code
The Company is committed to the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (September 2014) (the “Code”). During the year the Company has 
applied the main principles and complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Board
The Board is responsible for organising and directing the affairs of the 
Company and the Group in a manner that is in the best interests of the 
shareholders, meets legal and regulatory requirements and is also consistent 
with good corporate governance practices. There is a formal document setting 
out the way in which the Board operates, which is available upon request from 
the Company Secretary.
The division of responsibilities between Adrian Collins, Chairman, and John 
Ions, Chief Executive, has been clearly established by way of written role 
statements, which have been approved by the Board. The Chairman’s main 
responsibilities are to lead the Board, ensure that shareholders are adequately 
informed with respect to the Company’s affairs and that there are efficient 
relations and communication channels between management, the Board and 
shareholders, liaising as necessary with the Chief Executive on developments, 
and to ensure that the Chief Executive and his executive management 
team have appropriate objectives and that their performance against those 
objectives is reviewed.
The Chief Executive’s main responsibilities are the executive management 
of the Group, liaison with the Board and shareholders (as required by the 
Chairman), to manage the strategy of the Group, to manage the senior 
management team, oversee and manage the sales and marketing teams, and 
to be an innovator and facilitator of change. The Chief Executive discharges 
his responsibilities in relation to the executive management of the Group via 
two partnership management committees as detailed in the Risk management 
and internal controls report on page 31 to 33.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are responsible to the Board for the 
executive management of the Group and for liaising with the Board and 
keeping it informed on all material matters.
The Non-executive Director’s role has the following key elements:
• constructively challenging, and contributing to, the development of the 
strategy of the Company and the Group;
• scrutinising the executive management team’s performance in meeting 
agreed goals and objectives, and monitoring the reporting of performance 
to the Board;
• satisfying themselves that financial information is accurate and that financial 
controls and risk management systems are robust and defensible; and
• being responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration for 
executive directors and a prime role in appointing (and where necessary 
removing) senior management and in succession planning.
Under the Company’s articles of association, one third of the Directors must 
retire from office by rotation at each Annual General Meeting and may offer 
themselves for re-election (this does not include Directors appointed to 
the Board since the last Annual General Meeting). Under the Company’s 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, which reflect the provisions of the Code 
on Corporate Governance, Non-executive Directors must retire and may 
offer themselves for re-election annually once they have served nine or more 
years on the Board. The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that 
all Directors of FTSE 350 companies retire and are put up for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting. Although the Company is not a FTSE 350 
company; the Board considers this to be best practice and, accordingly, 
has decided to go beyond the requirements of the Company’s Corporate 
Governance Guidelines and articles of association and require that all Directors 
of the Company retire and offer themselves for re-election.
The Board met ten times during the year. In addition, there were occasions 
when the Directors met as a committee of the Board in order to authorise 
transactions already agreed in principle at Board meetings. On those 
occasions, a quorum of either two or three Directors was required.
Directors
Biographical details of all current Directors can be found on page 24.
There were no changes to the Board during the financial year and up to the 
date of the signing of the financial statements. Attendance at meetings of the 
Board and the Audit & Risk, Nomination and Remuneration Committees is 
shown in the table on page 34.
At all times during the year there have been at least three Non-executive 
Directors. The Board believes that the balance achieved between Executive 
and Non-executive Directors is appropriate and effective for the control and 
direction of the business.
The Chairman has met during the year with the Non-executive Directors both 
individually and collectively without the other Executive Directors.
Having duly evaluated each of the Non-executive Directors, the Board 
considers that, all such Directors are independent, in that they neither 
represent a major shareholder group nor have any involvement in the day to 
day management of the Company or its subsidiaries. As such they continue 
to bring objectivity and independent judgement to the Board and complement 
the Executive Directors’ skills, experience and detailed knowledge of the 
business.
None of the Executive Directors nor the Chairman are on the board of a FTSE 
100 company.
Non-executive Directors are aware that they have to report any change in their 
circumstances or those of the members of their families that might lead to the 
Board reconsidering whether they are independent. Directors are also aware 
that they have to inform the Board of any conflict of interest they might have in 
respect of any item of business and absent themselves from consideration of 
any such matter.
The Non-executive Directors have disclosed to the Company Secretary their 
significant commitments other than their directorship of the Company and 
have confirmed that they are able to meet their respective obligations to the 
Company.
Directors have the right to have any concerns about the running of the 
Company minuted and documented in a written statement on resignation.
The Company has arranged insurance cover in respect of legal action against 
its Directors and Officers.
Corporate Governance Report
LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   29 Corporate Governance Report continued
Performance
The Board conducts a formal review and rigorous evaluation of individual 
Directors, its own performance and that of its committees. The evaluation 
process is constructively used to improve Board effectiveness, maximise 
strengths and address any weaknesses. 
The Executive Directors have been subject to a formal performance appraisal. 
These appraisals were carried out in May 2017 and in all cases their 
performance was appraised as continuously effective. The performance of 
the Non-executive Directors during the year to 31 March 2017 has been 
reviewed by the Executive Directors. The review has confirmed that the 
performance of the Non-executive Directors is effective and appropriate.
In addition to the individual appraisals, the Board considers its overall 
performance as a body and of its committees. This review has confirmed that 
the performance of the Board and its committees is effective and appropriate.
Professional development and training
Every Director is entitled to receive appropriate training and guidance on 
their duties and responsibilities. Continuing professional development is 
offered to all Directors and the Board is given guidance and training on new 
developments, such as new regulatory requirements.
In order to promote awareness and understanding of the Group’s operations, 
the Chairman ensures there are additional opportunities for the Non-executive 
Directors to meet with senior management outside of the Board and 
its committees.
Communication with shareholders
The Chairman regularly meets with major shareholders and the Chief 
Executive and Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer also have 
regular meetings with existing and potential new shareholders. The views of 
the shareholder are conveyed to Non-executive Directors by the presentation 
at Board meetings of surveys of shareholder opinion carried out by the 
Group’s brokers and of analysts’ reports and also by feedback from the 
Executive Directors who regularly meet with shareholders.

30   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Risk Management and Internal Controls Report
LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   31
The Board is ultimately responsible for determining the risk appetite, risk 
strategy and risk management framework of the Group. The FCA have 
noted that it is for each individual firm to determine, based on its nature, scale 
and complexity, as well as its attitude to exposure to risk, whether or not to 
establish a Risk Committee of the governing body. The Group has determined 
not to establish a separate Risk Committee but to combine it with the Audit 
Committee, although this is reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, is accountable for, and 
responsible for, overseeing the Group’s financial reporting, risk management 
and system of internal controls, including suitable monitoring procedures, 
which are designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, is also responsible for keeping under review the scope, results, fees 
and the independence of the external auditors. 
The Head of Risk is responsible for overseeing all risk management of 
the Group and monitors the Group’s risks in a pro-active manner, with all 
departments fully aware of and managing the key risks appropriate to their 
responsibilities. All material risks to the business are monitored, appropriate 
mitigations for each risk are recorded and identified to the Board with markers 
for those with increased risk levels. Management recognise the importance 
of risk management and view risk management as an integral part of the 
management process which is tied into the business model and is described 
further in the Principal risks and mitigations section of the Strategic Report on 
pages 18 to 20.
Committee structure and delegation of powers
The Corporate Governance report on page 29 details the Board’s and the 
Chief Executive’s responsibilities for organising and directing the affairs of 
the Company. The Board has delegated a number of its powers to three 
subcommittees; the Audit & Risk Committee, the Nomination Committee and 
the Remuneration Committee.

received, cybersecurity and anti-bribery and corruption policies and procedures 
within Liontrust including the due diligence of third parties.
Portfolio Risk Committee
The Portfolio Risk Committee (“PRC”) oversees the management of portfolio 
risk throughout the business. This oversight encompasses portfolio risk 
management systems and operations together with the monitoring of portfolio 
risk investment restrictions. The PRC has documented the approach to risk 
management in the Risk Management Process document (“RMP”). The PRC 
also monitors portfolio performance and investment processes, establishing 
parameters for exception reporting and ensuring that appropriate client 
communications are prepared as necessary. 32   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

requirements of the Group’s staff.
There are Terms of Reference for all committees, setting out the way in 
which the meetings operate. The Terms of Reference are formally adopted 
by the Liontrust Board and are reviewed annually. Minutes are taken of 
each meeting and are circulated to the main board for review and challenge 
where appropriate.
Risk Management framework
In order to ensure that the Group regularly reviews and monitors all the 
potential areas of risk to the business, Liontrust has implemented a risk 
management framework which allows management, the Audit & Risk 
Committee and the Board to be kept fully informed of potential risks to the 
business and also how these risks would impact the group’s capital adequacy.

ICAAP ICAAP ICAAP Risk Register Risk Register Risk Register
There are two main elements to capturing and reviewing risk within the Group; 
the Risk Register and the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(“ICAAP”). The Risk Register records potential risks, their materiality and their 
likelihood of occurrence and is updated regularly with input from executives 
and function heads. The most material and likely risks from the complete 
Risk Register are reported to the main Board at each Board Meeting in a Key 
Risk Report. The ICAAP sets out the Group’s risk appetite for the different 
business areas and brings the Risk Register together with scenario analysis 
and stress testing to determine how the realisation of risks might impact on 
the Group’s financial position.
The Group breaks risk down into four main categories that feed into the Risk 
Register and the ICAAP: Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk and Other 
Risk. Further details of the risks are listed in the principal risks and mitigations 
section of the Strategic Report on pages 18 to 20. Each element of risk is 
formally reviewed by the Audit & Risk committee on a minimum of an annual 
basis, and the Group ensures appropriate controls are in place to manage 
these risks. 
The risk and uncertainties that affect the Group’s business can also be broken 
down into risks that are within the management’s influence and risks that are 
outside it. Risks that are within management’s influence include areas such 
as the expansion of the business, prolonged periods of underperformance, 
loss of key personnel, human error, poor communication and service leading 
to reputation damage and fraud. Risks outside the management’s influence 
include regulatory change, Brexit, falling markets, terrorism, a deteriorating UK 
economy, investment industry price competition and hostile takeovers.
Internal controls
The internal control system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The Group’s internal control 
system is based on a “three lines of defence” model summarised in the 
diagram below:

 Line of Defence
Liontrust’s Business Departments, supervised by the Partnership Committees, 
are responsible for identifying and managing risk and control activities within 
their business lines. This is the first line of defence. The Control Departments 
supervised by the Audit & Risk Committee develop and implement risk 
frameworks to support the front line and objectively challenge the identification 
of risk and the design of the controls within the business as a whole. The 
third line is a review of the risk and control activities in the Company by parties 
independent from the design, implementation and execution to highlight 
weaknesses, and provide assurance on the effectiveness and suitability of the 
internal controls. LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   33
The main elements of the Internal Controls which have operated throughout 
the year are as follows:
• a clear division of responsibilities and lines of accountability, allowing 
adequate supervision of staff;
• detailed procedures and controls for each department;
• the development and implementation of specific accounting policies;
• preparation of annual plans and performance targets in light of the overall 
Group objectives;
• reports from the Executive Directors to the Board on the actual 
performance against plans;
• reports from Internal Audit on the effectiveness of the Group’s systems and 
controls to the Board;
• reports from the Head of Risk highlighting the Principal risks faced by the 
Group detailing the exposures, controls and mitigations in place;
• reports from the Head of Compliance detailing the robustness of 
procedures and controls for each department;
• reports from the Head of Finance on controls and risks concerning client 
money and assets;
• reports from the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) detailing 
the arrangements in place for anti-money laundering and financial crime 
prevention;
• reports to the Board in respect of the management of, and results of visits 
to, third parties to whom functions have been outsourced;
• compliance by all members of staff with the Group’s policies and statement 
of business conduct, which seeks to ensure business is conducted in 
accordance with the highest standards; and
• capture and evaluation of failings and weaknesses and confirmation 
that necessary action is taken to remedy the failings, particularly those 
categorised as ‘significant’.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls for the financial year and up to the date of this annual report and 
financial statements. The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks affecting the business and has a process in place within the 
business to control and monitor risks on an ongoing basis, in accordance 
with the guidance from the Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on risk 
management, internal control and related financial and business reporting 
(‘GRM’) The Board is of the view that all necessary actions have been, or 
are being, taken to address matters identified as part of the ongoing risk 
management process and that no significant weaknesses were identified 
during the year.
Stakeholders and Key Contracts
Additionally the Group has a significant number of stakeholders whose future 
risks and uncertainties are linked to the Group. These significant stakeholders 
are: shareholders; clients; members; employees; service providers that provide 
the Group with outsourced functions; and industry bodies. 
Each of these groups presents different risks and uncertainties and the Group 
ensures that there is regular contact and monitoring of the various bodies. 
Outsourcing is an integral part of the Liontrust operating model. Recent 
changes in legislation and renewed interest by the FCA in the topic have 
prompted the documenting of how the model operates and determining if 
any changes are required within the new regulatory environment. Liontrust 
outsources in two key areas, Transfer Agency and Fund Accounting & Fund 
Valuation Services across two main jurisdictions. 
Transfer Agency
Liontrust appoints a trust company, bank or similar institution to maintain 
records of investors and account balances and transactions, to cancel and 
issue certificates, to process investor mailings and to deal with any associated 
problems.
Fund Accounting & Fund Valuation 
Liontrust appoints a trust company, bank or similar institution to perform 
Net Asset Value (“NAV”) calculations for each of the funds. The following 
services are also typically included in this service: processing of corporate 
actions and dividends, expense accrual management, cash management 
and reconciliation, calculation and timely payment of all management and 
performance fees, and preparation of interim and annual financial statements.
The table below details the companies that provide these outsourced 
functions:

Fund Valuation
UK International Financial Data 
Services Limited
State Street Bank & 
Trust Company
Ireland Northern Trust International 
Fund Administration Services 
(Ireland) Limited
Northern Trust International 
Fund Administration Services 
(Ireland) Limited
Liontrust has detailed service level agreements in place with these key 
outsource providers and they are closely monitored to ensure these standards 
are met. The Board have agreed a counterparty selection policy and has 
appropriate business continuity plans in place with details on monitoring, 
contingency and resilience plans for all counterparties.
Assurance process
The senior management arrangements, systems and controls environment 
in place across the Group are reviewed by the Board and Audit & Risk 
Committee each year. It was decided in 2016 that, given the growth and 
increased complexity of the business, it was appropriate for the Group to 
appoint an internal audit function and delegate much of the task of monitoring 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of its systems and controls to this 
internal audit function. The Audit & Risk Committee and the Internal Auditors 
have agreed a rolling three year Internal Audit plan. This includes the following 
Audit areas: front office controls; data protection, security and governance; 
risk management; significant financial systems; outsourcing arrangements 
and CASS. The Internal Auditors will also perform a full systems and controls 
review every three years.
On an annual basis, Liontrust commissions Deloitte LLP , an external 
accountancy firm, to perform testing of integrity of aspects of the Group-
wide control environment. Liontrust has adopted the principles established 
in the “Assurance Reports on internal controls of service organisations made 
available to third parties” as recommended by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of England and Wales in the March 2011 technical release of 
AAF 01/06. The results of this testing, including any exceptions identified, are 
made available to senior management, the Board, Audit & Risk Committee 
and our institutional customers as appropriate. Directors’ Board Attendance Report

Introduction by the Chairman of the Audit & 
Risk Committee
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Audit & Risk Committee (the “Committee”), I am pleased to 
present the Audit & Risk Committee report for the financial year ended 31 
March 2017.
The Committee’s principal duties are as follows: 
• assist the Board in its presentation of the Company’s financial results and 
position through its review of the interim and full year financial statements 
before approval by the Board, focusing on compliance with accounting 
principles and policies, changes in accounting practice and major matters of 
judgement;
• keep under review the effectiveness of the risk framework that is used 
to monitor Group’s system of internal controls and risk management 
systems, including suitable monitoring procedures for the identification, 
assessment, mitigation, monitoring and management of all risks including 
liquidity, market, regulatory, credit, legal, operational and strategic risks, with 
particular emphasis on the Principal risks faced by the Company, which 
are designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss;
• review and recommend to the Board for approval, the Company’s Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) to fulfil its regulatory 
obligations under the Capital Requirements Directive and assess whether 
the Pillar 2 assessments and Pillar 3 disclosures remain appropriate;
• review periodically and monitor the Company’s procedures for ensuring 
compliance with regulatory and financial reporting requirements, including 
whistle blowing arrangements, its relationship with the relevant regulatory 
authorities, arrangements for the deterrence, detection, prevention and 
investigation of fraud, and to receive and consider special investigation 
reports relating to fraud or major breakdowns in internal controls or major 
errors and omissions including remedial action by management; and
• keep under review the scope, results and cost effectiveness of the audit 
and the independence of the external auditors.
• consider annually whether there is a need for an internal audit function and 
make a recommendation to the Board. 
The terms of reference of the Committee, which explain its role and the 
authority delegated to it by the Board of Directors, are published on the 
Company’s website or are available upon request from the Company 
Secretary. 
This introduction is intended to provide a summary of key events during 
the year from a Committee perspective and to give further insight into the 
workings of the Committee and its approach. 
During the year, a significant proportion of the Committee’s time was spent 
reviewing the Group’s system of risk management and internal control; the 
integrity of financial reporting; and the effectiveness of the Group’s Finance, 
Risk and Compliance functions, and external audit. The Committee’s focus 
was on the continuing appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting. 
In particular this included the significant financial judgements taken in the 
financial year ended 31 March 2017, and the ongoing assessment of risks 
faced by the business and management’s response to these risks.
Composition and attendance
During the year, the Committee comprised of independent Non-executive 
Directors:
• Alastair Barbour (Chairman)
• Mike Bishop
• George Yeandle
The attendance record of members of the Committee during the year is 
shown in the table on page 34.
All of the Committee’s members who served during the year are considered 
by the Board to be appropriately experienced and sufficiently qualified to fulfil 
their duties. The Board considers Alastair Barbour to have recent and relevant 
financial experience.
The Committee members’ profiles are set out in full in the Board members’ 
biographies.
The Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Head of Compliance 
and Financial Crime, Head of Finance and Head of Risk were regular 
attendees at the Committee meetings and reported on their respective areas. 
The external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , attended the meetings 
following the half and full year ends and met privately with the Committee.

Audit & Risk Committee Report continued
Activities during the year
The Committee has a formal programme of issues which it covers during 
the year. This programme is formulated by the Committee Chairman and the 
Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer and is designed to ensure 
that all matters that fall within the Committee’s remit are reviewed during 
the year. The Committee has access to external independent advice at the 
Company’s expense. 
In respect of the financial year to 31 March 2017, the Committee met 5 times 
and discussed, amongst other things, the subjects described below: 
• Reviewing the annual financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2017 and half year financial statements for the six months to 
30 September 2016 with particular emphasis on their fair presentation, 
the reasonableness of judgements made and the valuation of assets 
and liabilities;
• The appropriateness of the accounting policies used in drawing up the 
Group’s financial statements;
• Review of the Group’s governance, risk framework, risk management, risk 
management processes and related policies;
• Consideration of the external auditors’ report on the financial year ending 
31 March 2017 audit and discussion of their findings with them;
• Consideration of the external auditors’ report on the half year ending 
30 September 2016 audit and discussion of their findings with them;
• Consideration and approval of the external audit plan for 2017;
• Review and approval of the Group’s ICAAP;
• Consideration and approval of the external auditor’s 2016 CASS audit 
report and a review of the new CASS Assurance Standard for 2017 
onwards;
• Review of the Group’s compliance monitoring programme, compliance 
manual (including whistle blowing arrangements), annual anti-money 
laundering report;
• Review and discussion of regular reports on financial reporting, key risks, 
compliance and financial crime from the Head of Finance, Head of Risk 
and Head of Compliance & Financial Crime;
• Review of reports and assessments relating to the following:
 o Anti-Money Laundering;
 o Bribery Risk Assessment 
 o Systems and Controls Gap Analysis;
 o Cyber-security risk assessment
 o Client Money and Annual Client Money Audit review; and
 o  Money Laundering Reporting Officer’s Annual Report which includes a 
Financial Crime & Money Laundering Assessment;
• Review of the Type 2 AAF 01/06 report on the Group’s control 
environment;
• Review of the annual Systems and Controls Review Report for the Group;
• Assessment of the performance, independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors; 
• A review of fees for non-audit services carried out by the external auditors; 
and
• Review of the Committee’s terms of reference.
Significant accounting matters
During the year the Committee considered key accounting issues, matters 
and judgement in relation to the Group’s financial statements and disclosures 
relating to:
i) Revenue recognition 
The risk of recognising revenue in incorrect periods via management 
manipulation is significant in that revenue levels may affect management’s 
levels of remuneration and incentivisation. Risks of such manipulation are 
heightened where there is judgement applied in calculation or recognition 
of revenue. Any such calculations are subject to internal approvals and sign 
offs and are subject to independent verification. Revenue is recognised 
in accordance with the accounting policy on Note 1m) on page 67. The 
Committee discussed recognition of revenue with management and 
questioned them on the application of the group’s accounting policy with 
particular emphasis on fee income, performance fees and profits from 
dealing in unit trusts. Revenue recognition was also a key focus for the 
auditors and they reported to the Committee on their work and findings.
ii) Risk of management override of controls 
International Standards on Auditing (‘ISA’s’) require that this is identified as 
a significant risk by our auditors and, as such, it is treated as a significant 
risk by the Committee. Management have the potential to manipulate 
accounting records and financial reports by overriding controls. Reported 
financial information is regularly reviewed and discussed by the Committee 
and the Board with any significant deviations from expectations being 
queried. Findings from the audit are discussed with the external auditor.
iii) Share based payments 
Share based payments are a focus for the Committee in view of the 
complexity of accounting, interpretation of the reporting standard and 
valuation of awards. The Committee receives information and explanations 
from management which is discussed with them and the auditors, taking 
into account the results of their audit work.
Internal audit
As part of its annual review of systems and controls, the Committee 
considered whether to establish a separate internal audit function. It was 
decided that, given the growth and increased complexity of the business, 
it was appropriate for the Group to appoint an internal audit function 
and delegate much of the task of monitoring the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of its systems and controls to this internal audit function. After 
a rigorous selection process, Minerva Management Consulting Limited 
(“Minerva” or “Internal Auditor”) were appointed as the Group’s internal 
auditors with a direct reporting line to the Head of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The Committee believe that using an external firm will ensure 
that the internal audit function will be adequately resourced and staffed by 
competent individuals and be independent of the day-to-day activities of the 
firm whilst still having appropriate access to a firm’s records. The Committee 
and the Internal Auditors have agreed a rolling three year Internal Audit plan. 
This includes the following Audit areas: front office controls; data protection, 
security and governance; risk management; significant financial systems; 
outsourcing arrangements and CASS. The Internal Auditors will also perform a 
full systems and controls review every three years.
The Committee regularly meets with Minerva, with and without management 
present, throughout the year to receive updates and to review its findings. 
Each year the Committee considers the performance and scope of the 
Internal Auditors prior to the commencement of the next year’s internal audit 
programme to ensure they remain consistent with the Group’s requirements. LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   37
External auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) are the Group’s external auditors and 
were re-appointed following a tender of the audit during 2015. Each year they 
present to the Committee the proposed scope of their full-year audit plan. This 
includes their assessment of the material risks to the Group’s audit and their 
proposed materiality levels, for the Committee’s discussion and agreement.
The Committee meets regularly with the external auditors without 
management present. The audit engagement partner attends the committee 
meetings at which the half yearly and annual reports are reviewed. Each year, 
the Committee considers the performance of the external auditors prior to 
proposition of a resolution on their reappointment and remuneration at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Based on the satisfactory conclusions of the work described above carried 
out by the Committee to assess the performance of the external auditors 
and safeguard their independence, the Committee has recommended this 
to the Board. The Board has accepted the Committee’s recommendation 
a resolution will be proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting for the 
reappointment of PwC as external auditors.
Non-audit services
The Committee has developed and implemented a policy and guidelines 
on use of non-audit services from the external auditors to safeguard the 
objectivity and independence of the external auditors. This policy has been 
approved by the Board. The policy provides that provision of certain types 
of non-audit services are allowed (“Allowed Services”), whilst others are 
not permitted under any circumstances (“Prohibited Services”). Prohibited 
Services are those where the Committee considers that the possibilities of a 
threat to auditor independence is high.
Allowed Services are those considered to have a low threat to auditor 
independence. Nonetheless, Allowed Services still need the Committee’s 
approval if the expected fee exceeds £25,000. The policy also sets out 
certain disclosures the external auditors must make to the Committee, 
restrictions on employing the external auditors’ former employees, partner 
rotation and the procedures for approving non-audit services provided by the 
auditors. The policy is reviewed regularly and updated to ensure compliance 
with all applicable regulations such as the new EU audit reform regulation.
During the year, the external auditors were, on a number of occasions, 
engaged as advisers. The range of non-audit services provided included 
tax compliance services, and technical support in relation to employee and 
member incentivisation services. The Committee is satisfied that the external 
auditors were best placed to provide these services because of their familiarity 
with the relevant areas of Group’s business and that there are no matters that 
would compromise the independence of the external auditors or affect the 
performance of their statutory duties. The Committee receives a regular report 
setting out the non-audit services provided by the external auditors during the 
year and the fees charged. Details of fees paid to the auditors can be found 
in Note 6 of the financial statements on page 74. The non-audit services as 
identified in Note 6 have all complied with the policy as detailed above.

• George Yeandle
The attendance record of members of the Committee during the year is

and discussed, amongst other things, the subjects described below:
• reviewed the size and composition of the Board including reviewing 
Board diversity;
• renewal process for the appointment to Board committees and confirmation

Time commitment
As part of the review of the time required of Non-executive Directors to 
discharge their responsibilities, the Committee noted that:
• Alastair Barbour, on account of being on the boards of a number of 
public companies listed in the UK and/or Bermuda and chairing the audit 
committee for all, has provided an analysis of his work commitments to the 
Committee, which shows the level of time commitment required for certain 
of his other roles and the complementary nature of his roles and the time 
committed to Liontrust; and 
• Adrian Collins, on account of being the Non-executive Chairman of the 
Company and being on the boards of a number of public companies 
listed in the UK, has provided an analysis of his work commitments to 
the Committee, which shows the relatively low level of time commitment 
required for certain of his other roles and the time committed to Liontrust. 
The Committee and Board confirmed their satisfaction with the time and 
overall commitment given to Liontrust by Mr Barbour and Mr Collins and all 
other Directors.
Diversity
The Committee considers diversity when looking to appoint additional Directors. 
It is a prerequisite that each Director or proposed Director must have the skills, 
experience and character to contribute both individually and as part of the Board, 
to the effectiveness of the Board and the success of the Company and Group. 
Subject to this overriding principle, the Board believes that diversity, amongst its 
members, including gender diversity, is of great value and it is the Board’s policy 
to give careful consideration to issues of overall Board balance and diversity, in 
making new appointments to the Board. The Company currently has no female 
Directors and the Committee aims to recommend the appointment and to 
increase the number of female Directors if appropriate candidates are available 
when Board vacancies arise.
The Company operates a policy of equal opportunity, details of which can be 
found in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of the Strategic Report.

14 June 2017 Remuneration Report
40   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Introduction by the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”), I am pleased to 
present the Remuneration report for year ended 31 March 2017.
Our full Directors’ remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders 
in February 2016 with 96% of votes in favour, is available on the Company’s 
website (in the Investor Relations section) and we have therefore only included 
the policy’s Elements of reward table in this year’s report.
The Annual report on remuneration outlines how our policy has been 
implemented in financial year ended 31 March 2017 and how we intend to 
implement it in the financial year ending 31 March 2018. As noted in my 
report last year I am committed to increased openness and consultation on 
remuneration matters and have ensured there is greater transparency of, and 
weighting to, performance and outcomes and how this effects annual bonus/
variable allocation in this year’s report. The Annual report on remuneration 
and this letter will be subject to an advisory vote at our 2017 Annual General 
Meeting, to be held on 12 September 2017. Note that no changes are being 
proposed to the remuneration policy.
The Committee is charged with determining remuneration policy for, and 
setting pay and other benefits of, the Executive Directors of the Company and 
reviewing pay and other benefits of the Group’s members and employees. 
All its recommendations are referred to the Board. Any Director, who has an 
interest in the matter which is the subject of a recommendation to the Board, 
abstains from the Board’s vote in relation to that matter and takes no part in 
its deliberations. The Committee may use external advisors if required. The 
terms of reference of the Committee, which explains its role and the authority 
delegated to it by the Board, are available on the Company’s website or upon 
request from the Company Secretary.
This introduction is intended to provide a summary of key events during 
the year from a Committee perspective and to give further insight into the 
workings of the Committee and its approach.
The Committee considered the Group’s overall performance in the financial 
year ended 31 March 2017 and the impact of awards under the L TIP on total 
remuneration when assessing Executive Directors’ annual bonus/variable 
allocation for the financial year ended 31 March 2017 and L TIP allocations for 
the financial year ended 31 March 2018.
Over the past year the Group has continued the excellent progress made in 
previous years in:
• executing its business strategy, in particular, increased Offshore assets 
under management (“AuM”) by 85%, Multi-Asset AuM by 77%, and 
broadened the product range by having completed the acquisition of the 
European Income fund management business of Argonaut Capital Partners 
LLP which added £272 million of AuM, and announced the acquisition of 
Alliance Trust Investments Limited, which completed on 1 April 2017 and 
added £2,518 million of AuM;
• increasing profitability (on an adjusted basis) by 18%;
• increasing profitability (on an adjusted basis excluding performance fee 
profits) by 30%;
• increasing assets under management by 36%
• increasing net inflows by 89%; and
• increasing dividends to shareholders by 25% (in pence per share terms)
All this, is in a challenging operating environment for fund managers 
with many fund management companies reporting net outflows. These 
achievements alongside performance against the key performance indicators 
set by the Committee for the Executive Directors (see the Annual report on 
remuneration for further details) are an important consideration in relation to 
the overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors, and have been 
reflected when determining the Executive Directors’ overall remuneration 
package and can be summarised as follows:
• Salary/fixed allocation to increase by 5%, the first increase in base 
remuneration for the Executive Directors for three years, and compares 
with an increase of 12% for the average employee/member over the 
same period and retail price index of 5.7% over the period March 2014 to 
March 2017;
• Pension/cash payments in lieu of pension for the Executive Directors to 
remain unchanged at 10% salary/fixed allocation for the financial year 
ending 31 March 2018;
• Annual bonuses and/or variable allocations to the Executive Directors of 
between 258% and 416% of base remuneration, with the cash element 
for John Ions capped at 200% of salary/fixed allocation. Between 
50% and 52% of the award deferred into Group managed funds, in 
consideration of EU regulations (including AIFMD and UCITS V), which 
vest over a three year period. This represents a 15% increase in the 
aggregate annual bonus/variable allocation pool for the Executive Directors, 
which when compared with the 30% increase in Adjusted Profit before tax 
(excluding performance fee profits) supports the aim of the Committee to 
restrict the change in the aggregate bonus/variable allocation pool for the 
Executive Directors to 50% of the change in Adjusted Profit before tax 
(excluding performance fee profits) for above target performance; 
• L TIP awards of 250% and 175% of base annual remuneration for 
John Ions and Vinay Abrol respectively, for the financial year ended 
31 March 2018, and will make these awards as soon as possible after 
the announcement of the Company’s annual results; and
• Base fees for the Non-executive Directors of the Company are to remain 
unchanged for the financial year ending 31 March 2018.
The Committee believes that the level of annual bonus/variable allocation and 
L TIP awards are commensurate with the exceptional corporate and personal 
performance of the Executive Directors over the financial year ended 31 
March 2017, please see the Annual report on remuneration for further details. 
Two important components of the Company’s remuneration policy are 
requiring a strong alignment between shareholders and the Executive 
Directors by requiring the Executive Directors to build up and retain a 
significant shareholding in the Company (2.5x salary/fixed allocation) and 
the significant deferral of variable remuneration. I am pleased to be able to 
confirm that John Ions and Vinay Abrol each have over 10x salary/fixed 
allocation in Ordinary shares and each are subject to the deferral of 70% of 
variable remuneration.
The annual bonus/variable allocation for all employees and members including 
the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 March 2017, which is 
capped at 30% of pre-cash bonus/variable allocation Adjusted Profit before

Directors’ remuneration policy
This section of the Remuneration report provides an overview of the key 
remuneration elements in place for Executive Directors. After the strong 
support received from shareholders at the 24 February 2016 General Meeting 
at which the revised Directors’ remuneration policy was approved, we have 
not made any changes to our remuneration policy and as such remain bound 
by the policy. We have not reproduced the full policy report in this report. 
The below presents our approved Elements of reward table for Executive 
Directors’ and Non-executive Directors’ for reference. A copy of our full 
Directors’ remuneration policy as approved by shareholders can be found in 
the February 2016 Notice of General Meeting, on pages 13 to 20 (available 
on our website: www.liontrust.co.uk in the Report & Accounts sub-section of 
the Investors Relation section).
Elements of reward
The following table summarises each of the elements of Liontrust’s total compensation package and the ongoing remuneration policy for the Executive Directors:
Objective and Link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Performance measures 
and assessment
Base salary or Fixed 
allocations
To provide a satisfactory base 
salary/fixed allocation within 
a total package comprising 
salary/fixed allocation and 
bonus/variable allocation. The 
level of salary/fixed allocation 
broadly reflects the value of the 
individual, their role, skills and 
experience. It is also designed 
to attract and retain talent in the 
market in which the individual is 
employed and/or a member.
Salaries and fixed allocations are 
reviewed annually effective in 
April taking account of market 
levels, corporate performance, 
individual performance and 
levels of increase for the broader 
employee/member population. 
Reference is made to median – 
upper quartile levels within the 
FTSE and industry comparators.
There is no guaranteed or 
maximum annual increase. The 
Committee considers it important 
that base salary and fixed 
allocation increases are kept under 
tight control given the potential 
multiplier effect of such increases 
on future costs. The Committee 
will aim to keep, on a rolling five 
year basis, base salaries/fixed 
allocations in line with the cost 
of living.

Performance measures 
and assessment
Annual bonus or 
variable allocation
The annual bonus or variable 
allocation rewards good 
performance of the Group and 
individual Executive Director and 
is based on the Group’s profits, 
which is considered one of the 
most prominent KPIs.
The annual bonus pool or variable 
allocation pool is based on a 
percentage of the Group’s pre-
cash bonus/variable allocation 
Adjusted Profit before tax. The 
Committee believes that this 
ensures that annual bonuses or 
variable allocations are affordable. 
Annual bonus/variable allocation 
payments to Executive Directors 
are made from this aggregate 
annual bonus/variable allocation 
pool in which all employees and 
members participate and which 
is approved by the Committee 
each year. The actual level of 
annual bonus/variable allocation 
payment to the individual 
Executive Director takes into 
account a number of factors 
relating to the individual’s role and 
performance from both a personal 
and corporate perspective. In 
addition, the Committee will also 
apply further measures such 
as assets under management, 
gross/net flows, cost control, 
corporate governance and risk 
management. Details of the 
performance metrics used to 
measure performance in each 
financial year will be disclosed 
where appropriate in the annual 
report on remuneration. The 
structure of the annual bonus 
or variable allocation is reviewed 
annually at the start of the 
financial year to ensure that it 
is appropriate and continues to 
support the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee will determine 
how much of the bonus/variable 
allocation is deferred into funds.
Liontrust does not explicitly link 
total incentive awards to a multiple 
of base salary or fixed allocation 
or cap total awards to individuals 
but it should be noted that the 
aggregate annual bonus and 
variable allocation pool for all 
employees and members including 
Executive Directors is capped. This 
is to ensure that high performers 
can be rewarded in line with the 
market on a total cash (salary/
fixed allocation plus bonus/
variable allocation) basis. This 
also reduces the need to increase 
base salaries/fixed allocations 
and thereby increase fixed costs. 
The aggregate pool is capped at 
no more than 30% of pre-cash 
bonus/variable allocation Adjusted 
Profit before tax. There will also 
be an individual cap for Executive 
Directors in relation to the cash 
element of the annual bonus/
variable allocation of 200% of 
salary/fixed allocation, in order 
to increase deferral potential 
and place more value at risk for 
the Executive Directors. The 
Committee will review these caps 
after three years to ensure that 
they remain appropriate. Due to 
the nature of the factors used 
by the Committee to determine 
level of annual bonus/variable 
allocation it is not possible to 
set out the minimum level of 
performance and any further levels 
of performance. However, annual 
bonuses/variable allocations will 
be conservative at threshold levels 
of corporate performance. The 
risk controls incorporated in the 
Group’s investment process and 
financial controls ensures that 
the uncapped annual bonus and 
variable allocations encourage both 
excellent performance and prudent 
risk management.
Individual risk and compliance 
behaviour is also considered 
in detail for relevant roles and 
factored into the assessment of 
performance and the determination 
of the bonus/variable allocation 
amount payable. The Chief 
Operating Officer & Chief Financial 
Officer, who is responsible for risk 
and compliance at board level, 
attends at least two Committee 
meetings each year to provide 
input on risk and compliance. 
A claw back principle applies to 
the annual bonus and/or variable 
allocations. This enables the 
Committee to recoup annual 
bonus or variable allocations in the 
exceptional event of: misstatement 
or misleading representation of 
performance, a significant failure 
in risk management and control, or 
serious misconduct of an individual. LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   43

Deferred Bonus and 
Variable Allocation 
Plan (“DBVAP”)
The DBVAP provides a deferral 
element to annual bonuses 
and variable allocations, to 
ensure a link to longer term 
performance and to align the 
interests of Executive Directors 
with shareholders.
The DBVAP offers deferral into 
Liontrust funds, in line with the 
current regulatory landscape 
and to create alignment directly 
with core business performance. 
Release will occur annually 
over three years (subject to a 
continuing employment and/or 
membership requirement). The 
Committee may award dividend/
distribution equivalents on 
Liontrust funds to the extent that 
awards are released.
Awards under the DBVAP are 
compulsory and are calculated 
on a formulaic basis such that a 
proportion of annual bonuses or 
variable allocations take the form 
of an award under the DBVAP , 
subject to an individual cap for 
Executive Directors in relation to 
the cash element of the annual 
bonus/variable allocation of 
200% of salary/fixed allocation. 
The deferred amount will be a 
minimum of 33.3% of the (total) 
annual bonus/variable allocation, 
subject to the cap on the cash 
bonus and variable allocation as 
detailed above.
No further performance conditions 
apply to DBVAP awards as, in 
determining the original annual 
bonus or variable allocation 
amount, the Committee has 
been satisfied that performance 
objectives have been met. 44   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

Long Term Incentive 
Plan (“L TIP”)
The L TIP is intended to provide 
long term reward, incentivise 
strong performance and retain 
the Executive Directors. Vesting 
will be subject to a continuing 
employment/membership 
requirement and performance 
conditions which are linked to 
the Company’s strategy/KPIs.
L TIP awards are granted annually 
and vesting is dependent on the 
achievement of performance 
conditions (including a 
shareholding requirement). 
Performance is measured over a 
three-year period. The operation 
of the L TIP is reviewed annually 
to ensure that grant levels, 
performance criteria and other 
features remain appropriate 
to the Company’s current 
circumstances. Awards will then 
be released on a staggered basis 
over five years as follows:
•  60% will be released 
immediately on vesting, three 
years after grant;
•  20% will be released four years 
after grant; and
•  20% will be released five years 
after grant.
The Committee may award 
dividend equivalents on shares to 
the extent that they vest.
The maximum annual award 
which can be made under the 
L TIP relating to any financial year 
is equal to 250% of base salary/
fixed allocation (based on the 
market value at the grant date). At 
target performance 20% of the 
award vests.
Awards are subject to continued 
employment and achievement of 
a range of balanced and holistic 
performance conditions that are 
linked closely to the Company’s 
business strategy/KPIs. The 
current performance criteria are 
total shareholder return (40%), 
earnings per share (30%) and 
other strategic objectives (30%) 
which include net inflows, growth 
in assets under management, 
fund performance and other 
strategic measures. There is also a 
shareholding requirement of 2.5x 
salary/fixed allocation for Executive 
Directors that is linked to L TIP 
awards as follows: 
•  if the target shareholding is met 
on the vesting date of the first 
L TIP award (i.e. three years from 
the grant date) then this award 
will vest in full; 
•  if less than 50% of the target 
shareholding is met then the first 
award will lapse in full; 
•  if between 50% and 100% 
is met, vesting will be scaled 
back proportionately on a 
straight-line basis; 
•  participants will be required 
to build up and retain at 
least one-third of their target 
shareholding within 12 months 
of the date of grant of the first 
award and must maintain at least 
50% of the target during the 
following two-year period. Failure 
to do so will impact the grant of 
subsequent awards; 
•  for subsequent L TIP awards, 
vesting is conditional on the 
target shareholding level being 
maintained; and
•  the shareholding requirement 
can be satisfied through 
unexercised options under 
the Company’s existing long 
term incentive plans, shares 
acquired through own resources 
and/or the deferral of annual 
bonuses/variable allocation into 
Company shares. LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   45

Share Incentive 
Plan (“SIP”)
The SIP allows the Executive 
Directors to purchase Company 
shares with a matching 
element, to build up an interest 
in Company shares and 
increase alignment of interests 
with shareholders.
An all-employee HMRC approved 
share plan that allows the 
Executive Directors to purchase 
shares, in a tax efficient manner 
and subject to limits, which are 
matched by the Company. In line 
with the normal operation of a 
SIP envisaged by HMRC, there 
are no performance conditions on 
matching shares.
The maximum opportunity for 
benefits is defined by the nature 
of the benefit itself and the cost 
of providing it. As the cost of 
providing such insurance benefits 
varies according to premium rates 
and the cost of other benefits is 
dependent on market rates and 
other factors, there is no formal 
maximum monetary value.
No performance conditions apply.
Claw back provisions apply on 
matching shares during the vesting 
period in the event the recipient is 
a bad leaver.
Benefits To provide benefits which are 
appropriately competitive.
Executive Directors are entitled to 
a range of benefits including:
•  Private Medical Insurance
•  Life Assurance;
•  Disability Assurance; and
•  access to an 
Employee / Member 
Assistance Programme
Where relocation payments 
or allowances are paid it will 
be limited to 50% of salary/
fixed allocation. 
The maximum opportunity for 
other benefits is defined by the 
nature of the benefit itself and the 
cost of providing it. As the cost of 
providing such insurance benefits 
varies according to premium rates 
and the cost of other benefits is 
dependent on market rates and 
other factors, there is no formal 
maximum monetary value.
Not applicable.
Pension To provide competitive levels of 
retirement benefit
Executive Directors’ pension 
contributions are made at 
percentage of salary/fixed 
allocation into the Liontrust 
Group Pension Plan. Executive 
Directors have the choice 
of taking an equivalent cash 
payment/fixed allocation in lieu of 
pension contributions.
The current Executive Directors 
receive a contribution or cash 
equivalent payment equal to 15% 
of base salary or fixed allocation.

John Ions  John Ions has led the senior executive team to achieve continued strong investment outperformance, excellent financial 
results and nearly £0.5 billion net flows despite a challenging environment. In addition, further progress has been made on 
the key strategic objectives set by the Board to broaden our product range with the acquisitions of Argonaut's European 
Income business and Alliance Trust Investments Limited.
Alongside Vinay Abrol, led external shareholder relations, with positive feedback on strategy and performance from these 
meetings.
Led the recruitment of Ian Chimes as Head of Global Distribution.
Alongside Vinay Abrol, successfully led the process to acquire Alliance Trust Investments Limited from Alliance Trust Plc.
Vinay Abrol  Vinay Abrol has shown strong leadership of the Finance, Operations, Risk, Compliance, IT and HR functions. Delivered 
budget and cost controls in the financial year, and led the Group through the annual report and results cycle.
Alongside John Ions, led external shareholder relations, and also led the initiative to have greater engagement with the Proxy 
Voting Agencies. Vinay has been instrumental in leading the Group's relationships with the Financial Analysts, with Canaccord 
Geniity initiating coverage during the financial year, bringing the total number of broker forms covering Liontrust to six.
Vinay Abrol successfully led the integration project to bring the Argonaut European Income funds on to the Liontrust platform 
and the pre-completion integration project for the Alliance Trust Investments Limited acquisition. Alongside John Ions, 
successfully led the process to acquire Alliance Trust Investments Limited from Alliance Trust Plc.

Around Threshold 
Below Threshold The Committee has used the above performance outcomes of Above Target 
performance to approve annual bonuses/variable allocations to the Executive 
Directors of between 258% and 416% of base remuneration, with between 
50% and 52% deferred into Group managed funds. This represents a 
15% increase in the aggregate annual bonus/variable allocation pool for the 
Executive Directors, which when compared to the 30% increase in Adjusted 
Profit before tax (excluding performance fee profits) supports the aim of the 
Committee to keep the change in the aggregate bonus/variable allocation 
pool for the Executive Directors to 50% of the change in Adjusted Profit 
before tax (excluding performance fee profits).
John Ions’ cash bonus has been capped at 200% of salary/fixed remuneration, 
and for the year ended 31 March 2017, between 52% (for John Ions) and 
50% (for Vinay Abrol) of the annual bonus/variable allocation has been deferred 
(2016: 46%) into Group managed funds and deferred over the period 1 April 
2017 to 31 March 2020 and therefore linked to the performance of the relevant 
Group managed funds. The vesting of DBVAP Awards are not subject to any 
performance condition, but are subject to continuous service conditions.
In determining the Annual bonus/variable allocations for the Executive 
Directors, the allocation of awards under the L TIP for the financial year ending 
31 March 2018 (see below) has been taken into consideration in terms of 
total variable remuneration for the Executive Directors. There is no vesting of 
awards previously granted under the L TIP until 2019.
LTIP awards
The Company’s shareholders approved the L TIP on 24 February 2016 and 
the L TIP was adopted by the Board on 21 March 2016. The rules of the 
L TIP state that awards may be granted to participants within the 42 day 
period following the date of publication of the annual results of the Company, 
approval of the L TIP by shareholders, or such other period as may be 
determined by the Committee in exceptional circumstances.
L TIP awards for the financial year ending 31 March 2018 will be 250% and 
175% of base annual remuneration for John Ions and Vinay Abrol respectively 
and will be awarded later within a 42 day period following the date of the 
preliminary announcement of the Company’s annual results for the financial 
year ended 31 March 2017.
L TIP awards are subject to continued employment and achievement of a range 
of balanced and holistic performance conditions that are linked closely to the 
Company’s business strategy/KPIs. The current performance criteria are:
• total shareholder return (40%);
• earnings per share (30%); and
• other strategic objectives (30%) which include net inflows, growth in assets 
under management, fund performance and other strategic measures.
There is also a shareholding requirement of 2.5x salary/fixed allocation for 
Executive Directors that is linked to L TIP awards as follows:
• if the target shareholding is met on the vesting date of the first L TIP award 
(i.e. three years from the grant date) then this award will vest in full;
• if less than 50% of the target shareholding is met then the first award will 
lapse in full;
• if between 50% and 100% is met, vesting will be scaled back 
proportionately on a straight-line basis;
• participants will be required to build up and retain at least one-third of their 
target shareholding within 12 months of the date of grant of the first award 
and must maintain at least 50% of the target during the following two-year 
period. Failure to do so will impact the grant of subsequent awards; 50   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Remuneration Report continued
• for subsequent L TIP awards, vesting is conditional on the target 
shareholding level being maintained; and
• the shareholding requirement can be satisfied through unexercised options 
under the Company’s existing long term incentive plans, shares acquired 
through own resources and/or the deferral of annual bonuses/variable 
allocation into Company shares.
Deferral of variable remuneration
The significant deferral of variable remuneration (deferral of bonus/variable 
allocation and L TIP awards) is an important component of the Company’s 
remuneration policy, and I am pleased to be able to confirm that John Ions and 
Vinay Abrol are each deferring 70% of their variable remuneration.

Annual bonus/variable allocation
Annual bonus/variable allocation for the financial year ending 31 March 2018 
will be determined using the same structure that was used in the financial year 
ended 31 March 2017. In summary, this will comprise:
• Financial Measures - Change in Adjusted Profit Before Tax (excluding 
Performance fees profits and Operating Margin);
• Non-Financial Measures - Distribution effectiveness, Net flows compared 
to budget, further broadening of International sales, further broadening of 
Multi-Asset sales, investment performance;
• Strategic Measures - Broadening the product range, talent management, 
risk management, compliance and conduct
The Committee sets ranges (“Target” and “Threshold”) around the agreed 
budget figures for the main financial measures and non-financial measures. 
There ranges consider the level of stretch in the budget and perceived 
potential for out-performance and under-performance. There will be disclosure 
of the ranges for the relevant performance metrics in the 2018 Annual 
report on remuneration as the Board consider the ranges to be commercially 
sensitive.
The results against the performance metrics will be determined using the 
same structure that was used in the financial year ended 31 March 2017. 
In summary, this will comprise of rating performance into one of five bands 
from Above Target to Below Threshold, with the Committee’s aim that Above 
Target performance will mean that the aggregate bonus pool for the Executive 
Directors will increase by 50% of the change in Adjusted Profit before tax 
(excluding performance fee profits).
L TIP awards
The Committee will determine the appropriate allocation for each Executive 
Director’s variable remuneration between annual bonus/variable allocation and 
L TIP awards taking into account regulatory requirements, market practice and 
the Committee’s aim of ensuring that a significant proportion of the relevant 
Executive Director’s variable remuneration is deferred into the Company’s 
shares and Group managed funds.

Dilution and employee benefit trust
Our policy regarding dilution from employee share awards and member 
incentivisation has been, and will continue to be, to ensure that dilution will be 
no more than 10% in any rolling ten year period.
The Committee intends to utilise the Company’s existing discretionary 
employee benefit trust (the “Employee Trust”) to reduce and manage dilution. 
The Employee Trust will have full discretion with regard to the application 
of the trust fund (subject to recommendations from the Committee). The 
Company will be able to fund the Employee Trust to acquire shares in the 
market and/or to subscribe for shares at nominal value in order to satisfy 
option awards granted under the L TIP , Liontrust Option Plan and DBVAP . 
Any shares issued to the Employee Trust in order to satisfy awards will be 
treated as counting towards the dilution mentioned earlier. For the avoidance 
of doubt, any shares acquired by the Employee Trust in the market will not 
count towards these limits. Share awards under the SIP and the DBVAP are 
satisfied by market purchased shares, so have no dilutive effect. 56   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

64   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
1 Principal accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, which comprise standards and 
interpretations issued by either the International Accounting Standards Board or the IFRS Interpretations Committee or their predecessors as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’), and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial information presented within these financial statements has been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost 
convention (except for the measurement of financial assets at fair value through profit and loss and financial assets available-for-sale which are held at their 
fair value). 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the directors of the Company to make judgements and assumptions (see note 1d) that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial information and the reported income and expense 
during the reporting periods. Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information. All accounting policies have 
been consistently applied. 
The financial information has been prepared based on the IFRS standards effective as at 31 March 2017. 
The Group did not implement the requirements of any Standards or Interpretations which were in issue and which were not required to be implemented at the 
year end date. 
The International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS Interpretations Committee have issued a number of new accounting standards, amendments to existing 
standards and interpretations. The following new standards are applicable to these financial statements, but do not have a significant impact. The Group plans to 
apply these standards in the reporting period in which they become effective. 
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative 
(effective date 1 January 2016)
These amendments clarify guidance in IAS 1 on materiality and aggregation, the presentation of 
subtotals, the structure of financial statements and the disclosure of accounting policies.
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment 
and IAS 38 Intangible Assets: Clarification of 
Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
(effective date 1 January 2016)
The amendment clarifies when a method of depreciation or amortisation based on revenue 
may be appropriate.
Annual improvements 2012 – 2014 cycle 
(effective date 1 January 2016)
This annual improvements cycle makes five minor amendments to existing standards.
The following standards and interpretations relevant to the Group that were not yet endorsed by the EU: 
Effective for periods beginning on or after
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS16 Leases 1 January 2019
The Group does not expect these updated standards to have any material effect on the Group when they are adopted, except for IFRS 16. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued on 13 January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 requires that all operating leases in excess of one year, where 
the Group is the lessee, are included on the Group’s balance sheet. The Group will be required to recognise a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability 
(representing the obligation to make lease payments). The ROU asset will be amortised on a straight-line basis with the lease liability being amortised using the 
effective interest method. IFRS 16 contains optional exemptions for both short-term leases (leases of less than 12 months) and for small-value leases. The 
Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement and the entity 
adopting IFRS 15 at the same time. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 on its financial statements. 
b) Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group has control of an entity if, and only if it has all of the following: 
– Power over the entity; 
– exposure, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and 
– the ability to use its power over the entity to affect its returns. 
The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an entity, including: the purpose and design of an entity, its 
relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential voting rights. There is no fixed minimum percentage at which the Group 
consolidates, and each exposure is reviewed individually. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
Uniform accounting policies are applied across all Group entities. Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between 
Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated 
on consolidation.  LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   65
1 Principal accounting policies (continued)
c) Adjusted profit or loss 
The Group provides additional disclosure in the form of an adjusted profit/ loss note (note 7, page 74) in order to provide shareholders with a clearer indication of 
the profitability of the Group. The adjusted profit or loss is the total of Group profit or loss excluding the following items: 
Non-cash items which include depreciation, intangible asset amortisation and IFRS2 related expenses; and 
Non-recurring items which include cost reduction expenses, professional services (restructuring, acquisition related and other), integration costs, share 
incentivisation expenses and severance compensation. 
The Group presents a reconciliation to the Profit for the year per the statutory financial information. 
d) Accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to 
exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are 
periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. The 
resulting accounting estimates may not equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities are set out as follows: 
Valuation and impairment of financial assets 
Details of the valuation policy for financial assets can be found in note 1i) below. 
Valuation and impairment of other assets 
Details of the valuation policy for other assets can be found in notes 1e) and 1h) below. 
Taxation 
Judgement is required in determining the total provision for income taxes. There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may 
be uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such 
differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. 
Acquisition of the the European income business of Argonaut Capital Partners LLP (the ‘acquisition’). (see note 13)
Determining whether a transaction is an acquisition of a business or a separately identifiable asset is a matter of significant judgement. It involves determining 
whether a particular set of assets and activities are capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant. Directors have considered 
all relevant aspects of the acquisition in conjunction with the guidance under the relevant accounting standards and concluded that the Argonaut acquisition was 
not an acquisition of a business because the assets purchased by the Group were not capable of being managed as a business in their own capacity. As such 
assets acquired have been recognised as intangible assets.
Employee share options 
Details of accounting policies relating to employee share options can be found on note 1p) below. 
e) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Leasehold improvements are included at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lower of the estimated useful life and the remaining 
lease term. 
Office equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is between three and ten years. 
Computer equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset which is three years. 
At each reporting date management reviews the assets’ residual values and useful lives, and will make adjustments if required. 
f) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables include prepayments as well as amounts the Group is due to receive from third parties in the normal course of business. These 
include fees as well as settlement accounts for transactions undertaken. These receivables are normally settled by receipt of cash. Trade and other receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value and then at amortised cost after deducting provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Prepayments arise where the Group pays 
cash in advance for services. As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expenses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.  66   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
1 Principal accounting policies (continued)
g) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables (excluding deferred income) represent amounts the Group is due to pay to third parties in the normal course of business. These 
include expense accruals as well as settlement accounts (amounts due to be paid for transactions undertaken). Trade payables are costs that have been billed, 
accruals represent costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at 
amortised cost. 
h) Intangible assets 
The costs of acquiring intangible assets such as fund management contracts are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits that are 
attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably. The assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
The fund management contracts are recorded initially at fair value and recorded in the consolidated financial statements as an intangible asset, they are then 
amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis over 5 years. The assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
i) Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale and loans and receivables. 
Financial assets are classified as available-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. After 
initial recognition, investments which are classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair value. Gains or losses, together with transaction costs, on available-
for-sale investments are recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in ‘other comprehensive income’ is included within ‘Realised gain/(loss) 
on sale of financial assets’ in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Assets categorised as available-for-sale are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period for impairment. 
Financial assets are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss if their carrying amounts will be recovered through continuing use. These financial assets 
consist of units held in the Group’s collective investment schemes as part of a ‘manager’s box (as detailed below) and assets held by the EBT in resepect of the 
Liontrust DBVAP . 
The Group holds the following assets at fair value through profit or loss: 
For the UK Authorised unit trusts, the units held in the ‘manager’s box’ are to ease the calculation of daily creations and cancellations of units. These box 
positions are not held to create speculative proprietary positions but are managed in accordance with specified criteria and authorisation limits. The units in the 
‘manager’s box’ are accounted for on a trade date basis. These units are valued on a bid price basis. 
Units in Liontrust UK Authorised unit trusts and shares in the sub funds of the Liontrust Global Funds Plc are held by the Liontrust EBT in respect of The 
DVBAP , the units and shares are accounted for on a trade date basis. The units are valued on a bid price basis. 
The Group holds the following assets as available-for-sale: 
The Group’s assets held as available-for-sale represent shares in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc as detailed in note 16 and are valued on a bid 
price basis. 
Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
j) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Under IFRS cash and cash equivalents are included in the consolidated cash 
flow statement. 
k) Own shares 
Own shares held by the Liontrust Asset Management Employee Trust and The Liontrust Members Reward Partnership LP are valued at cost and are shown as 
a deduction from the Group’s shareholders’ equity. No gains or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
l) Operating leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under 
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease.  LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   67
1 Principal accounting policies (continued)
m) Income and expenses 
Income and expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis when they become receivable or payable. The Group’s primary source of revenue is fee income 
from investment management activities. These fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of the assets under management (‘AuM’) and 
are recognised as the service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be received. Operating expenses represent the Group’s administrative expenses and 
are recognised as the services are provided. 
Front end fees received and commissions paid on the sales of units in unitised funds are amortised over the estimated life of the unit. 
Performance fees are recognised in the period in which they become due and collectable. Any portion of performance fees that are not due and collectable, and 
whose future entitlement is not certain, is not recognised but noted as a contingent asset. 
n) Taxation 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for, if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when 
the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities 
where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 
o) Pensions 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for its employees. The assets are invested with insurance companies and are held separately from the Group. 
The costs of the pension scheme are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred. The Group 
has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
p) Employee share options 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for 
equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense 
(and credited to equity reserves) over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed is determined at the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the 
options granted. A number of models have been used to calculate the fair value as follows: 
– Liontrust Option Plan (‘LOP’) 
A binomial model is used with the following assumptions having been made 
The fair value for each options is spread over the vesting period which is three years with an exercise price of 110.50 pence; 
The expected life of options issued under LOP is 6.5 years. 
The expected volatility has been calculated using historical daily data over a term commensurate with the expected life of the option and is 39.9% 
The risk-free interest rate has been based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds (UK strips) with a remaining term equal to the expected 
term and is 3.37%. No expected dividends have been factored into the model. 
– Liontrust Members Incentive Plan (‘LMIP’) with performance conditions 
A Monte Carlo simulation model is used with the following assumptions having been made: 
The fair value for each Incentive Capital Interest (‘ICI’) is spread over the vesting period which is 3 years with an exercise price of nil; 
The expected life of ICIs issued under this LMIP scheme is 10 years 
The expected volatility has been calculated for each plan using historical daily data over a term commensurate with the expected life of the ICIs and ranges 
from 28% to 40% 
The risk-free interest rate for each plan has been based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds (UK strips) with a remaining term equal to 
the expected term and ranges from 0.28% to 1.95%. No expected dividends have been factored into the model.  68   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

– Liontrust Deferred Bonus and Variable Allocation Plan (“DBVAP”) 
No fair value model is used. The shares are valued at initial cost 
– Liontrust Long Term Incentive Plan (‘L TIP’) with performance conditions attached 
A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to value the award with the following assumptions having been made: 
The fair value is spread over the vesting period which is 5 years with an exercise price of nil; 
The options are expected to be exercised at the point they become exercisable 
The risk-free interest rate has been based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds (UK strips) with a remaining term equal to the expected 
term. No expected dividends have been factored into the model. 
- Liontrust Members Reward Plan (‘LMRP’) with performance conditions attached 
A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to value the award with the following assumptions having been made: 
The fair value is spread over the vesting period which is 5 years with an exercise price of nil; 
The awards are expected to be exercised at the point they become exercisable 
The risk-free interest rate has been based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds (UK strips) with a remaining term equal to the expected 
term. No expected dividends have been factored into the model. 
q) Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the shareholders of the Company are recognised as a liability in the period during which they are declared. In the case of final dividends 
they are recognised as a liability in the period that they are declared and approved by shareholders. 
r) Holiday pay accrual 
Under IAS 19, all accumulating employee compensated absences that are unused at the balance sheet date are recognised as a liability. The Group’s 
entitlement period runs for the financial year and any employees with unused holiday allowance at the period end have no contractual entitlement to this. 
s) Foreign currency gains/losses 
Items in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (The ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling (‘£’) which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
t) Share Capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds. 
2 Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including price risk, cash flow interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk, 
liquidity risk and capital risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme understands the unpredictable nature of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
any potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses a number of analytical tools to measure the state of the business. The 
financial review on pages 14 to 17 of the Strategic Report identifies some of these measures. 
a) Market risk 
i) Price risk 
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the consolidated balance sheet as current 
financial assets (either held at fair value through profit or loss or held as available-for-sale). 
The Group holds the following types of investment as assets held at fair value through profit or loss or assets held as available-for-sale (see note 16): 
Operational investments 
1. Units in UK Authorised unit trusts; 
2. shares in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc. 
Investments held by the EBT 
1. Units in UK Authorised unit trusts; 
2. shares in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc. 
1 Principal accounting policies (continued) LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   69
2 Financial risk management (continued)
For UK Authorised unit trusts, the units held in the ‘manager’s box’ are to ease the calculation of daily creations and cancellations of units. These box positions 
are not held to create speculative proprietary positions but are managed in accordance with specified criteria and authorisation limits. The manager’s box for each 
fund is reviewed daily. If there is a negative box position then units are created to bring the box level positive. Three control levels of the manager’s box exist for 
each fund and each level is required to be signed off by progressively more senior staff. There are clearly defined maximum limits, over which manager’s box 
levels cannot exceed. 
The units in the ‘manager’s box’ are accounted for on a trade date basis. These units are valued on a bid price basis and held at fair value through profit 
and loss. 
For UK Authorised unit trusts, the units held in the EBT are selected as part of the DBVAP to align the interests of the Directors with the wider business. The 
units are accounted for on a trade date basis and valued on a bid price basis and held at fair value through profit and loss. 
The operational investment in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc, (an Ireland domiciled open ended investment company) have been undertaken as 
an investment to aid incorporation and will be redeemed when the sub funds grow in size. The Group has a regular review process for the investments which 
identifies specific criteria to ensure that investments are within agreed limits. 
For the shares in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc held in the EBT are selected as part of the DBVAP to align the interests of the Directors with the 
wider business. The shares are accounted for on a trade date basis and held at fair value through profit and loss. 
Management consider, based on historic information, that a sensitivity rate of 10% is appropriate. Based on the holdings in the Liontrust Global Funds at the 
balance sheet date a price movement of 10% would result in a movement in the value of the investment of £45,000 (2016: £13,000). Based on the holdings 
in the Liontrust Authorised Unit Trusts at the balance sheet date a price movement of 10% would result in a movement in the value of the investment of 
£95,000 (2016: £1,000). 
The Group monitors its investments with respect to its regulatory capital requirements and reviews its investments’ values with respect to overall Group capital on 
a monthly basis. 
ii) Cash flow interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from the fair value or future cash flows of adverse movements in interest bearing assets and 
liabilities and so reduce profitability. 
The Group holds cash on deposit in GBP . The interest on these balances is based on floating rates. The Group monitors its exposure to interest rate movements 
and may decide to adjust the balance between deposits on fixed or floating interest rates, or adjust the level of deposits. Management consider that given current 
interest rate levels a sensitivity rate of 1% is appropriate for GBP cash. Following a review of sensitivity based on average cash holdings during the year a 1% 
increase or decrease in the interest rate will cause a £195,000 increase or a decrease to nil in interest receivable (2016: £175,000 increase or decrease to nil). 
iii) Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to hold the 
minimum currency exposure required to cover operational needs and, therefore, to convert foreign currency on receipt. 
The Group is currently exposed to foreign exchange risk in the following areas: Investments denominated in US Dollars and income receivable in Euro and 
US Dollars. 
In calculating the sensitivity analysis below it has been assumed that expenses/income will remain in line with budget in their relative currencies year on year. 
Management consider that a sensitivity rate of 10% is appropriate given the current level of volatility in the world currency markets. In respect of investments 
denominated in foreign currencies a 10% movement in the UK Sterling vs. the relevant exchange rate would lead to an exchange gain or loss as follows: 
Sterling vs. Euros - a movement of 10% would lead to a movement of £5,000 (2016: £nil). 
Sterling vs. US Dollar - a movement of 10% would lead to a movement of less than £1,000 (2016: £2,000). 
In respect of Income receivable in Euro a 10% movement in the exchange rate would result in a movement of £92,000 (2016: £151,000) in the 
income statement. 
In respect of Income receivable in US Dollar a 10% movement in the exchange rate would result in a movement of £25,000 (2016: less than £1,000) in the 
income statement.  70   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

2 Financial risk management (continued)
b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is managed at a Group level. The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily on its trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits 
with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments. 
Fees receivable arise mainly from the Group’s investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly. Historically, default levels have been 
insignificant and the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets. 
Maximum exposure to credit risk 31-Mar-17 31-Mar-16
Cash and cash equivalents 16,956 18,967 
Trade receivables 68,066 35,413 
For banks and financial institutions only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘A-2’ are used and their creditworthiness is regularly monitored by 
the Portfolio Risk Committee. 
For receivables the Group takes into account the credit quality of the client and credit positions are monitored. The Group has three main types of receivables: 
management and performance fees, settlement due from investors in its funds and from the funds themselves for unit/share liquidations. For management and 
performance fee receivables, the Group proactively manages the invoicing process to ensure that invoices are sent out on a timely basis and has procedures 
in place to chase for payment at pre-determined times after the despatch of the invoice to ensure timely settlement. For receivables due from investors, the 
Group has rigorous procedures to chase investors by phone/letter to ensure that settlement is received on a timely basis. For settlement due from the fund for 
liquidations, the settlement of these types of receivables are governed by regulation and are monitored on an exception basis. In all cases, detailed escalation 
procedures are in place to ensure that senior management are aware of any problems at an early stage. 
During the year there have been no losses due to non-payment of receivables and the Group does not expect any losses from the credit counterparties as held 
at the balance sheet date. 
c) Liquidity risk 
Prudent liquidity risk management requires the maintenance of sufficient net cash and marketable securities. The Group monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s 
liquidity reserves (comprising readily realisable investments and cash and cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. 
The Group has categorised its financial liabilities into maturity Groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity 
date. The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

d) Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders whilst maintaining an optimal company structure to reduce the cost of capital and meet working capital requirements. 
The Group’s policy is that it and its subsidiaries should have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate standing with counterparties 
and meet working capital requirements at both a Group and subsidiary level. Management reviews the Group’s assets on a monthly basis and will ensure 
that operating capital is maintained at the levels required. Management consider capital to comprise of cash and net assets. As at 31 March 2017 the Group 
has cash and net assets of £22.1 million (2016: £22.3 million). In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amounts of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back shares or sell financial assets which will increase cash and reduce 
capital requirements.  LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   71
Regulatory risk capital 
Recognised regulatory bodies, such as the FCA in the UK, oversee the activities of a number of the Group’s operating subsidiaries and impose minimum capital 
requirements on the subsidiaries. The Group is regulated by the FCA as a UK consolidation Group. The FCA issued revised rules on Capital Adequacy following 
the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive IV which came into force on 1 January 2016. Having reviewed the new rules, Liontrust remains 
subject to the BIPRU regulations. Further details are available in the Liontrust Pillar III disclosure. 
The FCA requires the Group to hold more regulatory capital resources than the total capital resource requirement as defined in the Capital Requirements 
Directive. The total capital requirement for the Group is the base and variable capital resource requirement (the Pillar 1 requirement) and any additional 
requirements identified during the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (the Pillar 2 requirement). 
The total capital requirement for the Group is £6.5 million (2016: £3.9 million). 
As at 31 March 2017, the Group has regulatory capital resources of £23.0 million (2016: £23.6 million), significantly in excess of the Group’s total 
capital requirement. 
During the period the Group and its subsidiary entities complied with all regulatory capital requirements. 
3 Segmental reporting
The Group operates only in one operating segment – Investment Management. 
Management offers different fund products through different distribution channels. All key financial, business and strategic decisions are made centrally by 
the Board, which determines the key performance indicators of the Group. The Group reviews financial information presented at a Group level. The Board, is 
therefore, the chief operating decision-maker for the Group. The information used to allocate resources and assess performance is reviewed for the Group as a 
whole. On this basis, the Group considers itself to be a single-segment investment management business.

12 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profit after taxation for the year and the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue for each 
year. The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares was 45,059,188 for the year (2016:44,346,674). Shares held by the Liontrust Asset Management 
Employee Trust are not eligible for dividends and are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated on the same bases as set out above, after adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares for the effect of 
options to subscribe for new Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Shares held in the Liontrust Asset Management Employee Trust that were in existence during the year 
ended 31 March 2017. The adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary Shares so calculated for the year was 46,285,217 (2016: 45,518,720). This is 
reconciled to the actual weighted number of Ordinary Shares as follows:

16 Financial assets
The Group holds financial assets that have been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs into 
measuring the fair value. These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows:
– Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
– Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
– Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data.
As at the balance sheet date all financial assets are categorised as Level 1.
Assets held at fair value through profit and loss:
The Group’s assets held at fair value through profit and loss represent shares in the Liontrust GF Global Strategic Equity Fund, and units in the Liontrust Global 
Income Fund, the Liontrust Macro Equity Income Fund, the Liontrust UK Growth Fund and the Liontrust Asia Income Fund. Any Foreign currency assets are 
translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange rate differences arising are shown in note 6.
Assets held as available-for-sale:
The Group’s assets held as available-for-sale represent shares in the Liontrust GF Water & Agriculture Fund, the GF Global Strategic Equity Fund, the GF 
European Smaller Companies Fund, the GF European Strategic Equity Fund, The GF Asia Income Fund, the GF Macro Equity Income Fund and the GF UK 
Growth Fund (all sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds Plc) and are valued at bid price); and units in the Liontrust Global Income Fund, The Liontrust Macro 
Equity Income Fund, The Liontrust Asia Income Fund and the Liontrust UK Growth Fund. The gain on the fair value adjustments during the year net of tax was 
£nil (2016:£nil). Foreign currency assets are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange rate differences arising are 
included in other comprehensive income.

19 Capital reduction
During the last 5 years, the Group has engaged in corporate acquisitions with shares being issued at a premium in consideration for some of these the 
acquisitions. As a result of this, the share premium reserve grew to £17,692,000 at 31 March 2016.
By undertaking the Capital Reduction, it allows the future profits of the Company earned after the date on which the Capital Reduction took effect to then be 
available for the Directors of the Company to use for the purposes of paying dividends and/or buying back Ordinary Shares (should circumstances in the future 
make it desirable to do so). 
The capital reorganisation was completed on 18 March 2017 and £17,692,000 was transferred from the Share Premium reserve to the Profit and 
Loss reserve.

Under the Liontrust Members Incentive Plan (“LMIP”) certain individual members have been allocated Incentive Capital Interests, which entitle such individual 
member to a fixed amount. The entitlement which the holder of an Incentive Capital Interest would have is calculated on the basis of the application of a 
percentage to the “Maximum Incentive Capital Interest” (“MICI”) attributable to that Incentive Capital Interest. The MICI is a variable amount in Pounds Sterling 
equal to the number of Ordinary shares set out in his side letter multiplied by the price of Ordinary shares from time to time (by reference to a 30 day market 
average price). The MICI allocated, in terms of number of Ordinary shares, to individual members were as follows:

Under the Liontrust Members Reward Plan (‘LMRP’) certain individual members have been allocated profits with which they have made a capital contribution 
to the Liontrust LLP Members Reward Limited Partnership (‘LLMRLP’) , which entitle such individual member to a future amount dependant on performance 
conditions being met. The entitlement which the member of LLMRLP would have is calculated on the basis of the application of a percentage to the initial 
Capital contribuiton. The amounts allocated, in terms of number of Ordinary shares, to individual members were as follows:

DBVAP , and LOP operate in conjunction with the Liontrust Asset Management Employee Trust on the basis that at 100% of the options for DBVAP and 
LOP will be satisfied by market purchased shares. This is to ensure that dilution of shareholders’ interest is limited. At 31 March 2017 the weighted average 
remaining life of the options was 2.0 years (2016: 2.4 years).
At 31 March 2017, the Liontrust Asset Management Employee Trust owned 359,796 shares (2016: 430,205) at a cost of £1,119,191 (2016: £1,316,247). 
Dividends on these shares have been waived and they are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating the earnings per share of the Group. As at 
31 March 2017 the market value of the shares was £1,403,000 (2016: £1,094,000). LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   83

24 Contingent assets and liabilities
The Group can earn performance fees on some of the segregated and fund accounts that it manages. In some cases a proportion of the fee earned is deferred 
until the next performance fee is payable or offset against future underperformance on that account. As there is no certainty that such deferred fees will be 
collectable in future years, the Group’s accounting policy is to include performance fees in income only when they become due and collectable and therefore the 
element (if any) deferred beyond 31 March 2017 has not been recognised in the results for the year.
In the normal course of business a contingent liability has arisen in relation to a claim made by a former member against Liontrust Asset Management Plc, 
Liontrust Investment Partners LLP (“LIP”), Liontrust Investment Services Limited and the individual members of LIP . As the timing and amount of any potential 
liability is unknown and cannot be reliably estimated at this stage they are not disclosed. 84   LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017

27 Significant Accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, which comprise 
standards and interpretations issued by either the International Accounting Standards Board or the IFRS Interpretations Committee or their predecessors as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’), and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial information 
has been prepared based on the IFRS standards effective as at 31 March 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention. The principle accounting policies are the same as 
those set out in note 1.
Investment in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Notes 27 to 44 reflect the information for the Company.
28 Financial risk management
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including price risk, cash flow interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit 
risk, capital risk and liquidity risk. The Company is covered by the Group’s overall risk management programme. The risk management policies are the same as 
those set out in note 2 and elsewhere in the report and financial statements.
The specific risks affecting the Company are as follows:
Market risk
The investments in the sub-funds of Liontrust Global Funds PLC are valued on a daily basis at bid price. The investments are held as available-for-sale financial 
assets and are held at fair value and any permanent impairment in the value of the shares held would be taken to revenue.
Management consider, based on historic information, that a sensitivity rate of 10% is appropriate. Based on the holdings in the Liontrust Global Funds at the 
balance sheet date a price movement of 10% would result in a movement in the value of the investment of £140,000 (2016: £13,000).
Cash flow interest rate risk
The Company holds cash on deposit. The interest on these balances is based on floating rates and fixed rates. The Company monitors its exposure to interest 
rate movements and may decide to adjust the balance between deposits on fixed or floating interest rates, or adjust the level of deposits. Following a review of 
sensitivity based on average cash holdings during the year a 1% increase or decrease in the interest rate will cause a £6,000 increase or decrease in interest 
receivable (2016: £5,000).
In addition to the risks covered by the Group risk management polices. The Company is subject to some specific risks relating to its interaction with other Group 
companies. The company reviews its balances due to and from other Group companies on a regular basis.
Prudent liquidity risk management required the maintenance of sufficient cash and marketable securities. The Company monitors rolling forecasts of the it’s 
liquidity reserves (comprising readily realisable investments and cash and cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flow.
The Company has analysed its financial liabilities into maturity Groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity 
date. The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

accounting standards and the value of the loan to the EBT was calculated at £1,971,000 (2016: £1,094,000). The current value of the shares in the trust are

• Give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s and the Company’s profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended;
• Have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union; and
• Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
• The Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets as at 31 March 2017;
• The Consolidated and Company Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
• The Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements for the year then ended;

Our audit approach
Context
Liontrust Asset Management PLC (‘Liontrust’)is a FTSE Small Cap listed fund manager that was launched in 1995 and listed in 1999. Liontrust has a large 
presence in the UK covering both retail and institutional clients. Liontrust offers a range of products such as Unit Trusts, Offshore funds, Segregated Mandates 
and Discretionary Portfolio Management Services.
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of 
focus
• Overall Group materiality of £455,000 which represents 5% of profit before tax.
• Full scope audits of Liontrust Investment Partners LLP and Liontrust Fund Partners LLP because these are the financially 
significant entities and, together, represent more than 95% of the profit before tax of the Group.
• Full scope audits of Liontrust Investment Solutions Limited, Liontrust Investment Funds Limited and Liontrust Investment 
Services Limited as a number of financial statement items, including cash and cash equivalents and revenue, are material to 
the Group financial statements.
• Revenue.
• Share-based payments.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK and Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where 
the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as ‘areas of focus’ 
in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  Independent auditors’ report to the members of

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Revenue
Refer to note 4. Revenue and note 1. Principal accounting policies.
Revenue is the most significant account balance in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. 
Management fees
In 2017, management fees net of rebates and expense caps made up the 
majority of revenue. The recognition of management fees is dependent on the 
terms of the underlying investment management contracts (‘IMCs’) between 
the Group and its clients and/or the funds it manages. It is calculated as 
a percentage of Assets Under Management (‘AUM’) and the percentage 
applied varies across different funds and products. The risk relates to incorrect 
calculation or risk of recording fees in the incorrect period. Rebates are 
calculated as a percentage of the value of the unit holdings of an individual 
account and the percentage applied is based on underlying rebate agreements. 
Expense caps are expenses reimbursed to the funds in line with the IMCs’.
Box profits
Box profits vary from day to day and result from the daily creations and 
cancellations of fund units. The risk relates to incorrect calculation given the 
complexity with significant number of transactions each day and increases the 
risk of error.
Performance fees
Performance fees are standard industry practice but are often one-off or 
infrequent. Performance fees are largely driven by the outperformance of one 
individual segregated mandate and one Offshore fund this year. Similar to 
management fees, performance fees are set by the IMCs.
For all the revenue streams we understood and evaluated the design 
and implementation of key controls, including relevant Information 
Technology systems and controls, in place. This included both in-house 
and outsourced activities at the administrators, State Street and Northern 
Trust, and the transfer agent, International Financial Data Services, (‘IFDS’), 
(‘outsourced providers’).
To obtain audit evidence over the key controls at Liontrust and at the 
outsourced providers supporting the calculation and recognition of 
revenue, we:
• Performed testing of key Liontrust controls to obtain evidence of operational 
effectiveness of those key controls; and
• Assessed the control environment in place at outsourced service providers 
to the extent that it was relevant to our audit. This assessment of the 
operating and accounting structure in place involved obtaining and reading 
the report issued by the independent service auditor of the outsourced 
providers in accordance with generally accepted assurance standards for 
such work. We then identified those key controls on which we could place 
reliance to provide audit evidence. Where the controls reports had not been 
prepared for year ended 31 March 2017, we assessed the gap period and 
obtained bridging letters where necessary.
We found that the key controls on which we sought to place reliance for the 
purposes of our audit were designed, implemented and operating effectively.
We also obtained substantive audit evidence as set out below:
Management fees
For management fees from Units Trusts and Offshore funds, we recalculated 
management fees based on AUM data obtained from outsourced providers 
and management fee rates from IMCs and reconciled these back to 
accounting records. For other management fees we re-performed a sample 
of management fee calculations using independently confirmed AUM and fee 
rates obtained from the IMCs as inputs or tied back independently obtained 
fee calculations to accounting records. We also tested management fees to 
ensure that fees were accrued in the correct period. In respect of Unit Trusts 
and Offshore funds, to test for completeness we checked that management 
fees were recognised for all active funds. For segregated funds, on a sample 
basis, we compared the management fees for current year funds to previous 
years to assess completeness.
In respect of rebates, we re-performed the calculations based on information 
provided by IFDS and reconciled the amounts back to accounting records. 
For a sample of rebates, we agreed rates to rebate agreements signed by 
the clients.
In respect of expense caps, for a sample, we tied back the amounts booked 
in the Group records to payments made or accrual calculations received from 
the outsourced service provider. Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Liontrust Asset Management PLC continued

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Box profits
We reconciled the box profits revenue recognised in the accounting records 
to supporting values obtained independently from IFDS. Using daily box 
units from IFDS and independent prices we used data auditing techniques  
to perform a re-calculation of box profits for all funds and compared to 
the accounting records. Further, for a sample of days, we independently 
confirmed the day end net settlement on account of liquidations and creations 
with the Trustee of the funds, State Street. Also for a sample of discount 
transactions, we re-performed the computation to assess accuracy and 
reasonableness of the discount recorded. To test for completeness we 
checked that box profits were recognised for all Unit Trusts.
Performance fees
For a sample of performance fees, we assessed whether the fee had 
crystallised and therefore had been recognised in the appropriate period. 
For the same sample, we re-calculated this fee to check that it had been 
calculated in accordance with the IMCs. To test for completeness we 
assessed whether a sample of fund and segregated mandates were eligible 
for a performance fee and compared to the accruals to accounting records.
Based on work performed for revenue, we identified no material 
misstatements which required reporting to those charged with governance.
Share-based payments
Refer to the Remuneration report, note 21. Own shares and note 1. Principal 
accounting policies. 
Due to the complex and judgemental nature of share schemes and incentive 
plans, there is an increased risk of error.
The likelihood of an error occurring is driven by a number of factors such 
as the complexity of the schemes, the required record keeping and 
manual calculations.
We understood and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the 
control environment in place over the share based payment expense and 
performed the following to address the risks identified for each type of share 
based payment transaction:
• We obtained and read the deed of grant for the two new awards issued 
during the year. For these new awards, we verified that they were 
appropriately authorised, consistent with scheme plans, classified correctly 
as equity or cash settled and used the correct share price.
• We obtained and read external valuation reports for new schemes which 
used an industry accepted model to compute the grant date fair value. 
Using our valuation experts we recalculated the fair value and also 
assessed the reasonableness of the inputs used within these external 
valuation reports.
• We tested the reasonableness of the estimates in relation to performance 
and/or service conditions for the existing awards. We tested the 
reasonableness of management’s judgements by reference to historical 
data (i.e. schemes that have already vested).
• We tested a sample of options exercised during the year to ensure they 
were exercised in accordance with the terms of the grant, recorded at the 
correct value and appropriately authorised. 
• We obtained details of all the outstanding awards and checked the 
mathematical accuracy of the charge which was spread over the period of 
the award.
Based on work performed for share schemes and incentive plans, we 
identified no material misstatements which required reporting to those charged 
with governance. Independent auditors’ report to the members of

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured along a single business line being investment management. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of the Company and five 
subsidiary entities all of which are based in the United Kingdom.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed over the Company and each of the 
subsidiaries by us, as the Group engagement team, and also as auditors for each of the subsidiaries to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole had been obtained.
We therefore performed full scope audits on the complete financial information of Liontrust Investment Partners LLP and Liontrust Fund Partners LLP because 
they are financially significant components, together representing more than 95% of Group profit before tax. We performed a full scope audit of Liontrust 
Investment Solutions Limited, Liontrust Investment Funds Limited and Liontrust Investment Services Limited as a number of balances, including cash and cash 
equivalents and revenue, are material to the Group financial statements.
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as 
a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line 
items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £455,000 (2016: £423,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with previous years, we have applied this benchmark because it is a benchmark against which the 
Group’s performance is commonly measured and a recognised statutory measure.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £22,000 (2016: £21,000) as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 28, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, 
for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
• The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required 
to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to report in this respect. Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Liontrust Asset Management PLC continued
LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   101
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
Information in the Annual Report is:
• Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group and 
Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• Otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
The statement given by the directors on page 28, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
The section of the Annual Report on page 35, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the 
work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit and Risk Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
The directors’ confirmation on page 18 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.
The directors’ explanation on page 17 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our 
audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
• The Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the Code. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.  Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Liontrust Asset Management PLC continued

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 28, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person 
to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• The reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• The overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to 
draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to 
the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
