Chief Executive’s review
Opportunities in the future
Acquisition strategy continues  
to build the fund of capacity
Nigel Hanbury
Chief Executive
Summary
• Adjusted net asset value at 
£1.60 per share (2016: £1.96) 
• Five acquisitions in 2017 added 
£4.4m of capacity to 2017 
underwriting year
• 1.5p per share total dividend 
payable (2016: 5.5p)
We have continued 
to implement our 
strategy of building 
the portfolio of 
syndicate capacity.
Highlights
• The strategy of building a quality 
portfolio of syndicate capacity continues 
successfully as the portfolio increased 
from £32.6m to £41.0m – a 26% increase 
• The use of quota share has provided 
finance for acquisitions and has mitigated 
the loss from 2017 catastrophe losses
• The reduction of the value of the capacity 
portfolio to £13.0m (2016: £14.9m) will 
provide opportunities to acquire further 
LLVs at reduced prices
• Helios’ portfolio underwriting results for 2015 
underwriting year outperformed Lloyd’s 
return on capacity by 6.6% demonstrating 
the quality of the portfolio
• Market conditions for underwriting 
are improving after the 2017 losses
• With the prospect of improving 
underwriting returns, together with the 
opportunity to acquire LLVs at lower 
values, Helios is well placed to deliver 
value to shareholders in the future
Capacity value
The value of the portfolio of the syndicate 
capacity remains the major asset of the 
Group and an important factor in delivering 
overall returns to shareholders. The adjusted 
net asset value (“ANAV”), being the value of 
the net tangible assets of the Group, together 
with the current value of the portfolio capacity, 
is a key management metric in determining 
growth in value to shareholders. 
The Board had recognised that the average 
prices derived from the annual capacity auctions 
managed by the Corporation of Lloyd’s could 
be subject to material change if the level of 
demand for syndicate capacity reduces or if 
the supply of capacity for sale should increase. 
In 2017 the supply of capacity increased due 
in the main to surplus pre-emption capacity 
being sold. Capacity traded increased to 
£181.3m compared with £66.7m a year 
earlier while. Subscription demand reduced 
as the cash available to LLVs was used to 
reserve for the losses from the significant 
catastrophes in 2017. 
The fall in the weighted average prices for the 
2017 auctions valued the Helios portfolio at 
31 December 2017 at £13.0m (2016: £14.9m). 
The movement in the capacity and its value 
is as follows: 
2016 2017
Capacity 
£m

£m

At 1 January 28.1 11.8 32.6 14.9

Other capacity movements/change in value (1.0) 0.8 4.0 (4.0)
At 31 December 32.6 14.9 41.0 13.0
The weighted average price of capacity 
has now fallen back to just above levels 
last seen in 2012 – a time following a period 
of higher catastrophe loss activity when 
surplus cash in LLVs was reduced. Internal 
valuation assessments of capacity values 
have indicated the sensitivity to the expected 
values from the immediate expected profit 
distributions. As both 2016 and 2017 
underwriting years in aggregate will have 
limited cash distributions to LLVs, this 
has implicitly been reflected in the price 
of syndicate capacity traded at auction. 
As syndicate profitability resumes, the Board 
expects the projected cash flows will lead to 
higher valuations for capacity by stimulating 
the demand in the capacity auctions as some 
owners of the LLVs will wish to reinvest cash 
generated within the LLV in auction purchases.

Strategic report
We will continue to invest in the better 
managed syndicates at Lloyd’s, to provide 
the outperformance of returns that justify 
the capacity values.
The accounting policy requires an assessment 
of the carrying value of each syndicate 
participation against the latest average auction 
prices. The impairment charge for this year 
of £899,000 (2016: £555,000) results in a 
reduction in the fair value of the syndicate 
capacity held on the balance sheet.
These movements in the carrying value of 
capacity have no impact on cash flow.
Underwriting result
The calendar year underwriting profit from 
the Helios retained capacity for 2017 has 
been generated from results recognised 
in the portfolio from the 2015 to 2017 
underwriting years as follows:
Underwriting year contribution
Helios retained profits
Underwriting year 
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
2014 — 1,661
2015 1,294 1,031
2016 741 (484)
2017 (1,852) —
183 2,208
During 2017, the 2015 underwriting year 
midpoint estimate increased from 8.2% return 
on capacity to a final result of 12.9%. The overall 
return on capacity for 2015 benefited from 
the below average loss activity. The midpoint 
estimate for the 2016 underwriting year at 
31 December 2017 was 3.5% (2016: 3.5%). 
The expected improvement in the midpoint 
estimate for 2016 has been impacted by the 
2017 hurricane losses as this underwriting 
year had some exposure to those events. 
Nevertheless, we would expect the 2016 
underwriting year forecast to improve over 
the next 12 months to make a contribution 
to 2018 calendar year underwriting profits.
The level of major claims for the whole of 
Lloyd’s during 2017 at £4.5bn (2016: £2.2bn) 
was the third highest since the turn of the 
century and above the long-term average. 
These losses were incurred mainly as a result 
of the three hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) 
and the wild fires in California. Consequently, 
the 2017 underwriting year result in the first 
12 months retained by Helios made a significant 
negative contribution mainly arising from 
this claims experience. The 2017 result at 
12 months represents a loss of 15% of the 
retained capacity but we expect profits earned 
after January 2018 to reduce the 2017 
underwriting year loss substantially; it is 
too early to forecast an expected result.
Following the recent receipt of the first 
estimates of the 2017 year of account we 
are pleased the Helios mid point loss of 8.4% 
is in line with the market figure of 8.0%.
The underwriting environment has improved 
in 2018 following these losses within most 
classes of business although the availability 
of additional capital has restricted the upwards 
price adjustment following the 2017 losses. 
Other income
Helios generates additional income at Group 
level from the following:

Fees from reinsurers 426 557
Corporate reinsurance 
recoveries 629 —
Goodwill on bargain 
purchases 65 —
Investment income 158 347
Total other income 1,278 904
Fees and profit commission from reinsurers have 
reduced as the profit commission falls with 
the level of underwriting profits recognised. 
The Group has reinsurance policies as member 
level where any expected year losses can 
be recovered up the level of indemnity for 
the member. For the 2017 year of account, 
an assessment has been made of the 
likely year of account loss and a potential 
reinsurance recovery has been made. 
The Group Funds at Lloyd’s are invested 
to produce consistent long-term returns. 
Total costs
The costs of the Group comprise the operating 
expenses and the cost of the stop loss 
protection bought to mitigate the downside 
from large underwriting losses.

The costs have increased as foreign exchange 
losses arising from the strengthening of the 
US$ have been incurred.
Growth in capacity through acquisitions
The strategy of building a portfolio of underwriting 
capacity at Lloyd’s has continued through the 
purchase of further corporate members. There 
remains a steady flow of vehicles for sale as 
existing owners wish to cease underwriting due 
to a change of circumstances. During 2017 
£4.4m (2016: £5.6m) of capacity was acquired. 
We remained selective on the purchases and 
as the effect of the 2017 losses became 
apparent the discounts to the formal valuations 
increased. We would anticipate that the LLVs 
that are marketed for sale in 2018 will have 
lower values attributed as the average capacity 
prices are lower and as the prospective 2017 
losses are factored into the valuations. 
There remains a risk to the implementation 
of our strategy if suitable vehicles are not 
available at attractive prices.

Quality of portfolio
We continue to focus ruthlessly on the quality syndicates. In order to maintain the quality we strive to acquire LLVs with portfolios that comprise 
quality syndicates thereby having to pay the average auction prices. Participations on weaker syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to maintain 
the overall quality. The six largest participations with the leading managing agents at Lloyd’s account for 79% of the portfolio. These participations 
in syndicates managed by these managing agents represent shares in the better managed businesses at Lloyd’s.  Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2017 8
Reinsurance quota share
The use of quota share reinsurance to provide 
access to the Lloyd’s underwriting exposures 
for reinsurers and private capital has been 
expanded. The core of the panel of reinsurers 
remains XL Group plc and Everest Reinsurance 
Bermuda Limited.
This reinsurance reduces the exposure of the 
portfolio and assists in the financing of the 
underwriting capital. Helios will seek to reinsure 
a significant proportion of the capacity at the 
start of the underwriting year to mitigate the 
open-year underwriting exposures. For corporate 
members acquired during the year, a proportion 
of the “on-risk” capacity will be ceded to 
reinsurers whilst the capacity on older years 
will be retained 100% by Helios. Therefore, 
the proportion of the overall capacity that 
Helios retains is expected to rise as further 
corporate members are acquired in the future. 
The profits earned after the company has 
been acquired will be recognised by Helios.
The table shows that the Helios retained capacity 
increases significantly in years 2 and 3 as further 
corporate members are acquired and the 
older years are not reinsured. Capacity 
on underwriting years after 18 months of 
development is substantially “off risk” as 
the underlying insurance contracts have 
mostly expired. 
Therefore, the profits from the capacity on 
the older years are retained 100% by Helios. 
The proportion of overall capacity retained by 
Helios for the 2016 and 2017 underwriting 
years is expected to increase to approximately 
50% as further corporate members are acquired.

Development of profit estimates
As Helios has no active involvement in the 
underwriting or management of the syndicates 
in which it participates, it relies on information 
on forecast profitability of the portfolio that is 
released on a quarterly basis by the managing 
agents of the syndicates. The managing agents 
have traditionally been conservative in the 
estimation of the profitability of a year of 
account, waiting until the development of 
the underlying reserves for the claims can 
be assessed with greater certainty. 
The capacity acquired on the “off-risk” years 
that is retained 100% by Helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the Group. 
The chart below indicates that a significant 
proportion of the improvement in the estimates 
of profitability of syndicates are declared by 
the managing agents in the last 12 months 
to the close of an underwriting year. Even 
though the 2017 underwriting year has 
incurred significant catastrophe losses and 
is currently forecast to close at an overall 
loss for the underwriting year at 36 months, 
the loss recognised at 12 months for 2017 
of approximately 15% of capacity is higher 
that the ultimate expected loss to be declared 
at 36 months. Therefore when Helios will 
benefit from profits recognised from the 
12 month stage on 2017 underwriting year.
Quality of portfolio continued
The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio have on average outperformed the Lloyd’s market average. Helios’ average return on capacity 
over the last three closed years is 14.2% and is on average 5.4% higher than the average of the Lloyd’s market.
The combined ratio of the portfolio (before Helios corporate costs) has been 5.79% lower on average over the last three calendar years. 
These incremental returns demonstrate the diversity and breadth of underwriting expertise within the businesses comprising the portfolio 
of syndicate capacity.

Risk management
Helios continues to ensure that the portfolio is well diversified across classes of businesses 
and managing agents at Lloyd’s. 
The purchase of quota share reinsurance cedes 70% of the risk on the younger or “on-risk” 
years, which has remained consistent for the last three years. 
Following the 2017 losses there has been a change in pricing for most classes of business and 
the rate change data published shows increases on average of 5 per cent. The 2017 losses 
from three hurricanes making landfall in the US were significant but the losses were absorbed 
by the strong capital position of the insurance industry. The high aggregation of coastal 
exposures in the US and other developed markets is one reason why further catastrophe 
losses and dislocations cannot be ruled out in the future. 
The biggest single risk faced by insurers arises from the possibility of mispricing insurance on 
a large scale. This is mitigated by the diversification of the syndicate portfolio and by the depth 
of management experience within the syndicates that Helios supports. These management 
teams have weathered multiple market cycles and the risk management skills employed 
should reduce the possibility of substantial under-reserving of previous-year underwriting.
We assess the downside risk in the event of a major loss through the monitoring of the 
aggregate net losses estimated by managing agents to the catastrophe risk scenarios 
(“CRS”) prescribed by Lloyd’s. 
The individual syndicate net exposures will depend on the business underwritten during 
the year and the reinsurance protections purchased at syndicate level.
The aggregate exceedance probability (“AEP”) assesses the potential impact across the 
portfolio from either single or multiple large losses with a probability of occurring greater 
than once in a 30-year period.

In addition, Helios buys stop loss reinsurance 
that will mitigate the impact of a significant 
loss to the portfolio.
For 2018, the scope of the stop loss cover has 
been rationalised and terms have been included 
which will assist in funding a large loss.

Helios has generated free cash of £1m in 2017 
(2016: £3m) from the distribution of its share 
of the final underwriting profits of the 2015 
underwriting year. During the year, the Group 
funded a 2017 solvency deficit in November 
2017, contributing to the increase in Helios 
own funds used as underwriting capital. We 
anticipate that £3m of the Helios own funds 
will be released by Lloyd’s in 2018, which 
together with the 2015 distribution of 
retained profits will provide free cash to 
Helios of £4m for acquisitions in 2018.
Corporate, social and environmental 
responsibility
Helios aims to meet its expectations of its 
shareholders and other stakeholders in 
recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. 
As Helios manages a portfolio of Lloyd’s 
syndicate capacity, it has no direct 
responsibility for the management of those 
businesses. Each managing agent has 
responsibility for the management of those 
businesses, their staff and employment 
policies and the environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Board does not consider 
it appropriate to monitor or report any 
performance indicators in relation to corporate, 
social or environmental matters.
