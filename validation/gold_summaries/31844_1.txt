 ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 12
Overview
The core ScS business has continued  
to focus on providing excellent choice, 
value and quality for our customers, and  
I am pleased to see this delivering record 
results in furniture and flooring sales. 
Furthermore, our targeted investment  
in key growth areas continue to prove 
successful, with an 8.3% increase in sales 
from our House of Fraser concessions and 
12.3% growth in our online business.
Results
The Group saw a £15.7m (4.9%) increase  
in revenue in the year to £333.0m  
(2016: £317.3m). Gross profit increased  
to £153.7m (2016: £149.1m), EBITDA 
increased 8.4% to £17.4m (2016: £16.0m) 
and profit before tax rose 9.9% to £12.0m  
(2016: £10.9m). 
Strategy for growth
The Group continues to focus on four  
key areas in its strategy for growth:
Area 1 – Increase sales densities
Sales density per square foot at our ScS 
stores for the last 12 months was £226. 
This represents an increase of £7 per 
square foot or 3.2% on the £219 achieved  
in the 12 months ended 30 July 2016.  
This increase was achieved by continued 
focus on the following:
• The ongoing targeting and 
maximisation of a branded range  
of products and the continued 
development of our flooring offering;
• Maximising our average order value, 
with furniture order values rising 1.1%  
in the year to £1,575, and flooring order 
values rising 3.5% in the year to £629;
• Continued investment in our online 
capability, resulting in both the benefit 
of direct sales through the website and 
the indirect benefit of improving the 
quality of footfall, with customers  
often entering our stores having already 
researched their choices. This has 
ensured that, despite decreases in 
footfall noted industry-wide, customers 
are more engaged and more likely  
to place an order; and
• Improving the customer journey, 
experience and confidence, evidenced 
by an improved Trustpilot satisfaction 
score. The Group has over 73,000 
reviews and is proud to have improved 
its overall score and maintained its 
maximum 5-star ‘Excellent’ rating.
Marketing spend increased to £24.7m  
in the year (2016: £23.1m) as the Group 
continued to operate in an increasingly 
competitive and challenging marketplace, 
and to drive sales conversion, namely the 
proportion of customers who purchased  
a product after entering a store, which 
further increased this year.
Area 2 – Maximise the opportunity  
with House of Fraser customers
The Group operates 27 House of Fraser 
concessions, targeting those customers 
who prefer to shop in department stores 
and town centres, and enabling the Group 
to access a wider demographic. Despite 
being integrated into the Group for over 
three years, gross sales continued to rise 
strongly in the year, increasing by 8.3%  
to £27.4m (2016: £25.3m).
Contribution to the Group’s EBITDA is  
a continued focus as these concessions 
become established, and following their 
first positive contribution in the prior year, 
the House of Fraser concession EBITDA 
continued to strengthen in 2017. As with 
the ScS store network, individual 
concession performance is regularly 
reviewed to ensure all locations make  
an appropriate level of return.
Both ScS and House of Fraser management 
teams continue to recognise the ongoing 
potential that the partnership offers and 
continually work together on how to 
improve sales and margins.
Area 3 – Optimise online presence
Whilst relatively large ticket home 
furnishings continue to be predominantly  
a store-based sale, we know that a high 
proportion of our customers continue to 
research our products online before they 
visit the store to make their final purchase 
decision. Continued website investment 
has therefore been a key part of the 
Group’s strategy for growth. In addition,  
as the Group continues to improve its online 
presence and provide a higher quality 
responsive web platform, an increasing 
number of customers are choosing to  
make their purchase directly online. This has 
been supported by continued investment  
in website development and maintenance  
of £1.8m (2016: £1.4m) and increased digital 
marketing spend, which has successfully 
driven improvements in our website visitor 
count and conversion.
Online gross sales increased 12.3% to 
£11.3m (2016: £10.0m).
Area 4 – Achieve strong financial returns 
from new store openings
During the first half of the financial year, the 
Group opened four new stores in Aberdeen 
(September 2016) and Thanet, Edinburgh 
(Straiton) and Plymouth (all on Boxing Day 
2016). All four stores have performed in line 
with the targets set within their initial 
investment analysis and have contributed 
positively to EBITDA in the year. 
We are delighted to be  
reporting continued sales 
growth across all areas of the 
Group for the third year in a row

III II I. Strategic Report
EBITDA
£1 7.4m
+8.4% 
Gross profit
£153.7m
+3.1%
We now operate from 100 stores across  
the UK, almost all of which are in modern 
out-of-town retail parks, often alongside 
competing furniture and floorcoverings 
retailers. A new store in Chelmsford is 
targeted to open on Boxing Day 2017.
We continue to hold a list of sites identified 
for potential new stores, and opportunities 
are consistently pursued and monitored, 
with plans for further expansion in the 
coming financial year.
Additionally, we continue to closely 
monitor the performance of our network 
and actively manage the portfolio.
Current trading and outlook
Since the start of the current financial  
year, trading performance has been in line 
with our expectations. Furthermore, we 
believe the Group’s increasing resilience 
will enable us to manage the continued 
economic uncertainty and take advantage 
of opportunities.
The continued successful self-financed 
expansion of the ScS network, ongoing 
growth in the concession agreement with 
House of Fraser and double-digit online 
growth, together with the Group’s strong 
cash flow dynamics, demonstrate the 
ability of the Group to maintain a strong 
financial position and continue to deliver 
value for our shareholders.
