Introduction
2017 has been a year of considerable 
change for Velocys as it has pivoted from 
being purely a technology licensor to 
setting the foundations for future profit 
delivery as a renewable fuels company. 
After many years of concerted effort, 
encompassing R&D, engineering, project 
management and relationship building, 
the first commercial scale plant using 
Velocys’ technology is in operation in 
Oklahoma City. Velocys has also advanced 
its new strategy for commercialising its 
technology; in 2017 the Company made 
considerable progress driving forward 
the development of its first biorefinery 
using woody biomass as feedstock. 
Notwithstanding the progress made 
throughout 2017 , given the particular 
circumstances of the business’ financial 
position at year end the Company decided 
to make a significant impairment against 
a range of, primarily, intangible assets. 
Strategy and market
The creation of a world-leading technology 
that is operating at commercial scale has 
been a significant achievement. But now, 
as well as seeking opportunities to 
license its technology, Velocys is focused 
on its commercialisation through the 
delivery, with its partners, of repeatable 
biorefineries to become a producer 
of significant volumes of cellulosic 
renewable fuels. We will remember 
2017 as the year Velocys transitioned from 
technology development to its commercial 
roll-out, which has meant the winding 
down of R&D programmes both in the UK 
and the US. The Company has maintained 
its corporate and commercial office in 
the UK. 
After conducting its detailed strategic 
review, Velocys has taken the decision 
to focus its resources on the renewable 
fuels market. Our analysis shows that 
the Velocys route to the production of 
renewable fuels can be cost-effective 
using the reserves of sustainable biomass 
feedstock that are abundant in the US. 
Unlike other routes to renewable fuel 
production these biorefineries will not be 
constrained by the amount of feedstock 
available, and will therefore be well 
positioned to deliver significant quantities 
of renewable fuel to a large and growing 
market at a competitive price.
In a move that is consistent with our 
renewable fuels strategy of delivering 
integrated plants in collaboration with 
partners, we are also in the early stages of 
developing a UK waste-to-jet fuel project 
with world-class partners, which include 
British Airways. 
Other market opportunities, such as 
stranded gas conversion to liquids 
or waxes, are still available and their 
attractiveness to Velocys will continue to 
be reviewed if market conditions change 
in the future. These opportunities give the 
Company future optionality.
Management and Board
In 2017 and early 2018 there were a 
number of changes to the Board. Andrew 
Morris was nominated as a Non-Executive 
Director and Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee at the start of June 2017 , 
in place of Non-Executive Director 
Mark Chatterji who left the Board in 
April 2017 . Ross Allonby and Julian West 
left the Board in June 2017 and February 
2018 (post-period end) respectively. 
On behalf of the Board I thank Mark, 
Ross and Julian for their contributions 
to the Company. I would like to welcome 
Andrew, who brings a wealth of financial 
and business experience from companies 
similar to Velocys in terms of size, sector 
and complexity. 
The appointment of Andrew Morris has 
helped to align Board competencies to 
those needed to guide the delivery of the 
Company’s strategy. Board costs have 
been reduced through the reduction in the 
number of Non-Executive Directors, and 
by reducing the fees paid to existing  
Non-Executive Directors by 10%. 
Susan Robertson stepped down as 
Chief Financial Officer in August 2017 , 
a role she held for nine years. I would 
like to thank Susan for her contribution 
to Velocys during that time. In the 
summer we welcomed John Tunison 
as Interim CFO.  Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 7

Introduction to our corporate governance 
Velocys has the ambition to grow 
significantly, and to develop into a 
multinational business. The Company 
is in the process of implementing the 
required business level governance that 
is both scalable and has the flexibility 
to meet the requirements of delivering 
the new strategy. This governance covers 
the processes required to manage 
the route into the renewable fuels 
market, with defined critical activities 
and key milestones that will drive risk 
management and decision making at 
both the executive and Board levels. 
The composition of the Board has 
reflected the development of the 
Company, with a shift in emphasis 
towards expertise in business, 
legal and finance.

in the future.
Managing risk
Assessing the risks facing the business 
and overseeing management’s strategies 
for mitigating these risks.
Engaging with shareholders
Ensuring shareholders are kept 
informed of the Company’s direction and 
achievements through regular contact.
Supporting management
Constructively challenging the team on its 
plans and delivery.
Fundraising
Velocys completed a fundraise of over 
£10m (before expenses) in May 2017 
primarily through the support of existing 
shareholders, who we thank for their 
continued support. The proceeds 
raised were used primarily to fund 
the pre-FEED (FEL-2) engineering 
study for the Mississippi biorefinery 
project, to undertake a joint technology 
demonstration with our partner TRI, 
and to extend Velocys’ loan arrangement 
with ENVIA to support the plant in 
achieving steady state operations. 
In January 2018 (post-period end) £18.4m 
(before expenses) was raised through 
a further fundraise, principally to help 
fund the development of our Mississippi 
biorefinery project, and to secure strategic 
investment into it. We included an open 
offer element in this fundraising round 
to enable all eligible shareholders an 
opportunity to participate. Our existing 
major shareholders again demonstrated 
their considerable support, but at the 
same time we were pleased by our ability 
to extend our shareholder base. The Board 
recognises that additional funding is 
still required to reach final investment 
decision (FID) on the Mississippi 
biorefinery project; further details are 
given in the Financial review and note 2. 
Outlook
Velocys is pursuing its new strategy and 
has completed its shift to becoming 
a renewable fuels business. It did so 
mid-2017 after taking decisive action 
to capitalise on its achievements at 
ENVIA. The Company has strengthened 
its Executive Committee and adapted its 
organisational structure as it continues 
to build a strong team that has the 
long-term aim of delivering repeatable 
biorefineries. Velocys has transformed in a 
short time and its primary focus is to drive 
the delivery of the FID for the Mississippi 
biorefinery project, which the Company 
is targeting in the second half of 2019. 
A key step in this process will be to bring 
on board one or more strategic investors 
into the Mississippi project consortium 
to meet the remaining development 
capital requirement.
