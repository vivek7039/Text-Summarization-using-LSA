 Chairman’s Statement
However, we suffered a setback in the second half 
of the year due to a combination of factors which 
overall impacted our reported profits for the year; 
first, as a result of customer disruption in the wake 
of the June 2017 UK General Election, sign-off on 
some contract wins, especially within health and 
transport, was delayed; secondly, following an 
internal review by our finance team in preparation for 
the full year audit, we identified nine contracts where 
we did not consider revenue should be recognised 
in these results. 
I am pleased to report that the year-end audit and 
subsequent review of revenue recognition did not 
show up any additional material problems around 
accounting irregularities, nor did it increase the size 
of the related adjustment materially. 
Our finance team are to be congratulated for 
their diligence and integrity in standing up for the 
correct treatment and precise year end cut off. On 
the downside, we have expended considerable 
management time on resolving these issues.
There have been more robust discussions and 
technical analysis of revenue recognition accounting 
policies, in particular around the complex area of 
6PM software licence treatment. As a result, an 
adjustment was made to management figures 
relating to 6PM licence revenue.
The Board
Richard Kellett-Clarke, who had become a Non-
Executive Director of Idox in November 2016 after a 
successful tenure as our Chief Executive, stepped 
back in as Interim Chief Executive in December 
2017 following the regrettable illness of his original 
successor Andrew Riley. Andrew remains on 
extended sick leave. I am pleased to report that 
Richard has been able to rapidly execute on a 
plan to get the business back on track as soon as 
possible and will help out for as long as necessary. 
2017 proved to be a year of change and 
contrasting performance for Idox; after a promising 
start to the year, it is disappointing to report on a 
mixed set of results for the year as a whole. 
The early part of the year was focused on 
completion of the acquisition of 6PM, a software 
and solutions business whose main customer 
is the UK NHS, which represented a significant 
expansion in the health and social care market.  
We made a further important acquisition in August, 
of Halarose, an electoral back office software and 
services business that has significantly enhanced 
our elections’ capabilities. 
“ Spanning both the public and private sectors, 
Idox works across a range of industries and 
sectors – from central and local government to 
transport, health and social care and commercial 
organisations, to deliver smart technology that 
enhances services and improves productivity.”

04 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2017 Peter Lilley, who joined the Board in 2005 will step down from his 
role at the Company’s AGM as Senior Non-Executive Director and 
chair of the Remuneration Committee after twelve years’ service 
to the Group. We would like to take this opportunity of thanking 
him for his contribution to the Group over this period. 
Results Summary
A summary of our financial key performance indicators is 
presented above.
Idox grew revenues by 16% but organic growth suffered due to 
the one off issues that occurred during the year, as outlined in 
the Chief Executive’s Statement. As a result, adjusted EBITDA 
declined by 13.9%. The overall Group margin declined to 21% 
from 28% in the previous year. This was the result of a change in 
mix and higher than anticipated one off costs in several parts of 
the business.

The miss of the originally expected EBITDA target of £27.2m by 
£8.7m can be summarised as follows:
Management had an expectation that 6pm licences would be able to be 
recognised at a point in time and had budgeted for revenue in this way. 
In practice this was not possible and 6pm licences were recognised over 
time resulting in a £1m difference between expected revenues and actual 
revenues recognised.

Chairman’s Statement continued
Net debt (including the 6PM bond) as at 31 October 
2017 stood at £32.1m (2016: £25.0m), and has not 
been impacted by the revenue recognition issues. 
Bank debt remains within the Group’s banking 
facilities, and the net debt / EBITDA ratio as at 
31 October was 1.7 times. Cash conversion has 
improved to 82% (2016: 63%).
Group Strategy
The Group continued its focus on providing digital 
solutions and services to the public sector in 
the United Kingdom and Europe. The key to our 
success is to ensure we deliver better user results 
and productivity improvements for customers 
through focusing on usability, functionality and 
application of integrated digital technologies  
and solutions.
The Group has had a setback this year but the 
Board believes it can bounce back quickly with the 
steps already taken to rectify the issues identified 
and reflecting the underlying strengths of the core 
business, its product offering and talented people. 
Acquisitions
During the financial year two acquisitions were 
completed, 6PM for £18.5 million and Halarose for 
£5.0 million, both in line with our strategy, and both 
of which contributed to this year’s financial results. 
6PM represented a significant expansion into one 
of the most important and largest public services 
– healthcare. Halarose significantly consolidates 
our position in elections. The Board believes that 
both will deliver earnings enhancing contributions in 
future periods.
The 6PM acquisition was funded by means of a 
placing of new shares which raised gross proceeds 
of £20.5 million, whilst £3.5m of the Halarose 
acquisition was financed out of the Group’s existing 
cash resources, with £1.5m settled in shares. 
Dividends
The Board proposes, subject to approval at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting, that a final 
dividend of 0.655p (2016: 0.650p) be paid bringing 
the total for the year to 1.04p (2016: 1.00p), an 
increase of 4%, consistent with our progressive 
dividend policy. In reaching this decision, the Board 
has taken into account the disappointing results for 
the year. 
Summary
Following the disappointment at the year-
end regarding delayed contracts and revenue 
recognition, I am pleased that these matters have 
now been clarified and that we can look forward 
with confidence to the new financial year. Idox 
has an exceptionally strong market position in the 
public sector, a sound balance sheet, and multiple 
opportunities for growth. I am therefore confident of 
the Group’s future prospects.
