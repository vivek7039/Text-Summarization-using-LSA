 STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
 
 
Avanti Communications Group plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In the first half of the financial year, Avanti’s financial 
position suffered disruption when the additional debt 
facilities sought were not forthcoming on suitable 
terms. After a period of very hard work, our existing 
bondholders and long term investors supported the 
Company through a refinancing transaction that 
provided $242million of additional liquidity through a 
mixture of new money and interest deferrals.  
The disruption of the first six months of the year led to a lengthening 
of the sales cycle as our customers and potential customers waited 
for the refinancing and strategic review to be completed. Following 
the completion of the transaction, some confidence did return to the 
customer base, but the lag in the sales cycle has taken some time 
to reverse, meaning that our revenues for the year were significantly 
lower than initially expected. 
Nevertheless, Avanti did win some significant business towards the 
end of the year. The award of a new 3 year contract worth up to $21 
million to deploy several hundred services to government sites 
across Africa with an existing government customer strengthens our 
business with governments across our target markets. Furthermore, 
the SaT5G (Satellite and Terrestrial network for 5G) project has 
started well. This project will research, develop and validate key 
technologies required to enable the plug-and-play integration of 
satellite communications into 5G networks. The project will trial and 
assess these through live testbed demonstrations across Europe 
Shortly after the year end David Williams, Chief Executive and co-
founder, left the business. Alan Harper, who at the time was a non-
executive director of the Company, agreed to take up the role of 
interim Chief Executive. Alan has 25 years of experience in 
European and African telecoms markets. He has worked at 
Vodafone as Group Strategy Director and more recently founded 
and ran Eaton Towers, which served most of the major telco that are 
a key part of the strategy for expansion at Avanti. Alan is focussed 
on rebuilding the sales momentum of the business and ensuring 
that the Group has a go to market strategy that is fit for the current 
market. The search for a full time replacement is underway and we 
hope to make an announcement shortly.  
As recently announced, the Board has launched a restructuring of 
the Company’s balance sheet. The restructuring is aimed at 
correcting the capital structure that has developed given recent 
trading and will provide the platform for success over the medium-
term.  It is proposed to issue new shares to repay all of the 2023 
notes which would reduce the Group’s debt by in excess of $500m. 
This is subject to the agreement of the shareholders at a General 
Meeting to be held in early 2018. In addition, the Board has agreed 
with our Bondholders, subject to necessary consents, to reduce the 
interest rate on the 2021 notes to 9% with the ability to pay cash or 
roll up the interest as appropriate.  The combined impact of these 
two developments will reduce the Group’s annual interest charge 
by approximately 70%. I hope that you see fit to support this 
initiative which will give Avanti a significantly strengthened balance 
sheet and remove a significant impediment to sales growth.  
I would also like to thank our employees, customers, suppliers and 
investors for their ongoing support.
