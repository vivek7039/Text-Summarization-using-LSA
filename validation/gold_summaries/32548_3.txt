In a more uncertain  
retail and economic 
environment we are 
confident the Group  
is well placed to meet  
the challenges ahead.”
In a year that has seen the introduction of 
the National Living Wage, the vote for the 
UK to leave the European Union and the 
resulting devaluation of Sterling against 
both the US Dollar and the Euro, I am 
pleased to report another year of progress 
for the Group. While we expect some 
uncertainty ahead as the UK negotiates 
the terms of Brexit, we remain confident  
in the long term prospects for the Group 
based around our strategy to build a 
unique pet-focused offer of products 
and services within our store estate, to 
maximise our investments in omnichannel 
which will bring more of Pets at Home 
to customers more of the time, and to 
develop national coverage of first opinion 
vet practices and specialist referral 
centres within our Vet Group.
Following a strong first half, Merchandise 
sales in the second half were softer than 
anticipated, although online grew strongly 
reflecting the momentum gained from our 
omnichannel investments. Vet services 
again delivered strong growth driven by 
our strategy of providing a quality service 
to clients across both first opinion 
and specialist referral centres. In the 
year as a whole, revenue grew 7.2%
◊
 
to £834.2 million. Like-for-like
†
 growth 
was 1.5%
◊
. The Board proposes an 
ordinary dividend of 7.5p per share.
The combination of our specialist  
retail offer, veterinary practices and  
pet grooming salons, all within a single 
pet-focused environment, represents a 
uniquely attractive offer to our customers 
and, as more of our recent investments  
in vet practices and grooming salons 
mature, will deliver increasingly powerful 
financial results. As the year progressed 
we launched a number of important 
initiatives to bolster our service and  
value propositions. Building on our 
investments that support omnichannel 
shopping we launched a subscription 
platform, initially for flea treatments,  
and Order in Store which allows 
colleagues to serve customers from our 
extended online range via instore iPads 
– our PetPads. Online sales grew by 
53%
◊
. We also launched Switch & Save, 
highlighting the value of our private 
brands in Advanced Nutrition, and we 
will continue to offer better value to our 
customers across our product ranges. 
Our VIP loyalty scheme continues to grow, 
delivering highly targeted information and 
offers to our customers and providing 
us with powerful data on their purchasing 
behaviour.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 The diversification of our veterinary 
business has continued with the 
acquisitions of Eye Vet Referrals and Dick  
White Referrals, bringing the number of 
specialist referral centres in the Group  
to four. Joining Northwest Veterinary 
Specialists and Anderson Moores, The 
Eye Vet is a dedicated ophthalmology 
practice, while Dick White Referrals is one 
of the largest specialist veterinary centres 
in Europe, offering outstanding levels of 
clinical care in state-of-the-art facilities. 
We have identified opportunities to 
expand our network of specialist referral 
centres to give us nationwide coverage 
and to maximise this opportunity we have 
established a new Specialist Division 
alongside our existing First Opinion 
Division in the expanded Vet Group. 
Management 
Following the appointment of Ian Kellett 
as Group Chief Executive in April 2016,  
we appointed Mike Iddon as Group Chief 
Financial Officer in October 2016. Mike 
joined the Group from New Look, where 
he had been the Chief Financial Officer. 
He has a wealth of experience in the  
retail sector having previously held senior 
finance positions at Tesco plc. He 
qualified as a Chartered Accountant 
with Arthur Andersen. As a consequence 
of Mike’s appointment, Mark Adams,  
who had been an excellent Interim  
Chief Financial Officer, left the Group in 
November 2016. I would like to welcome 
Mike to the business and to thank Mark 
for his stewardship as Interim CFO.
We recognise the significant potential  
that exists for the Group, particularly  
in the veterinary sector, and have 
therefore made a number of changes  
to the responsibilities of our Executive 
Management Team to give us better  
focus as we enter the new financial  
year. Sally Hopson, who was CEO of our 
Services Division, will exclusively drive  
the development of our Vet Group. Peter 
Pritchard, CEO of our Retail Division, will 
assume responsibility for Grooming, while 
pet insurance services transfers to Mike 
Iddon, CFO. Louise Stonier will extend  
her remit to cover people in a new role  
as Chief People and Legal Officer. 
Colleagues
It is a shared passion for pets that forms 
the special bond between our business, 
our colleagues and our customers. I would 
again like to thank all our colleagues, in 
every part of the business, for their hard 
work and dedication in a more challenging 
economic environment. 
With the adoption of the National Living 
Wage we made no distinction between 
colleagues based on age alone and we 
have maintained our Earn As You Learn 
approach which rewards retail colleagues 
further as they develop their knowledge  
and specialism. In Grooming we saw our 
first apprentices complete their training  
and emerge as qualified stylists. And 
among our veterinary professionals  
we have launched apprenticeships  
for veterinary nurses, with the first  
cohort beginning their training at  
Dick White Referrals.
Looking forward
The UK pet market has a track record 
of resilience in more difficult economic 
times. While we take nothing for granted, 
the Board believes we have the right 
strategy and a strong and experienced 
team to lead the organisation successfully 
through the more uncertain period ahead. 
Accordingly, we remain confident in the 
outlook for the Group.

“ As part of developing a Clinical 
Governance Framework for our 
first opinion practices, it was 
important to me that I spend time 
in our practices and referral 
centres, getting to know clinicians 
in all parts of the business. This 
was crucial to furthering my 
knowledge of their day to day 
operations and helping our Vet 
Group develop a framework  
that ensures our vets maintain 
complete clinical freedom, whilst 
at the same time being able to 
better support them in achieving 
the best clinical standards.”
Tessa Green 
Independent Non-Executive Director
 
Our Non-Executive Directors  
frequently spend time in the business, 
supplementing their knowledge of our 
strategy, operations and colleagues. 
Tessa Green, in her role as Chairman of 
the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
and Pets Before Profit Committees, has 
focused on furthering her knowledge of 
operations that have significance for the 
Group’s ethical, social and environmental 
impacts. During her time with Pets at 
Home, this has included a number of 
visits to our first opinion vet practices and 
specialist referral centres, as the CSR 
Committee worked towards developing  
a Clinical Governance Framework.
