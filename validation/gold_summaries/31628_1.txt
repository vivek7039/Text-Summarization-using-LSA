Overview
At the Investor Day in March 2016 we said that 2017 would be a 
year of transition. I believe our performance in 2017 shows that 
the strategy is working and we are slightly ahead of schedule.
We have been able to speed up the strategy because of the 
financial independence that resulted from DMGT’s decision 
to reduce its holding in Euromoney, which they completed 
in January and by investing some of the benefit from the 
strengthened US dollar compared to sterling. We have 
delivered a return to growth with both year-on-year revenue 
and profit ahead of 2016 though this included significant help 
from exchange rates. We remained focused on our use of 
capital by investing in the big themes, such as our acquisition of 
RISI, and disinvesting from areas which would otherwise create 
a drag. We have also made good progress fixing structurally 
challenged businesses and returning them to growth.
In May 2017 we announced a new, progressive dividend policy 
which aims to pay out approximately 40% of adjusted earnings 
each year. The new policy, the share buyback, improved Group 
performance and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to 
recommend to shareholders a significant increase in dividend 
for the year.
In the year ahead we shall continue to focus on delivering 
growth through investing in areas of opportunity and 
disinvesting from areas that are structurally and cyclically 
challenged.
Strategy
Our strategy is to manage a portfolio of businesses in markets 
where information, data and convening market participants 
are valued. We deliver products and services that support our 
clients’ critical activities. In particular, we look to serve markets 
which are semi-opaque; that is, where the information which 
organisations need in order to operate effectively is hard to find.
We characterise the business models of B2B information 
companies into three generations, which we call B2B 
Information 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. Their characteristics are set 
out on page 11.
As we manage our portfolio to achieve our strategy and to 
become a 3.0 business, we categorise our business into four 
quadrants. We allocate capital to the top two quadrants and 
withdraw capital from the bottom two.
This quadrant-based assessment leads to three pillars of 
strategic activity:
1.  Investing around the big themes. These include price 
discovery, post-trade activities, asset management and 
telecoms.
2.  Transform the operating model. There are two aspects to 
our model. One is our target business model (see page 14). 
The second is a best-of-both-worlds operating model which 
combines Euromoney’s entrepreneurial culture with strong 
central functions that support the businesses and enable us 
to take advantage of our scale.
3.  Actively manage the portfolio. Acquisitions have always 
been, and remain, an important part of Euromoney’s 
strategy. We have a record of identifying businesses where 
our ownership adds value. We also sell businesses where we 
believe we are not the best owners and to generate capital 
to invest in the big themes.

Euromoney AR2017 Strategic-Proof 6.indd   10 12/11/2017   12:13:28 PM Our strategy is designed to develop the businesses we own and 
deliver strategic, timely, and well-executed acquisitions and 
disposals. We aim to allocate and recycle capital efficiently 
to good organic and inorganic opportunities via our operating 
model. Our ambition is to generate consistent and meaningful 
returns for our shareholders at relatively low risk.
Investing around the big themes
Our big themes enable us to exploit market and industry 
opportunities. In response to the challenges in our asset 
management segment (BCA, NDR and Institutional Investor) 
due to MiFID II and the shift from active to passive investing, 
our product development is geared to growing segments of 
the market:
• BCA is developing new products targeting passive, specialist 
and alternative investments
• NDR is providing tools for registered investment advisors (RIAs)
• II is launching new products targeting defined contribution 
pensions, RIAs and the private wealth sector

Cycle
Structure
In our pricing, data & market intelligence segment, we are 
investing in technology, sales, product management and in 
developing our people across price reporting, insurance and 
telecoms among other areas.
Transforming the operating model
We have now embedded our strategy throughout the 
organisation with our best-of-both-worlds operating model. 
This has included the creation of seven divisions (grouped 
into our four reporting segments) and five functions under 
the leadership of our new Group Management Board to 
serve our customers better.

Actively managing the portfolio
We continue to manage our portfolio, investing in our big 
themes, removing the bottom-left quadrant drag of businesses 
which are structurally challenged or finding better owners for 
businesses which do not fit with our strategy. During the year 
we bought RISI, BroadGroup and Layer123 and disposed of 
six businesses – HedgeFund Intelligence, II Intelligence, 
Euromoney Indices, Latin Finance, Adhesion and World Bulk 
Wine (the last two completing after year-end). We continue 
to look for acquisitions which are, or have the potential to be, 
3.0 businesses. We have also decided to review strategic 
options for our Global Markets Intelligence division (CEIC and 
EMIS) and you will see that they are identified in this report as 
held for sale. These are good businesses, but ones which we 
believe may fit another owner’s strategy better. If sold this 
would give us the opportunity to recycle more capital towards 
our big themes.
Performance for the year
Headwinds for our asset management businesses (BCA, NDR 
and Institutional Investor) meant that revenues in this segment 
were under pressure during the year, but we managed costs 
carefully. Other businesses performed strongly particularly 
Metal Bulletin, TelCap and Insurance Insider. 
Overall, total and statutory revenues are both up 6%  
year-on-year and adjusted profit before tax is up 4% on 
last year, primarily due to the favourable USD-GBP rate, 
the high margin flow-through from the asset management 
segment and the prior year restructuring of our training 
business. Our full-year adjusted profit before tax of £106.5m 
represents a strong performance for the Group in the year of 
transition with adjusted diluted earnings per share growing 
to 76.4p from 66.5p last year, a 15% increase. Statutory profit 
before tax of £40.7m is lower than adjusted profit before tax 
due to exceptional items, primarily the impairment charge 
taken for NDR in the first half, and acquired intangible 
amortisation. In addition, Euromoney’s tradition of strong 
cash generation continues with underlying conversion 
of adjusted operating profit to cash in the year at 118%. 
These results demonstrate our ability to both invest for 
growth and manage the business effectively.
Outlook
With uncertainty still surrounding Brexit and a challenging 
geopolitical climate we are operating in a volatile environment. 
We expect our asset management businesses to continue 
facing challenging market conditions due to the headwinds our 
customers face but believe our risk mitigation plans will reduce 
the impact. Commodity markets are improving and our banking 
clients are experiencing a recovery, although the uncertainty 
over Brexit negotiations could make this short-lived. 
Our plans are built around these factors and we will continue 
investing for future growth while managing risk. 
The strategy we unveiled in March 2016 is working. Growth 
returned slightly ahead of schedule in 2017, which we still regard 
as a year of transition, and our view is that 2018, the third year of 
our strategy, will be a year of further and accelerated growth.
