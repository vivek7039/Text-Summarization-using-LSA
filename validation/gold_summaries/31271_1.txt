 2017 was a landmark year for Serica, delivering our highest profit to date and providing us 
with a platform to grow further. 
Building on a strong set of financial results, the announcement of the BKR Assets acquisition 
in late November rounded off an excellent year. We believe that the UK North Sea, where 
there are strategic benefits for Serica, will continue to provide new opportunities to grow the 
business and add shareholder value.
Net production of 722,000 boe (2016 – 597,000 boe) and 
operating profits of US$14.1 million (2016 – US$3.4 million) 
represent Serica’s strongest annual performance 
to-date even though wax control in the condensate 
export pipeline restricted Erskine second half volumes. 
The year also saw the announcement of the BKR 
Assets acquisition and significant progress on bringing 
Columbus to a development decision.
The problems with a wax build-up in the Lomond to 
Everest condensate export line have deferred production 
from Erskine but it is expected that this production will 
be recovered once the pipeline restrictions have been 
cleared. Erskine partners’ focus has therefore been placed 
on resolving the restrictions that have been preventing 
delivery of the field’s full capability. A long-term solution 
has been sanctioned and work on this has commenced 
alongside the ongoing efforts to clear the build-up.
The capability of the Erskine reservoir and wells 
continues to outperform the projections that Serica 
made when the asset was first acquired. Estimated 
remaining 2P reserves at 1 January 2018 of 3.1 million 
boe net to Serica compare to an estimated 3.3 million 
boe when Serica first acquired the field interest in 
mid-2015 even though 1.9 million boe net to Serica 
have been produced during the intervening period. 
When not subject to external restrictions, the field has 
demonstrated an ability to sustain production at rates 
around 3,000 boe per day net to Serica. 
The acquisition of the BP interests in the BKR Assets 
will provide Serica with the opportunity to build on the 
experience gained from Erskine in order to move forward 
as a production operator. I have been tremendously 
impressed with the professionalism and enthusiasm of 
the BP staff that will be transferring to Serica and I look 
forward to welcoming these staff as well as our new 
recruits into our new operational headquarters which 
will be opened in Aberdeen in the second half of 2018.
Meanwhile, we are pleased to confirm that Serica and 
the other Columbus partners have notified the Oil and 
Gas Authority (“OGA”) of a selected offtake route for the 
Columbus field development. This is discussed in more 
detail below and in the Operations Report. We now look 
forward to working with our partners and infrastructure 
owners to develop and submit a Field Development Plan 
(“FDP”) to the OGA for Columbus, targeted for mid-year.
Serica remains committed to exploration and the 
forthcoming Rowallan well, on which Serica is fully 
carried, is one of the few significant UK exploration wells 
due to be drilled in 2018 targeting gross reserves over 
100 million boe. Elsewhere in the UK Continental Shelf 
(“UKCS”) Serica is looking to grow its exploration portfolio 
and has participated in three applications for new 
licences in the UKCS 30th Offshore Licensing Round. 
Industry activity in both Ireland and Namibia is showing 
strong signs of recovery as oil prices recover from the 
lows seen in 2015-16; this is expected to enhance our 
ongoing efforts to secure drilling partners in these areas.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 
REPORT
STRATEGIC REPORT
6 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Erskine 
During the first five months of 2017 Serica’s primary 
asset, the Erskine field, delivered a particularly strong 
performance with production averaging 3,100 boe 
per day net to the Company. This was followed by a 
period when wax build-up in the Lomond to Everest 
condensate export line restricted rates through June 
and July leading into a two-month field shut-in as a 
planned August maintenance programme extended into 
September for additional wax management processes 
and repairs to a Lomond caisson. The recommencement 
of production in late September brought a further 
period of steady production, averaging close to 
2,500 boe per day net, until an unplanned outage of the 
Forties Pipeline System (“FPS”) on 11 December shut-in 
Erskine along with approximately 80 other North Sea 
production platforms. 
Though frustrating not to have been able to maintain 
Erskine early year performance, Serica’s net share of 
production for 2017 still averaged close to 2,000 boe 
per day, delivered at improving oil and gas prices, and 
generating profit before tax of US$10.8 million compared 
to US$3.3 million for 2016. It should also be emphasised 
that output restrictions during 2017 were almost entirely 
related to the oil offtake pipelines. 
The FPS interruption was a rare event which the 
operator, Ineos FPS, was quick to address given the 
strategic importance of this line which transports to 
shore over 40% of total UK oil production. However, the 
wax build-up in the Lomond to Everest condensate 
export line has been a recurring challenge and, as 
already reported, has caused a further interruption to 
Erskine production in early 2018. Response to-date has 
been to manage the problem through rate control, 
periodic soaking of the line with solvents and pigging. 
However, pigging programmes have historically been 
limited due to the risk of full blockage. 
Net production of 722,000 
boe and operating profit of 
US$14.1 million represents 
Serica’s strongest annual 
performance to-date.
7 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT CONTINUED
New Lomond operator, Chrysaor Holdings Limited, 
after reviewing the various wax management measures 
employed in recent years, has concluded that the best 
long-term solution is to bypass the area of wax build-
up by replacing a 26 km section of line, a proposal that 
Serica fully supports. A clean line will allow full and 
regular pigging right from the start thus preventing 
the wax build-up that has proved so difficult to remove. 
Serica’s share of the cost is comparable to some 40 days 
of Serica’s field revenues. Equipment procurement 
has commenced and the installation is expected to be 
completed in Q3 2018.
So, although field production is again being curtailed 
during early 2018, Serica has confidence that the bypass 
solution will assist delivery of full field potential in 
future years and pay for itself many times over. In the 
meantime, the Lomond operator continues to make 
every effort to clear the blockage with further equipment 
currently being mobilised. 
BKR Asset acquisition
Since the 2015 acquisition of an interest in the producing 
Erskine field, Serica’s management has been seeking 
additional North Sea production interests. In addition to 
diversifying risk away from a single revenue stream, this 
would also assist in accelerating and fully exploiting the 
value of Serica’s UK North Sea ringfence tax losses. It has 
taken considerable time and patience to deliver the right 
deal but we believe the structure of the BKR transaction 
allows Serica to achieve further transformation whilst 
managing downside risk and avoiding excessive dilution 
or leverage. 
As the deal also brings operating responsibilities, the 
transition phase will necessarily be of sufficient duration 
to allow the Company to put in place systems and 
resources and obtain the necessary consents. This 
work is progressing well, the consultation phase for 
over 110 staff transferring from BP is almost complete, 
recruitment for additional positions is underway, new 
offices have been identified in Aberdeen and the 
Company is working with BP, the OGA and field partners 
to ensure a safe and ordered transition. Completion is 
targeted for late Q3 2018.
During Q1 2018, BKR production has remained strong, 
routinely exceeding 20,000 boe per day net to BP. 
However interruptions for the FPS shut-in and the recent 
severe weather conditions in the North Sea mean that in 
Q1 2018 the average production was 16,000 boe per day 
net to BP. Importantly, Ofgem has recently approved the 
raising of the National Transmission System (“NTS”) entry 
specification for CO2 content of gas delivered at the St 
Fergus Gas Terminal to 5.5mol% CO2 largely eliminating 
the need for costly blending gas required up to now to 
offset the relatively higher CO2 content of Rhum gas. 
BP has entered into a contract for a rig to carry out the 
re-entry and re-completion of the previously drilled (but 
STRATEGIC REPORT
8 Serica Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 not yet producing) Rhum R3 well. Operations are expected to commence in 
May this year. The well is already connected to the necessary infrastructure 
and it is expected that production will commence before the year-end. 
Under the terms of the SPA, Serica will benefit from a 40% share of 2018 net 
cashflow from the acquired assets rising on a stepped basis to 100% in 2022. 
The amount generated in the period up to completion, adjusted for notional 
tax, will be offset against the £12.8 million consideration due at completion. 
At current production volumes and sales prices, this is expected to exceed 
the initial consideration delivering a net cash receipt to Serica.
Columbus
Under the extension terms of the Columbus licences, Serica and its partners 
in the Columbus field were required to notify the OGA by 31 March 2018 
of the choice of an offtake route and to submit an FDP by 30 June 2018. 
Work has concluded on the evaluation of two potential offtake routes 
for Columbus production and the Columbus partners have selected the 
Shearwater hub as providing the optimum export route for Columbus gas 
and liquids. This selection is contingent on a near-term commitment being 
made by the Arran field partners to the construction of a pipeline from the 
Arran field to Shearwater passing near the Columbus field with appropriate 
tie-in points. The OGA has been informed of the decision and Serica has 
commenced the preparation of the field development plan which is intended 
to be ready for submission by mid-2018. 
Exploration
The Rowallan well, will be Serica’s first exploration well since 2014 and our 
15% fully carried interest brings significant potential with an independently 
assessed 19.7 mmboe of P50 Prospective Resources net to Serica. A tender 
process is underway to contract a drilling rig to commence drilling of the 
exploration well in H2 2018. Though Serica has been careful to manage its 
exploration commitments during the industry downturn, this well, targeting 
material hydrocarbon volumes, is close to infrastructure within the general 
Erskine/Lomond area making it a strong candidate for early development 
should the well prove successful and will be drilled at no cost to Serica.
Serica intends to continue targeting exploration opportunities where an 
attractive balance can be struck between financial commitment and risked 
commercial return and has participated in three applications for new 
licences in the UKCS 30th Offshore Licensing Round.
Further Opportunities
Though the main effort must necessarily be directed towards preparing 
for BKR operations and completing the transaction with BP, Serica will 
continue to look for opportunities to build the Company and deliver 
further shareholder value. As the time taken to deliver the BKR opportunity 
demonstrates, it requires patience to achieve this but we believe that 
Company progress to date provides a sound platform from which to further 
build our upstream business.
