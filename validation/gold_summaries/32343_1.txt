 Chief Executive’s review
Our focus, as a REIT, is to collect and compound 
our long and strong income and to enhance its 
repetitive, reliable and secure characteristics.
Our portfolio is positioned around 
strong fundamentals of owning 
highly desirable assets, let to good 
companies and where over time 
the income will grow.

Income growth with 
structural support
We continue to live in a world 
characterised by both political and 
economic uncertainty. The prolonged 
low interest rate environment and 
unorthodox monetary policy has 
created an almost desperate search 
for yield across a widening spectrum 
of investment classes. 
Our focus, as a REIT, is to collect and 
compound our long and strong 
income and to enhance its repetitive, 
reliable and secure characteristics. 
We expect this strategy to outperform 
more traditional hyper-active 
development and trading models 
where volatile and uncertain returns 
are diluted by income interruption 
and frictional costs. 
Technological advancement and 
innovation is having a profound 
impact on many businesses as they 
attempt to remain relevant in an 
evolving world where the pace of 
change is accelerating. The real 
estate sector is not immune. 
In recent years, we have seen a 
signiﬁcant shift in consumer shopping 
habits, with customer expectations of 
efficiency, speed and convenience 
driving omni-channel retailing. 
This has signiﬁcantly increased the 
proportion of non food retail sales 
online, which is expected to reach 
26% by 2020 compared to just 13% in 
201 1; a growth rate of 10% per annum. 
These structural changes in how 
people shop are driving retailer 
demand for logistics. We have 
responded to these trends by actively 
pivoting our investment focus from 
retail parks into the logistics and 
distribution sectors, which we expect 
to account for over 70% of our 
portfolio by the end of the current 
ﬁnancial year. We remain disciplined 
and unemotional in our investment 
approach and will continue to 
dispose of assets where we think 
growth prospects are less exciting. 
These actions have put us on the right 
side of the changing retail landscape 
and consequently we expect to be 
a strong beneﬁciary. We believe 
that the favourable demand/supply 
metrics for logistics will exist for some 
time, leading to high occupancy, 
long leases and attractive income.
Our portfolio is positioned around 
strong fundamentals of owning highly 
desirable assets that are beneﬁting 
from structural trends, let to good 
companies and where, over time, the 
income will grow and the returns will 
compound. This will allow us to deliver 
ongoing dividend growth over the 
next few years.

three urban logistics reviews with an 
average uplift of 16.9% on a ﬁve yearly 
equivalent basis.
This demonstrates not only the 
attractive dynamics of our buildings but 
increasingly the growing importance 
that occupiers are putting on logistics 
and fulﬁlment.
Structural changes impacting 
shopping habits and 
occupier demand
Technology is disrupting many long 
established industries and real estate 
is no exception.
Structural trends in consumer behaviour 
and shopping patterns continue to 
drive retail sales online leading to c.10% 
per annum online growth. 
Retailers are therefore increasingly 
committing more of their capital 
expenditure into improving the 
efficiencies of their fulﬁlment 
operation with more investment in 
digital infrastructure and distribution 
warehousing. Today, it is estimated 
that retailers and third party logistics 
operators account for 60-70% of all 
distribution warehousing real estate 
take up. 
The benchmark continues to be set by 
Amazon which doubled its UK logistics 
footprint in 2016 and accounted for 
c.20% of take up in 2016. The urban 
logistics infrastructure that they are 
building is evidence of the importance 
they attach to same day, even same 
hour, delivery, something that the rest 
of the market will also have to address 
to stay competitive.
The impact of this evolution on 
traditional retail has never been more 
pronounced and, as retailers seek to 
‘right size’ their store portfolios, their 
demand for physical retail space falls. 
There is clearly going to be pain felt 
across the sector as retailers continue 
to adjust to the growth of online 
shopping. Department stores and 
apparel retailers feel the most at risk, 
and whilst the stronger destinations 
will inevitably fare better, even the 
owners of super-prime locations will 
not be immune, as they have to deal 
with increasing polarisation, impending 
lease expiries, building obsolescence 
and/or tenant defaults. 
The property markets are increasingly 
aware of the shifting tectonic plates 
and are beginning to price in 
these changes.

Behaving as a REIT
With interest rates hovering not far from 
all time lows, and a growing number of 
people retiring every year, the demand 
for alternative sources of income is on 
the rise.
We take comfort in having made the 
right structural calls, focusing on income 
and income growth, and our alignment 
to the logistics sector will continue to 
provide a highly repetitive, predictable 
and reliable income stream and deliver 
exactly what a REIT was designed to do. 
Ten years on from the introduction of 
REITs, it’s notable how few companies 
have fully embraced the REIT structure. 
Our income focus remains central 
to our investment thesis and we aim 
to own assets where the net income 
exceeds the dividend and the 
‘terminal’ value will be higher  
in ﬁve years’ time.
Our ultimate priority is to pass on 
income generated from our tenants 
to our shareholders in the form of a 
dividend. Since merger in 2013, our 
EPRA earnings have grown from 3.9p 
to 8.2p per share, which has allowed 
us to not only cover our dividend 
comfortably but also progress it  
for the second year running.
Enhancing our strong  
portfolio metrics
We continue to maintain our very 
strong portfolio metrics with long 
average lease lengths of 12.8 years, 
high occupancy at 99.6%, high gross 
to net income ratio of 98.6% and with 
only 1.2% of our rent due to expire in 
the next three years. Over 50% of our 
portfolio is now subject to contractual 
rental increases.
Continued reﬁnement of our portfolio 
has delivered a strong performance in 
the year with a total property return of 
7 .4%, outperforming the IPD All Property 
by 280bps, and ERV growth of 3.8%. 
These robust metrics are reﬂective of 
our sector calls, the strength of our 
occupier relationships and the high 
occupier appeal of our real estate.
In the year, we delivered 69 asset 
management activities generating 
like for like income growth of 4.6%. 
New lettings achieved an average 
lease length of 18.2 years, helped 
by new leases to Amazon, Michelin 
and Eddie Stobart. Open market rent 
reviews on distribution assets were 
particularly strong and we settled

Increasing focus 
on urban logistics
As part of our end to end logistics 
strategy, our investment focus in the 
year was on building our platform 
in urban logistics. 
Urban logistics is an essential part 
of modern distribution and enables 
the retailer and parcel operator to 
get closer to its point of delivery and 
fulﬁl orders quickly. Operators are 
increasingly looking to move closer 
to their end customer, albeit there 
are some severe supply constraints.
The functionality of urban logistics 
has evolved from a location which 
previously stored products to an 
operation today that is designed 
to maximise speed of delivery. 
Rising consumer expectations have 
reduced average delivery times 
down from 28 days to just a few days, 
with next day delivery now common.
Looking forward, delivery times are 
likely to fall further as expectations 
grow and more demanding younger 
shoppers, in particular millennials, 
account for a larger proportion of 
retail spend. Half of shopping by 
millennials is expected to be online 
by 2019.
Vacancy across the urban logistics 
market is already very low and new 
supply is very limited, especially 
around the major UK cities. 
According to the UK Warehousing 
Association, there has been a 
46% reduction of industrial space 
across Greater London since 1980. 
This is expected to fall by a further 
30% over the next 20 years. 
Achieving scale in this sub-sector 
is not easy, which in itself creates 
barriers to entry. Over the year, our 
urban logistics portfolio increased 
from eight to 23 assets valued at 
£160.8 million, the majority of which 
are located around major UK cities. 
We have made a further £23.9 million 
of acquisitions since the year end and 
expect this portfolio to grow quickly to 
c.£250 million in value.

Aligning our portfolio further 
towards distribution through 
investment and development
We have been a signiﬁcant beneﬁciary 
of an early move into the logistics and 
distribution sectors where demand/
supply dynamics have strengthened 
considerably over recent years. 
Our strategy is aligned to the structural 
beneﬁts of the distribution sector 
whilst overlaying a tactical approach 
to ensure we invest in the sub sector 
that offers the most compelling 
investment proposition.
After a record year for distribution take 
up in 2016, occupier demand remains 
strong across the UK. Supply remains 
highly restricted, there is limited 
speculative development and 
estimates suggest that there is only 
four to ﬁve years of land available to 
accommodate warehouse demand. 
These macro trends and attractive 
dynamics have seen investor demand 
for the asset class increase globally. 
Despite a more competitive landscape 
we have again made strong progress in 
growing our footprint across this sector, 
whilst remaining patient, disciplined 
and rational. 
Over the year, we acquired a further 
£107 .0 million of new distribution 
investments and developments  
at an average yield of 6.2%.
As at the year end, our distribution 
portfolio was valued at £950.2 million, 
which represented 62% of our whole 
portfolio, against 54% a year ago. 
This has increased to 64% including 
post period end activity.

 Distribution developments completed in the year
0.9m sq ft
 Distribution developments under construction
0.6m sq ft
We have previously commented 
on the very attractive property 
fundamentals underpinning the 
strong pricing of mega and regional 
distribution warehouse investments.
Investing further in that market has 
therefore been less compelling of 
late and we have shifted our sights 
to growing our exposure through well 
located short cycle development 
opportunities, where the returns 
are signiﬁcantly more attractive.
In Wakeﬁeld, our 527 ,000 sq ft 
development completed in 
September 2016. This was pre-let to 
Poundworld on a new 15 year lease 
with contracted rental uplifts linked 
to RPI. 
In Warrington, our 357 ,000 sq ft 
regional distribution development 
completed in November 2016. 
Five weeks later we let the building to 
Amazon on a new 15 year lease with 
contracted rental uplifts linked to CPI. 
We continue to look at reﬁlling our 
development ‘hopper’ but will only 
do so where the demand/supply 
dynamics are attractive and our 
exposure to market timings are short. 
Therefore to minimise development 
risk, we only commit to developments 
once planning consent has been 
received and once pre-lets are 
agreed or where we have strong 
conﬁdence of a letting before 
practical completion.
Today, we are committed to 
0.6 million sq ft of developments 
at Dagenham, Stoke and Crawley 
delivering an anticipated yield on 
cost of 6.2%. We have secured pre-
lettings on over half of the space.
Above: Our 527,000 sq ft development for Poundworld in Wakeﬁeld 
The warehouse was developed at a yield of 6.3%. Poundworld signed a 15 year lease with 
the rent subject to ﬁve yearly compounded RPI rent reviews between 2.5-5.0%. The building 
is rated BREEAM Very Good.
Above: 137,000 sq ft development for Michelin in Stoke 
Michelin has signed a new 15 year lease with ﬁve yearly rent reviews, at the higher of 
open market and guaranteed ﬁxed uplifts. The anticipated yield on cost is 6.3% and we 
are leveraging our occupier relationships to progress a full build out of the 277,000 sq ft 
development. The building will be rated BREEAM Very Good.
This will become a major automated 
fulﬁlment centre for Amazon and will 
employ c.1,200 people.
We also completed a 53,000 sq ft 
distribution facility in Crawley, which 
is let to furniture retailer Barker & 
Stonehouse on a new 15 year lease.

 Retail park disposal at King’s L ynn
Further reducing 
our retail portfolio
Our further push in the distribution 
sector has largely been funded 
by the sale of mature retail parks 
where business plans have been 
fully executed.
Despite the political and economic 
uncertainty, we have continued 
to see strong buying interest for 
our assets with our retail disposals 
totalling £127 .6 million. These disposals 
crystallised a geared IRR, on average, 
of 13%.
As a result of this activity our retail 
park weighting has halved over the 
last two years to 13% of the overall 
portfolio. We will continue to monetise 
further retail assets upon completion 
of various asset management 
initiatives during the year. 
Post year end, we disposed of our 
Morrisons foodstore in Loughborough 
for £32.5 million, reﬂecting a net initial 
yield of 4.3% and a proﬁt on cost 
of 26.0%.
Opportunistic retail acquisitions
We fully recognise the competitive 
nature of the retail market and 
therefore increasingly view this 
sector opportunistically. We will 
therefore limit our involvement to new 
convenience food opportunities and 
those where we partner with our retail 
customers in securing new outlets 
that they consider integral to growing 
their business.
Over the period we completed the 
development of seven convenience 
retail stores mainly let to Aldi and M&S. 
The average yield on cost for all of 
our retail developments was 6.7% and 
the average lease length achieved 
was 13.4 years. 
During the year, we also acquired 
two single let retail assets for our 
long income MIPP Joint Venture at 
an average yield of 6.8% and with 
a lease length of over 15 years.
Above: 74,000 sq ft retail park in King’s Lynn sold for £24.0 million at a NIY of 5.8% 
The property was purchased in 2011 for £15.1 million and has undergone complete 
refurbishment with six new lettings to Next, B&M, DFS, Tapi, Poundland and Greggs. Since 
purchase, the rental income has increased by 47% and the WAULT has risen from 4.3 years 
to 13.3 years.

Finances strengthened 
and diversiﬁed
Our ﬁnancing arrangements remain 
aligned to our property strategy and 
we have continued to strengthen our 
debt facilities with new lenders and 
ﬂexible arrangements. 
During the year, we entered into a 
£130 million private debt placement 
at a blended coupon of 2.7% and 
a weighted average maturity of 
8.3 years. This increased headroom 
available under our facilities which, 
as at 31 March 2017 , was £299.7 million. 
In addition, our £95 million equity raising 
in the year has given us the ﬂexibility to 
accelerate our distribution investments 
and developments without impacting 
on our conservative approach 
to gearing. 
As at 31 March, LTV was 30%, average 
debt maturity was 5.2 years and our cost 
of debt was 3.5% with a marginal cost 
on drawing further debt of just 1.5%.

Our disciplined 
investment approach
We focus on 
achieving attractive 
risk-adjusted returns 
which are structurally 
supported and 
underpin a steady 
long term income 
return proﬁle
The sustained low interest rate and uncertain environment has driven strong 
demand for long duration assets with stable cash ﬂows that are less sensitive 
to economic cycles. 
However, not all income is the same. Whilst strong and sustainable income with 
structural support will endure, weak and over-rented income will be exposed 
as structurally challenged assets see their income shortening. We are therefore 
increasingly wary over the pricing of some assets where cash ﬂows are at risk 
from continuing defensive capital expenditure and ongoing structural change. 
The yield gap between the very good and the poor assets has arguably 
compressed too far. As such we believe that structural changes will put some 
of these capitalisation rates under outward pressure.
Our disciplined investment approach continues to focus on delivering 
attractive risk-adjusted returns which are structurally supported and underpin 
a steady long term income return proﬁle for our shareholders. We will behave 
rationally through maintaining a margin of safety in our actions whilst retaining 
appropriate portfolio liquidity and ﬂexibility. 
We continue to see attractive investment opportunities where we can leverage 
our relationships and expertise, and we remain conﬁdent in our business model 
and ability to deliver on our strategic objectives and priorities.
