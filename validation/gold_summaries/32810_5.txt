Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
I am delighted to join 
Stobart Group at an exciting 
time when the foundations 
in Energy, Aviation and Rail 
are ripe for further 
development and growth. 
I have worked with the 
Group since 2009 during the 
early stages of developing 
London Southend Airport 
when I was Chief Operating 
Officer at easyJet. My 
experience working with this 
entrepreneurial team gave 
me insights into the value 
being created. This sparked 
my interest and led me to 
follow the Group’s progress 
over recent years.
Over the years, I have forged a good 
working relationship with Andrew Tinkler 
and once I left easyJet in September 
2016, I spent three months working very 
closely with Andrew and the Stobart 
Group Board to understand the value of 
the Group but moreover, to see if I could 
use my international experience from my 
early days in Private Equity, through to my 
extensive aviation experience in Europe, 
to support and lead the next chapter for 
the Stobart Group.
I am particularly impressed by how the 
Group applies its heritage in logistics 
and distribution across all the divisions 
as well as how it embraces the customer 
service ethos. When combined with 
being very entrepreneurial, culturally the 
Group fits with my ambitions. I expect to 
use the foundations in Energy, Aviation 
and Rail to continue creating value for 
shareholders over the long-term.
Over the last six months I have very 
much enjoyed working with the Board 
and Andrew but moreover believe there 
is a lot of unlocked value and growth 
potential across our core divisions 
that has yet to be realised. Whilst the 
foundations have been laid in each 
division, with investment and a clear 
strategic direction, the business can 
continue to grow. The Group has all 
the resources available to support 
accelerated growth and then over time 
the operating businesses will underpin 
the value creation for our shareholders. 
Energy
Having now toured several of the 
Group’s processing sites and plants, 
as well as spending time working with 
Ben and the team, I can see that this 
business is all about logistics and 
distribution so fits very well with the core 
expertise of the Group. With several 
of the large energy plants coming on 
stream over the next 12 months there 
will inevitably be a few challenges but I 
am confident that the team will deliver 
on the overall targets. I expect we will 
deliver 60% of the market’s fuel supply 
into biomass plants and this will underpin 
the financial returns for the next 20 
years or so. I also see opportunities to 
grow the business through operating 
and managing the energy plants and 
extending into other forms of fuel that 
can leverage our current specialist 
transport and logistics operation. 
Aviation
Airport – The key to value creation is 
our London airport becoming part of 
the answer to supporting London’s 
travel growth within the airport systems. 
The on-going London airport capacity 
constraints will mean our London airport, 
with its great train links 45 minutes 
from London, will be an opportunity 
for the capital’s travel market to grow. 
London Southend Airport is London’s 
best airport and the infrastructure can 
support 10m+ passengers per year. The 
other differentiator is that Stobart Group 
provides all the services across the 
airport from operating the railway station, 
owning and operating our 4* hotel under 
the Holiday Inn brand, our food and 
beverage outlets, car parking and solar 
farm. These all create additional value for 
the Group and will be an important part of 
further developing London’s best airport. 
There is also a lot of space to develop 
our property assets at the airport which 
could be used for maintenance and 
other businesses. It is truly remarkable 
that we will be able to create a London 
airport capable of delivering 10m+ 
passengers per year for under £200m, 
so the capital efficiency is impressive. 
Airline and Aircraft Leasing – Our regional 
airline, Stobart Air, based in Dublin, 
operates under a long-term franchise 
with Aer Lingus which we believe will be 
an important support for International 
Airlines Group’s focus on growing its 
transatlantic traffic through the Dublin 
hub. Stobart Air also operates for Flybe 
and, in the future, will operate regional 
jets under the Flybe brand to support 
the growth of our London airport. Our 
aircraft leasing business, Propius, 
supports Stobart Air and together they 
will be developed to create more value 
for the Group. From my perspective, 
the UK and Europe’s regional airline 
market would benefit from some type 
of consolidation to ensure the capacity 
supports profitable regional connectivity. 13

Ground Handling and Support Services 
– The Group already provides ground 
handling services and given its 
expertise in logistics, distribution and 
customer services, we plan to grow 
this business in the UK and Europe.
 
Stobart Exec Jet Centre – With c.100,000 
private jet movements into the London 
market per year, our Exec Jet Centre is 
well placed to offer a great service by 
connecting product into London. With 
a clear plan to grow this business, we 
believe over time it will become a key part 
of London’s executive aviation offering. 
The Group is well set-up for growing 
these small but established businesses 
and capitalising on the current 
opportunities in the market. 
Rail and Non-Rail Civil  
Engineering
Our Stobart Rail team is highly regarded 
in the Industry and provides valuable tier 
2 specialist services to Network Rail and 
its tier 1 partners. Its real competitive 
advantage is the team’s innovative 
approach to developing equipment, 
systems and people to deliver significant 
value to the customer. Stobart Rail is 
renowned for operating strongly under 
critical time constraints and delivering 
quality work on time and to budget.
On the non-rail side, the team are 
specialists in building distribution centres, 
airports, racecourses etc. T ogether with 
an innovative approach, design capability, 
planning and low cost execution, they 
provide value engineering across the 
Group. They have supported the Group 
by building processing sites for Stobart 
Energy as well as providing specialist 
infrastructure projects at the airport 
including taxiways, runway works etc. 
This provides the Group with a real 
competitive advantage by being able to 
deliver infrastructure at competitive costs. 
Overall, after a lot of due diligence and 
time spent within Stobart Group, I see 
an opportunity to use the foundations 
to grow the Group over the next few 
years. We will aim to remain a very 
entrepreneurial team with Andrew  
Tinkler supporting as an Executive 
Director to ensure we do not lose 
our “founders mentality” of creating 
value and operating in an agile way. 
This will ensure that we continue 
to grow the business to deliver 
sustainable and progressive returns 
for shareholders for years to come.
