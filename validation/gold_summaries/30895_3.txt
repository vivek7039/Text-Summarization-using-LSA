 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Continuing to deliver
We remain well placed 
to access future 
growth opportunities
We have seen solid progress in 2017 towards 
our objectives of building a significant new mobile 
broadband business with our new Global Xpress 
constellation, as well as investing in establishing 
a leadership position in the largest growth 
opportunity in the commercial satellite sector, 
In-Flight Connectivity for the commercial 
aviation sector. In our core business overall, 
particularly in Maritime, Aviation and Government, 
we have seen solid steady performance in the 
face of growing competition.
OUR RESPONSE TO 
SECTOR HEADWINDS
However, we have been hit with headwinds as well, 
which have negatively affected our share price. 
Some of these derive from issues in the sector 
we are in. Firstly, there is growing overcapacity 
in the fixed satellite space, derived from declining 
video and telecoms revenues, markets we 
are not in. Secondly, companies in the sector 
who are financially stressed have dropped prices. 
As a result of these factors, fixed satellite 
operators are attempting to enter the higher 
growth mobile satellite space where we operate.
We believe these trends were predictable and 
known. It was contemplated as we invested further, 
over the last few years, so as to maintain leadership 
in the mobile satellite sector of commercial 
satellites. The mobile satellite sector is 
fundamentally distinct from the fixed sector and 
the services needed to address this market will take 
many years for competitors to develop. Our moves 
in broadband mobile satellite are made from a 
position of strength in the maritime and aviation 
sectors, where we have had a presence and been a 
leader for decades. These are healthy and growing 
segments in the commercial satellite sector and 
our moves in 2017 and leading into 2018 uniquely 
position us to lead and accelerate growth in these 
emerging opportunities in the years ahead.
OVERVIEW OF OUR 
PERFORMANCE IN 2017
The management team has been following the 
strategic plans outlined in our previous annual 
reports and commented on in our quarterly 
reporting and in 2017 executed well on those 
plans to drive future growth opportunities. 
Major accomplishments for the year include 
two successful satellite launches, a set of 
new service launches across land, sea and air, 
as well as tremendous progress on the build, 
licensing and sales of our soon to be launched 
European Aviation Network. We have built up 
our presence and costs in aviation so that we 
are in a position to successfully support and 
grow that business in the years ahead.
While certainly there were operational and sector 
challenges in 2017, overall the management 
team has executed well and achieved our primary 
strategic objectives for positioning the business 
for growth. This will be laid out in more detail on the 
following pages of this report by Rupert Pearce, 
in his CEO review and in the strategy section.
BALANCING INVESTMENT 
IN GROWTH WITH 
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
In light of this year’s share price performance, 
we have also stood back and assessed our plans 
and performance. We have met extensively with 
shareholders and listened. It is clear from this 
feedback that there is growing concern about the 
impact of our medium to long-term investments 
on the short-term financial performance of the 
business and the implications for our financial 
strength downstream. It is important to emphasise 
that our business remains on a solid footing 
financially and the Board remains supportive of the 
investment path we are on. However, we will continue 
to assess various paths to enhance our progress 
over the short term, as well as the long-term, 
to address the concerns which have been raised.
That brings me to the Board’s decision on the 
dividend going forward. During 2017, particularly in 
the second half of the year, two elements started 
to become clearer. Firstly, the Board’s conviction 
around our opportunity to build our position in the 
emerging and substantial In-Flight Connectivity 
segment continued to grow and, secondly, 
the continued lack of visibility and uncertainty 
around the future cash contribution from Ligado 
Networks. With these factors in mind, particularly 
their potential impact on our short to medium-term 
cash flow profile, the Board took the decision 
to reduce the level of annual (full year) dividend 
payments to shareholders to 20.00 cents ($) 
per share.
Inmarsat is pleased that it has paid over $2.1bn to 
shareholders in dividends since our IPO in 2005. 
However, given the magnitude of solid growth 
opportunities before us and the other reasons 
stated, adjusting our dividend to address this capital 
requirement is in the Company’s best interest.
The dividend will remain at these levels until 
our cash flow grows sufficiently, to make future 
increases in the dividend appropriate. Whilst 
this was an extremely difficult decision for 
the Board to take, we had to ensure the right 
balance between providing our shareholders 
with attractive cash returns and doing what is 
right for the business – in particular, by supporting 
our growth prospects with a clear and targeted 
investment programme.

THE INMARSAT 
INVESTMENT THESIS
Standing back from all of this you can see that 
we are investing with the belief that broadband 
connectivity will greatly expand in the markets 
we serve, those with little or no terrestrial wired 
or wireless connectivity. This of course is at sea, 
in the air and in remote, less densely populated 
environments. This is broadly our investment 
thesis and supports our purpose of ‘enabling 
a connected world’. We believe we are best 
positioned to be a leader in this often overlooked 
global opportunity. Translated to more specifics, 
this means that we believe more consumers on 
aircraft will demand connectivity on their smart 
phone or laptop. We believe that ship owners 
and mariners will have greater increased need 
for high speed connectivity for ships generally 
and also in what is being referred to as ‘Smart’ or 
automated ships. We believe that government 
and aid workers in remote environments, will 
demand the same kind of connectivity they 
experience everywhere else, in order to stay 
connected and function. Our resources are 
focused on investments that ride this trend.
BOARD DEVELOPMENTS
Early last year, two of our long-standing Directors 
retired from the Board, with one having been 
appointed at the time of our IPO in 2005 and 
the second in 2006. We would like to thank 
Stephen Davidson and Kathleen Flaherty for 
their significant contributions to the success 
of Inmarsat over more than a decade.
Joining the Board during 2017 is Warren Finegold. 
Warren has tremendous experience in the 
telecoms sector, having recently retired 
as a senior executive with Vodafone, as well as 
significant experience in investment banking. 
His biography can be found on page 61.
We have asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, a long-standing 
Director at Inmarsat, to stay on the Board, while 
recognising he is no longer deemed independent 
due to his tenure with us. Bryan will continue 
to participate in the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, but no longer as a formal member. 
He will remain as a member of the Telecoms 
Regulatory Committee. The Board however, 
still maintains significantly more than a majority 
of its Directors as independents. We believe that 
Sir Bryan’s contributions and insights continue 
to be extremely valuable for the Inmarsat Board.
Our Board is diverse in experience, gender and 
nationality. For a global technology business 
we believe this is essential to achieving a 
high level performance for the Board, as well 
as the Company as a whole. When we review 
Board succession, and the appointment of new 
Non-Executive Directors, diversity consideration 
is part of the hiring process. We have recently 
published our Gender Pay Report which looks 
across our business to ensure there is no 
unconscious bias in any of our decision making 
and we report separately our UK employee statistics 
to the UK Government. A copy of the report can 
be found on our website. There has been much work 
done during 2017 on our talent management 
and internal succession planning and we are 
delighted progress has been made on these key 
areas to support opportunities for our staff.
We would like to assure our shareholders that we 
strive to meet the highest standards in terms of 
the governance standards we utilise to conduct 
our business. Last year, while our Remuneration 
Policy received a solidly supportive vote, the 
implementation of that Policy however received 
significant opposition. In light of that, we have 
consulted with shareholders and reviewed our 
remuneration implementation. As a result we 
have listened to the comments received and 
made significant changes which are highlighted 
in our Remuneration Report on page 76.
Your Board continues to function well and we 
completed our annual assessment of this during 
the course of 2017. More details are provided 
in the Governance Report on page 56.
SUMMARY
We believe Inmarsat is on the right course 
to continue to grow profit and prosper for our 
customers, staff and shareholders. We have 
maintained our leadership in maritime and 
aviation while making significant unprecedented 
investments to allow us to focus in those sectors 
we believe we can profitably grow. Despite these 
forward looking investments, we remain solid 
financially. However, we need to be mindful of 
financial market concerns for the sector and the 
growing investments required to capitalise on these 
growth opportunities and the Board is focused 
on these areas as part of its 2018 priorities.
We would like to thank our customers for 
continuing to trust and rely on us for their 
often mission critical connectivity. We take our 
commitment to reliability and quality deeply 
seriously, not only for the safety services 
we provide at sea and in the air, but also for our 
commercial services. We also would like to thank 
our staff for their dedication and commitment 
which allows us to continue to succeed. Lastly, 
I would like to thank our shareholders who have 
supported the continued evolution of our business 
into new and essential growth opportunities.
