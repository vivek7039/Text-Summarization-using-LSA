 56 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Letter 
from the 
Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
Overview
During the year, Landsec continued to deliver 
against its business objectives. Our retail  
assets focus on thriving shopping destinations 
and our teams work in partnership with our 
occupiers to deliver a great experience to our 
consumers. Our London assets are prime and 
our regeneration in Victoria has been hugely 
successful. Landsec is in a strong financial 
position, with historically low levels of financial 
and operational gearing and a portfolio of  
first class, enduring assets. 
Board priorities
Given the political events we are witnessing,  
the Board has spent considerable time  
assessing the possible effects on the property

 — Sector leadership in Health, 
Safety and Security.
market of various economic outcomes flowing 
from decisions which might be taken.  
We continue to believe in the sustainability  
of our business model and the deliverability  
of superior relative returns. Our revenue  
profit is up 5.5% and we are confident in the 
underlying strength and prospects for the 
Group. Consequently, we are recommending  
a 10.1% increase in the full year dividend.
We expect a continuation of a wide 
range of technological innovations in the near 
future and we are discussing the speed at 
which they will affect the way we work and 
the requirements for our business and our 
customers’ businesses. Examples of anticipated 
change range from different construction 
techniques and materials, more sophisticated 
building management systems, greater use of 
pre-fabrication, the use of customer data and  Governance

the seamless digital environment which envelops 
us today. The diverse experience of our Directors 
has informed and expanded our debates on 
these matters. 
The Board recognises and, by its own 
example, promotes the importance of a strong 
culture within the organisation and the benefits 
which such a culture brings to the Company and 
its employees. Our recent office move puts our 
people at the centre of our business by providing 
a modern workplace with a cross-functional and 
collaborative atmosphere. I believe we will be a 
more efficient and effective business as a result 
of this move. Furthermore, during the year, Rob 
and his executive team focused on refreshing 
the Company’s brand to ensure that it reflects 
the values of our people and the aspirations  
of our customers. 
We continue to embrace the benefits of 
workforce diversity and the need to prioritise 
the growth of leadership and development skills 
within our teams. Women represent 30% of 
the Board and 36% of the Senior Management 
(including the Executive Committee) but we still 
have work to do on embracing ethnic minorities 
and disabled people. The Board allocates 
significant time on its agenda to succession 
planning and talent development. In all these 
ways, Landsec is and will be better placed to 
address the pace of change.
Shareholders and stakeholders
We are proud of the strength of our investor 
relations programme and during the year I was 
pleased to meet shareholders representing a 
significant percentage of our register in the UK 
and the Netherlands to discuss the business and 
its strategy and answer Board composition and 
succession planning questions. The meetings 
were timely with most being held the week 
following the Brexit vote. We are grateful for 
the time that shareholders set aside for these 
meetings and their feedback is always welcome. 
There were other occasions, at Investor Days 
and results presentations, at which shareholders 
could meet me and our Non-executive Directors.
We have recently completed a detailed 
third party feedback survey of our shareholders 
and were reassured by the positive results. 
In particular, our Senior Management and 
execution capabilities are highly valued. 
Shareholders contributed widely to the survey 
and provided some constructive suggestions 
which we are including in our Board agendas 
and discussions to the extent that they were  
not already part of our normal business. 
Shareholder engagement remains a high  
priority for me and the management team.
We appreciate the impact which a 
company like Landsec can have on a wider 
group of stakeholders. This is reinforced  
by our vision to be the best in the eyes of  
our customers, communities, employees  
and partners, but it goes beyond that.  
The expectations being placed on companies, 
and the ways in which they are being judged, 
are changing rapidly. The Board debates these 
issues when considering specific investments 
and more broadly when looking at future 
opportunities and the role that Landsec can 
play in a wider sense. You will see in other parts 
of this Annual Report examples of how this 
is put into practice throughout the business. 
In our separate Sustainability Report you will 
see how we are building the business for the 
future so that we leave a strong legacy for 
those following us. As part of our contribution 
to the wider issues of governance currently 
under consideration, we responded to the 
Government’s Corporate Governance Green 
Paper and await the outcome of that review 
and other governance initiatives. 
Health, safety and security
The health, safety and security of our customers, 
employees, contractors and visitors remains 
a top priority for us. We work closely with our 
partners and maintain a safety record that 
is well ahead of industry benchmarks. Our 
leadership position over the last year on mental 
health in the construction industry saw us 
recognised with the visit in December to our 
Nova site in Victoria by the Minister of State for 
Disabled People, Health and Work. Reflecting 
the ever-changing threats, we remain vigilant 
on matters of both physical and cyber security.
Board changes and effectiveness
I am delighted to welcome Nicholas Cadbury 
to our Board. Nicholas joined on 1 January and 
brings a wealth of commercial experience that 
will inform our Board discussions. As I said in  
my letter to you last year, Kevin O’Byrne will  
be retiring from the Board later this year 
and, when he does, Nicholas will take over as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee having had 
the benefit of Kevin’s oversight of this year’s 
results. I would like to convey my special thanks 
to Kevin for his nine years on the Board and  
his leadership of the Audit Committee. 
We conducted an internal evaluation  
of our Board’s effectiveness during the year.  
The process followed and outcome of this  
review and its results are set out on page 66.
Looking ahead
At Landsec, we are fortunate to have a  
Board and Senior Management who are  
very experienced and exceptionally well  
qualified. We are engaged with providing 
shareholders with attractive returns whilst  
giving customers a top-class property 
experience. All our employees work hard  
and share our enthusiasm for the business  
and I thank them for their commitment.
Dame Alison Carnwath
Chairman
I was delighted to 
be appointed to 
Landsec’s Board 
and have been 
impressed by the deep 
knowledge throughout 
the Company. My 
induction programme 
has enabled me to 
understand the business 
quickly, to get to know 
my fellow Directors, 
Senior Management 
and key advisers 
right from the outset 
and to get a good 
understanding of the 
opportunities ahead.”
