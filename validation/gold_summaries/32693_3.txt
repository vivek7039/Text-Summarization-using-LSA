 Name change
Let me start out by welcoming 
shareholders to this the ﬁrst Annual 
Report of Ferguson plc. We changed our 
name from Wolseley plc to the name of 
our business in the USA on 31 July 2017 . 
We strongly believe that the Ferguson 
name is much more reﬂective of the 
Group today with 89 per cent of our 
trading proﬁt generated in the USA. 
Board changes
Mike Powell joined the Group as Chief 
Financial Officer (“CFO”) on 1 June 2017 
and he brings a wealth of experience 
having worked in a variety of senior 
ﬁnance positions. He has spent many 
years running large businesses in 
North America which will stand him in 
good stead in his career at Ferguson. 
Dave Keltner’s appointment as Interim 
CFO last year, after 10 years as CFO 
of the USA, enabled us to conduct a 
thorough search for a suitable long-term 
CFO and execute an orderly handover 
of responsibilities to Mike. 
Frank Roach, formerly Chief Executive of 
the USA, also retired this year. Frank had  
a remarkable career with Ferguson, joining 
the business 41 years ago. In particular, 
his tenure as Chief Executive for the 
last eight years has been outstanding, 
achieving sustained rapid growth and 
record trading margins. 
On behalf of the Board I’d like to 
thank both Frank and Dave for their 
signiﬁcant contributions to the Group’s 
success and wish them both long and 
happy retirements.
Kevin Murphy succeeded Frank on 
1 August 2017 . Kevin joined the business 
in 1999 and spent the last 10 years as the 
Chief Operating Officer of the USA. 
He has a great track record of 
driving proﬁtable growth and a deep 
understanding of the business which 
makes him the ideal Executive to drive 
our future growth and development.
While the Group has made excellent 
progress in developing our e-commerce 
platforms, the Board is aware of the need 
to stay vigilant to future potential threats 
and opportunities in the digital space. 
Nadia Shouraboura was appointed 
as a Non Executive Director on 1 July 
2017 and has spent her entire career 
working in and running large international 
e-commerce businesses including eight 
years at Amazon.com Inc. Nadia will 
provide support, challenge management 
and assist in capitalising on the signiﬁcant 
opportunities in the years ahead.
Governance
The Company remains UK-listed and 
meets the requirements of the regulations 
published by the UK Government 
concerning narrative and directors’ 
remuneration reporting. We continue 
to meet these disclosure requirements, 
monitor developments and adopt best 
practice in corporate governance. 
We describe how we have applied the 
UK Corporate Governance Code’s main 
principles in the Governance section of 
this report on pages 50 to 84. The Board 
places great emphasis on providing clear 
and transparent reporting and believes 
this Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Shareholder returns
The Board is committed to maximising 
long-term shareholder value. We are 
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 73.33 
pence per share (2015/16: 66.72 pence 
per share), to be paid on 1 December 
2017 to shareholders on the register 
at 27 October 2017 . 
This will bring the total dividend for the year 
to 110.0 pence per share (2015/16: 100.0 
pence per share) representing a year-on-
year increase of 10.0 per cent. 
Our investment priorities remain focused 
on achieving organic growth, funding 
the ordinary dividend through the cycle 
and investing in bolt-on acquisitions that 
meet our stringent investment criteria. 
The Board has a progressive dividend 
policy for future payouts, with the aim 
of increasing dividends in line with the 
long-term underlying growth in earnings. 
Any surplus cash after meeting these 
investment needs will be returned 
to shareholders. 
Reﬂecting management’s conﬁdence 
in the business and the continuing strong 
cash generation of the Group, the Board 
considers that the Group has surplus 
cash resources available. The Group 
will now commence a £500 million share 
buyback programme with the intention 
to complete this within the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and 
the Group will continue to target net debt 
in the range of 1x to 2x EBITDA, consistent 
with investment grade credit metrics. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank all our associates for their hard work, 
enthusiasm and dedication throughout 
the year. It is the service they provide 
that delivers continually improving results 
for the Group and creates value for 
customers, suppliers and shareholders 
every year. 
Gareth Davis
Chairman

impetus to the rapid execution of our strategy, in particular prioritising 
investment and focus on our largest growth opportunity in the USA,
