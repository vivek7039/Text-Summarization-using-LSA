 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
In my last year as Chairman, I am pleased to report 
another robust performance for NWF and continued 
investment in the strategic development of the 
Group. Over the last ten years we have seen solid 
progress from the Group with revenue up from 
£361 million to £556 million, headline profit before 
tax up from £4.0 million to £8.5 million, headline 
earnings per share up from 5.8p to a record 14.0p 
this year and dividend per share up from 3.9p per 
share to 6.0p per share. Over the same period net 
debt has fallen from £52 million to £13 million.
During the year, strong performances from 
Food and Fuels more than offset the challenging 
conditions experienced in the Feeds market. 
Food remained at full capacity, operated efficiently 
and delivered more loads whilst maintaining 
service levels at 99.7%. Fuels increased volumes 
significantly, more than offsetting the impact of the 
mild weather in the first half with growth across the 
depot network and the successful development 
of our cold starts in the South East. Feeds volumes 
were stable, with growth in line with the market but, 
with increasing commodity costs, margins were 
under pressure and the business was not able 
to fully pass on these increases during the year. 
The capability of the Group to deliver sustainable 
growth whilst experiencing tough trading 
conditions due to its diversified operations has 
again been demonstrated. The continued ambition 
of the Group has been shown by the significant 
investment in the feed mills in the North and in 
Cheshire. Strong cash generation has allowed 
this investment in the year whilst maintaining 
a satisfactorily low level of net debt and a robust 
balance sheet position.
In 2017, the capability of the 
Group to deliver sustainable 
growth due to its diversified 
operations has again 
been demonstrated.
I am pleased to report 
another robust performance 
for NWF and continued 
investment in the strategic 
development of the Group.
OVERVIEW As a consequence of the good progress achieved 
and the Group’s strong cash generation, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 5.0p per share 
(record date: 3 November 2017; payment date: 
4 December 2017) (2016: 4.7p) giving a total 
dividend of 6.0p per share (2016: 5.7p), a 5.3% 
increase on the prior year.
Our business
NWF Group is a specialist agricultural and 
distribution business delivering feed, food and fuel 
across the UK. Each of our trading divisions has 
scale and good market position, and is profitable 
and cash generative. Each division trades under 
different brands with their own brand architecture 
as follows:
 » Feeds: NWF Agriculture, S.C. Feeds, 
New Breed and Jim Peet 
 » Food: Boughey
 » Fuels: NWF Fuels (including a number of local 
sub-brands) 
Key areas of focus for the Board in 2017 were:
Investing in strategic development
The Group has invested in significantly increasing 
the capacity and improving efficiency of the mill 
at Longtown in Cumbria, which was acquired 
with the Jim Peet business in 2016. In parallel the 
blending facility at Wardle has been automated 
which improves the production capacity for this 
growing segment of the market and increases 
efficiency. Both were completed during the year, 
albeit the Longtown facility was delayed by a few 
months and so incurred some additional 
exceptional costs in the year.
Responding proactively to market conditions
The Group has responded effectively to some 
challenging market conditions in the year. In Feeds 
the year started with low milk prices and whilst 
feed volumes recovered with milk price increases, 
the volatility in the commodity and foreign exchange 
markets led to significant cost increases, which the 
business endeavoured to pass on to the market. 
In Food, further efficiencies have been gained 
from ensuring loads are ready for dispatch ahead 
of time and improved backload revenue was 
delivered. In Fuels, in spite of a mild first half, the 
business has delivered increased volumes and 
improved margins on key product lines to offset 
the impact of lower demand for heating oil.
Cash generation
Cash generation remains a priority for the Group 
and a further sustainable improvement in working 
capital has been achieved in Feeds that has been 
managed sensitively at a time of recovery in the 
dairy market. 
Rewarding good service
The consistent focus on excellence in customer 
service across the Group has been critical to our 
continued development. It has enabled volume 
gains to be achieved in each of the three divisions 
in the year.
Commodity volatility 
Volatility in the commodity markets impacted the 
Group’s performance in 2017. In Fuels, oil (which 
is purchased on the spot market) moved between 
$42 per barrel and $57 per barrel for Brent Crude 
with further volatility resulting from exchange rates. 
In line with market practice, Feeds buys its raw 
materials under forward purchase contracts. 
Significant increases in feed input commodities in 
the year impacted margins as price increases were 
implemented after cost inflation was experienced.
Board changes
My thanks go to all who have supported NWF 
throughout the year both inside and outside 
the Group. 
I am delighted that Philip Acton, Non-Executive 
Director, will be taking over from me as the 
Chairman of NWF Group, with effect from the 
Annual General Meeting in September. Philip has 
extremely valuable experience in listed agricultural 
businesses and has gained a good understanding 
of NWF since joining the Board almost four years 
ago. In addition, as previously announced, Lorraine 
Clinton will join the Board in September and brings 
a strong operational and commercial background 
which adds complementary skills to the Board. 
Chris Belsham, Finance Director, joined the Board in 
April 2017 and this completes the transition process 
for the Board to whom I wish the best for the future.
Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the Executive team, 
many of whom have worked with me during the 
entire 11 years that I have chaired the Board. 
As a group, they have displayed that combination 
of commitment, hard work, vision, humanity and 
humour that has made my job rewarding and 
NWF successful.
I look forward to updating shareholders on the 
Group’s continuing progress at the time of the 
Annual General Meeting on 28 September 2017.
