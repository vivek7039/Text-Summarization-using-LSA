Our story
The HSS Hire Group is a leading provider of tools, 
equipment and related services in the UK and 
Ireland. Our nationwide network ensures easy 
access to an extensive range that has grown to 
include specialist capabilities including power 
solutions business, ABird and powered access 
provider, UK Platforms.
Focused on delivering Safety, Value, Availability and Support, 
we work predominantly with ‘business-to-business’ customers 
in the ‘fit-out’, maintain and operate sectors. We are dedicated 
to helping them all work safely, efficiently and cost-effectively.
Our team of HSSers are the reason we are able to deliver a hire 
experience that, we believe, is the best in the industry so we are 
committed to making sure they have the skills and support they 
need to flourish.
We take a responsible approach to the way we conduct all 
business activities and we are ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 
18001, CHAS and SafeHire Certified. 
We are delighted to share our story with you.
Our network: 
UK and Ireland
During 2017 we closed a 
number of branches across 
the network due to lower 
Rental revenue growth 
and a loss of focus on 
our Tool Hire business. 
We now have branches in more than 
250 locations, and following recent 
network reconfiguration changes, 
we will now be able to provide a 
greater availability of services to our 
customers across the UK and Ireland. 
This will include the expansion of test 
and run into all HSS branches and 
customer distribution centres (CDCs) 
and more intensive repair into a 
number of strategically located 
workshop CDCs. In addition the 
workshop CDCs will link to a national 
cross dock centre in Oxford that will 
enable the overnight movement kit 
to service our customers delivery 
requirements between all of our 
CDCs in England and Wales.

Support
Safety is our priority and we work hard to ensure 
the safety of our customers and the equipment 
we hire to them as well as supporting their own 
progress towards ‘Zero Harm’ and ‘Target Zero’ 
goals. We drive safer product design throughout 
our supply chain – such as the unique anti-
entrapment system Activ’Shield on our UK Platform 
diesel booms – and we ensure that every single bit 
of kit is robustly maintained and tested through 
strictly controlled processes before every hire so 
it is always safe to use. Our dedicated training 
division, HSS Training, offers over 260 industry-
recognised technical and safety courses that cover 
equipment operation and safe working practices. 
Making sure our customers have ready availability 
of the kit they need, when and where they need  
it is key to our service offering, enabling us to 
guarantee that they can order by 7pm and get by 
noon the next day. We have a multi-channel offer 
that includes online and call centre ordering for 
delivery or collection as well as a strategically 
positioned branch network, stocked with the 
most popular kit ready to take away. 
To make sure our customers receive value from 
their hire, we work with them to drive down ‘the 
true cost of hire’ – providing reliable equipment 
and an excellent service as well as helping them  
to understand, manage and control their costs. 
We continue to invest in our fully transactional 
e-commerce platform and Remote Fleet 
Management systems, which help customers 
to better manage hire volumes and durations 
as well as saving them time. In 2017 , we continued 
to underpin our commitment to value with a 
simplified pricing structure. 
Supporting our customers is about making life 
easier for them. We offer a range of hire-related 
services to help our customers and which 
includes a Managed Service Provider offer that 
enables us to manage the complex supply chains 
of some of our larger customers. We also support 
our customers by ensuring that – from recruiting 
the right people to providing them with ongoing 
training and development – our colleagues are 
better equipped with the skills and knowledge 
they need to provide an excellent hire service.
