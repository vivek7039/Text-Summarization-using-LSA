 Maintaining strong leadership
This is my last statement as Chairman 
as I shall be retiring at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting in May. 
I was appointed as Chairman to guide the Company through 
the IPO and its early years as a listed entity, and to establish 
a strong Board to underpin the Company’s future growth 
and development. Whilst no formal timeframe was set for 
my tenure, I feel that having successfully achieved those 
objectives, it is now the right time for me to retire as Chairman. 
As announced in January this year, Gary Hoffman who joined 
the business as Chief Executive Officer in November 2012, will 
succeed me as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. 
Succession planning has been high on the Board’s agenda as 
it seeks to sustain the Group’s growth and development. The 
Board therefore prioritised various considerations as part 
of the succession process; primarily continuity and stability, 
together with the need for strong independent governance and 
effective strategic leadership. 
The Board is aware of the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) in that a Chief Executive should not 
go on to be Chairman of the same company but, after full and 
careful consideration, the Directors agreed unanimously that 
Gary’s transition from Chief Executive Officer to Chairman would 
be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Gary has been a key individual in the Group’s success, not only 
in the years leading up to the IPO, but in the period since, which 
has seen nine successive quarters of profitable growth. The 
Board therefore regarded retaining Gary’s services as critical to 
the Group’s continued success. Gary has extensive experience of 
chairing various boards, notably having served as Vice-Chairman 
of Barclays plc, Chairman of Barclay’s UK Banking division and 
Barclaycard, and currently serves as Non-Executive Chairman 
of VISA Europe. Gary will not chair or be a member of any Board 
Committees and Tom Colraine, Senior Independent Director, 
will be appointed as Chairman of the Company’s Nomination 
Committee from 1 March 2018. 
“ The changes to the 
Board leave the Company 
in very safe hands to 
enable its continued 
success for the benefit 
of all stakeholders.”

Hastings Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2017
12 | Chairman’s statement In anticipation of Gary’s appointment 
as Chairman, Toby van der Meer, who 
has been the Managing Director of 
the Company’s UK trading subsidiary, 
Hastings Insurance Services Limited 
since 2011, will be appointed to the 
Board with effect from 1 March 2018 as 
Chief Executive Officer. Toby has played 
a pivotal role in the significant growth 
and development of the Group’s retail 
business over the past six years and is a 
well respected leader within the Group. 
I congratulate both Gary and Toby on 
their appointments. 
In my statement last year, I explained 
that on 1 March 2017, Rand Merchant 
Investment Holdings Limited (RMI), 
a South African investment holding 
company acquired 29.9% of the 
Company’s issued share capital. Under 
the terms of a relationship agreement 
between RMI and the Company, as 
long as RMI holds at least 15% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, RMI is 
entitled to appoint one Director to the 
Company’s Board. Herman Bosman, 
Chief Executive Officer of RMI was 
appointed as a Director of the Company 
on 14 March 2017 and at the same time; 
Michele Titi-Cappelli (representative of 
the Goldman Sachs Shareholders) and 
Edward Fitzmaurice (representative of 
the Founder Shareholders), resigned 
as Directors.
On behalf of the Board, I welcome 
Herman as a Director who brings a 
wealth of experience in the insurance 
and banking sectors. In August this year, 
Richard Brewster, also a representative of 
the Founder Shareholders, resigned as a 
Director. He was succeeded by Founder 
Shareholder nominee, Selina Sagayam in 
August this year. I express my gratitude 
to Michele, Edward and Richard for their 
contribution as Directors of the Company 
and welcome Selina. 
The diversity of the Board was also 
reviewed by the Nomination Committee 
and a detailed explanation of the 
Board approved policy on diversity is 
set out in that Committee’s report on 
page 79. As announced on 2 February 
2018, Malcolm Le May tendered 
his resignation as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company following his 
appointment as Group Chief Executive 
Officer of Provident Financial plc. The 
date on which Malcolm’s resignation will 
become effective has yet to be decided 
and the Company is in discussions 
regarding an appropriate period 
of notice.
When the Company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange in 2015, it was 
not fully compliant with the Code due to 
the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee. This non-compliance was as 
a result of the requirement of the major 
shareholders at the time of the IPO  
to be represented on this Committee;  
this stipulation was part of the 
relationship agreement between  
the Company and these shareholders. 
The Board agreed that the independence 
of the Remuneration Committee was 
not compromised as it has had an 
independent Chairman and a majority 
of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Following discussions with 
the shareholders in question, I am 
pleased to announce that they have 
no longer nominated Directors to the 
Remuneration Committee and the 
composition of this Committee is  
now fully Code compliant.
Further information on the changes 
to the composition of the Board and 
its Committees are covered within the 
Corporate Governance section later on 
in this report.
Optimising shareholder value – 
dividends 
The Board remains confident in the 
Group’s long term prospects and is 
pleased to propose a final dividend of 
8.5p per share. This dividend will be 
paid on 31 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register on 4 May 2018 with an 
ex-dividend date of 3 May 2018. This 
is the Company’s second dividend for 
the year having paid 4.1p per share in 
November, taking the full year dividend 
to 12.6p per share. This final dividend is 
subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 
24 May 2018.
Farewell
It has been a pleasure to serve as 
Chairman of the Company and to 
oversee its early years as a publicly listed 
company. The changes to the Board 
will leave the Company in very safe 
hands to enable its continued success 
for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
I thank Gary, his management team 
and all of the colleagues at Hastings 
for their hard work, commitment 
and dedication contributing to the 
profitable and sustainable growth of 
the Group to date. I would also like 
to thank our shareholders for their 
support throughout my tenure. I remain 
confident that the Group will continue to 
deliver long-term value and returns for 
shareholders.
