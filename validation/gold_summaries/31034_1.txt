Chief Executive’s Review
Market Context
I am pleased to report a strong performance for the Group. 
The Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (‘RMI') market 
has been subdued during 2017, particularly during the 
second half, reflecting low consumer confidence. We have 
experienced an almost perfect storm of macro factors, 
including increasing political and economic risk, the first 
interest rate rise in ten years, worsening house price data, 
low real wage growth and a weak pound driving material 
cost inflation.
Against this more challenging backdrop, we have made 
excellent progress with our strategic priorities, continued to 
invest significantly in the growth of our business and made 
further gains in market share.
Financial Performance
We have reported robust financial results for 2017 and 
delivered higher revenues and profits.
Overall, sales growth was good at 8% (excluding 
acquisitions). Growth was driven by our specifications 
teams, which have continued to be successful in 
generating demand for our products with architects and 
planning authorities in the private new build sector, and by 
the continued expansion of our branch network.
Profitability was solid, having been impacted by  
the weaker second-half markets and increasing  
cost inflation we have seen for resin, other 
raw materials and traded goods. We are  
implementing selling price increases to  
mitigate pricing pressure where possible,  
but the market does lag supplier price  
increases, so there is a delay in capturing  
the benefit. We continue to manage our  
underlying operating costs tightly, whilst 
progressing further our strategic priorities 
and investing in business expansion.
As a result, adjusted profit before tax was  
£24.5 million (2016: £24.3 million) and  
reported profit before tax was £23.7 million  
(2016: £23.8 million). Further information  
on financial performance is provided in 
the Divisional and Group Financial Reviews.
Operational Performance
Health and safety
The safety and well-being of our employees and 
contractors is our first operational priority. We continue  
to maintain good health and safety performance.  
We recorded one major injury in 2017 (cut to an employee’s 
hand) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (‘RIDDOR’).
We noted in our 2017 Half-Year Report that the Health and 
Safety Executive (‘HSE’) intended to take action against the 
Company, following a minor accident to an employee in 
August 2016. The matter has now been concluded, 
resulting in a fine of £68,000 under the Health and Safety 
at Work Act.
Further details of our safety performance are included in 
Corporate and Social Responsibility.
Production
We delivered another consistent production performance 
in 2017. We manufactured approximately 44.4k tonnes of 
rigid and foam PVC profiles at our primary extrusion 
facilities, up from 40.9k tonnes in 2016, an increase of 9%.
We believe that our proven 
strategy and capabilities  
will enable Eurocell to deliver  
value to our customers  
and Shareholders.”

(2) OEE is a measure which takes into account machine availability, performance

Planned initiatives aimed at mitigating raw material cost 
inflation lead to increased scrap and lower OEE levels. 
These include increased trials of alternative materials, 
including resin from potential new suppliers and other 
materials used in the extrusion process (e.g. compound 
stabilisers), as well as tests of new technologies  
(e.g. tooling) to support increasing the use of recycled 
material in the extrusion process.
Recycling
In 2017 we used 8.3k tonnes of recycled compound 
alongside virgin resin in the manufacture of many of our  
rigid PVC products in our primary extrusion processes.  
This represents 17% of material consumption, up from  
14% in 2016, an increase of approximately 2k tonnes.

Our efforts to secure increased supplies of in-feed stock for 
the recycling plant are proving successful, with collections 
up 15% in 2017. Initiatives include back-hauling material from 
our fabricator, installer and branch networks.
Information on our recent investments in recycling and 
objective to increase further the use of recycled materials is 
described in Strategic Priorities below.
Warehouse logistics
We reported last year that, following a period of outsourcing, 
the operation of our main warehouse facility was brought 
back in-house with effect from February 2017.
We have worked to understand how the arrangements 
could be better structured to deliver a more efficient 
operation and improved customer service levels. We have 
made good progress, with on-time in-full deliveries 
increasing to 96%, compared to 91% in 2016. Initiatives 
include shorter production run times and revised warehouse 
shift patterns, with picking and relationship teams assigned 
to specific key accounts.
Whilst we have incurred some incremental cost as a result 
of these changes, we believe that the primary benefit of 
improved customer service has been a critical factor in 
maintaining the loyalty of our existing customer base and  
in supporting the winning of new accounts. 10 EUROCELL PLC

Strategic Priorities
As described in Our Strategy on page 20, our overall objective 
is to deliver sustainable growth in Shareholder value by 
increasing sales and profits at above our market level  
growth rates.
We have five clear strategic priorities to help us achieve our 
overall objective. We are making good progress with all of 
our strategic priorities, with the key aspects detailed below.
Target growth in market share
Our aim is to increase our share of the PVC profiles market 
to utilise the spare manufacturing capacity in our extrusion 
facilities. The effect of this is such that, whilst new volume 
could be dilutive to gross margin in the short term, the net 
margin on these sales should be attractive.
In order to deliver the incremental volume, we have been 
targeting the new build, commercial and public sectors,  
as well as a number of larger trade fabricators. In doing so,  
we emphasise why Eurocell is different: we have a strong single 
brand, good customer service and a leading recycling 
capability, all of which are attractive to customers. In addition, 
expanding the branch network pulls through demand for our 
manufactured products, thereby exploiting the spare capacity.
After a slow start in the first half of 2017, we have made 
good progress winning accounts since the summer. Sales 
have started to come through from customers who have 
recently moved onto our product systems, with more new 
accounts contracted for 2018.
Expand our branch network
Expanding the branch network secures sales growth and 
delivers good returns in the medium term, as new branches 
begin to mature. It also provides an increasing opportunity 
for sales of windows and other high-value products through 
the branch network, and (as noted above) pulls through 
demand for our manufactured products.
I am very pleased to report that we opened 31 branches in 
2017, which is a record number of new sites introduced by 
Eurocell in a 12-month period (2016: 18 new branches). 
This represents a significant investment in the expansion  
of our business, taking the total estate to 190 branches at 
the year end. We also launched a new and improved 
branch format with more products on display, and added 
new product lines to the range, to help meet our objective 
of becoming a one-stop shop for customers.
The cost of investing in new branches does create 
downward pressure on profitability in the near term as the 
new sites work towards a break-even position. Historically 
it has taken more than two years for a new branch to reach 
a break-even run-rate. We have been running trials to 
reduce start-up costs and shorten the time to break-even 
for the branches opened in 2017, with initiatives based on 
more focused direct marketing campaigns and sharing 
resources with established sites in the same region. The 
trials have gone well and there have been some key 
learnings. There is more work to do in this area, particularly 
with respect to the branches opened in 2016, but we are 
confident that, in future, new branches should reach a 
break-even run-rate before their two-year anniversary.
Our intention remains to develop an estate of approximately 
250 branches in the medium term. Subject to the success of 
the current programme, consideration of the sites available, 
potential branch maturity and sales saturation rates, we 
continue to believe that an estate of around 350 sites is a 
realistic long-term aspiration for Eurocell.
However, in order to allow the team to consolidate the 
existing estate, complete the work on reducing break-even 
times and maximise the sales of high value items through 
the whole branch network, we have revised down our short 
term target for new sites and plan to open up to 15 
branches in 2018.
Increase the use of recycled materials
The work to increase the use of recycled materials in our 
primary extrusion manufacturing processes is becoming 
even more important in the face of continued raw material 
cost inflation, particularly for PVC resin.
Average resin prices increased by 13% in 2017 and by 
approximately £150 per tonne over the last two years, 
driven by a combination of currency movements (largely 
weak Sterling) and underlying commodity price changes 
(rising oil and ethylene). This has resulted in a widening gap 
between the cost of virgin PVC compound and our 
recycled compound, making the case for further 
investment in recycling more compelling.
During the course of 2016 and 2017 we invested 
approximately £1.8 million in a project to increase our 
recycling capacity, which has boosted usage in primary 
extrusion from 9% (4.1k tonnes) of material consumption  
in 2015 to 17% (8.3k tonnes) in 2017.
Looking forward, we intend to invest to expand again  
our recycling capacity. As a result, we expect usage in 
primary extrusion to increase to around 20% in 2018 
(approximately 10k tonnes), driving a substantial saving 
compared to the cost of using virgin material.
Beyond that we will continue to evaluate opportunities to 
increase further our recycling capacity in the years ahead.

Explore potential bolt-on acquisitions 
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of 
Security Hardware, a supplier of locks and hardware 
primarily to the RMI market. Annual sales at acquisition 
were approximately £3 million.
The integration of Security Hardware is now substantially 
complete. The extensive product range (over 3,000 stock 
keeping units (‘SKUs'), covering the major hardware brands 
and an own label offering, Schlosser Technik) is now 
available through our branch network, supporting our 
objective to be a one-stop shop for anything window related 
for our customers. This also allows us to better engage with 
facilities management companies and other large 
maintenance contractors.
We are developing a range of hardware to complement our 
window profile. This will enable our fabricator customers to 
offer a fully certified common specification of window 
(including hardware), giving Eurocell the opportunity to 
target a greater share of the new build market and grow 
sales of windows through branches. We expect the 
hardware range to be available later in 2018.
We will continue to assess and consider bolt-on acquisition 
opportunities in the markets in which we operate. Our 
focus is principally on businesses that add value through 
range extension, operational efficiencies or added value 
products, or to satisfy a make-or-buy decision.
Outlook
We have made excellent progress with our strategic 
priorities in 2017, continued to invest significantly in the 
growth of our business and made further gains in  
market share.
Profit was impacted by raw material cost inflation and a 
subdued RMI market, especially in the second half. 
However, the benefits of our differentiated business model 
are becoming increasingly evident. I expect the significant 
investments we are making in the Group to deliver further 
gains in market share and allow Eurocell to take more 
control of material costs in the future.
Looking ahead, our focus for 2018 will be on optimising our 
existing branch network and expanding further our 
recycling capability. Whilst our markets remain challenging 
and raw material price inflation continues, we are in a 
strong financial position and sales in the first two months 
are in line with our expectations.
In summary, we believe that our proven strategy and 
capabilities will enable Eurocell to deliver value to our 
customers and Shareholders throughout 2018 and beyond.
