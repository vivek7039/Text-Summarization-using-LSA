Chairman’s statement
It has been a year of further progress for AO, with strategic 
developments on many fronts. 
AO has continued on its mission to become the best electrical retailer 
in Europe delivering on all aspects of its four pillar strategy, the 4Cs:
 – Developing new countries; 
 – Rolling out new categories in existing and new countries;
 – Delivering a market-leading proposition to customers; and
 – Developing and protecting our unique culture that underpins 
our brand.
Over the period, AO has established a new fully operational 
35,000 sq. metre Regional Distribution Centre in Bergheim, serving 
Germany and the Netherlands (which has now been trading for a full 
year); successfully launched new categories – audio‑visual (“AV”) in 
Germany and computing in the UK; maintained consistently high 
customer metrics and furthered our brand awareness.
In the last quarter of the financial year the Board reviewed the capital 
structure of the Group and raised, shortly after year end, c.£50m via a 
placing of new shares. This capital injection strengthens the balance 
sheet, provides flexibility to react to market opportunities and changes 
and, importantly, suitably capitalises the business to support our 
continued growth and increasing scale.
We have delivered another good year of top-line growth albeit with 
a challenging second half of the year which meant we missed our 
internal expectations. Group revenue increased by 17% to £701.2m. 
Year-on-year UK revenue was up 12.7% to £629.7m (with AO branded 
sales accounting for £557.9m, up 14.5% year on year). Revenue for our 
European segment was £71.5m/€84.7m; up 52.3% year on year on 
a constant currency basis.
Group Adjusted EBITDA losses for the period were £2.1m marking 
an improvement against prior year losses of £3.9m, with strong 
performance from the UK business more than offset by the trading 
losses incurred in our Europe business as we continue to build scale 
and achieve critical mass. UK Adjusted EBITDA was £24.4m, up 41.7% 
from the prior year and Europe Adjusted EBITDA losses were £26.5m, 
an increase of 25.5% against the prior year. On a statutory basis, our 
operating losses were £12m (such losses increasing 13.4% year on year 
due mainly to the share-based payment charge this year (with a credit 
in 2016)). Cash at year end was c.£29.4m, before taking account of net 
placing proceeds, which were received just a few days after the year end.
In February we announced a transition in our Executive Director roles, 
with Steve Caunce taking over as CEO and John Roberts assuming the 
role of Founder. This was a natural evolution and the Board is confident 
that Steve is the right person to take on the role from John to deliver the 
significant growth potential of the Group. John’s new role will enable 
him to continue to play to his strengths as an innovator and a visionary 
leader, helping develop and test high level strategy. Steve and John 
remain very much a partnership and together they will ensure that AO 
continues to deliver for customers, colleagues, suppliers and our investors.
There have also been some changes to the Board’s Non-Executive 
composition, following the retirement of Rudi Lamprecht as a 
Non-Executive Director and we are looking to appoint two further 
Non-Executives to the Board over the next few months. Further details 
are set out in the governance section on page 52.
In summary, the Group has continued to make good progress against its 
strategy. Whilst the Board continues to be cautious given the uncertain 
UK economic outlook and broadly expects the patterns of trading seen 
in the second half of FY2017 to continue into the year ahead (with UK 
business profits being reinvested in our European operations) the Board 
is confident of achieving its stated goals over the years ahead. 
Since taking the role of Chairman in July 2016 I have been impressed by 
the quality and enthusiasm of the Executive Directors and of the teams 
of people that support them and I look forward to working with them on 
their way to become the Best Electrical Retailer in Europe.
