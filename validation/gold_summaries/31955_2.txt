Markets
A unique investment 
approach
Highly diversified  
client base
Ashmore has a strong investment track record 
established over 25 years of focusing on the 
opportunities available in Emerging Markets.
 – Emerging Markets account for the majority of the 
world’s population (87%) and GDP (58%) yet only a small 
proportion (20%) of the world’s debt
 – The structural growth opportunity is therefore 
substantial and inefficient asset classes mean specialist, 
active management is key to delivering superior 
investment returns
Attractive long-term investment returns
