Alternative Performance Measures
The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) as key financial performance indicators (KPIs) to assess underlying performance of the Group. The APMs used are widely used 
industry measures, form the measurement basis of the key strategic targets (return on net operating assets** and operating profit* margin) and are linked directly to executive remuneration. 
All references to adjusted operating profit or operating profit throughout this report meet the definition of an APM.
Definitions of the APMs discussed throughout this Annual Report and Accounts, and a reconciliation to the equivalent statutory measure, are detailed on pages 148 to 150.
