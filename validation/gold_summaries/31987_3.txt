CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
Ian Gilham, Ph.D.
Chairman
genedrive plc is well 
positioned for growth  
in the rapidly growing  
point of need molecular 
testing market.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that 2016/17 has seen us make further 
progress on our journey to refocus the Company on the 
highly attractive opportunities which the Genedrive® 
diagnostics platform offers in the rapidly growing market for 
decentralised, near patient diagnostic tests.
Key Achievements
A major focus for the year was the development of our 
Genedrive® HCV ID Kit. With the advent of new ‘curative’ 
direct acting antiviral treatments for Hepatitis C (HCV), there 
is a major opportunity to tackle the global burden of the 
disease if accurate, decentralised diagnostics can be used 
to identify those living with HCV and give them access to 
therapy.
Our Genedrive® HCV ID Kit was submitted for CE 
registration in April 2017 based on excellent performance 
data from clinical validation studies. Post year end, I am 
delighted that we obtained CE marking, a vital first step to 
commercialization.
We are also delighted to have entered into a distribution 
agreement with Sysmex Europe to target the commercial 
HCV opportunity in Africa. The agreement covers the EMEA 
region with an initial focus on multiple countries in Africa. 
Working together the two companies will focus on securing 
the required regulatory approvals and we anticipate 
commercial traction during the 2017/18 financial year.

Other Activities
The pathogen detection programme with the US DoD 
contributed significantly to the current year revenues and 
included shipments of Genedrive® units and assays for field 
use testing. Post year end we also received confirmation 
that following successful evaluations, the programme will be 
entering its next phase, worth $1.4m in development income 
and $0.5m in product sales to be recognised in the year to 
30 June 2018. 
As previously announced, we encountered a specific 
sample preparation problem relating to a supplier 
component in the MTB/RIF test. An alternative solution had 
been successfully tested in Indian laboratories however we 
have had difficulty assessing the impact of this through our 
commercial partner. In the light of these challenges, we are 
considering how best to address the Indian MTB/RIF market 
and the broader potential of Genedrive® in this area. As 
stated in the trading statement of 13 July 2017, no additional 
short term revenues were expected from MTB/RIF in India. 
However, the TB market is large and there is significant 
potential for Genedrive®.
Away from our core human healthcare focus, we enjoyed 
success with funded field trials of Genedrive® for white-spot 
disease detection in farmed shrimp. The results validated 
Genedrive®’s potential as a rapid cost effective system for 
disease detection in animals. The Company however 
remains focused on the human health market and will only 
pursue this opportunity further if a commercial partner can 
be identified.
With modest investment the Services division continued to 
contribute to the Group. Revenues and operating margin 
were up on the same period last year. The Board wishes to 
see the division divested and discussions are ongoing in 
order to pursue that as a strategic aim and thereby secure 
additional investment capital for Genedrive®. While we 
remain optimistic that an appropriate divestment can be 
secured, we believe the division can continue to contribute 
to the Group should a sale not be secured. 
Governance and People
Strong governance and values are vitally important to the 
success of the Company and the Board remains focused on 
ensuring its own effectiveness and that of the governance 
processes throughout the Company. The Board has recently 
gone through some changes. John Rylands, stepped down 
from the Board in November 2016 and we thank him for his 
excellent contribution to the Company and wish him well for 
the future. Matthew Fowler joined the Board on 
13 December 2016 in his role as Chief Financial Officer. 
Matthew brings to the role strong business skills and 
extensive experience in listed businesses, which are already 
proving of great benefit to the Company.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our staff and 
extend this thanks to our investors and customers for their 
commitment and support. We look forward to updating 
investors during the year on further progress and delivery 
against our strategic objectives.
