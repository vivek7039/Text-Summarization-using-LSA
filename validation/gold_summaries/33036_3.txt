 Your company has continued to make good
progress this year – delivering strong
ﬁnancial results while continuing to
transform the business. New wave revenues
grew by 30% to £3,387 million.
Earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, grew by 19% to 16.9 pence –
almost doubling in two years. While continuing to
invest for the future, we generated free cash ﬂow of
over £2 billion and reduced net debt to £8.4 billion – a
reduction of two thirds on the level of three years ago.
Our business
Your company continues to make progress by
innovating in our traditional markets and by growing
revenues in all the new wave markets – ICT
(information and communications technology),
broadband, mobility and managed services – in which
we operate. We continue to invest where we believe it
will make the greatest difference, while achieving
rigorous standards of cost efﬁciency and smarter
working practices.
Returns to shareholders
Although long-term shareholder return remains the key
measure of our success, our share price performance
this year has not been strong. Earnings per share
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
have risen well, but this has yet to be reﬂected in our
share price.
However, total shareholder return also includes the
dividend, and here the news for shareholders is
positive.
We are recommending a full year dividend of
8.5 pence per share. Reﬂecting BT’s commitment to a
progressive dividend policy, the dividend pay out ratio
for the 2004 ﬁnancial year was around 50% of
earnings before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items. The full year dividend is 31% up on last year,
and over four times higher than two years ago. We are
targeting a 60% pay out ratio in 2005/06.
The strong cash ﬂow generated by the group also
enabled us to begin a share buy back programme in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year. This is being funded from cash
generated over and above that required to meet our
debt target of £7 billion in 2006/07, after paying
dividends and taking into account any acquisitions or
disposals.
Regulation
The recently announced strategic review of
telecommunications by the UK regulator, Ofcom, is
important and welcome to BT.
The review will cover, within the 21 key strategic
questions to be addressed, the possibility of the
structural separation of BT. Your company believes this
is not in the interests of shareholders, customers or
employees, and will argue in favour of a strong and
integrated BT.
Wider responsibilities
It is important that companies such as BT live up to
their responsibilities in the wider communities in which
we operate. I’m proud to report that in the 2004
ﬁnancial year, we were the highest placed
telecommunications company in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the third year in a row.
Our goal is to help everyone beneﬁt from
improved communications and to spread the beneﬁts
of new technology as widely as possible. This is
demonstrated, for example, by our wide deployment of
broadband technology throughout the UK, and by the
BT Education Programme, which has enabled more
than two million young people to participate in a
drama-based campaign designed to help them improve
their communications skills.
Strategic progress and outlook
The strong growth in new wave turnover, our ICT order
book and broadband shows that our strategy is
working. We remain committed to that strategy and
are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver our key strategic
goals.
We’ve come a long way since May 2001, when
your Board announced a radical plan to reduce debts,
manage costs and improve customer satisfaction.
We’ve established a solid platform for future growth
and success.
None of this could have happened without the
loyalty and support of our shareholders, customers,
suppliers and employees. Given the continued support
of all our stakeholders, we will build on this success
and accelerate the transformation of our business.
