 ACCSYS TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 08
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
A transformational year
This has been a transformational year for Accsys, with 
capacity expansion agreed for both Accoya® and Tricoya®, 
a total of €82m of new financing secured and a continued 
growth in demand for our products. Partnerships and 
commercial terms with BP, Medite and Rhodia Acetow 
(formerly Solvay Acetow) also endorse Accsys’ patented 
Accoya and Tricoya technology and our prospects for 
the future.
The expanded Group and the Accsys team are now very 
well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that 
we have been nurturing since the Company’s inception. 
I have confidence that the market opportunity remains 
substantial and conclude that the additional capacity, new 
financing and partnerships have put us in a strong position 
to exploit this in the most efficient way possible for the 
benefit of our shareholders.
As a small company the increased workload of negotiating 
and finalising the Tricoya Consortium and expanding our 
Accoya facility in Arnhem fell on a small management 
team. At the same time, our employees were being tasked 
with maximising the output from our existing facilities. They 
were all unwavering in their determination to deliver the 
best result for Accsys. My colleagues and I on the Board 
wish to thank all our employees for the diligence and 
commitment they have shown throughout the year.
Sales growth
10 years have passed since our existing Accoya 
manufacturing facility in Arnhem started operations.  
Since then we have carried out many improvements to  
our process which enabled us to increase capacity from 
the same two chemical reactors. As a result this year, 
we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya, an 18% increase 
compared to last year, and 60% more than was even 
thought possible 10 years ago. Sales by Medite of Tricoya 
panels increased by 32% to 5,806 cubic meters last year.
Sales volumes in the second half of the financial year 
grew by 31% compared to the same period last year. This 
increase was possible following the resolution of the supply 
chain bottleneck issues in the first half of the year which we 
had highlighted in November.
We continue to believe the total market for Accoya and 
Tricoya is in excess of 2.6 million cubic meters per annum, 
based upon detailed market assessments. This figure still 
represents a small fraction of the overall solid wood and 
wood panel industries. 
Additional manufacturing capacity
In March we formed the Tricoya Consortium, with 
agreements to build, operate and fund a new Tricoya 
chip acetylation plant in Hull. This includes €68m of 
comprehensive financing arrangements including debt  
and equity from BP, Medite, BGF and Volantis and debt

from RBS. In addition, these transformational agreements  
have recognised a pre-funding valuation of the Tricoya 
business of €35m with Accsys retaining a 74.6% interest  
in the Tricoya licensing business and a 46% interest in the 
new Tricoya plant.
The plant will have an initial design capacity of 30,000 
metric tonnes and is expected to be operational in the first 
half of 2019. Medite has signed an off-take agreement to 
purchase a minimum of 20% of the capacity in the first 
year, rising to a minimum of 40% after the fourth year 
of commercial production. The plant is expected to be 
EBITDA positive operating at 40% capacity. 
During the year we have also made significant progress 
with the expansion of our Accoya plant in Arnhem, from its 
current capacity of approximately 40,000 cubic meters to 
60,000 cubic meters per annum in the first of a two part 
expansion, with a further 20,000 cubic meters to follow.
The sale and leaseback of the land in Arnhem has been 
completed. Detailed engineering work has progressed and 
continues on site, with the third reactor itself having been 
delivered to site on 8 June 2017. We continue to expect the 
construction to be complete by the end of the calendar 
year 2017, with the benefit of the additional capacity and 
resulting sales growth expected in the financial year ending 
March 2019. 
The fourth reactor will be added at a later date to meet 
demand, increasing capacity to 80,000 cubic meters, 
with the potential to generate in excess of €120m of 
Accoya revenue and Accoya manufacturing EBITDA in 
excess of €30m.
Financial Results
Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by 7% 
to €56.5m (2016: €52.8m). Within this total, Accoya wood 
revenue increased by 17% to €50.7m (2016: €43.5m) as a 
result of an 18% increase in sales volume, while licence and 
licensing related income decreased from €5.3m to €1.9m  
as expected, following the receipt of higher one-off fees 
in the prior year, including those from our Accoya licensee 
Rhodia Acetow.
Gross profit margin decreased from 34% to 25% for a 
number of reasons including one-off licensing income in 
the previous year, together with the full year impact of 
discounted prices to Rhodia Acetow, a higher proportion  
of sales to Medite in respect of Tricoya (also at a lower 
sales price) and a small increase in raw material prices. 
Other operating costs (excluding exceptional items) 
remained consistent at €18.5m.
The above resulted in a €3.8m decrease in underlying 
Group EBITDA to €1.2m loss (2016: EBITDA profit of 
€2.4m). Underlying EBITDA improved from €1.6m loss in 
the first half of the year to €0.4m profit in the second half 
as a result of higher licensing income and sales volumes. 
Balance sheet
The increase in the cash balance to €41.2m at 31 March 
2017 (2016: €8.2m) reflects the first part of the funding 
received in respect of the Tricoya Consortium, including 
€18.6m proceeds of Loan Notes issued to BGF and 
Volantis and net €18.3m received in respect of equity in 
the Tricoya subsidiary companies issued to the investors 
in the Tricoya Consortium. 
During the period €2m was drawn down under the Rhodia 
Acetow loan facility and €4.2m was received in respect 
of the sale of the land in Arnhem. €6.2m was invested in 
property plant and equipment including both the Tricoya 
project and Arnhem expansion. The balance was principally 
attributable to the €1.1m EBITDA loss in the period and a 
€1.5m increase in working capital. 
The net cash balance was €20.1 million (2016: €8.2 million). 
The balance excludes €12.4m net proceeds of the Firm 
Placing and Open Offer which was completed after the 
year-end in April 2017. 
Outlook
I believe we have now reached a solid platform for future 
growth, both in respect of our products and intellectual 
property but also in respect of our business model, 
reflecting our ambition to retain a direct interest in 
manufacturing as we continue to grow to maximise returns 
for our shareholders.
By building on our achievements so far we are now well 
positioned to focus on bringing the new manufacturing 
capacity on-line and growing sales and demand for our 
products globally. 
The Firm Placing and Open Offer, which was launched 
successfully and completed in April, with the Open Offer 
having been four times oversubscribed has also put the 
Group in a firm financial position. I am confident that as we 
continue to invest in growth, and as we benefit from the 
additional manufacturing capacity, we will become cash-
flow generative. 
The new financial year has started well, with growth in 
Accoya sales being comparable to growth seen in the 
second half of last year. Sales growth will be temporarily 
restricted for the year as a whole until the new capacity 
becomes available in early 2018 calendar year. Demand for 
Accoya continues to increase and we expect sales to grow 
further thereafter.
