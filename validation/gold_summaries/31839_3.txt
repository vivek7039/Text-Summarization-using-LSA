STRA TEGIC
REPORT
As individuals or as companies, 
we can either create the future or 
we can be visited by it – and who 
is to say that if we just wait for it, 
whether we’ll like that future visit 
when it arrives? 
It’s clear from the challenging experiences 
of many great companies in recent years, 
that unless we prepare properly for the 
future, the one we want probably won’t be 
there when we need it. It reminds me of 
the old saying “the best time to replace 
the roof is when the sun is shining.”
Choosing our future
There are, in fact, many possible 
‘futures’ that can be created for a 
company. So it’s far better that it’s 
one we intentionally design ourselves, 
rather than an accidental one we may 
not like when it arrives. That’s the 
fundamental job we have to do as a 
leadership team and as a Board, ie to 
create a new sustainable and viable 
future for Smiths, one which creates 
more value for our shareholders and 
more opportunities for our employees. 
By design, it will be one which is much 
better than if we had simply waited at the 
bus-stop of opportunity for something 
serendipitous – or not – to come along. 
A fact which is rarely acknowledged 
by observers is that the core of every 
company is slowly dying. This includes 
even the most ‘modern’ companies 
such as those focusing on software, 
social media and the internet. 
The core of every company is being 
constantly attacked by competition, 
by end-of-life technology, product 
substitution, regulation and 
cannibalisation, and also by changing 
customer preferences and performance 
expectations. The core of every 
company is trickling away like a 
melting ice cube in the hot sun. 
The rate at which this decay or attrition 
happens can be surprisingly high, 
depending on the type of end market 
being served. So clearly, there is no 
way to succeed in the competitive 
game by simply standing still. The only 
way to overcome this natural attrition 
problem is by continually replacing 
the core business with new products, 
new customers, new technologies and 
new markets. If a company wants to 
grow faster than the market, it has to 
make this replacement at a rate which 
well exceeds the natural rate of core 
attrition. While this may seem to be an 
obvious statement, you’d be surprised 
by how few companies recognise this 
problem and address it head on. We 
will not make that mistake at Smiths.
So what do we want our company future 
to look like? First, we can observe that 
all great companies are innovative 
companies. A company cannot beat 
entrenched competition, and certainly 
cannot beat aggressive new market 
entrants, unless it’s innovative. 
Operational excellence clearly has 
a big part to play in a company’s 
competitiveness, although there is 
no amount of process excellence that 
can ever adequately substitute for 
a healthy dose of innovation. Nor is 
there an adequate substitute offered 
in productivity initiatives alone. As the 
saying goes, you can’t save your way 
into prosperity. We can see this most 
clearly in electronics and software 
companies where the market, product 
and technology changes are easily 
the fastest. But exactly the same 
gradual attrition phenomena happens 
to industrial companies, consumer 
packaged goods companies, healthcare, 
transportation, energy and food. So 
while the rates of decline may be a little 
slower than in electronics markets, 
they are nevertheless there. Second, 
great companies grow faster than the 
markets they serve and, as a result, 
they steadily build market share 
each year. It also implies that their 
new product vitality index is high.
High performance companies also have 
strong levels of employee satisfaction 
and customer satisfaction; they have 
best-in-class margins, and attractive 
and stable returns on capital investment. 
They are also inclusive of ‘all-comers’ 
– creative talent needs to come from 
everywhere – and they are places with 
a good employer brand where able 
people want to work. These companies 
also have good Environmental, 
Social and Governance scores. 
In broad brush strokes, this is the 
kind of company and ‘new future’ we 
are determined to build. We have not 
changed or deviated from this mission 
one bit since I became the Chairman 
of Smiths, though I’m proud to say that 
under the dynamic leadership of our 
Chief Executive Andy Reynolds Smith 
and his team, we are now executing 
against this mission much faster.
 
Creating new value
In terms of new financial value creation, 
companies have only five levers they 
can pull to improve shareholder value 
creation. Higher sales growth, margin 
expansion, improved working capital 
turns, lower taxation rates and an 
improving P/E multiple. For most 
mature industrial companies, with their 
typical underlying characteristics of 
high margin and lower sales growth, 
the best method of creating new value 
for all stakeholders in the company is to 
drive higher levels of profitable organic 
growth. Achieving a point of sales growth 
usually exceeds the value creation of a 
point of margin improvement by several 
multiples. Plus, there are natural limits 
to profit margin that the laboratory of 
life teaches us are possible. If margins 
go too high, customers complain and 
even greater competition is enticed 
into your market. A strategy of only 
improving margin eventually runs 
out of runway. Growth never does.
We have scope for higher levels of growth 
at Smiths Group – along with huge 
opportunities for improving our working 
capital efficiency. Here and there, we also 
have opportunities for margin expansion 
in some of our businesses – particularly 
in Smiths Medical. So this essentially 
NO MAT TER WHAT 
THE COMPANY DOES, 
IT WILL ALWAYS BE 
WORLD-CL A SS TALENT 
WHICH IS THE 
GRE ATEST NEED.

We were delighted to welcome Noel Tata to the Board in January 2017 
as an additional non-executive director and member of our Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees. We welcome Noel’s 
extensive experience and expertise in higher-growth economies such 
as Asia and Africa. As I have said on previous occasions, the ability to 
manage change is a good indicator of a business’ resilience. Following 
Chris O’Shea stepping down from his role as Chief Financial Officer in 
May, we were pleased that my Board colleague and Audit Committee 
Chairman Bill Seeger agreed to step into the Chief Financial Officer 
role on an interim basis while we seek a permanent replacement. 
We were also delighted that non-executive director Mark Seligman 
agreed to take on the Chair of the Audit Committee.
is the nub of the Group’s strategic plan. 
A balanced combination of operational 
excellence and high levels of organic 
growth, driven mostly by innovation. 
Here and there, we may yet trim the 
portfolio in those places where we feel 
we can’t create the kind of value-creating 
growth profile and company we want.
An everybody wins strategy
Yes, we will certainly continue to 
use acquisitions as an accelerant to 
growth, but in today’s market of high 
purchase prices for companies, we will 
be selective and thoughtful about how 
to do this. We still have a mission of 
achieving sensible returns on investment 
well above our cost of capital. 
Acquisitions can bring many positive 
things (and some negative ones if a 
company isn’t careful), but done properly, 
one thing acquisitions always do is to 
bring speed of execution of the strategic 
plan. The wonderful thing we can 
observe about growth and innovation 
is that it’s an ‘everybody wins’ strategy. 
Investors win with better returns, 
employees win with greater career 
opportunities, suppliers win with higher 
volume and customers win with better 
products. We have lots of opportunity 
too for improvements in working capital 
turns and again, like growth, this is 
already on the docket of things being 
done to substantially improve the Group. 
Adapting for change
What might that new future look like for 
Smiths? If we think carefully, much of 
the general direction of technology and 
customer preferences can be forecast. 
The details no, but the generalities yes. 
So another element of a company’s 
profile is that it must be a learning 
company and be agile and adaptable to 
changing circumstances. For change, 
these circumstances certainly will. For 
example, there’s no reason to believe 
that border crossing and airport security 
challenges will become easier in the 
future than they are today. So executed 
properly, this will be a great business 
to be in long term. But more and more 
advanced detection technologies will 
need to be developed, expanding from 
sophisticated explosives detection to 
all forms of contraband detection at 
border crossings and inspection points. 
The same opportunities apply to medical 
businesses. People are living longer 
and that part of the world we refer to as 
higher-growth markets are demanding 
better healthcare, better education and 
communications, cleaner air and water, 
higher levels of food safety, better cars 
and better housing among others. The 
three large disease states of cancer, 
heart disease and diabetes can, and will, 
be improved by medical science and we 
will play our part in that. Energy needs, 
petrochemical-sourced feedstocks 
and electronics-oriented products will 
continue to be huge features of our daily 
life, in fact, ever more so. So this puts our 
John Crane and Interconnect businesses 
front and central in this new world.

Higher growth market focus
We have decided to build a much stronger 
focus on growing in these higher growth 
regions. Arithmetically, if our portfolio 
had the same percentage of sales in 
these regions as do our peers, our 
organic growth rate would be about 100 
basis points higher than it is today. That’s 
a missed value creation opportunity 
lingering from the past. To help address 
this, we’ve assigned a top Smiths 
leader, Roland Carter, to that task, with 
operational control of Asia Pacific.
When I moved to live in the United 
States in 1978, one of the first projects 
I worked on was electric vehicles and 
the fundamental architecture of the 
drive system was more or less identical 
then to what we see in electric vehicles 
today. Yet it is only in recent times that 
they had become commercially viable. 
There is no question that electric 
vehicles, autonomous driving, artificial 
intelligence, robotics, advanced 
materials and nanotechnologies will 
all have their increasing place in this 
new world. Energy storage devices, 
electrostatic as well as galvanic, will 
see big changes. However, sometimes 
we have to temper our enthusiasm 
about the rate at which these things 
will be adopted, but gradually adopted 
they will be. I have no doubt.
Possibly the greatest impact inside 
the Group will come from that fastest 
moving area of technology, ie electronics 
and the internet, with its underlying, 
sensing, algorithmic, computational 
and software elements. Those will have 
tremendous effects on virtually every 
product we make over the next 10 years. 
Embracing the digital future
Smiths is making significant upfront 
investments in digital, including in 
centres of excellence in the US and 
Europe, to make sure we are properly 
prepared to respond to this emerging 
opportunity. These technological 
ideas are altering the way people think 
about the products they buy, about 
marketing, communications, healthy 
eating, entertainment, transportation 
etc. In a not-too-distant future, virtually 
all products and their components 
will be tracked and traced and 
automation, robotics, linked intelligent 
self-diagnosing and self-correcting 
devices will be features of our daily 
lives. All companies need to be better 
prepared for the challenges of cyber 
security, since many of these devices 
are going to be connected to the Internet 
and communicate with us and with 
each other. We can either prepare 
for this future or be run over by it.
The solution to all creative problems 
requires a blend of optimism, curiosity, 
imagination and relentless execution. 
The optimism is needed to believe that 
something can be done, imagination is 
required to create it, and curiosity is 
required to identify it when it’s finished 
and lastly, relentless execution is 
needed to achieve it. These factors 
will increasingly become features of 
our company culture. No matter what 
the company does, it will always be 
world-class talent which is the greatest 
need. Nothing in the company ever 
gets done except through people. 
Repositioning our portfolio
In terms of progress along this pathway, 
the past year has seen steady execution 
towards building a vibrant and faster-
growing Smiths, reminiscent of the 
high-growth innovative company which 
existed around a half a century or more 
ago. To this end, in FY2017 we’ve made 
one major acquisition in the detection 
business, Morpho Detection, and 
trimmed the company’s portfolio by 
selling four other non-core pieces of 
the portfolio where the chance to drive 
strong growth seemed less obvious. This 
has resulted in the Group being about 
the same size as it was a year ago, but 
with much better growth prospects. We 
are investing in new product platforms 
everywhere and as these products are 
released to market, they will accelerate 
our growth and competitiveness. 
We’ve also made improvements in our 
use of working capital, with a £85m 
reduction this past year. Much more has 
yet to be done here. We made excellent 
progress in our pension plan and in 
getting the kind of leadership we need 
in key places around the Group. As 
far as innovation is concerned, there’s 
always a longer lead time than we’d 
like before we see the green shoots. 
I know from past experience that if 
we continue down this innovation 
pathway the growth will come, 
additional value will be created and 
a much happier and better Group.
I’d like to thank all of our investors 
for believing in us. It will work – 
I’m sure of it – and ultimately all 
of us will be the beneficiaries.
