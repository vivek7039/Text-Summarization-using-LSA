 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Camellia is a unique group, not only in our ethos and culture, but also in the diversity and quality of our
assets. Our ﬁnancial position is strong and following our withdrawal from the UK ﬁnancial services market
our ﬁnancial risks are substantially reduced. In his statement the Chairman rightly reﬂects on the
diﬃculties of operating in emerging markets, however this access to some of the world’s fastest
expanding economies also provides us with opportunities for growth.
In the Agriculture division, whilst climate change and political uncertainty in many of our operating
countries are largely outside our control, we have four key advantages. First, we are growing a selection
of crops which are increasingly in demand from an urbanising, longer living and more health conscious
consumer who is ever more concerned with the provenance of their food. Second, our focus on
sustainability has put us in a strong position to beneﬁt from these global trends. Third, we have been
operating in many of our territories for a very long time. Fourth, we have the resources to pursue our
strategic goals. Furthermore, whilst our expenditure on sustainability may not always be immediately
apparent, our long standing investment in irrigation, community welfare and better agricultural practices
is an integral part of our success. We will continue to build on these strong foundations for the beneﬁt of
all our stakeholders.
In our other divisions we continue to take steps to invest where we believe that it is in the long term
interests of the Group and to divest where we no longer believe that to be the case. 
Over the last three years we have disposed of Duncan Lawrie Asset Management at a substantial proﬁt
and closed or sold Duncan Lawrie Private Bank, AKD Engineering and Loddon all of which were loss-
making. This process of reﬁning our portfolio is an important part of our long term strategy and a
summary of the acquisitions made during 2017 and since the year end is set out below:
■ Tea City. A collection of Indian packet tea brands which was bought by Goodricke to add to its existing
brand portfolio.
■ Jing Tea. A UK based branded speciality teas business selling to the retail and food service sectors
internationally.
Both of these acquisitions will help to bring us closer to our market place and its changing trends; Jing Tea
will also enable us to distribute our high end teas more proﬁtably.
In addition to these acquisitions we are proposing to make a number of small disposals and other
changes to the portfolio as follows:
■ BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU Cutting and Grinding. Both of these companies have been with the
Group for many years, and whilst both remain cash generative they are too small and too niche to
represent good investment opportunities or to deliver long term growth for the Group. I am pleased
to say that each is in the process of being sold to its respective management team.
■ XiMo. Having now successfully demonstrated production of sample quantities of its catalysts, the next
stage is to conﬁrm the same capabilities on a larger scale in order to prove that the process is viable
commercially. This stage will require signiﬁcant additional investment and we are actively seeking
third party funding for this next step.
I strongly believe that these changes to the portfolio support our long term strategy and will make a
positive contribution to the Group in the future.
I am also pleased that we have been able to raise the dividend again this year. Other than in 2008 when
we held the dividend, we have raised the dividend every year since the merger with Linton Park in 2005.
On other matters, I am pleased that the 2017 triennial UK pension scheme valuation shows a small
surplus of £7.1 million as against a previous deﬁcit of £7.9 million. We will continue to monitor the
position carefully, mindful of our continuing and future obligations to the members.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The overall Group strategy, which is set out on page 20, remains unchanged with each division expected
to perform against an agreed divisional strategy with goals and targets for the short, medium and long
term. These are summarised below:
Agriculture
■ To focus on our core crops of tea, macadamia and avocado where we have scale and geographic
spread. Where appropriate opportunities arise, to add to our production capability in these three
crops, as well as to make aligned acquisitions and investments to enable us to capture more of the
value chain.
■ To maintain and potentially to grow our portfolio of non-core crops in order to retain the diversity of
location and crop which has historically proved so valuable in shielding the Group from the impact of
climate change and commodity price ﬂuctuations.
■ To utilise our agricultural expertise to make the most of the estates that we already have and to
develop new estates where possible and appropriate.
Agriculture is the largest division and is the area where we see the best long term investment
opportunities for the Group. This will remain our focus for future investment.
Engineering
Engineering North. To take advantage of the recovering oil sector whilst diversifying into adjacent sectors
in order to create a sustainably proﬁtable engineering business.
Engineering South. To continue to grow Abbey Metal Finishing and its joint venture in Germany, Atﬁn, as
quality suppliers to the aerospace industry.
XiMo. To ﬁnd new investors to take the technology to the next phase in its development.  
Food Service
ACS&T. To continue to operate as a high quality business in the storage and distribution of frozen foods,
aiming to achieve critical mass by proﬁtable growth and if appropriate, acquisition. 
Aﬃsh and Wylax. To establish a sustainably proﬁtable business model that works in the European ﬁsh
distribution market.
Investments
Investment Portfolio. The Group has a portfolio, principally of listed investments, the strategy for which
remains to invest in high quality companies where we believe that there is long term value. This portfolio
also enables us to balance our geographic risk exposure.
Investment Property. The strategy is to continue to invest in quality assets where an appropriate yield may
be realised. The process of developing some of our existing properties to enhance yield will continue.
Collections. The Group has collections of art, philately and manuscripts which are regularly reviewed and
are added to or sold as appropriate.
Associates
The Group has three associate companies in the ﬁnancial services sector of which BF&M, the listed
Bermudian insurance business, is the most signiﬁcant. With all our associates, we continually monitor our
investment and may increase or decrease our holding in the future.

Tea pricing and operations
India
India had a record production year in the Dooars gardens. Volumes in Darjeeling for the year were
materially impacted by the previously reported strike. A new dedicated Bought Leaf factory (Jogopur) was
successfully opened at our Danguajhar factory site and Bought Leaf production was restarted in Assam
on Sessa and Borpatra gardens.
Tea prices for India were generally lower than the previous year other than those from the Dooars region.
Prices at the start of the year were under pressure due to high volumes of unsold teas from 2016’s record
production, but improved from the mid-year point to levels above the previous year’s, particularly for the
Dooars and Assam CTC’s, whilst the Assam orthodox market was down on the previous year. Darjeeling
prices were volatile due to the supply constraints inﬂicted by the strike. First ﬂush teas sold well but the
majority of the second ﬂush and main season teas were lost.
The situation was not helped by the implementation of GST in India, which hindered both the auctions
and tea sales in general as the market familiarised itself with the new system.
Our average selling price over the year was 6.4% lower than the previous year.
Goodricke Group’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certiﬁcate was renewed, as were other
certiﬁcations including FSSC and RFA for all our Assam, Darjeeling and Cachar gardens. The Trust Tea
certiﬁcation for the Bought Leaf initiative is being implemented across all our gardens in the Dooars, and
Goodricke won a social sustainability Bronze award for their WASH (Water, Air and ventilation, Sanitation
and Hygiene) programme, at the North American Tea Sustainability Awards.
In total, India’s national production volumes for 2017 were up on 2016, primarily due to higher
production in south India and increasing volumes from the Bought Leaf sector. Costs continue to rise
through wage and general inﬂation which, without compensatory increases in the market price, creates
margin pressure. To mitigate this, eﬀorts continue to reduce seasonal labour requirements through the
mechanisation of planting, pruning, spraying and plucking.
During the year, Goodricke acquired a number of well-known Indian brands including Tea City, Supercup
and Samovar. This will result in increased volumes of packet tea being produced and sold in 2018 in line
with our strategy of moving up the value chain.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Bangladesh
Our Bangladesh operations had another successful year achieving their second highest ever production
despite the heavy rainfall which led to signiﬁcant ﬂooding in many areas.
As in India, prices in the Bangladesh market were under pressure during the ﬁrst half of the year due to
high levels of prior year’s stock remaining unsold. Import tariﬀ levels were raised again during the year
and prices recovered well in the third quarter and remained ﬁrm through to the end of the year. Our
average selling price over the year was 4.3% lower than the previous year.
Production trials were conducted on both orthodox and green teas with some very encouraging results
and feedback from the domestic and export markets. These trials will continue with the aim of reaching
commercial production in 2018. Trials have started on shear plucking in an eﬀort to reduce harvesting
costs through improved productivity.
RFA certiﬁcation was achieved on all gardens in September. Duncan Brothers being only the second, but
by far the largest, producer to achieve this certiﬁcation in Bangladesh.
Kenya
Our production was impacted by drought during the ﬁrst half of the year but saw an upturn as the
weather improved in the ﬁnal quarter.
Tea prices in Kenya ﬁrmed at the start of the year as it became apparent that the dry conditions were
going to have an impact on national production. These growing conditions did not improve until the 4th
quarter which saw record production. However, despite this, our average selling price for the year was
21.5% ahead of the previous year.
The wage negotiations remain unresolved for the Collective Bargaining Agreement years of 2014/15, and
2016/17 which creates uncertainty in the cost base and agitation, frustration and industrial action at the
operational level. To mitigate the risk of escalating labour costs, our eﬀorts to develop more mechanised
processes continue. To this end automated withering has been installed on a trial basis in our Chemomi
factory and the area under mechanised tea harvesting has expanded and will continue to do so. The
research and development initiative into new harvester technology continues with the engagement of a
UK specialist engineering company to design and fabricate a new prototype.
The number of smallholders continues to increase as does the volume derived from this sector.
Smallholder production represents a signiﬁcant proportion of our total volumes in Kenya and remains a
critical factor in the wider social responsibility and sustainability strategy of our tea operations.
All the estates and registered smallholders are RFA and FSSC certiﬁed and Eastern Produce Kenya won an
environmental sustainability Gold award for our “Wise Use” programme at the North American Tea
Sustainability Awards.
Malawi
Our Malawi operations achieved an all-time record crop and also began a project to produce and sell
commercial volumes of green tea which has met with signiﬁcant interest from buyers.
Tea prices in Malawi were ﬁrm throughout 2017 due to strong demand resulting from an undersupplied
Kenyan market. Our average tea selling price for the year was 21.2% higher than the previous year.
The Malawi Tea Revitalisation 2020 programme continues with the roll out of some excellent initiatives in
nutrition, gender empowerment and smallholder production. Eastern Produce Malawi won a social
sustainability Gold award at the North American Tea Sustainability Awards for its Diversity, Inclusion and
Women’s Welfare policy in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 5, “to achieve gender equality
and empowerment of women and girls”. 
All estates and smallholders are RFA certiﬁed and three factories have FSSC 22000 certiﬁcation; the ﬁrst
tea factories in Malawi to achieve this.

Macadamia Production
Macadamia production in 2017 was disappointing and showed a slight decrease from the already
signiﬁcantly reduced volumes in Malawi and South Africa seen in 2016. This was due to drought conditions
that aﬀected both regions and the consequential reduction in nut volumes and size.

Macadamia Pricing
Due to rising demand for macadamia products, prices remained ﬁrm and in line with the previous year’s
levels during the ﬁrst half of the year. As it became apparent in the market that supply was once again
impacted by drought, particularly in southern Africa, prices reached record highs; our average selling price
for the year was 7.4% ahead of the prior year. Signiﬁcant progress was made in the development of the
Maclands brand.
Macadamia Operations
Malawi
Overall Malawi volumes were below those of 2016 and the lowest seen in the last 15 years, which is
indicative of the drought impact. The operation is focusing on agronomic activities to mitigate the impacts
of climate change and to improve the resilience of the orchards to a changing growing environment. Such
initiatives include heavy mulching, tree thinning, plant density reduction and replanting. Currently over
50% of our orchards are still young in production potential terms so the prospects for improved volumes
going forward are positive.
The processing factory is FSSC 22000 certiﬁed.
South Africa
Volumes were disappointing though marginally up on the previous year. As with the Malawi operations,
the focus is on agronomic activities which will improve the ability of the orchards to cope with more
extreme climate challenges. There is also signiﬁcant investment being made to expand water resources
for irrigation from the Simpson Dam on Mambedi estate.
Due to the rising costs of labour, investment is being made in the mechanisation of certain activities
including harvesting, sorting and processing.
The development of Mambedi estate to macadamia continues with over 80Ha of new planting completed,
bringing the total development to just under 300Ha.
The processing factory successfully completed the second phase of upgrading and is FSSC 22000 certiﬁed.
The renewal of the lease for our Wales estate is under negotiation. If unsuccessful, it will result in Eastern
Produce South Africa having to vacate the property at the expiry of the lease in March 2020 with the last
harvest from the estate likely to be that for 2019.
Kenya
Production volumes were up on the previous year’s levels but were also impacted by the dry conditions
experienced in Kenya in the ﬁrst half of the year. To combat this, similar initiatives to those of Malawi and
South Africa are under way.
249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 10 11
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
The footprint of the orchards continues to grow with an additional 73Ha planted to bring the total
development to 1,027Ha. The age proﬁle of the orchards is very young and volumes are expected to grow
rapidly with the developing maturity proﬁle.
The cracking facility successfully completed its second full season of processing and is FSSC 22000
certiﬁed.

Avocado Pricing and Operations
Avocado production was in line with expectations for the year despite the dry conditions which had a
negative impact on fruit size. We exported an increased volume of Hass but Pinkerton volumes were down
on the previous year. Fruit sourced from smallholders was signiﬁcantly reduced as unscrupulous exporters
took advantage of European demand to export immature fruit. As a result of these exports and the
associated reputational damage, Kenyan fruit is now frequently being discounted in the European market.
However, by maintaining the standard of our own fruit, pricing achieved through the year was ﬁrm and in
line with the previous year for similar sized fruit.
New avocado development continues with 60Ha of orchards planted. The total orchard footprint now
stands at 607Ha. In addition, Eastern Produce Kenya is undertaking a three year trial of Hass avocado near
Kitale in western Kenya to investigate the viability of avocado production in that region.

Speciality Crops Pricing and Operations
Arable. Record yields were once again achieved in soya and establishing forward contracts early for the
2017 crop ensured that the prices achieved were in line with the prior year despite an oversupplied
market. Record yields were also achieved in the maize crop which more than compensated for the lower
than expected prices which arose from oversupply in the market.
Rubber. Production was in line with the previous year. Demand was disappointing, leading to sustained
low prices throughout the year.

Citrus. In California we had a good year, with record yields being achieved for the Murcotts without an
impact on prices. Navel oranges also performed well with good yields and prices.
Wine. The continuing drought in the Cape meant that grape production was below expectations but in line
with the previous year’s volumes. Wine sales were also disappointing. Investment was made in the winery
to improve handling and quality in production.
Almonds. Production and pricing was in line with expectation for this relatively immature development. 
Pineapples. These are being phased out at Kakuzi and will be replaced with Pinkerton avocado. 
Forestry. Better sales of large poles at Kakuzi led to a much improved result.
We continue to raise cattle on those areas of the Kakuzi estate in Kenya unsuitable for crop development.
In total, the Agriculture division made a trading proﬁt of £35.6 million (2016: £29.9 million) on revenue of
£239.4 million (2016: £207.1 million).
Engineering
Engineering North
Engineering North continued to struggle in 2017 as the anticipated pick up in the oil industry failed to
translate into signiﬁcant additional sales or proﬁts. The new Site Services division, which provides services
to the hydroelectric sector, has made an encouraging start. As a result, total revenue at AJT Engineering
rose to £8.0 million from £6.9 million in 2016.
Engineering South
Abbey Metal Finishing and its subsidiary Atﬁn made a substantially increased operating proﬁt in 2017 as
demand grew for their services to the aerospace industry. The two other companies in this division are in
the process of being sold.
XiMo
XiMo, our industrial catalyst research and development business, continues to develop products with the
objective of commercial use. In common with other research based businesses, it is expected to lose
money pending the outcome of commercial trials. As stated earlier, we are now seeking partners to
ﬁnance the next stage of its development.
In total, the Engineering division made a trading loss of £2.6 million (2016: trading loss £2.6 million) on
revenue of £20.5 million (2016: £18.8 million).
Food Service
ACS&T saw revenue and proﬁts grow substantially in 2017 as demand increased for its services from its
major customers.
In the Netherlands, both Aﬃsh and Wylax succeeded in increasing revenue, but due to exchange rate
movements and a competitive market ended the year loss making.
In total the Food Service division made a trading proﬁt of £1.8 million (2016: £0.8 million) on revenue of
£37.8 million (2016: £31.6 million).
Investments
Investment Portfolio. The gains on sale for the year were £0.7 million (2016: £1.5 million). The total value of
the portfolio at 31 December 2017 was £47.0 million (2016: £37.2 million).
Investment Property. We continue to work on our estate of investment properties in order to maximise the
value and the return. Following refurbishment in 2016, No. 6 Hobart Place was let during the year as was
a property in Queen Square in Bristol. On the Linton Park estate work has commenced to convert surplus
buildings into residential property for rent.
Collections. The collections are held at cost. A number of minor additions and disposals were made during
the year.
249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 12 Associates
BF&M recorded a strong operating year from its core insurance and investment advisory services.
However, two category 5 hurricanes in the Caribbean in September 2017 (Irma and Maria) resulted in
signiﬁcant costs and the need to purchase additional reinsurance cover which has led BF&M to report a
reduced proﬁt before tax of Bermudian Dollar 1.9 million (2016: Bermudian Dollar 17.9 million).
Our two associate companies in Bangladesh, United Insurance and United Finance, saw marginally lower
proﬁts than in 2016 as a result of falling interest rates and political uncertainty.
In total, the share of the results of associates amounted to £2.0 million (2016: £5.1 million).
Discontinued Operation – Duncan Lawrie
As previously stated, the wind down of the remaining assets of Duncan Lawrie continued throughout
2017 and the banking license was ﬁnally returned in December, indicating that the regulators in the UK
are satisﬁed that all issues have been dealt with. The full ﬁnancial impact of the disposals and closure are
summarised in the Chief Financial Oﬃcer’s Report.
POLITICAL, LEGISLATIVE and LEGAL ISSUES
The Group is present in many jurisdictions and is subject to local legislation. The following issues may
have a material impact on the Group:
■ At the start of 2016 the Government of Malawi put forward new legislation which proposed, inter alia,
the conversion of all freehold property into 50 year leaseholds. 
■ The Group continues to monitor and assess the impact of the UK’s exit from the EU. To date the
impact of the decision has been broadly conﬁned to currency movements which may impact the
costs of imports, particularly tea, and the prices paid to producers. 
CAPITAL INVESTMENT and DEVELOPMENT
We continued to invest in our assets during the year and £15.0 million was spent on property, plant and
equipment and investment property (2016: £10.2 million) including the following key projects:
■ Starting the rebuilding of the Simpson Dam in Mambedi, South Africa to assist with water retention
for the macadamia estates.
■ Trialing a new automated withering system at Chemomi factory, Kenya in order to improve quality
and reduce labour costs.
■ Building a Bought Leaf factory at our Dangujuar garden in India.
■ Continuing improvements to Linton Park winery in South Africa.
■ Developing the Ruo factory and irrigation in Malawi.
■ Development of our investment properties in the UK.
In addition to our continuous programme of replanting our tea areas, a programme to extend our
planted areas in macadamia and avocado has been underway for a number of years and in 2017:
■ 91Ha (2016: 65Ha) of new avocado plantings were completed in Kenya.
■ 73Ha (2016: 97Ha) of new macadamia plantings were carried out in Kenya, 82Ha (2016: 47Ha) in
South Africa and 48Ha (2016: 12Ha) in Malawi.

249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 13 SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR
Responsibility
The Group’s businesses are fundamentally connected to the welfare of our communities and the
environments in which we operate. We proactively invest to ensure these environments are protected
and improved. Our focus is on the long-term stability, security and continuity of our businesses and those
communities. We support and integrate the UN Sustainable Development Goals into our sustainability
strategy.
We invest in, monitor and report on, both Environmental and Social sustainability initiatives across all our
divisions. In 2017 the Group launched a new on-line system for capturing data relating to our global
environmental footprint. The system allows us to monitor our energy use, Greenhouse Gas emissions,
Water and Waste, the results of which are summarised below. 
As part of our wider drive towards greater sustainability, we have developed a range of mid to long-term
targets to reduce, in some cases substantially, the environmental impact of our operations. As an example,
strategic improvements in our usage and sourcing of energy supports our ambition to align with Science
Based Targets. Targets adopted by companies to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions are considered
“science-based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature
increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial temperatures.
Whilst monitoring and reducing our environmental footprint is critical, so too is ensuring the well-being of
the communities in which we operate. We refer to this social sustainability as our “licence to trade”. The
level of health and educational facilities available from state governments varies widely across our
operations, and consequently so does the focus and scale of our social sustainability projects. The level of
support provided to many of these communities by the Group is substantial and is summarised below.
We also need to ensure that all our operations can demonstrate that they meet the requirements of our
customers in terms of certiﬁcations and traceability. The vast majority of our tea gardens are RFA certiﬁed
and all our macadamia, avocado and winery operations are FSSC 22000 certiﬁed. Further details of these
are included in the operational reports above.
Environmental Sustainability
The key metrics for the Group include Greenhouse Gas emissions, water usage and waste produced. The
table below sets out the Baseline (average of the three years 2013-2015) and how we have progressed
since that time.

(i) A 1.4% decrease in Greenhouse Gas emissions in 2017 has been achieved through a focus on more eﬃcient use of
energy, reduced tea production in 2017, and a reduction in emissions of electricity from the grid, oﬀset by an
increase in fossil fuel usage in certain of our operations.
(ii) Dry conditions in Kenya and South Africa as well as an expansion of our irrigation infrastructure in a number of
our operations to help address the impact of drought have increased water use.
(iii) These are restated ﬁgures and take account of the fact that we no longer consider certain types of compost to be
waste. There are ongoing initiatives to increase our waste recycling rates in a number of our operations.

249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 14 Some of the initiatives we are undertaking include:
■ Pursuing limited resource use eﬃciency, this year alone we identiﬁed over 200 energy and water
management projects across the Group.
■ Ongoing investment in energy eﬃcient technology includes: upgrading lighting and trialing energy
eﬃcient motors and variable speed drives, continued growth in the use of renewable energy via solar
projects and the increasing use of energy eﬃcient transport across the Group. 
■ Development of modern water management solutions is aligned with energy eﬃciency and improved
sanitation projects in many of our operations. Precision Agriculture is increasingly used to determine
the water status of both soil and plant for eﬃcient use of water in irrigation. We also implement
systemic water management processes by encouraging water recycling, water harvesting through
rainwater capture and by building dams.
Social Sustainability
We believe that all employees should be remunerated fairly and that they and their families should have
access to education, healthcare and housing. The table below shows the provision of schools and
healthcare by the Group in 2017. In addition, we continue to provide housing for over 200,000 people.
2017
Schools* 284
School children educated annually 33,259

*The funding and operation of schools and hospitals, provided for our employees and their communities, varies by
location in accordance with local culture, practice and requirement. Some facilities are owned and operated by us
directly, whilst others are fully or partly funded by us whilst being state and/or NGO managed and owned.
Through a broad range of CSR initiatives across the Group, we contribute to improved health and
nutrition, hygiene and sanitation of our communities. We assist with the improvement of local
infrastructure by supporting road, water, healthcare and education projects. In 2017, our work in this area
was recognised by the Tea Association, USA. Our continued focus on developing sustainable housing for
our working communities is reﬂected in major housing renewal projects in India, Bangladesh, Kenya and
Malawi.
Health
All our tea estates have a hospital, clinic or dispensary. In addition in India and Bangladesh staﬀ have
access to central Group operated hospitals to which more serious cases can be referred. We provide
medical services, including where appropriate antiretroviral drugs, in those communities where HIV/AIDs
is prevalent. We also give medical support to schools that are either run locally or by our operations.
During 2017 in India, we made our hospital facilities available to visiting surgeons to perform over
400 medical treatments for cleft palates, club feet and eye conditions. In Bangladesh, our Primary Health
Care initiative is extended to all estates and provides the communities with comprehensive and specialist
health programmes.
Education
We are committed to providing the opportunity for development for all. We provide schools in areas
where we operate, either by building and running the schools or by supporting state educational projects
in our communities. Aiming to develop education and opportunity for all employees, we provide skills
development programmes and adult education. For example, in Malawi we support students from
technical colleges by providing employment opportunities. In India, over 350 adults received educational
support through a range of initiatives, including the Peter Leggatt Educational Stipend.

Female economic empowerment
In order to support our working mothers and enable them to take part in the economic process, we
provide over 16,000 places at ﬁxed and mobile crèches across our operations.
Smallholders
Demonstrating our commitment to responsible sourcing, we continue to develop smallholder
programmes including agricultural training days in Kenya, Malawi and India. In 2017, we produced
19.2 million kgs of smallholder Made Tea across the Group. In Kenya, 220,000 cartons of avocados were
packed for smallholders during the year. These initiatives enabled over 30,000 local farmers to improve
their earnings by beneﬁting from our agricultural expertise, infrastructure and access to market.
Wages
We are committed to paying fair wages, beneﬁts and allowances in accordance with local legislation and
trade union agreements and have received certiﬁcations from Fairtrade, the Rainforest Alliance and
WEITA, among others, all of which require an audit of the Group’s employment practices as part of
maintaining the accreditations. We are part of a number of other initiatives to address the issue of low
pay in developing countries. All our UK companies are Living Wage accredited employers.
