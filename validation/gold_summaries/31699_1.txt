 STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
3
Overview
The Group delivered a good performance in the year, driven by like-for -like sales growth, new 
contract openings across the world and the ongoing implementation of our programme of 
operational improvements. We are continuing to invest in the development of the business 
and to bring new brands and concepts to our clients and customers. We have made further 
good progress in the development of the business in North America and Asia Pacific, and the 
first year’s performance of our joint venture in India has been encouraging. 
Strong financial results
The financial performance of the Group is presented on an underlying basis, for which the 
statutory reported results are adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, the amortisation 
of intangible assets created on the acquisition of the SSP business in 2006 and the revaluation 
of the obligation to acquire an additional share of TFS by the end of the 2018 calendar year . 
The statutory reported performance of the Group is explained in the financial review, with 
detailed reconciliation between statutory and underlying performance provided on page 15.
The Group delivered a strong financial performance in 2017 , with underlying operating profit 
increasing by 27 .0% (on a constant currency basis) to £162.9m, and with a constant currency 
increase, excluding TFS, in the operating margin of 50 bps. The consolidation of TFS added a 
further 30 bps, bringing the Group margin to 6.8%. 
T otal revenue increased by 11.7% on a constant currency basis, including like-for -like 
sales growth of 3.1%, net contract gains of 6.0% and a negative impact of 0.3% from the 
additional leap year day in 2016. The TFS business contributed a further 2.9% to revenue. 
Like-for -like growth in the air sector has again been stronger than the rail sector, driven by 
increasing passenger numbers in most of our markets. 
Net contract gains were 6.0% in the year , an encouraging increase from last year’s gains 
of 1.7%. We saw very strong contributions from North America and the Rest of the World, 
reporting net gains of c.23% and c.18% respectively. Significant new openings at Chicago 
Midway and JFK T7 airports in North America, and in Hong Kong and China in the Rest of the 
World, have contributed to this strong performance.
We are encouraged by the pipeline of new contracts. During the year we won a number of 
significant new contracts, including at airports in Seattle, Los Angeles and Boston in North 
America, and at Cebu in the Philippines. 
The strong operating margin improvement of 50 bps reflects the like-for -like sales growth 
and further encouraging progress on our strategic initiatives. 
We delivered strong free cash flow of £89.0m, after investing £115.0m in capital 
expenditure (excluding capital contributions from our partners), which was a £19.1m 
increase on the prior year . The increase in capital expenditure reflects our net gains. 
Reported net debt fell from £317 .4m to £262.2m. The reduction in net debt was driven by 
the free cash flow of £89.0m, net of the dividend payment of £29.0m. We have taken the 
decision to increase the ordinary dividend and pay out 40% of net income. This takes the 
payout ratio to the top of the range we gave at the IPO of 30-40%. Furthermore, we are 
proposing a special dividend of approximately £100m, accompanied by a proposed share 
consolidation, which reflects our confidence in the future of the business and our desire to 
maintain an efficient balance sheet.
Summary and outlook
The Group delivered a strong financial performance in the year with good like-for -like sales 
growth, very strong net gains and improvement in operating margin. The new financial year 
has started in line with our expectations and the pipeline of new contracts is encouraging. 
Looking forward we face a higher level of general economic uncertainty, but the significant 
structural growth opportunities and our programme to deliver operational excellence, leave 
us well placed to continue to deliver both for our customers and our shareholders.
