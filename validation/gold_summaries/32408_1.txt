Group revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by  
7 per cent. to £22.5m (2016: £21.0m) whereas Net Fee Income (“NFI”) 
improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to £6.19m (2016: £5.73m). The 
NFI percentage has increased to 27.5 per cent. (2016: 27.3 per cent). 
APAC revenue increased to £8.82M from £6.92m last year. In the same 
period revenues in the UK decreased from £14.1m to £13.7m mainly due 
to a slowdown in the contractor market.
EBITDA was £25,000 for the year (2016: £257,000) mainly as a result of 
a slowdown in the UK market and continued investment into the USA, a 
market entered into for the first time last year. Although revenue grew 
in APAC, the continued investment in training and technology meant 
that the region made a loss for the year. The region has been through a 
year of restructuring and it is now in a position to grow the bottom line 
going forward. The year-end balance sheet showed borrowings increase 
from £1.2m to £1.5m to help fund the increase in revenue. This also 
had the effect of increasing the year end trade receivables to £3.9m 
(2016:£3.4m).
There was an operating loss for the year of £211,000 (2016: profit 
of £37,000). The Directors are not recommending the payment of a 
dividend for the year but resumption of dividend payments will be kept 
under review.
The 2017 result shows that we have maintained staff levels at 80 after 
a period of attrition during the year.
Our clients need to feel confident before making a permanent or 
contract hire and political events during the last financial year, including 
Brexit and the US presidential election caused a slowdown in decision 
making in some sectors.
UK operations
UK operations continue to see existing markets come under pressure 
from in-house recruitment and externally managed service providers. 
The UK business was restructured from a service provision and 
operational standpoint in Q3 last year. Headcount remained stable but 
the business did not meet its hiring targets internally. Over the last year 
the market has become more heavily brokered and fragmented and the 
ability to generate value in traditional digital sectors has been eroded.
In response to this, Nakama London has continued to increase its 
capacity to deliver within the expanding data and analytics markets 
across both corporate and agency clients. The data and analytics service 
line is complementary and relevant to the existing client base both 
within the UK and globally. Margins and rates are healthy in this sector 
and senior level candidates and clients are suited to the consultative 
and pro-active approach to recruitment that is at the core of Nakama’s 
delivery. The business will look to grow its capabilities in this area 
whilst continuing to look at the implementation of technology to create 
efficiency and higher margins through the automation of lower  
value work.

CEO’S REPORT  
CONTINUED
The UK financial services sector experienced a tougher environment 
with Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) challenges affecting 
contract margins within the sector. Overall there has been an increase 
in permanent billings, with demand for mid and senior level hires.
The UK general insurance market saw increased competition by RPO 
companies impacting on contract delivery and margins. The focus 
for Highams is on the business analyst/product and transformation 
markets within insurance as that is where we see the growth. During 
the year there have been new technology platform programmes 
and digital distribution activity requiring specialist skills. Regulatory 
legislation in insurance, wealth management and pensions is a 
necessary requirement and demand for skills in this area has been 
steady.
APAC operations
Operating conditions across the APAC region remain similar to the 
previous year. A mix of economic environments, financial periods and 
local cultures can prove challenging. We continue to address this by 
ensuring that businesses focus on servicing high value verticals in 
their current markets. All businesses have continued to drive retained 
services and consultancy offerings relevant to their markets. We have 
a key focus on training and development so that the right skills are 
developed along with an onboarding and talent attraction programme 
to ensure that the business attracts and retains the right talent in an 
increasingly competitive market. External competition is increasing 
and it is still Nakama’s key objective to invest in and build a strong 
management team to enable us to continue to pursue a consistent 
and clear strategy in multiple markets in line with the Group’s vision.
The APAC offices have again experienced an increase in turnover. 
This has yielded a 27% increase in revenue to £8.82m compared to 
£6.92m last year. However, investment in training and technology in 
the region during the year in order to future proof the business meant 
that the region made a loss this year of £20,000 compared to a profit 
of £189,000 last year.
The economic outlook in APAC is stable and the economy is in growth 
mode. Hiring restrictions in the Australian markets due to changes in 
legislation will put pressure on salaries and attracting consultants to 
the business. It is likely to have an ongoing effect on the permanent 
hiring outlook within Australia.The digital and technology disruption is 
beneficial in the sectors Nakama provides staff to, specifically within 
analytics, data, digital and transformation. Traditional non digital 
businesses have taken or started to undertake wholesale reviews 
of where to position themselves. There has been an appetite for the 
range of human resource consultancy services that Nakama is starting 
to provide in the region and we see this as an essential differentiator 
of Nakama’s product offering going forward.
Projects are being adopted by organisations across many industries 
which are driving demand for digital skills, a high proportion of 
which are not in the local market. Clients are focusing on a customer 
first digital strategy involving service and product design, the 
strengthening of their data and “big” data and analytics functions 
and we are continuing to see clients evolve their digital customer 
acquisition strategies.
The business has seen demand from the traditional consultancies that 
are now pursuing digital strategies to compete with the traditional 
advertising networks. In the new “gig economy” talent is increasingly 
more mobile than ever before and businesses are continuing to adapt 
to having more flexible staffing solutions. This is evident in the Asian 
markets where the contracting market has started to move from low 
value, low skill to high value, high skill within our sectors.
The client base across our APAC businesses has seen the business 
become more involved with corporate clients whilst continuing to 
service the advertising and digital agency businesses.

We continue to leverage our global networks to deliver against these 
demands. We see a natural cap on the Australian market due to its 
size and location but we still feel that the market has a high level 
of growth over the next financial year, specifically around the range 
of onsite and consultancy services Nakama is providing. The Asia 
businesses have continued to add revenue despite a mixed year 
where we saw changes and challenges in the South East Asia market. 
They have also been key in the introduction of new business across 
the wider region.
Singapore focuses on the South East Asian corridor into Malaysia 
and Thailand, with Hong Kong continuing to build market share 
and experiencing high demand from China and the wider region. 
The businesses benefit from a collaborative approach to business 
development and creating opportunity throughout the region based 
on this approach. We see the growth of both these business units as 
essential to our strategy within the region.
All the APAC businesses continue to have a healthy balance of repeat 
business based on the areas of specialisation, new service lines and 
expertise within the local and increasingly global markets.
The market continues to be competitive; the businesses have seen a 
higher than expected turnover of staff this year in our South East Asia 
market and one of the Australian businesses and finding good quality 
candidates is difficult. The business has addressed this by refocusing 
its internal talent acquisition strategy and approach across all regions.
The business does benefit from having global operations and is 
focused on a sector that is in high demand, which has been beneficial 
to attracting staff from a variety of industries and locations.
The factors to success in APAC continue to remain similar to last 
year: increased competition, a highly mobile workforce that is 
increasingly looking for change, overcoming language barriers, 
restrictions on hiring staff in regions due to changes in legislation 
and financial constraints have the potential to force business costs to 
unsustainable levels and prevent businesses being able to hire.
Retaining high performing staff is critical and ensuring the business 
creates high performing staff in all regions is a key area of focus. 
The skillsets the business is looking to attract to deliver on the group 
strategy will add value to the group as a whole both regionally and 
globally. We maintain our outlook that a strong understanding of local 
and global technology, digital and consultancy markets and our ability 
to work across these from a local, regional and global perspective 
is essential in achieving the growth we seek and delivering to our 
shareholders.
