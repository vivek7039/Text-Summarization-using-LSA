Who we are
We are a visionary immunology 
business with specialist experience 
in the research and development 
of allergy treatments. We have 
a well-established commercial 
presence in Europe and are focused 
on the US market opportunity. 
What we do 
We specialise in the diagnosis 
and treatment of allergy. Allergy 
vaccination is a successful 
treatment that deals with the 
underlying cause of allergies 
and not just the symptoms
1
. 
We mainly sell our products in 
European countries and our pipeline 
of products in clinical development 
includes vaccines for grass, tree 
and house dust mite, as well as 
a peanut allergy vaccine in pre-
clinical development. Adjuvant 
systems to boost performance 
of vaccines outside allergy 
are also under evaluation.

What makes  
us different
Our ultra-short course treatments 
consist of 4-6 injections over the 
course of 3-6 weeks compared 
to daily tablets or an average 
treatment in the market of a 
12-15 course of injections. Our 
approach offers the simplicity of 
4-6 injections, increased tolerability 
and demonstrated efficacy
2
. 
Our adjuvant technologies improve 
therapies by allowing them to 
increase efficacy. We are further 
developing this concept in our 
specialist business, Bencard Adjuvant 
Systems; improving health and 
evaluating vaccinations for infectious 
diseases and cancer treatments. 
Our values have created a culture 
based around vision, commitment 
and humanity. We take extraordinary 
ideas and bring them to market 
– enhancing treatments and 
transforming people’s lives.
