Strategic report
Chairman’s introduction
Outstanding progress against 
our strategic objectives and 
further expansion of our 
global footprint.”
Colin Smith OBE
Non-Executive Chairman Strategic progress
I am pleased to report outstanding 
progress in 2017 against our strategic 
objectives and further expansion  
of our global footprint. 
In January we signed a joint venture 
agreement with Sonae Modelo Continente, 
Portugal’s leading food retailer, to form 
Sohi Meat Solutions which supplies a 
wide range of packaged beef, lamb, veal 
and pork products. In May we invested 
in Foods Connected Limited, a market 
intelligence data management company 
focused on the fresh food supply chain. 
In August we announced expansion in 
Central Europe to produce fresh foods 
including sandwiches, pizza, ready meals 
and soups. In October we announced 
we will expand into New Zealand by 
constructing a new meat processing 
facility to supply Countdown Supermarkets 
which is due to open in 2020. In November 
we completed the £81m acquisition of 
Seachill, a leading chilled UK based fish 
processor and since the year end we have 
agreed to restructure the Australia joint 
venture and take full operational control  
of its two existing plants. Given the growth 
in business categories and geographies, 
planning of future resource implications  
is well in hand.
The Seachill acquisition was funded 
through an equity placing which raised 
over £55m and a new bank refinancing 
putting in place a syndicated facility.
This expansion into a new protein, fresh 
foods and into new geographical markets 
provides Hilton with broader foundations 
to its business. This, together with the 
benefit of a new bank refinancing, means 
Hilton is well positioned for further growth.
Group performance
We grew our volume in 2017 maintaining 
a trend of continuous growth achieved 
in every year since Hilton’s flotation in 
2007. There was strong pre-exceptional 
operating profit growth of nearly 12% 
including the benefits of the Seachill 
acquisition and favourable exchange 
rate movements (over 2% up after 
exceptionals) which was achieved despite 
considerable investment in people 
and infrastructure to support growth. 
Pre-exceptional basic earnings per share 
were 11% above last year (down 1.5% 
after exceptionals).
Hilton continued to generate significant 
operating cash flow during 2017. 
This enabled the Group to end the year 
with net cash of £25.4m, compared with 
£32.3m at the end of last year, despite the 
significant investment made in the Seachill 
acquisition, net of the equity raised to part 
fund it. 
Our continued investment in our facilities 
includes new technology to increase 
capacity, improve operational efficiency 
and offer innovative solutions to our 
retailer partners.
There is a continuing climate of local, 
global and geopolitical uncertainties 
including the UK’s decision to leave 
the European Union. Although the final 
terms of Brexit are unknown, Hilton’s 
predominantly local sourcing and operating 
model leaves us well placed and we 
are confident that the Hilton business is 
resilient to weather these uncertainties.
Dividend policy
The Board considers that the Group’s 
progressive dividend policy maintained 
since flotation remains appropriate, given 
both the strategic progress achieved in 
2017 and Hilton’s continuing strong level  
of cash generation. With the proposed final 
dividend of 14.0p per ordinary share, total 
dividends in respect of 2017 will be 19.0p 
per ordinary share, an increase of 11.1% 
compared to last year. 
Our Board and governance
The Hilton Board is responsible for the long 
term success of the Group and, to achieve 
this, it contains an appropriate mix of skills, 
depth and diversity and a range of practical 
business experience, which is available to 
support and guide our management teams 
across a wide range of countries. I would 
like to thank my colleagues on the Board 
for their support, counsel and expertise 
during the year.
We remain committed to achieving good 
governance and compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code including 
succession planning and maintaining a 
talent pipeline.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will be held at the Old 
Bridge Hotel, 1 High Street, Huntingdon, 
Cambridgeshire PE29 3TQ on 23 May 
2018 at noon and my colleagues and I very 
much look forward to seeing those of you 
who are able to attend.
