 A sustainable growth story
Successful IPO and project financing
Energean’s Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange 
in March 2018, raising US$460 million, was a landmark 
accomplishment for the Company. It has effectively reopened 
the upstream IPO market after four years of relative stagnation 
and is a strong indicator that positive sentiment is returning 
to the London oil and gas sector. 
Signing the US$1.275 billion Facility Agreement in the same 
month was a key milestone in financing the development of 
the Karish and Tanin project and testament to the confidence 
placed in us by leading international banks.
Our investment proposition to the London market attracted 
substantial institutional interest, despite challenging market 
conditions. This proposition is characterised by the quality 
of our asset portfolio, our strategic position in the Eastern 
Mediterranean, our offshore experience and our management’s 
track record of value creation.
Our priority now is to deliver significant growth in our first year 
as a listed business.
Our strategy
Our aim is to maximise production, reserves and cash flow from 
our existing low-cost production base, while pursuing sustainable 
growth and returns through active development and exploration 
programmes in the Eastern Mediterranean. We will achieve 
this while maintaining a disciplined financial framework and 
a conservative balance sheet. This strategy is underpinned 
by our key competitive strengths:
 X We are an experienced offshore operator, operating 
the majority of assets in our portfolio
 X We are well-positioned as an independent, Eastern 
Mediterranean E&P to move quickly in an increasingly 
active region
 X We have a track record of value creation through timely 
acquisitions and efficient development
 X We have the depth and diversity across a series of assets at 
various stages of development to position us as a full-cycle, 
sustainable business
 X We have an experienced management team, with an 
international oil industry track record, who are significantly 
invested in Energean
 X We have a strong health and safety track record
 X We have world class industry partners such as TechnipFMC, 
BP and Repsol and strong financial capacity

Maximising output and cash  
flow from our producing assets
The Prinos and Prinos North oil fields, offshore North Eastern 
Greece, are low-cost producing assets that have already delivered 
115 million barrels of oil to date. The Prinos Basin licence was 
acquired in 2007 for US$1.5 million (plus acquired indebtedness). 
Since then, we have secured a 25-year licence extension and  
have increased reserves through the technical reappraisal of the 
reservoir, with a new 3D campaign undertaken in 2015 as well as 
further drilling activity enabling us to implement our fully-funded 
development plan to significantly increase production over the 
next three years. 
Energean’s long track record in the Prinos basin, operatorship 
of the majority of our assets, and low operating costs per barrel, 
underpins our ability to maximise cash flow from our reserves 
and resources. 
Prinosdevelopmentprogramme
In the Prinos Basin, we are delivering an investment plan of 
approximately US$350 million through 2021, which we expect to 
significantly increase production over the next few years, tapping 
the 39.5 MMbbls of discovered 2P oil reserves and 6 Bcf of 2P 
gas in the Prinos, Prinos North and Epsilon oil fields. 
This development plan includes drilling 24 new wells (with eight 
wells already drilled since December 2015); the construction of an 
unmanned platform to exploit the Epsilon field adjacent to Prinos; 
and infill drilling in the existing producing fields.
We regard Prinos as a low-risk development, due to our extensive 
knowledge and experience of the Basin and its geology, the 
secured offtake agreement with BP that will fully cover the 
expected increase in production, and the control we enjoy as 
operator over the related infrastructure.
2
Developing Karish  
and Tanin
Amaterialde-riskedopportunity
Our most significant undeveloped assets are the Karish and Tanin 
gas fields located offshore Israel, which we acquired in December 
2016 for US$148.5 million and which are set to transform our 
business over the next few years. The fields have an estimated 
2.4 Tcf of natural gas and 32.8 MMbbls of condensate and light 
oil (contingent 2C resources) .
At the time of acquisition, Karish and Tanin were stranded 
assets with no gas contracts in place. Along with receiving 
approval of our FDP from the Israeli government in August, 
last year we aimed to secure gas sale and purchase agreements 
with leading industrial companies and power producers in Israel. 
By December 2017, the Company had secured contracts with 12 
leading domestic industrial and independent power producers in 
Israel for the sale of 61 BCM of gas (up to 74 BCM including the OR 
gas supply agreement) over a period of 16 years on a weighted 
average basis. The annual production rate is estimated at 
approximately 4.2 BCM per year on an ACQ basis (up to 5.1 BCM 
per year including the OR gas supply agreement). This was 1.2 
BCM above the amount required to proceed with FID for Karish 
and Tanin and reflects the increasing energy demand in Israel.
Currently discovered 2C discounted cash flows from Karish 
and Tanin equate to an estimated NPV of US$830 million  
net to Energean (70% working interest (WI)) according to the 
NSAI CPR. This uplift in value has been realised in the space  
of 15 months, due to Energean’s ability to execute key project 
milestones quickly and effectively. 
The development of the Karish field, which is fully-funded to 
first gas in 2021, will materially increase the scale of the Group’s 
operations and support Energean’s strategy to become a major 
player in the Eastern Mediterranean gas market. Production from 
Karish will be solely used to supply Israel. Therefore, these assets 
are highly strategic for the development of the Israeli energy 
market and can help to meet increasing Israeli demand, increase 
market competition and improve security of supply. 
We have de-risked the project through a scalable development 
plan. Our new-build FPSO will allow Energean to develop its 
assets in the region and will be available to be used as a tie back 
option for future third party discoveries. The FPSO is currently 
the only such vessel earmarked for operation in the region, 
presenting us with an advantage to quickly capitalise on suitable 
adjacent discoveries.

Capitalising on growth opportunities  
in the Eastern Mediterranean
Katakolo
In addition to the Prinos Basin, we are also advancing the 
development of Katakolo in Western Greece in 2018, which 
we received government approval to develop in 2017 and which 
holds 10.5 MMbbls of 2P oil reserves and 6.2 Bcf of 2C gas 
resources. On approval of an Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessment, we expect to take our FID on the project in the 
second half of 2018, and drill the first pilot well in the second 
half of 2019. First oil is expected in 2020.
Exploration prospects
Energean has a focused exploration strategy with several 
exploration prospects in Greece, Montenegro and Israel. Our 
strategy revolves around identifying and exploring undeveloped 
areas where we have technical experience of similar geologies 
to minimise exploration risk. Our exploration portfolio has best 
estimate unrisked prospective resources of 3.1 Tcf of natural 
gas and 375.3 MMbbls of liquids. 
We deploy a controlled approach to managing exploration risk. 
This is evidenced in our two onshore Greek exploration assets, 
Aitoloakarnania and Ioannina, which we recently farmed out 
to Repsol as operator (60% WI), and who will carry 90% of the 
exploration costs. 
In March 2017, Energean signed a concession contract to explore 
blocks 26 and 30 offshore Montenegro, which hold best estimate 
unrisked prospective resources of 1.8 Tcf of natural gas and 
143.9 MMbbls of liquids. While the Eastern Adriatic remains 
substantially underexplored, Western offshore Adriatic has 
been a prolific hydrocarbon producing province for over 50 years  
for both oil and gas. We believe Montenegro has significant 
exploration potential for future oil and gas discoveries and the entry 
of ENI into the four blocks neighbouring those held by Energean, 
with significant exploration commitments, is an indication of the 
area’s potential. We plan to begin the 3D seismic acquisition at 
the end of this year, to be completed in the first half of 2019.
In November 2017, Energean Israel participated in Israel’s First 
Offshore Bid Round, and in December was awarded five licences 
for blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 31. The award of these exploration 
licences, adjacent to our Karish and Tanin project, further bolsters 
our exploration portfolio and long-term value potential in the 
region. Block 12 is on trend with the Karish and Tanin discoveries, 
presenting an opportunity for low-risk exploration, which could 
be developed via a tie back to the FPSO. 
4
Maintaining a disciplined  
financial framework
We have successfully maintained a conservative balance 
sheet throughout the commodity down-cycle, through careful 
management of working capital and low levels of bank debt. 
We aim to preserve our balance sheet flexibility, alongside 
disciplined capital deployment, backed by strong cash flow 
from our producing assets.
As our track record demonstrates, Energean continually assesses 
ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value-
accretive opportunities. We have strict investment criteria  
for new projects, typically targeting an unlevered internal  
rate of return of more than 15%. This approach, alongside  
the Group’s production, development and exploration  
prospects, will underpin Energean’s sustainable  
growth in the future.

Outlook
Energean is currently the only upstream Company on the  
LSE with considerable exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean, 
an area which is attracting increasing interest from global oil 
and gas majors. As a fast-moving independent, our aim is to 
take advantage of this trend and be part of the substantial 
infrastructure developments that will connect the region 
to local and wider markets.
As we progress through 2018, we are confident that our ability 
to acquire, de-risk and develop projects of significant scale can 
deliver a flow of new opportunities in the region.
We are well placed to capitalise on our growth plans and have the 
infrastructure, local relationships and track record to move swiftly 
on future value-accretive opportunities for all our stakeholders.

Health,safetyandtheenvironment
We see our health, safety and environmental (HSE)  
performance as a key aspect of the overall success of our 
business. We are committed to the highest standards of HSE 
regarding our employees, contractors, partners, the general 
public and the mitigation of our environmental impact.
Our experience of operating in environmentally sensitive areas 
without compromising them is something we are incredibly  
proud of. Energean’s HSE record has been an important factor  
in our successful bids for licences, including Karish and Tanin.
Energean is the only oil and gas producer in Greece and, together 
with its predecessor business, has a 37-year track record of 
operating offshore and onshore assets in environmentally 
sensitive areas. Energean’s experience and conscientious 
approach towards the management of its assets is a key 
differentiator in the sector. 
As we continue to scale up operations, we will remain focused 
on our key HSE performance indicators and the safety of our 
employees. These are key aspects of how we operate as a 
business and are integral to our culture and engagement with 
our stakeholders.

Low-cost producer with  
stable cash flow
Historically, we have been able to respond to oil price volatility 
by reducing our cost of production per barrel (excluding 
depreciation) at Prinos, largely through increased production. 
This approach led to our cost of oil production per barrel falling 
from US$63/bbl in 2014 to US$25/bbl in 2017.
Our aim is to maximise production, reserves and cash flow from 
our existing low-cost production base, while pursuing sustainable 
growth and returns through active development and exploration 
programmes in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Experienced and proven  
offshore operator
Energean is the operator of the majority of its assets, including 
Prinos, Prinos North, South Kavala, Epsilon and Katakolo in 
Greece; Karish, Tanin and Blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 31 in Israel; 
and blocks 26 and 30 in Montenegro.
Our operational and technical knowledge is core to our business, 
including our dedicated teams of geologists, geophysicists and 
production and reservoir engineers, which will help us to rapidly 
develop projects. This extensive knowledge has been built up 
across the business during more than 36 years of offshore 
operating experience in the Prinos Basin.
This experience and in-house capability have supported the 
Group in maintaining stable and risk-controlled production from 
Prinos and provided a platform to acquire attractive assets and 
de-risk key development projects.
The Directors believe that operatorship affords us the flexibility 
to progress projects at the most advantageous rates.
We intend to maintain a flexible and prudent approach to retaining 
or farming out operatorship, depending on the nature of each 
asset and its financing structure.
Strategically positioned in 
an increasingly active region
Our operations are focused on the Eastern Mediterranean,  
with the most significant assets located in Israel and Greece, which 
are both OECD countries and strategically attractive for investment. 
By maintaining a focused approach to this region, we believe the 
Group has developed strong relationships with all key stakeholders.
The Eastern Mediterranean has become an increasingly active 
area for E&P. Recent discoveries of material gas fields in Egypt 
and Israel (the Zohr and Leviathan fields, respectively) have drawn 
attention and investment to the region. In Greece, Exxon Mobil, 
Total, Edison and Repsol have been attracted to the hydrocarbon 
sector and have acquired, or expressed an interest in acquiring, 
Greek exploration blocks.
As an independent, locally-based E&P company, Energean  
is well positioned to move swiftly on opportunities in the Eastern 
Mediterranean.
Track record of value creation
Energean has a strong track record of value creation through 
timely acquisitions and efficient development.
The Prinos Basin licence was acquired in 2007, at what the 
Directors believe was a relatively advantageous valuation level. 
We have since been able to secure a licence extension and have 
increased reserves through technical reappraisal of the reservoir 
and drilling activity, enabling the implementation of a low-cost 
development plan. 
The most recent Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. Competent 
Person’s Report (‘NSAI CPR’) for Prinos estimates that Prinos 
Basin 2P assets will have a cumulative net cash flow (discounted 
at 10%) of approximately US$0.7 billion through 2035.
The value of Prinos to the Group is further enhanced by a 
four-year extension of Energean’s long-term offtake agreement 
with BP, from 2021 to 2025, for 100% of Prinos production. BP 
has been the Group’s offtaker in the Prinos Basin since 2013.
The Karish and Tanin leases were acquired in 2016 for 
US$148.5 million. The assets were sold due to a regulatory 
requirement relating to the seller.
The acquisition of Karish and Tanin was completed at a lower 
US$/boe value than other discoveries in the region, at a US$/boe 
value of 0.4 (excluding royalties), while Zohr (Egypt) and Aphrodite 
(Cyprus) have US$/boe values of 1.4 and 0.8, respectively  
(source: IHS Energy database – Herold).
At the time Energean acquired them, Karish and Tanin were 
stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. Since the 
acquisition of these leases, the Group has achieved a number 
of key milestones, including the approval of the Karish and  
Tanin Field Development Plan (‘FDP’) in August 2017. We have 
also signed 12 Gas Supply Agreements, totalling an estimated  
4.2 BCM per annum on an annual contract quantity (‘ACQ’) basis,  
or 3.1 BCM per annum on a take or pay basis.
Currently discovered 2C from Karish and Tanin equate to an 
estimated NPV of US$830 million net to Energean (70% (‘WI’)). 
This uplift in value has been realised in the space of 15 months, 
due to Energean’s ability to execute key project milestones 
quickly and effectively.
In addition, Energean has secured a number of attractive 
exploration licences in Israel, Western Greece and Montenegro, 
where we believe we can add value.
As our track record demonstrates, Energean continually assesses 
ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value-
accretive opportunities.
Experienced management with 
international industry track record
Energean’s management team and staff are drawn from 
international and national oil companies, major and smaller 
independents and engineering contractors.
Management’s experience encompasses a broad range of 
projects, asset types – including offshore (shallow and deep 
water) assets – and E&P technology, with over 200 years’ 
combined experience in the oil and gas industry.
We have offices in the UK, Israel, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt  
and Montenegro and our technical team has recently been 
expanded to support the move into deep water operations 
at Karish and Tanin.
World-class partners and 
strong financial backing
The growth and success of our business has been supported by 
our strong partnerships with industry-leading technical experts 
and the financial backing of major banks and specialist investors. 
These world-class partners, in addition to our strong customer 
relationships, have enabled us to realise our potential and will  
be integral to our future as we transform Energean into a leading 
international oil and gas business.
Strong health & safety record
Energean’s exemplary HSE performance is a key aspect of our 
overall success. We have operated in the Kavala and Thassos 
Island areas in Greece, both of which are environmentally 
sensitive locations with high tourist activity, for over 37 years.
Energean Gas benefitted from this experience and we believe 
that the Gulf of Kavala’s continued biodiversity and popularity 
with tourists are testament to our ability to conduct our 
operations in an environmentally sound and responsible manner.
Our HSE record has been an important factor in our success in 
bidding for licences and we are committed to maintaining the 
health and safety of all our employees and other stakeholders.
Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 15 14 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Greece
Energean is currently the only company in Greece operating 
producing oil and gas assets.
Interest in the country from international oil and gas companies 
is growing. A consortium of Exxon Mobil, Total and Hellenic 
Petroleum has bid for two licences offshore Crete, and Repsol 
and Hellenic have jointly bid for a block in the Ionian Sea.
Energean also operates four development stage fields at Prinos 
and Prinos North in Kavala, Epsilon in Northern Greece and 
Katakolo in Western Greece.
Montenegro
The Eastern Adriatic remains underexplored, despite having 
what appear to be all the necessary hydrocarbon-generating 
components. Large prospects have been identified offshore 
Montenegro. These are on a par with recent oil discoveries in 
northern Albania, such as the onshore Shpirag-2 discovery. 
To date, over 5 billion barrels of oil in place have been discovered 
within this prolific carbonate play.
In March 2017, Energean signed a concession agreement with 
Montenegro for offshore Blocks 30 and 26. The NSAI Ioannina 
and Montenegro CPR indicates that the two blocks hold best 
estimate unrisked prospective resources of 1.8 Tcf of natural 
gas and 143.9 MMbbls of liquids.
Market overview
Maximising opportunities  
in a highly prospective region
The Eastern Mediterranean 
The Eastern Mediterranean is an increasingly active E&P region. 
Recent discoveries in Egypt and Israel (the Zohr and Leviathan 
gas fields, respectively), as well as the Aphrodite and Calypso 
fields in Cyprus, have drawn investment from global oil and  
gas majors.
The region represents a large captive market in which 
governments are seeking to transition to cleaner sources of 
energy and are keen to expand sovereign resources. Growing 
demand from Western Europe for alternative sources of gas has 
raised the prospect of strategic pipelines being put in place that 
will considerably increase the economic importance of Eastern 
Mediterranean assets.
Our opportunity
Energean is well positioned to target and compete for 
opportunities in this region. In addition to our strong track  
record of value creation from assets in the Prinos Basin, we have 
secured world class industry partners (such as BP, Repsol and 
Prime Marine) and strong financial backing from the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Kerogen 
Capital and Third Point.
Our expanding presence in the Eastern Mediterranean will 
strengthen our ability to create new opportunities.
Game-changing gas discoveries
The Eastern Mediterranean has seen a number of major gas 
discoveries in the last decade. These include the Tamar gas field, 
currently estimated to contain 11.2 Tcf of gas reserves, in 2009 
and the Leviathan gas field, estimated to contain 21.4 Tcf of gas, 
in 2010, both off the coast of Israel. 
Cyprus’ oil and gas sector has experienced significant expansion 
following the discovery of the Aphrodite gas field, with an estimated 
4 Tcf of natural gas, in January 2012. ENI, Total, Exxon Mobil and 
Qatar Petroleum are currently operating in the country.
In February 2018, ENI announced the Calypso 1 gas discovery, 
offshore Cyprus, which it described as “a promising gas discovery 
that could contain more than 230 BCM of gas”.
Increasing M&A activity
The Eastern Mediterranean has recently received investment 
from world class companies.
Landmark deals in the region include Tamar Petroleum’s 
purchase of a 7.5% stake in the Tamar natural gas reserve  
in January 2018, for US$560 million and 38.5 million shares.  
Two Zohr field deals were concluded in Q4 2016, with Rosneft 
acquiring a 30% share in the field for US$1.125 billion and BP 
securing a 10% interest in the Shorouk concession, offshore 
Egypt, which contains the Zohr gas field, for US$375 million.  
In March this year, UAE’s Mubadala Petroleum acquired a 10% 
stake in Shorouk for US$934 million. In February 2018, two Israeli 
firms signed a US$15 billion agreement to export gas to Egypt 
from Leviathan and Tamar. The deal will see 64 BCM of gas 
supplied over 10 years with an implied price of c.US$6.6/mmbtu.
East Med Pipeline and export  
routes to Europe
A 1,700km pipeline connecting the Eastern Mediterranean’s 
Levantine Basin (Israel) with the European gas network, via 
Greece and Italy, is due for completion in 2025. 
Known as the East Med Pipeline, this development has been 
classified as a European Project of Common Interest. A MoU has 
already been signed between Israel, Greece, Italy and Cyprus to 
support the expected US$6–7 billion pipeline construction.
Regional market overview
Israel
Over the last decade, Israeli natural gas demand has been  
among the fastest growing globally. Future demand is forecast  
to increase substantially, primarily driven by the electricity sector 
to serve population growth, rising living standards, increased 
water desalination, electrification of the railway system, and the 
adoption of electric vehicles and compressed natural gas (‘CNG’) 
for transportation. Israel consumed 10.4 BCM of gas in 2017.  
The Israeli Ministry of Energy anticipates that demand will 
increase to 12.5 BCM in 2020 and to 18 BCM by 2030, of which 
85% will be for electricity generation and industrial use.

Future pipeline developments
There are currently three major pipeline projects which could 
traverse Greece. The Trans-Anatolian pipeline is planned to run 
from the Turkish border with Georgia, to the Greek border at 
Edirne. Here, the pipeline will connect to the Trans-Adriatic 
pipeline, which is planned to run across Greece to Albania in the 
west. The East Med pipeline is planned to run from the Levantine 
basin (Israel) to Cyprus then to Crete, the Peloponnese and finally 
connect with the Poseidon pipeline to Italy. 
A floating gas storage and regasification unit offshore 
Alexandroupolis is expected to begin operations in 2020,  
creating a fourth import route to Greece. 
Oil price outlook
Oil prices began to recover in 2017 following the oil price  
crash in mid-2014. However, prices remained volatile,  
ranging from US$44.82/bbl (21 June 2017) to US$67 .02/bbl  
(26 December 2017).
Energean’s conservative financial management and its focus  
on operating costs give the Group confidence that it can prosper 
under a range of oil prices.

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 17 16 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Our strategy in action
Energean is focused on a clear strategy of producing, 
developing and exploring existing and new assets in the 
Eastern Mediterranean. By maximising the potential of our 
assets and building momentum in this increasingly active 
region, we aim to deliver real value in this new era of our 
growth story.
Maximising  
output and cash  
flow from our  
producing assets
Maximising our low-cost 
production base
A key strategic priority is to increase Prinos Basin production 
and cash flow. Our existing development plan targets the 
monetisation of 2P reserves of 39.5 MMbbls of oil and 6.0 
Bcf of gas, as well as 2C resources of 22.9 MMbbls of oil and 
5.3 Bcf of gas, as of 31 October 2017, according to the NSAI 
Prinos CPR. Our long-term development plan from 2018–
2021 includes: drilling 24 new wells; constructing an 
unmanned platform to exploit the Epsilon Field, adjacent to 
Prinos; and infill drilling in the existing producing fields. We 
estimate average 2P production rates to increase to 
4,000–4,500 bopd in 2018 as new infill wells are brought on 
stream in the Prinos complex.
Our focus for the next  
12 months
 X Complete Prinos Alpha in-fill programme  
(PA-32 drill, PA41 w/o, PA-33 maint)
 X Deepen PA-32 to Kazaviti and undertake production test
 X Add to the Alpha programme an ERD well drilled to Epsilon
 X Commence fabrication of Lamda jacket for the  
Epsilon field
