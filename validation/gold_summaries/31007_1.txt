We continue to achieve this by providing consumers with the 
most up to date, engaging and comprehensive property 
content together with search, research and home moving 
tools to support their home moving journey. In addition to  
the hundreds of updates to our platforms each month,  
recent improvements and innovations include: redesigning 
map-based search and the introduction of ‘Where can I live?’ 
discovery-based search functionality which helps consumers 
find homes in areas which are affordable and convenient for 
them. Innovation requires experimentation, and in 2017 we 
piloted an experimental app, ‘RentLondon’, which explored 
trends in search to make the process of finding a rental 
property more efficient. It incorporated a ‘messenger bot’ to 
enable renters to conduct their entire search using natural 
language via Facebook Messenger. The future is exciting as 
we take the learnings from RentLondon and apply them to  
our core search functionality in 2018.
We continued to invest in our brand in 2017, concentrating on 
two market sectors: renters, and those looking to find the right 
home near the right school. We launched the latest iteration 
of our ‘find your happy’ television campaign on Christmas Day. 
This next phase brings to life strong emotional stories which 
many home hunters connect with. The stories all relate to why 
people move, not just the search process. Our first critically 
acclaimed advert in the series addresses downsizing and 
growing families. It not only created a bit of a stir on social 
media but reflects our position at the heart of home moving 
for all generations. Brand building will continue to focus on 
national television through our partnership with Channel 4 
supported by online video on demand. We will also continue  
to add further presence in London with 400 branded taxis, 
additional outdoor media and our exclusive partnerships  
with the Evening Standard and Time Out. 
Rightmove, the UK’s number one property portal, has 
delivered another year of record results. Our number of 
advertisers grew by 2% to reach an all-time high of nearly 
20,500 and with advertisers spending more on our products, 
data and services, our revenue increased by 11% to £243.3m 
with underlying operating profit
(1)
 up 11% to £184.4m and 
operating profit up 10% to £178.3m.
Home movers visited Rightmove over 1.5 billion times in 
2017, an increase of over 4% on 2016 and they spent nearly  
a billion minutes on Rightmove every month.
Our continued progress is testament to our restless focus  
on the UK property advertising market and the huge effort 
‘Rightmovers’ have made to build our business in partnership 
with our industry customers. This restless innovation was 
recognised by Forbes in 2017, ranking Rightmove as the 
world’s most innovative growth company for the second year 
in a row. Our innovation is focused on making our marketplace 
simpler and more efficient, creating even more reasons to be 
excited by the opportunities ahead for Rightmove.
Our Strategy – making home moving easier
The place consumers ‘turn to first’ and engage with most 
At the core of our strategy is a relentless focus on continual 
improvement and innovation to create the most compelling 
experience for consumers so that they turn to us first. With 
our focus on doing the right thing for both consumers and 
customers, Rightmove is a trusted and valuable source of 
property information. We provide support for home movers 
enabling them to feel confident, inspired and in control.  
This not only results in more consumers turning to Rightmove 
first and engaging with us, but importantly it generates more 
and better quality leads for our customers than anywhere  
else, leading to better outcomes and greater value for them.

searching commercial property listings on Rightmove.  
This activity generated more than 650,000 leads for our 
customers. As a result more and more commercial agents 
and commercial landlords are choosing to advertise with us.
Our Data Services business continues to help the property 
industry by leveraging our unmatched pool of property data.  
In addition to providing our Agency and New Homes 
customers with invaluable data driven insights, we use our 
data and technology to run a market leading automated 
valuation model for some of the largest lenders and help the 
surveying industry to drive efficiencies in their businesses.  
For example, our Surveyors Comparable T ool saves surveyors 
preparation time, improves valuation accuracy and provides 
documentary proof of the process making it the go-to tool  
for the industry. During 2017 the tool assessed and scored 
over 1.7 billion comparable property records to create over 
two million compatible reports for surveyors. 
Unrivalled exposure, leads and products for our customers
With visits to our platforms growing for the 16th consecutive 
year we continued to increase the exposure for our 
customers’ brands and properties. This exposure generated 
43.6 million leads for our customers, seven percent down on 
2016. The surge in lettings stock following the stamp duty 
increase for second properties in April 2016 meant for most 
of 2017 the lettings market was less frenetic giving potential 
tenants more choice. In these market conditions each tenant 
typically sends fewer leads as they are more assured of 
securing the property they want. In addition, this takes 
account of the full year impact of changes we made to the 
search flow in the second half of 2016 to further increase the 
quality of our leads. In order to help agents become more 
efficient every lead sent through Rightmove is now about a 
specific property.
More consumers than ever turned to Rightmove in 2017 with 
over 1.5 billion visits across all our platforms. Time spent on 
the Rightmove platforms was unchanged year on year at a 
record equalling 11.7 billion minutes. Against the backdrop of  
a new, faster site infrastructure rolled out during 2016, a less 
frenetic lettings market and the increase in use of mobile 
devices, which typically have lower average time per visit,  
this demonstrates the continued popularity and importance 
of our platforms. Our market share of traffic across both 
desktop and mobile was 73%
(2)
 with the mobile component 
even higher at 79%
(2)
.
The tools we provide for researching the market bring 
simplicity and confidence to sellers and landlords. T raffic to  
our research tools also grew significantly in 2017 as sellers  
and landlords turned to Rightmove first to help inform their 
decisions. Our research tools, such as sold prices data, are  
by far the most widely used in the UK and provide the unique 
benefit of access to our catalogue of one million currently 
listed properties and 45 million historical property records. 
Consumers spent over 420 million minutes using our research 
tools in 2017 which is up by over 15% on the previous year.
Visits to our Overseas property site remained consistent  
with levels seen in 2016, suggesting the dream of owning a 
property abroad for many of the British public continues to  
be a popular one, despite the fall in Sterling and uncertainty 
around the UK’s relationship with Europe. Given the 
environment, it is testament to the value of our advertising 
platform that the number of overseas properties we 
advertised increased by 6% on average despite the  
number of overseas estate agent and developer  
customers advertising falling by 7%. 
Our Commercial property advertising business continues  
to gain momentum with commercial property professionals 
and occupiers spending over 11 million minutes per month

Average Revenue Per Advertiser increased by 10% to  
£922 driven by customers spending more on products  
and packages and price increases.
Innovation to create a simpler and more  
efficient marketplace 
Combining our software and whole of market dataset whilst 
supported by our dedicated account management teams, we 
help customers drive operational efficiencies and inform their 
business decisions. Our focus is in the areas our customers 
value most, which in the case of our agents is identifying 
potential business and winning and retaining that business. 
Whilst our software tools are already recognised as being  
best in class and widely adopted with 90% of our Agency 
customers using our tools each month, it is not in our DNA  
to stand still and we have continued to innovate our market 
intelligence software for agents, Rightmove Intel. Winning  
new business is a resource intensive activity for our customers 
and 2017 saw the introduction of a number of reports which 
highlight both new and secondary business opportunities 
meaning agents can spend more of their time on the most  
valuable opportunities.
These innovations have been warmly received by customers. 
For example in November 2017 our customers ran over two 
million reports, a remarkable 67,000 reports per day and more 
than double the number in November 2016.
Rightmove Intel also helps customers more efficiently 
communicate the marketing performance of properties to 
their vendors. The Marketing Report, which shows the interest 
a property is generating compared to similar properties on the 
market, launched at the end of 2016, was run on over 400,000 
different properties for sale in 2017, covering nearly a third of 
all properties listed in the year. 
2018 will see us continue on this path. We will be releasing a 
number of new tools to help agents become more efficient 
including a tool to help prioritise vendor enquiries from 
Rightmove and a solution to better manage the process  
of referencing rental tenants in advance of the looming  
tenant fee ban. 
Our  focus on the quality of our leads continues to stand us in 
good stead as they convert far more often to instructions, 
sales and lets for our customers. In fact, we generate 86%
(3)
  
of the sales and lets from portals for our Agency customers, 
our fourth year of consecutive growth. No wonder , when 
home sellers and landlords are so much more likely to find 
their buyer or tenant on Rightmove compared to any other 
portal, that 85%
(4)
 of people selling their home rank Rightmove 
as the most important site for marketing their property. 
Winning the right to an instruction to sell or let a property is 
critical to an agent’s success. Over a million of the email leads 
sent by home movers to agents highlighted that they had a 
property to sell, each one creating an instruction opportunity 
for a customer. These were in addition to the instruction 
opportunities that came via our telephone leads, which 
accounted for around 60% of all leads. We also delivered 
175,000 leads from people asking for a valuation on their 
home, for those customers who bought our popular Local 
Valuation Alert product. 
Following the acquisition of the Outside View in 2016 we 
launched our new ‘Rightmove Discover’product in July 2017. 
Using our combined knowhow and Rightmove’s unique 
dataset, Rightmove Discover uses predictive analytics to 
identify the most likely potential sellers in a local area within the 
next six months and markets to them on behalf of an agent. 
The early success of Rightmove Discover is encouraging and 
since launch, we have delivered nearly 16,000 high quality email 
leads to our customers in 750 areas. Customers also report an 
increase in potential vendors contacting them via telephone 
and their own websites. Our customers who have purchased 
the product have benefitted from exclusive, early contact from 
vendors of an equivalent of 5% of resale properties which 
came to market in the second half of the year.
There is significant headroom to grow product revenue as we 
leverage data to increase the penetration of existing products, 
evolve their value and pricing, and continue to innovate and 
introduce new products as customers look to invest more to 
drive their brand exposure and gain market share. This year

In parallel with these new events we continue to run our ever 
popular webinar series which allows estate agency teams to 
learn how to make the most of the Rightmove platforms  
while also covering industry topics and more general business 
practices. In 2017 we ran 170 webinars attended by over 
16,500 people.
Build great teams with a culture to innovate
Rightmove is people and our people define Rightmove. 
Rightmove has a culture which is both restless and focused. 
We strive to create one team of Rightmovers with as few 
barriers as possible to rapid growth and innovation. We believe 
that this comes from a process-light, highly connected 
organisation with little constraining hierarchy and bureaucracy. 
It is about employing the right people, giving them the 
freedom and authority to innovate and lead, and then guiding 
them to succeed. In order to hear the symphonies produced 
by a well-functioning team we need every Rightmover to be  
both individually empowered and accountable. 
A diverse Rightmove is important to us. We recognise that a 
diverse team will provide a wide range of perspectives that 
promote innovation and business success. Drawing on what  
is unique about individuals adds value to the way we do 
business and helps us anticipate and provide what our 
customers want from us and what home hunters want  
from the Rightmove platforms.
Foremost in the design of our expanded London home,  
we have taken care to create a physical environment that 
encourages open and honest discussion, including social 
spaces for the teams to enjoy each other’s company.  
Our workplace is free from offices and the usual trappings  
of hierarchy.
We believe in sharing often and early and reinforce this 
through events such as ‘townhalls’ which share progress, 
successes and challenges. In June 2017 the whole of 
Rightmove spent a day and a summer night under canvas 
together building and reinforcing cross team connections. 
Beyond Rightmove Discover our data continues to provide 
the basis for a rich seam of innovation. Following successful 
experiments during 2017, we intend to launch Rightmove 
Active Display in 2018, which will allow our New Homes 
customers to target their potential audience on Rightmove 
based on the home hunter’s usage of Rightmove over time, 
not just their current search criteria.
The digitalisation of the property industry and the efficiencies 
our software and tools bring help to reduce the cost per 
Agency office and have also enabled the growth in the 
number of customers. Over the last 12 months our 
membership base has grown to close to 20,500 customers.
We care about our customers’ business success and building 
strong partnerships is vital to support their ambitions, 
especially in light of the significant digital changes that are 
taking place. T o that end we are spending more time with 
customers than ever before and making sure that more  
of our conversations lead to recommendations that our 
customers truly value.
In 2017 we evolved our event programme with the 
introduction of ‘Rightmove Live’. These events brought 
together speakers from a range of industries covering content 
applicable to all small and medium sized businesses, with an 
objective of inspiring and motivating. Speakers included  
Dr David Lewis, ‘father of neuromarketing’; Nicky Moffat CBE, 
British Army highest-ranking female officer and Andrew 
McMillan, Head of Customer Service at John Lewis. In keeping 
with an online culture these events are now hosted on an ‘on 
demand’ platform, meaning our customers can benefit from 
this content irrespective of whether they were able to attend 
on the day. 
We also recognise our role in helping our customers keep up 
to date with a changing industry. Bringing together industry 
experts covering a range of changes facing agents in 2018, 
including the General Data Protection Regulation and lettings 
legislation, ‘Legislation Live’ was attended by over 250 agents 
from around the country with a further 600 watching a live 
stream of the event.
We care about our customers’ business 
success and building strong partnerships 
is vital to support their ambitions. rightmove.co.uk 12
Investing in our  
market leading brand
Our marketing connects with the strong positive 
emotions that moving home often generates and 
reaffirms that the UK public moves with Rightmove. 
The place consumers ‘turn to first’ and engage with most
With the focus on doing the right thing for both consumers 
and customers, Rightmove is a trusted and valuable  
source of property information.

Our culture is not solely built on events like these, but  
also from the everyday small gestures, including sending 
employees monkey puzzle tree seeds to celebrate National 
T ree week or a ‘Rightmove-versary’ card to mark their first 
anniversary at Rightmove. Everything together creates a 
unique and driven environment that we believe results in 
people feeling a sense of belonging and a passion to perform. 
By striving to make Rightmove a great place to work we can 
attract and retain the best talent and provide the best service 
for consumers and customers.  
Great talent and passion to perform is not enough to make  
a great Rightmover; the way in which we behave towards  
each other , our customers and consumers is vital. We expect 
the very highest standards of ethical behaviour from all 
employees. How we go about our work is central to our 
recruitment, feedback and personal development processes. 
We also have a scheme to allow Rightmovers to recognise 
their peers who embody the behaviours we aspire to. 
The biggest influence on our culture, of course, comes from  
our people. Their actions and behaviours create the sense of 
belonging and connection and allow the business to continue  
to thrive and attract great people. In our 2017 ‘Have Your Say’ 
people survey , 90% of Rightmovers responded that they think 
‘Rightmove is a great place to work’. Whilst this is a very strong 
result, it is below the record high level of 95% achieved in 2016. 
T o celebrate those employees who have been part of the 
Rightmove journey for more than ten years we have continued 
with our well known, although not widely replicated, practice of 
creating a gnome in their image. In the fast moving world of 
today , long tenures with single organisations are becoming  
rarer so I’m pleased that we have expanded our ‘gnome tree’  
to accommodate an ever growing collection of gnomes. 
Our culture sets us apart from many organisations and is 
defined by everyone of the nearly 500 people who are proud 
to call themselves Rightmovers. I would like to thank them  
all for creating a culture which continues to drive our  
business success.
Current trading and outlook
We believe the outlook for the UK online property advertising 
market remains positive, despite the continuing uncertainties 
stemming from the result of the EU referendum. Consumers 
and customers are becoming increasingly digital and therefore 
spend continues to transition from traditional advertising 
channels. 
Our clear market leadership coupled with the value of  
our products and data positions us well for the future.  
With Average Revenue Per Advertiser continuing to  
grow from a stable membership base the Board remains 
confident of making further progress in 2018.
