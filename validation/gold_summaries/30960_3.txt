 6 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
CHAIRMANâ€™S STATEMENT
I am pleased to be introducing the 
2017 Annual Report for Gulf Marine 
Services, a year in which GMS 
celebrated 40 years of successful 
operations. The Group has made 
good progress in securing new 
contracts despite the protracted 
market recovery.
The Group has delivered an adjusted EBITDA 
for 2017 of US$ 58.5 million (2016: US$ 
106.8 million) in what was a challenging year 
for the oil and gas industry. Our continued 
focus on cost management has enabled  
us to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin  
of 52% (2016: 60%). A loss for the year of 
US$ 18.2 million (2016: net profit of US$ 29.4 
million) has been reported, although the 
underlying performance after adjusting for 
certain items, was a net profit of US$ 4.8 
million (2016: US$ 50.7 million). 
No dividend will be paid for 2017. The Board 
believes the cash generated by the business 
is better utilised for the reduction of bank 
debt at this time. Shareholder priorities 
continue to be recognised and dividend 
payments will be resumed as soon as 
reasonable financial prudence allows.
During the year we agreed certain amendments 
to our bank facilities, which has increased our 
liquidity and financial flexibility and this will allow 
us to benefit from improving market conditions. 
We have been encouraged by the increasing 
levels of enquiries and tender activity in the 
Middle East and Europe. During 2017, the 
Group secured five new contracts with a 
total charter period of just under eight years. 
Our backlog stands at US$ 160.6 million  
as at 1 March 2018 (all contracts include 
option periods). 
Vessel age has become increasingly  
relevant, with our clients currently able  
to demonstrate a preference for modern 
tonnage. Our investment in our new build 
programme has ensured GMS is well-placed 
to address this in tenders, with our fleet now 
one of the youngest in the industry. The 
performance of our Large and Mid-Size 
Class vessels in particular is notable, with 
these achieving above 70% utilisation. 
We are delighted to have amongst our new 
contract wins two long-term charters for wind 
farm projects in Europe, where the Group 
has worked successfully in the renewable 
energy sector in the past. A good example of 
how we use our operational experience and 
technological expertise to provide tailored 
solutions for our clients is the crew transfer 
system we developed for one of these 
projects, which is discussed later in this report.
I would like to thank all our staff, both 
land-based and offshore, for their hard work 
and their continued commitment to health 
and safety across the business and their 
achievement of zero lost time injuries in 2017 
is excellent. 
The Group is well-positioned to capitalise  
on a market recovery under the leadership  
of our CEO Duncan Anderson and his strong 
management team.
