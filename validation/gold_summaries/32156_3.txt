 Continued growth in uncertain times
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
Following graduation from AIM to a Premium Listing 
on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange 
in August 2016, the Company became a constituent 
of the FTSE 250 and FTSE All‑Share indices on 
19 December 2016. From the same date, it was also 
included in the EPRA indices which measure the 
performance of the European listed REIT sector. 
I would like to welcome all new shareholders joining 
the register as a result of these significant events.
On admission to the Main Market, NewRiver REIT plc 
became the ultimate parent company, replacing 
NewRiver Retail Limited. The change in name 
reflected the combination of the Company’s 
portfolio now including both retail and leisure 
assets as well as its high dividend pay‑out ratio as 
a UK‑registered Real Estate Investment Trust. The 
core business strategy remains unchanged and the 
Company continues to operate according to its strict

I am delighted to report that NewRiver REIT plc 
(“NewRiver”) produced excellent financial results for the 
year ended 31 March 2017. Funds From Operations grew 
by 24% to £58 million, and the Company increased the 
ordinary dividend for the period by 8% to 20.0 pence per 
share (FY16 18.5 pence), as well as declaring an additional 
special dividend of 3.0 pence per share.
founding principles of active asset management and 
risk‑controlled development.
NewRiver’s specialism is owning convenience‑led, 
community‑focused assets, primarily serving 
family shopping and leisure requirements. Its 
occupiers are, in the main, value‑led retailers, 
paying affordable rents and providing shoppers with 
everyday non‑discretionary items such as clothing 
and groceries. From the perspective of the landlord, 
this sector consistently proves itself to be a highly 
resilient segment of the retail market, capable of 
sustaining cash flows in most economic conditions. 
The strength of the Company’s key operating 
metrics demonstrated the soundness of its business 
model during what was at times a turbulent year 
for the retail sector generally. Notably, like‑for‑like 
footfall and occupancy levels both improved 
compared to the previous period.
12 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Company showed agility in the acquisitions 
market over the year with the purchase of a major 
shopping centre in Bexleyheath, South East London, 
a retail park in Dumfries and a retail warehouse 
in Sheffield. The latter purchase subsequently 
generated cash receipts of £11.5 million, which, 
in accounting terms, fall within the definition of 
Funds From Operations. The Board has therefore 
approved a further special dividend of 3.0 pence 
to be paid on 4 August 2017 to shareholders on the 
register on 16 June 2017. The ex‑dividend date will 
be 15 June 2017.
I am also delighted to announce that the first quarter 
dividend for FY18 will be increased to 5.25 pence 
per share (Q1 FY17: 5.00 pence), payable on 
4 August 2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 16 June 2017. The ex‑dividend date will be 
15 June 2017.
As previously announced, Chris Taylor, Senior 
Independent Director, stepped down from the Board 
with effect from 9 April 2017. On behalf of NewRiver, 
I would like to thank Chris for his major contribution 
over five years as a Non‑Executive Director and 
to wish him well for the future. On behalf of the 
Board, I would also like to thank NewRiver’s 
management and employees, whose hard work, 
enthusiasm and entrepreneurial flair delivered 
another strong performance. Finally, I am grateful to 
the Company’s advisers and shareholders for their 
continuing support.
While the Board is aware of general economic 
caution in light of uncertainty over Brexit 
negotiations and the potential for rises in inflation 
and interest rates, it believes that NewRiver is 
well placed to meet the challenges that could 
arise in this environment. The Company owns 
a sizeable portfolio with critical mass. It is highly 
cash generative with an occupier base representing 
some of the strongest covenants in the UK retail and 
leisure sectors. Assets are geographically diversified 
with a focus on day to day shopping needs which 
the Company considers to be significantly less 
volatile than other segments of the retail market.
The Board remains optimistic in its outlook for 
the Company and looks forward to the future 
with confidence.
