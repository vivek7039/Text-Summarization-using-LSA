 Our remuneration principles
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to support our overall vision to become the most dynamic, creative and trusted soft drinks company 
in the world. At the heart of our vision is our people, which the company is required to attract, engage and retain from across our global sector. 
To determine the shape, size and variability of each element of pay the Committee follow five key remuneration principles:
Competitive market positioning 
and opportunity
To attract, retain and engage the executive talent we need to realise our vision and deliver our 
strategy our remuneration arrangements need to be sufficiently competitive but not excessive.
Pay aligned with sustainable 
long-term performance
The mix between both fixed and variable pay as well as the balance between rewarding short 
versus long-term performance are critical to ensure they are correctly balanced and reward those 
behaviours that will lead to the realisation of our long-term vision without compromise for short-term 
gain. In addition, all forms of variable pay are only fully delivered in return for performance materially 
above the standards required by the company and our shareholders; In other words the superior pay 
opportunity available can only be realised in return for superior performance.
Incentive metrics aligned with 
our strategy and key KPIs
The performance measures selected to determine both our annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plans have been carefully considered to focus on a simple and effective selection 
of those key drivers of our strategy and long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Alignment of executive and 
shareholder interests
To ensure the continued alignment of executive and shareholder interests, the greatest potential 
pay opportunity for executives is via our long-term incentive plans. Awards are based in shares 
and are dependent on a balance of absolute and relative growth in long-term value creation for 
shareholders. In particular, the mix of share options and performance shares is designed to 
ensure that executives are only rewarded for superior market performance and the realisation 
of our vision. This is further reinforced by meaningful shareholding guidelines for executives so 
that their long-term wealth remains tied to Britvic’s sustained long-term success.
Mindful of our wider stakeholder 
responsibilities 
In support of our vision our Executive Directors’ pay arrangement are not only focused on 
financial returns but also mindful of performance against our wider long-term stakeholder goals. 
The Committee takes great care to set appropriate targets that do not compromise our wider 
stakeholder aspirations. Both malus and clawback provisions are in place to address potential 
inappropriate actions or risk taking when determining incentive plan pay-outs.
