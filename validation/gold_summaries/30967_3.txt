 Creating quality outcomes
through strong governance
Chairman’s Statement
1 
 All items are shown before amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
which, in 2017, was £0.1 million (2016: £0.2 million) as defined in the 
financial review and before exceptional costs which were £nil million 
(2016: £0.4 million).
AMS continues to progress as a leading international provider of high quality, high value, 
innovative and technologically advanced products for the surgical and advanced wound 
care markets. We are pleased to report another year of strong revenue growth, profit 
performance and cash generation. 
Our revenues increased 16% to £96.9 million (2016: £83.2 million), representing growth 
of 12% on a constant currency basis and our adjusted
7
 profit before tax increased by 
29% to £25.4 million (2016: £19.7 million) and our profit before tax increased by 32% 
to £25.3 million (2016: £19.1 million). The continued strong cash generation of the 
business has resulted in the Group ending the year with net cash of £62.5 million 
(2016: £51.1 million).
As reported at the half year, at the beginning of 2017 we reviewed our business 
structure and consolidated our Business Units from four to two. Our Branded Business 
Unit focuses on the distribution, marketing and innovation of all the Group’s branded 
products. Our OEM business focuses on the distribution, marketing and innovation of 
all the Group’s products that are supplied to our medical device partners and marketed 
under their brands. This new structure is designed to enhance focus and improve 
marketing efficiencies for the Group. We have restated our segmental prior year 
financials in line with this new reporting structure.
Good progress has been made with all of our brands. LiquiBand
®
 continues to do 
well in the US and we have gained a further 2% market share since we last reported to 
take our market share by volume to 26%. Revenue from our RESORBA
®
 brands grew 
steadily across all territories and has grown by 15% and by 6% at constant currency 
to £20.8 million (2016: £18.1 million), while ActivHeal
®
 grew by 4% to £6.3 million 
(2016: £6.0 million).
We were pleased to announce in October 2017 that we had agreed a patent out-
licensing agreement with Organogenisis for a collagen based wound dressing 
containing Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (“PHMB”). Under this agreement, we receive 
royalties from Organogenesis’ net sales in the US on the product. The agreement is in 
place for the life of the patent which expires in October 2026. 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.75p per share, making a total dividend for 
the year of 1.10p per share, an increase of 20% (2016: 0.92p). If approved at the Annual 
General Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 15 June 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 May 2018.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our employees for their contributions 
during the past year. We would not have been able to achieve our strong performance 
without their commitment and effort. I would also like to thank our customers, 
suppliers, business partners and shareholders for their continued support in helping AMS 
achieve its goals.
We ensure that the Group is managed in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as far as is reasonably practicable, although it is not a requirement 
for an AIM quoted company. The Board believes that effective corporate governance 
will assist in the delivery of sustainable shareholder value and safe-guard shareholders’ 
long-term interests.
AMS continues to be in robust financial health and we are continuing to grow our 
international footprint and scale. The Group is well positioned to increase investment 
in internal innovation and to actively pursue external opportunities in line with our  
long-term strategy and growth objectives.
