1 Adjusted EBITDA loss excludes share-based payment charges along with depreciation, amortisation,  
interest and tax from the measure of profit.
Overall, £7.5m of revenue generated 
from subscription fees and transactions 
over the network represented 68% 
of total revenue (2016: 80%, £5.2m). 
The balance, £3.5m, relates to 
implementation fees for new customers 
and new services and represents 
32% of total revenue (2016: 20%, 
£1.3m). This increase in value and 
share for implementation fees reflects 
the progress made in deepening the 
Group’s product offering within major 
accounts, particularly for our UK and 
international Tier 1 grocer clients where 
implementation fees were £2.8m (2016: 
£0.7m). These implementations open 
up recurring transactional revenues 
which benefit future periods.
Although message volumes increased 
10% in the year to 44.4m (2016: 
40.3m), messaging revenue fell to 
£1.6m for the year (2016: £1.8m). This 
reduction reflects the increasingly 
competitive messaging market. The 
Group renewed two key contracts 
during and after the year, for UK 
Power Networks and Paragon, and 
has seen increases in transactional 
volumes following those renewals. 
Gross profit
The gross margin increased to 88% 
(2016: 79%) as gross profit grew to 
£9.8m (2016: £5.1m). The core AIR 
gross margin carries a significantly 
higher margin than the messaging 
business, and has continued to 
improve during the year to 96% (2016: 
92%). This increase, together with the 
increase in core AIR revenue which 
now accounts for 85% of total revenue, 
has driven the improved margin.
Adjusted operating costs
Adjusted operating costs of £11.5m 
(2016: £6.9m) represent sales and 
marketing, product development (net 
of capitalised costs), operational IT, 
general and administration costs. 
The overall increase was in line with 
management’s expectations and 
plans for strategic growth, including 
supporting the international activity 
for Loblaw in Canada. The investment 
in people is the main driver of this 
growth, with the average headcount 
for the year increasing to 100 
(2016: 73). During the year the Group’s 
infrastructure was also enhanced with 
both an operational and a disaster 
recovery data centre in North America 
having been established, in addition 
to the existing facilities in the UK.
Within staff costs gross expenditure 
on product development increased 
69% to £2.9m (2016: £1.7m) reflecting 
investment in enhancing the capacity, 
features and speed of the AIR platform. 
Capitalised product development 
costs were £1.5m (2016: £1.2m) whilst 
amortisation of capitalised development 
costs was £1.5m (2016: £1.6m). 
EBITDA 
Reflecting the strategic re-investment 
of increased gross profits, adjusted 
EBITDA loss for the year was held at 
£1.8m (2016: loss £1.8m). To provide a 
better guide to the underlying business 
performance, adjusted EBITDA excludes 
share-based payment charges along 
with depreciation, amortisation, interest 
and tax from the measure of profit. 
The GAAP measure of loss before 
interest and tax improved to £3.8m 
(2016: £4.1m) reflecting a reduction in 
the non-cash share-based payment 
charge to £0.4m (2016: £0.6m).
EPS and dividend
Following receipt of £0.3m research 
and development tax credit 
(2016: £0.4m), reported basic and 
diluted loss per share was 15.73p 
(2016: loss per share 16.36p). 
The Board does not feel it appropriate at 
this time to commence paying dividends.
Group statement of financial 
position
Following the successful placing 
completed in June 2017 which raised 
£5.8m (net of costs), the Group had 
net assets of £8.9m at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £5.9m), including capitalised 
intellectual property of £2.2m (2016: 
£2.2m) and cash of £3.7m (2016: 
£1.3m). The increase in net assets 
reflects the proceeds of the placing 
offset by the loss made in the year. 
Cash flow and net cash 
Cash at the end of the year had 
increased to £3.7m (2016: £1.3m). The 
main components to the gross cash 
increase of £2.4m for the year (2016: 
£3.0m decrease) were the proceeds 
from the placing of £5.8m, offset by an 
operating cash outflow of £2.0m (2016: 
£1.5m) and capital investment in the 
AIR platform of £1.5m (2016: £1.2m).
Banking facility
During the year the Group extended 
its three-year revolving loan facility 
with Barclays Bank plc (first arranged 
in June 2016) to £3.0m (2016: 
£1.5m) that is currently undrawn and 
together with the funds raised in the 
placing means that the Group is well 
positioned to capitalise on recent 
momentum in the business and to 
pursue identified growth opportunities. 
Financial review
Redemption volumes, a key measure of usage of the 
AIR platform, grew by 58% year-on-year to 60.4m for 
the year (2016: 38.4m). In addition, loyalty interactions 
totalled 1.1m (2016: 0.1m).
Group results
Revenue
Revenue growth for the Group was up 
38ppts to 71% for the year (2016: 33%), 
with revenue increasing to £11.1m (2016: 
£6.5m). The Group is continuing to grow 
half-by-half and H2 2017 revenue 
accounted for £6.0m (H1 2017: £5.1m), 
representing growth of 18% on H1 2017 
(H1 2016 to H2 2016: 19%).
This growth has been driven by 
increased revenue from the AIR 
platform which now represents 85% 
of total revenue, £9.4m (2016: 72%, 
£4.6m). This increase was largely as 
a result of the Group’s success with 
Tier 1 grocer clients; Asda, Sainsbury’s 
and Loblaw. Revenue from Tier 1 
clients in the UK increased by 92% 
to £3.3m (2016: £1.7m). This growth 
was also supported by new business 
wins such as John Lewis and Society 
of London Theatres and deepening 
relationships with existing clients, thus 
increasing redemption volumes. 
Of the AIR platform revenue stream, the 
element specifically linked to recurring 
subscriptions and transactions saw a 
69% increase to £5.9m (2016: £3.5m), 
aided specifically by increased licence 
fees for the Tier 1 clients and the full 
year effect on transactions of the 
national roll out of the AIR platform 
across all Asda stores. This Tier 1 AIR 
revenue growth is also supported by 
growth from F&B clients (20%) and 
other retail clients (69%) in the year. 
Redemption volumes, a key measure 
of usage of the AIR platform, grew 
by 58% year-on-year to 60.4m for 
the year (2016: 38.4m) driven by the 
full year impact of our solution for 
Asda’s coupon counting going fully 
live in the prior year, initial Sainsbury’s 
transactions and increased volumes 
from existing F&B and other retail 
clients. In addition, loyalty interactions 
totalled 1.1m (2016: 0.1m) reflecting 
the adoption of our loyalty solution by 
Greggs and M&B during the year. STRATEGIC REPORT

Product risk
The Group’s business involves providing 
customers with highly reliable software 
and services. If the software or services 
contain undetected defects when first 
introduced or enhanced, the Group may 
fail to meet its customers’ performance 
requirements or otherwise satisfy the 
contract specifications. As a result, it 
may lose customers and/or may become 
liable to them for damages. Whilst the 
Group has liability insurance in place 
and endeavours to negotiate limitations 
on its liability in its customer contracts, 
this is not always commercially possible. 
Additionally, the Group is committed to 
developing products for its customers 
on a set timeline. However, the pace of 
progress of the development projects 
may not be as expected and the Group 
could fail to meet its customers’ timing 
or performance requirements. As a 
result of these risks, the Group may 
lose customers, may become liable 
to those customers for damages and 
may suffer damage to its reputation.
The Group has service level commitment 
obligations with some of its customers 
in which it provides various guarantees 
regarding levels of service. The Group 
may not be able to meet these levels 
of service due to a variety of factors, 
both inside and outside the Group’s 
control. If the Group fails to provide 
the levels of service required by the 
agreements, such customers may be 
entitled to terminate their contracts or 
may choose not to enter into new work 
orders with the Group and this may also 
damage the Group’s reputation and 
reduce the confidence of the Group’s 
customers in its software and services, 
impairing its ability to retain existing 
customers and attract new customers.
Online security breaches,  
data loss and fraud
Security breach and fraud remain key 
concerns in the online payments world 
and any security breach or fraud event 
might deter consumers from purchasing 
goods via online voucher and offer 
content. Any move away from the mobile 
channel for purchasing goods could 
have a negative impact on the Group’s 
growth prospects and revenues. 
Security breach and fraud may also 
lead to regulatory investigations, 
sanctions (including fines) and litigation 
with clients and consumers. Any 
regulatory investigation or litigation 
may be costly and may divert efforts 
and attention of the Group’s key 
management and other personnel 
and resources, may cause wider 
reputational damage to the Group and 
may result in existing clients terminating 
contracts and deter potential new 
clients from becoming actual clients.
Any compromise of the Group’s 
systems, security breaches or data loss 
may result in the temporary inability of 
the Group to operate its services and 
clients’ mobile sites and applications 
and therefore may have a detrimental 
impact on the Group’s revenues, 
both directly through the inability of 
the Group’s clients to trade or of the 
Group to authenticate offers, and 
indirectly through loss of confidence in 
the security of the Group’s platform. 
In line with its ISO 27001 accredited 
procedures, the Group uses a third party 
security and data compliance service to 
monitor and mitigate against this risk in 
addition to client specific security testing.
Dependence on key customers 
The Group is dependent on a 
number of key contracts and partner 
relationships for its current and future 
growth and development. A limited 
number of clients account for a large 
percentage of the Group’s revenue. 
Whilst the Group endeavours to enter 
and renew long-term agreements with 
its clients, there can be no assurance 
that clients will continue to be secured 
on acceptable terms and conditions.
 
Financial review continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
Evolution of the market
The Group operates in an evolving 
market and there is a possibility that the 
rate of growth in mobile commerce will 
not match independent predictions or 
that users of mobile devices will change 
their behaviour with respect to mobile 
commerce. The Group’s services are 
new and evolving and it is difficult to 
predict the future growth rates, if any, 
and the size of these markets. Even if 
the market for the Group’s products 
develops as anticipated, the Group 
may face severe competition from other 
businesses offering similar products 
and services and there can therefore 
be no assurance that the Group will 
be able to secure customers for its 
products and services on acceptable 
terms and conditions, or successfully 
adjust the Group’s strategy to meet 
the changing market dynamics. 
The Group is also entering new 
international markets and not all of 
these markets may be at the same 
stage of development. The Group 
may face competition from other local 
businesses in those territories offering 
similar products and services and there 
can therefore be no assurance that the 
Group will be able to secure customers 
for its services on acceptable terms and 
conditions, or successfully adjust the 
Group’s strategy to meet the different 
dynamics of these new markets. 
These risks are mitigated by the 
strength and experience of the 
Group’s management team.
Technological changes could 
overtake the products being 
developed by the Group
The Group’s business is dependent 
upon technology which could be 
superseded by superior technology, 
more competitively priced technology 
or a shift in retail practices which could 
affect both the potential profitability 
and the saleability of the Group’s 
product offering. Staying abreast of 
technological changes may require 
substantial investment. The Group’s 
existing software products need to 
develop continually in order to meet 
customer requirements. The Group may 
encounter delays and incur additional 
development and production costs 
and expenses, over and above those 
expected by the Directors, in order 
to develop suitable technologies and 
products. The technology used in the 
Group’s products is still evolving and 
is highly complex and may change 
rapidly. Research and development by 
other companies may render any of 
the Group’s products in development, 
or currently available, obsolete. This 
risk is primarily mitigated by the quality 
of the technical staff recruited.
Protection of intellectual property
The Group’s success and ability 
to compete effectively are in large 
part dependent upon exploitation of 
proprietary technologies and products 
that the Group has developed internally, 
the Group’s ability to protect and enforce 
its intellectual property rights so as to 
preserve its exclusive rights in respect of 
those technologies and products, and its 
ability to preserve the confidentiality of 
its know-how. The Group relies primarily 
on enforcement of its pending and 
granted patents under applicable patent 
laws and non-disclosure agreements to 
protect its intellectual property rights. 
No assurance can be given that the 
Group will develop further technologies 
or products which are patentable, that 
patents will be sufficiently broad in 
their scope to provide protection for 
the Group’s intellectual property rights 
against third parties, or that patents 
will have been granted in all new 
territories which the Group enters.
Patents pending or future patent 
applications may not be granted and 
the lack of any such patents may 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s ability to develop and market 
its proposed products. Where patents 
have been granted the Group may not 
have the resources to protect any such 
issued patent from infringement. There 
is a significant delay between the time of 
filing of a patent application and the time 
its contents are made public, and others 
may have filed patent applications for 
subject matter covered by the Group’s 
pending patent applications without the 
Group being aware of those applications. 
The Group’s patent applications may 
not have priority over patent applications 
of others and its pending patent 
applications may not result in issued 
patents. Even if the Group obtains 
patents, they may not be valid or 
enforceable against others. Moreover, 
even if the Group receives patent 
protection for some or all of its products, 
those patents may not give the Group 
an advantage over competitors with 
similar products. Furthermore, the Group 
cannot patent much of the technology 
that is important to its business. If the 
Group fails to obtain adequate access 
to, or protection for, the intellectual 
property required to pursue its strategy, 
the Group’s competitors may be able 
to take advantage of the Group’s 
research and development efforts.
Once granted, a patent can be 
challenged both in the patent office 
and in the courts by third parties. 
Third parties can bring material and 
arguments which the patent office 
granting the patent may not have seen. 
Therefore, issued patents may be 
found by a court of law or by the patent 
office to be invalid or unenforceable 
or in need of further restriction. STRATEGIC REPORT

Financial review continued
Staff recruitment and retention
The ability to continue to attract and 
retain employees with the appropriate 
expertise and skills cannot be 
guaranteed. Finding and hiring any 
additional personnel and replacements 
could be costly and might require the 
Group to grant significant equity awards 
or other incentive compensation, which 
could adversely impact its financial 
results. The Group’s future development 
and prospects depend to a significant 
degree on the experience, performance 
and continued service of its senior 
management team. Effective product 
development and innovation, upon which 
the Group’s success is dependent, 
is in turn dependent upon attracting 
and retaining talented technical and 
marketing personnel, who represent a 
significant asset and serve as the source 
of the Group’s technological and product 
innovations. In addition, to continue to 
expand the Group’s customer base, 
increase sales and achieve growth 
generally, the Group will need to hire 
additional qualified sales personnel 
as well as recruit further personnel in 
administrative and operational support 
functions. If the Group is unable to hire, 
train and retain such personnel in a 
timely manner an undue burden could 
be placed on existing personnel, the 
development and introduction of the 
Group’s products could be delayed 
and its ability to sell its products and 
otherwise to grow its business could 
be impaired and the delay and inability 
may have a detrimental effect upon 
the performance of the Group.
Changes in applicable  
laws and regulations
Laws and regulations governing internet-
based services, related communication 
services and information technology, 
e-commerce, the processing of personal 
data (including the introduction of the 
General Data Protection Regulation 
in 2018), the processing of payment 
card data and mobile commerce in 
the UK and other territories continue 
to evolve and, depending on the 
evolution of such regulations, may 
adversely affect the Group’s business.
Exit of UK from European Union
The UK has voted in an advisory 
referendum to leave the European Union 
(commonly referred to as “Brexit”). 
The impact of the referendum and 
consequent triggering of Article 50 of the 
Lisbon Treaty is not yet clear, but it may 
significantly affect the fiscal, monetary 
and regulatory landscape in the UK, and 
could have a material impact on its 
economy and the future growth of its 
various industries. Depending on the exit 
terms negotiated between EU Member 
States and the UK following Brexit, the 
UK could lose access to the single 
European Union market and the global 
trade deals negotiated by the European 
Union on behalf of its members. Such a 
change in trade terms could affect 
the attractiveness of the UK as an 
investment centre and, as a result, 
could have a detrimental effect on UK 
companies. This may impact the Group’s 
ability to access funding in the future, 
and its prospects. Although it is not 
possible at this point in time to predict 
fully the effects of an exit of the UK from 
the European Union, it could have a 
material effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and results of 
operations. In particular, it may impact 
the Group’s ability to recruit suitably 
skilled staff for its UK-based operations.
Exchange rate risk
As its international operations grow, 
exchange rate fluctuations could 
have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s profitability or the price 
competitiveness of its services. There 
can be no assurance that the Group 
would be able to compensate or 
hedge against such adverse effects 
and therefore negative exchange rate 
movements could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
prospects and financial performance.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group embraces working in a 
way that delivers financial, socially 
responsible and environmentally 
sustainable business performance 
and ensures adherence to the law and 
conducts its affairs to the highest ethical 
standards. We expect our customers 
and suppliers to embrace these same 
principles. The Group values teamwork, 
taking personal responsibility, positive 
attitudes and working hard to deliver 
positive outcomes for all our stakeholders 
– customers, staff and shareholders 
alike. We encourage the personal 
learning, growth and development of our 
team and voluntarily try to eliminate 
practices that harm the environment.
