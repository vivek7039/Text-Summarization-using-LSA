Hurricane’s  
expertise lies in 
identifying and 
appraising fractured 
basement reservoirs.
Our Business Model
•  Prioritise health, safety  
and the environment  
at all times
•  Do things the right way,  
never compromising  
safety or quality and 
implementing measures to 
protect the environment
• Technically driven
•  Explore, develop and produce 
our Rona Ridge assets
•  Lancaster EPS provides 
reservoir knowledge to 
materially derisk the 
producibility of our Rona 
Ridge assets
•  Focus on minimising 
finding and development 
costs to progress assets to 
a stage where significant 
uncertainties are removed
•  Accept that maintaining  
higher licence interests than 
typical for more common 
reservoir types may be 
optimal for basement assets
•  Limited number of 
appropriately incentivised  
Tier 1 contractors,  
to minimise operating  
costs without  
compromising delivery
•  Engage with the regulator 
to ensure licence to operate 
never becomes a bottleneck

Governance
Overview
Hurricane’s strategy is to create shareholder value 
through monetising the significant reserves and 
resources associated with the naturally fractured 
basement reservoirs within its portfolio through 
exploration, appraisal and development.
Lancaster EPS – the key to delivering our strategy
Overview
• 2-well tieback to FPSO
•  First step in a phased  
development of Lancaster to  
de-risk Rona Ridge assets
• First oil targeted for H1 2019
Purpose
•  Provide data to refine reserve/ 
resource estimates
•  Commence development in  
a phased manner
•  Generate cash flow and an  
acceptable return 
Progress in 2017
•  Completion of FEED
•  Signing of project contracts
• Financing, FID, FDP approval
•  Start of project execution 
Explore / Appraise Develop Produce Priorities
Strategic Goals
•  Explore and appraise fractured basement assets  
within Hurricane’s Rona Ridge portfolio
•   Progress assets to a stage where value  
is expected to be maximised 
• Extended production intended to  
generate sufficient data to allow  
for planning of the next phase of  
development
