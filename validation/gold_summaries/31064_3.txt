 Our Business 
The Group has performed well against our strategic milestones for 
the year. The acquisition of CellRight Technologies is a transformative 
opportunity for the Group, combining two innovative, regenerative 
platforms with large addressable markets and synergistic growth 
opportunities. With the appointment of Steve Couldwell as CEO, 
the Board is confident that it has the leadership in place to take 
the Company to the next stage and a comprehensive review of the 
development pipeline is ongoing. With our augmented, established 
product portfolio generating a growing level of sales, we have 
identified key development assets to focus our commercial resources 
behind, and we are confident that following final product validation 
and transfer of manufacturing in-house, the newly focused strategy 
will drive significant shareholder returns. 
Financial Performance 
Overall Group performance 
The Group delivered revenues of £5,233K in the 12 months to 
31 December 2017, a 263% increase when compared to the 
11 month period to December 2016. 
Organic DermaPure
®
 sales grew 46% in the US to £1,932K, and 
the commercial traction of the European controlled joint venture 
continued with increased revenues to £1,135K. 
Following the equity fundraising undertaken in August 2017, the 
Group has a robust cash position to fund the near term future of the 
enlarged Group and we maintain our expectation that the Group will 
be cash break-even during 2020. 
Leadership 
In November 2017, we announced the appointment of Steve 
Couldwell as CEO of the Group. Steve succeeds Antony Odell who 
stepped down in October 2017 after nine years leading the Group. 
We would like to thank Antony for his leadership during the Group’s 
early years.
Steve has experience spanning over 25 years in the Medical 
Device space and a proven track record of delivering revenue and 
profit growth. He has had an extensive career including Smith & 
Nephew and more recently, Sanofi BioSurgery based in Boston, 
Massachusetts. Having held senior commercial positions in both 
the US and Europe, Steve has the necessary skill set to drive the 
next stages of the Group’s commercial strategy required to deliver 
shareholder returns. 
Following the resignation of Paul Devlin on 30 November, we  
have appointed an  interim CFO and initiated a search for a 
permanent candidate. 
Our People 
The Board and I would like to extend our thanks to our employees 
and partners, especially throughout this year of significant change. 
With the integration of CellRight Technologies, we welcomed a new 
team in the US, led by CEO Jesus Hernandez, and the addition of 
their experience and the ongoing commitment of all our employees 
remain fundamental to our success.
