STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
Financial performance 
The 2017 financial year delivered profitable growth, with passenger numbers increasing by 18.9 per cent. year-
on-year to 23.8 million. The trading environment experienced in FY 2017 of very low fares and increasing fuel 
prices unquestionably favoured our ultra-low-cost business model and we were able to increase our growth 
rate, strengthen our number one position in CEE and also maintain one of the highest profit margins of any 
European carrier.  Our market leading position, with the combination of one of the highest growth rates and 
profit margins of all European airlines, makes Wizz Air one of the most exciting airline businesses in Europe. 
Operating the most efficient aircraft with the latest technology has always been a key foundation stone of 
Wizz Air’s ultra-low cost base. Our fleet currently has an average age of just 4.4 years, one of the youngest in 
Europe.  We continue to build on that foundation with a delivery stream of brand new A321ceo aircraft which 
deliver double digit cost savings compared to A320ceo aircraft. At the end of FY 2017 we operated 16 A321ceo 
aircraft, representing a quarter of the airline's seat capacity, which gives us a clear cost advantage compared 
to most of our rivals.  
The resilience of our ultra-low cost business model, which we are convinced is the best model for stimulating 
air travel in CEE, combined with our growing diversified network and our ever stronger balance sheet places 
Wizz Air in a unique position to exploit the significant market opportunity that exists in a market of over 300 
million people.  
Our strong performance was driven by capacity expansion, higher load factors, higher passenger growth and 
continued improvements to our industry-leading ultra-low-cost base. In numbers, we delivered: 
 ticket revenues that increased by 2.3 per cent. to €915.5 million; 
 ancillary revenue that increased by 22.7 per cent. to €655.7 million; 
 total airline unit cost that decreased by 7.8 per cent. to €3.15 cents per Available Seat Kilometre (ASK); 
 a 19.7 per cent. increase in the capacity offered to the market (as measured by ASKs), as we extended and 
deepened our network of routes to and from Central and Eastern Europe; and 
 an increase in our average load factor by 1.9 percentage points to 90.1 per cent. in the financial year, 
despite significant capacity expansion. 
Strategic progress 
The Company is convinced that its strategy of building on its strong network, highly efficient model, 
compelling customer proposition, solid finances and sound risk management policies will enable it to deliver 
sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders. 
Wizz Air’s management team enforces rigorous cost control in all aspects of the Group’s business and has 
created a company-wide business culture that is keenly focused on driving costs lower. The Company believes 
that this cost advantage protects Wizz Air’s market position, enables it to offer some of the lowest ticket prices 
in its markets, stimulates demand in its markets and supports continued profitable growth.  
With its ultra-low-cost structure, innovative unbundled pricing strategy, leading market position among low-
cost carriers in CEE and track record of expansion in CEE and beyond, the Company believes that it is well 
positioned to continue to grow profitably. Wizz Air’s infrastructure, including personnel, processes, systems 
and relationships with suppliers of outsourced services, is scalable and sufficiently flexible to support Wizz 
Air’s growth plans.  
The Company believes that Wizz Air is a “pioneering” airline in the markets in which it operates by seeking to 
bring the low-cost carrier concept and Western European aviation standards into currently under-served new 
Eastern markets and is at the forefront of airline innovation in these new markets. Wizz Air has a strong track 
record of working with regulators to develop appropriate regulatory structures in non-EU countries. Wizz Air 
has been able to leverage the know-how, market understanding and cultural awareness of its senior 
management team and employees to build strong relationships with airport operators, suppliers, governments 
and regulators in new markets and is able to present itself as a reliable partner that, to date, has never exited 
from a country where it has established an operating base.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED 
Strengthened leadership in CEE 
Wizz Air continues to be the clear market leader in Central and Eastern Europe, maintaining our market share 
of over 39 per cent. of low-cost airline traffic. The expansion of our network with 113 new routes launched in 
FY 2017 has allowed us to strengthen our position, reaching new customers throughout the region. 
Today we operate in 19 of the 21 CEE countries, serving the market by offering a network of 28 bases and 141 
destinations in 42 countries. With a low propensity to travel and low-cost market penetration currently at 40.4 
per cent. (source data: Innovata, April 2016 – March 2017), there remains a significant opportunity for Wizz Air 
and we continue to believe that the ultra-low-cost business model is best placed to serve this market. 
Wherever we operate, Wizz Air brings safe, reliable operations, low fares, hassle-free services and a distinctive 
brand designed to appeal to the whole market. 
As a result, Wizz Air’s aggregate market share in CEE was 39.1 per cent. in the 2017 financial year and we are 
the number one or number two low-cost airline in all but one of our CEE base countries. The table below shows 
the Company’s ranking by low-cost market share in each of its CEE base countries.

Strengthened leadership in CEE continued 
The Company offers services from 19 CEE countries including the 14 CEE countries where it has base aircraft

Fleet development securing long-term growth  
During the 2017 financial year, we continued to invest significantly in our fleet by adding twelve A321ceo aircraft, taking 
our fleet to 79 aircraft at the end of March 2017. Deliveries of the A321ceo commenced in November 2015 and in just 
18 months we are already operating 16 of the type representing 24.5 per cent. of the Company’s total seat capacity.  
We are excited about the cost savings we are seeing from the A321ceo aircraft, and the continued roll-out of these 
aircraft across our network is expected to further improve our cost base and competitive edge. 
The composition of our fleet at the end of the 2017 financial year and currently anticipated at the end of the 
next two financial years is as follows: 
  March 2017 March 2018 March 2019 
  Actual Planned Planned 
A320ceo without winglets (180 seats) 35 35 28 
A320ceo with winglets (180 seats) 28 28 28 
A320ceo with winglets (186 seats) - 3 9 
A321ceo with winglets (230 seats) 16 25 31 
A321neo with winglets (239 seats) - - 3 
Fleet size 79 91 99 
Share of fleet with winglets  55.7% 61.5% 71.7% 
Average number of seats per aircraft 190 194 198 
A321neo 
In FY 2016 the Company concluded a purchase agreement with Airbus for 110 firm-order A321neo aircraft and 
purchase rights for a further 90 of the type. During the 2017 financial year the Company selected and contracted Pratt 
& Whitney’s new technology geared turbofan engines to power these aircraft. 
We anticipate that, based on the estimates of both Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, the A321neo will deliver significantly 
better fuel burn efficiency and even lower unit costs compared to the ceo version, making it the perfect aircraft to 
underpin the Company’s ambitious growth plans and replace older aircraft as they are returned to lessors.  Our first 
A321neo is scheduled to be delivered in 2019 and deliveries will continue until the end of 2024. The purchase 
agreement includes uncommitted purchase rights for 90 additional A321neo aircraft as well as certain conversion 
rights to receive the smaller A320neo, providing the flexibility needed to match aircraft deliveries with the 
Company’s capacity needs. 
Based on our current order book with Airbus, and lessor return schedule, our fleet will nearly double in size 
from the end of FY 2017 to the end of FY 2024. 
Improving the customer experience 
New routes and base operations 
We launched 113 new routes during the 2017 financial year, taking our route network to 486 routes from 28 
bases, connecting 141 destinations in 42 countries at the end of March 2017.    
Our markets are also reacting very well to the emergence of air travel within CEE with the Company launching 
13 new routes connecting CEE countries in FY 2017.  This trend is continuing into FY 2018 with the Company 
commencing operations on five previously unserved Western Balkan routes between Budapest and Kosovo, 
Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania.  In addition to connecting CEE countries we 
are also experiencing significant demand on the two domestic routes launched in Romania and Bulgaria.

Improving the customer experience continued 
Offering our customers more 
We know that our customers welcome the opportunity to fly at Wizz Air’s lowest prices yet experience the 
great on-board service provided by our dedicated crew. We also know that many of our customers also 
welcome the opportunity to tailor their travel experience to their requirements by adding additional services.  
We took a look at what our customers are buying and decided to make it easier and cheaper for them to buy 
some of the most popular additional services together, with the "WIZZ Go" bundle, which offers a discount 
over the “Basic Fare” and the prices of the included additional services when bought separately. 
Many of our customers are loyal Wizz Air fans who fly with us on multiple occasions each year.  Our Wizz 
Discount Club enables our most loyal customers and their friends and families to benefit from even lower fares 
than normal, throughout the year.  No wonder it’s popular: membership of the Wizz Discount Club reached 
1.05 million members by the end of the 2017 financial year, representing a 29 per cent. growth compared to 
the 2016 financial year. 
Our customers have always enjoyed the convenience of being able to book accommodation and car hire, 
along with other travel services, with our partners through wizzair.com. But, demonstrating our commitment 
always to give our customers more, for less, we launched our own inclusive package tour operator Wizz Tours, 
in 2015. The opportunity to book flights and accommodation at the same time, in a single package and at a 
discounted price, is proving increasingly popular – Wizz Tours’ revenues increased fourfold to €18.1 million in 
the 2017 financial year.  
None of this means that we’ve taken any less interest in ancillary revenue, though, which continues to be a 
very important part of the Company’s business model. For the financial year ended 31 March 2017, total 
ancillary revenues represented 41.8 per cent of overall airline revenue, up from 37.4 percent in the previous 
financial year. 
Technology advancements 
In FY 2017 Wizz Air launched the new wizzair.com website across all platforms through a mobile-first phased 
roll-out in May and August. The new responsive design caters for the needs of Wizz Air's young and mobile savvy 
audience, through a clean and fast one-page booking process. The introduction of our unique three-click express 
booking functionality enables an even faster booking experience. Throughout the year hundreds of major and 
minor digital optimizations contributed to a record high conversion rate on ticket and ancillary sales.  
With a website now available in 24 languages and 11 on the app, Wizz Air served over 200 million sessions to 
more than 50 million users. Wizz Air is the eighth most visited airline website in the world with one of the 
highest (56%) share of mobile visitors. Our mobile app user base more than doubled to 3.7 million users in FY 
2017. With 1.8 million followers on Facebook, Wizz Air has by far most fans per available seat among its peers 
in Europe. New digital initiatives in the next financial year will further strengthen the engagement with our ever 
more connected customers. 
Balanced hedging approach  
Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies approved by the Board and supervised by the 
Audit Committee. The aim of our hedging policy is to reduce short-term volatility in earnings and liquidity. 
Therefore Wizz Air hedges a minimum of 50 per cent of the projected US Dollar and jet fuel requirements 
for the next twelve months (40 per cent on an 18-month hedge horizon). Recently, the Company started 
to hedge it largest non-EUR revenue currency, GBP against EUR in order to smooth out potential future 
volatility due to Brexit.  Unlike for the US Dollar, there is no minimum coverage set, while the maximum is 
60% of projected net GBP exposure on rolling twelve-month basis. 
Details of the current hedging positions (as at 15 May 2017) are set out below:  
Foreign exchange (FX) hedge coverage of Euro/US Dollar 
   F18   F19  
Period covered  11 months   7 months

Sensitivities 
 Pre-hedging, a one cent movement in the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate impacts the 2018 financial year 
operating expenses by €6.9 million. 
 Pre-hedging, a one penny movement in the Euro/British Pound exchange rate impacts the 2018 financial 
year operating expenses by €2.3 million. 
 Pre-hedging, a $10 (per metric ton) movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2018 financial year fuel 
costs by $8.3 million. 
In the Company’s view, the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical evidence 
of major industry-wide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of twelve 
to eighteen months.  
Management changes 
There were a number of management changes throughout the year. 
John Stephenson, the Group’s Executive Vice President and Gyorgy Abran, Chief Commercial Officer stepped 
down from their positions in August 2016. I would like to take this opportunity to thank John and Gyorgy for 
their significant contribution they have made to the Company over the last 10-12 years, respectively. They 
played a central role in building Wizz Air into the leading low cost carrier in CEE and one of the strongest 
airlines in Europe. We wish them all the best in the future.  
As announced earlier in the year Sonia Jerez Burdeus stepped down from her position of Chief Financial Officer 
in order to relocate back to Spain. I would like to thank her once again for her contribution during the time 
that she was with us. We are making good progress in recruiting her replacement and will make a further 
announcement in due course. 
During the 2017 financial year George Michalopoulos, Chief Commercial Officer and Jozsef Ujhelyi, Chief Flight 
Operations Officer, were promoted to their current roles and Diederik Pen was promoted to become Executive 
Vice President & Chief Operations Officer, reflecting the importance of the Operations function to the success 
of Wizz Air. I would like to congratulate each of them on their appointments and wish them well as their careers 
continue to develop at Wizz Air. Between them, Diederik, George and Jozsef have collectively been with Wizz 
Air for over 25 years, which demonstrates the continuity and depth of experience within the Wizz Air 
management team, something which the Company is fortunate to be able to call upon as it continues its fast 
growth in the coming years.

Outlook 
2018 financial year 
In FY2018 growth continues as a top priority with increase in capacity by around 23% targeting to carry nearly 
30 million passengers. The Company recorded a strong start to FY2018 due to the timing of Easter, and 
although still at an early stage of the financial year, currently the Group net profit is expected to be in a range 
between €250 million and €270 million in FY2018.  This guidance is heavily caveated by the revenue 
performance for the all-important summer period as well as the second half of FY2018, a period for which the 
Company currently have limited visibility.
