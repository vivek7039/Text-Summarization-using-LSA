 At a glance
Nexus Infrastructure currently comprises two 
separately managed and operated businesses; 
Tamdown and TriConnex.
Our businesses
Tamdown provides a range of specialised 
infrastructure and engineering services to  
the UK housebuilding sectors.
Services include earthworks, 
building highways, substructures 
and basements, creating 
drainage systems, as well as 
constructing reinforced concrete 
frames. The business has a  
well-established market position 
having been in operation for 
over 40 years and works with 
nine of the top ten largest UK 
housebuilders. Tamdown’s 
operations are focused on the 
South East of England and London.
TriConnex designs, installs and connects gas, electricity 
and water networks and, more recently, fibre, on new 
residential and commercial developments. 
TriConnex was established in 2011 
to take advantage of deregulation 
in the utilities market, with the 
goal of being recognised as the 
UK’s leading independent provider 
of utility connections to new 
developments. TriConnex’s current 
areas of operation include the 
South East, South Midlands and 
South West of England. 
Our clients
The Group has a very strong base of  
blue-chip customers which includes all  
of the top ten largest housebuilders in  
the UK. In addition, the Group’s diverse 
customer base includes affordable  
housing providers and many of the  
top 25 housebuilders.
