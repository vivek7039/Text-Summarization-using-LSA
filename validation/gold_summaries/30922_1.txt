 Stabilisation involved embedding changes set in motion since 2016. 
Some of this change enabled the re-allocation of 
resource to the front-end of the business.  
Turning around Poland was 2017’s top priority, 
through a combination of aligned pricing, 
a restructured sales team and driving efficiencies 
across the entire organisation. We invested in 
Poland, and we are seeing positive results.
2017 was a year of stabilisation 
and turnaround, producing 
encouraging tangible results

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Group financial performance
Evidence of stabilisation and turnaround is in 
the results: growth in volume, share, revenues, 
profitability and cashflow. The balance sheet 
strengthened further, as net debt was reduced,  
and financing facilities were extended.
Turnaround in Poland
Our first focus was embedding the changes 
initiated in 2016, chiefly under the “Root & 
Branch review”. This included strengthening 
and optimising our entire business to better 
compete in an intensely competitive market. 
To keep competitive, we had to further engage 
in the pricing re-alignment that the market has 
experienced since 2014, as our primary competitor 
continued an aggressive pricing strategy. Working 
with customers, we adjusted pricing architecture 
on selected products to stay competitive in on-
shelf pricing. This, along with better execution in 
the trade, is the major driver of 2017’s results. 
We continued to grow share in volume and value 
since December 2016, while monitoring the 
clearly divergent strategies, not to mention mixed 
fortunes, of our two main competitors.
Whilst these results are encouraging, we remain 
vigilant and the market, though stable, has yet to  
see upward pricing, as the market leader remains 
highly competitive. 
The economy supported growth, with rising average 
incomes. Though the Government will restrict 
Sunday trading in 2018, we expect limited impact. 
The vodka market continues to grow, and it 
remains, by far, the largest spirits category. Clear 
vodka is the main variant. Despite the aggressive 
pricing in economy and mainstream segments, 
consumers are up-trading to more premium and 
prestige brands, reflecting growing affluence. 
We benefit from this, given our brands’ strong 
positions in premium price segments. Flavoured 
vodka has traditionally seen less premiumisation 
and so represents an opportunity, particularly as it 
grows ahead of the overall vodka category.
The traditional trade remains the key vodka trade 
channel, and one competitor’s effective withdrawal 
from direct involvement in this prominent channel 
presents another opportunity for us.
In terms of our brands, our priority was 
distribution-build and consumer-activation over 
new product development (NPD). Our NPD 
focused on Saska flavour extensions and re-
launching Stock 84 brandy. 
Our biggest brand, Żołᶏdkowa de Luxe, returned 
to growth in sales, out-performing both the overall 
and clear vodka categories. Most of the growth 
came from the traditional trade. Żołᶏdkowa 
Gorzka responded well to activation programmes 
directed at younger adult drinkers. We continue 
to strengthen Stock Prestige, for example with the 
exclusive limited edition Stock Prestige Carbon. 
Above it, in top premium, Amundsen Expedition 
continues to grow. We achieved more effective 
price execution on our economy brands Żubr and 
1906, as well as introducing a 9cl variant. In the 
flavoured vodka sub-category, impressive growth 
from the more premium Stock Prestige flavours 
and Saska could not raise our share given slower 
growth on Żołᶏdkowa Gorzka and the decline in  
Lubelska sales. 
Our distribution arrangement with Beluga Group, 
now in its second year, saw the brand Beluga out-
perform the ultra-premium segment.

with prizes for the Lubelska range, Lubelska 
Cytrynówka, Żołᶏdkowa Gorzka, Żołᶏdkowa de 
Luxe and Żołᶏdkowa de Luxe Peppercorn.
Whisky, though a much smaller category, 
experienced strong growth and its profit pool 
now exceeds flavoured vodka. The Beam-Suntory 
whisky brands, especially Jim Beam, rapidly grew 
share in the sub-category and beat Jack Daniels 
to number four position by volume. We see 
great interest in Irish whiskey and we will exploit 
opportunities through distribution of The Dubliner 
and The Dublin Liberties brands. 
Following the significant changes in 2016, 
our Polish organisation benefitted from stable 
management through the year. We continued to 
up-skill our salesforce, improving sales execution 
capabilities. We strengthened our modern trade 
sales team to work more closely with customers 
and step up intensity and quality of promotions. 
Progress in the Czech Republic
Our Czech business delivered another set of 
robust results, extending leadership in the 
overall market. The spirits category continues 
to grow in volume and value, supported by the 
economy performing well, with earnings rising. 
This delivered growth, especially in the premium 
off-trade. The on-trade was impacted by increased 
smoking restrictions.
We see aggressive pricing across some sub-
categories, and monitor positions closely and 
take actions as necessary, for example where 
we strengthened category-management in the 
modern trade.
Božkov returned to growth – strengthened by focus 
and investment, including new Božkov Tradicni 
and Božkov Bily variants providing incremental 
share. The brand won the “Most Trusted Spirits 
Brand” award for the second successive year. It also 
delivered better profitability and share growth.
The Pražská, Nordic Ice and Dynybyl brands 
acquired in 2016, and integrated ahead of plan, 
significantly contributed to our growth in the vodka 
category, as well as our Czech results overall.
The Black Fox launch was a strategic entry 
with a new brand into the premium herbal 
bitters category at a time of intensifying price-
competition. The launch highlights increased use 
of digital marketing in our campaigns.
Our important relationship with Diageo delivered 
well for both partners, and is being extended 
into 2019, with our leading distribution helping 
Diageo to be the 2nd fastest growing spirits 
company in the market. Building on this successful 
relationship, we gained approval to distribute 
Beam-Suntory products and to explore synergies 
that exist between these two complementary 
portfolios. With the Diageo, Beam-Suntory and 
Quintessential Brands Irish Whiskey portfolios 
leveraging our Czech distribution, we will have the 
strongest range of third party brands covering all 
segments of the growing whisky category.
The impact from a possible EU ban on certain 
ingredients in rum ether is being managed, and we 
anticipate limited impact, given our plans in hand.
Challenges in Italy
The Italian market continues to be challenging 
and high young-adult unemployment continues 
to impact our brands, primarily Keglevich, but we 
detect some optimism recently. The overall spirits 
category grew slightly, mainly through limoncello, 
gin and aperitifs, with pricing offsetting flat 
volumes overall.
We launched Syramusa, an ultra-premium  
Limoncé extension to consolidate our leadership  
in limoncello. The iconic Stock 84 brandy was  
re-launched with overt on-trade focus. The premium 
XO variant performs well, enabling us to remain in 
2nd place in the brandy category.
As a result of the challenging environment, the 
Italian business’ value suffered impairment (further 
details are provided by Paul in the Financial 
Review), a risk we had highlighted at the half year. 
Chief Executive’s statement continued
29
Strategic Review Governance Financial Statements Whilst Keglevich retains leadership in clear vodka 
and it extended its leadship in flavoured vodka, this 
sub-category is declining. In late 2017 we brought 
to market our re-vamped Keglevich fruit variants, 
to better fit the changing preferences of the young 
adult consumers. This was the initial step of a multi-
year program to strengthen the Keglevich brand.
Nuove Distillerie Vicenze, a liqueur business,  
was added as a distribution partner in November, 
as was Nordés Gin. The organisation was further 
restructured, investing more in the salesforce, 
especially in the on-trade. Though we made 
encouraging progress in the modern trade, our 
insufficient scale hampers results.
Strong results in Slovakia
This business delivered to expectation, with 
solid performance by the Golden Ice range 
strengthening our position in the premium fruit 
spirits sub-category.
To penetrate the premium profit pool further,  
we signed a distribution agreement with  
Beam-Suntory here also. Combining our distribution 
capability and Beam-Suntory’s strong investment in 
Jim Beam, we delivered pleasing results. 
With the Jim Beam, Distell and Quintessential 
Brands Irish Whiskey portfolios under our 
distribution, we now have a range of brands 
covering the rapidly growing whisky category.
Our relationship with Beluga continued to deliver 
growth in the ultra-premium vodka sub-category. 
Other markets
There was good performance in Croatia. Our focus 
is in the on-trade and distribution was extended 
beyond the Beam-Suntory relationship to include 
Beluga Group, Bortran rum and Bols.
Stock 84 brandy became the biggest spirits brand 
in Bosnia. It benefitted from the re-vamp, seeing 
growing appeal amongst young adult drinkers, 
especially in the on-trade. Bosnia also benefitted 
from a new Beluga distribution agreement. 
Innovations
The Group's NPD process was strengthened 
during the year in order to help extend our reach in 
premium and higher price segments. The improved 
process aims to reduce the number of new launches 
whilst increasing their impact and speed to market, 
thus providing a better return from investment.
Operations and supply chain
We continue to develop our excellent supply chain 
to further leverage our core competitive strengths of 
productivity, smart cost management and technical 
talent. This delivered further efficiencies and 
effectiveness and contributed to our overall success. 
We invested across people, facilities, processes 
and systems. We are now well-invested, and future 
investment focuses on safety and quality. 
Sales and operations planning development was a 
major enabler of improved performance, integrating 
all disciplines and markets to drive us forward. Our 
operations team won awards in Poland: 
• BRC Food and IFS Food Certification (the first 
spirits producer to gain both accreditations), and 
• ‘Employer – Organiser of Safe Work’ (from PIP, 
the State Labour Inspectorate).
During the year we suffered an equipment failure 
in our Baltic distillery. Though spirits production 
was interrupted for a brief period, our businesses 
were able to operate as normal. The distillery has 
since returned to normal operations.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017  Technology
We continue to invest in technology, leveraging 
prior investments made under the “One Network” 
strategy. Our cyber security kept the business 
safe, and we stay focused on security. 
We completed the first phase implementation 
of a software-defined Wide Area Network 
(WAN) which has improved service levels. The 
second phase will deliver a “Tier 3” datacentre to 
house critical technology. As we extend digital 
capabilities across our business, we will have a 
technology base and capability underpinning this.
The group-wide Intranet, StockNet, was launched 
to provide a collaborative platform to quickly 
share and deliver further digitalisation. A unified 
communications suite delivers continued savings in 
travel, whilst enabling more engagement through 
virtual meetings. Progress to a single group-wide 
SAP platform continues.
Our people
StockNet is an effective and exciting mechanism 
engaging and energising us into a more aligned 
workforce. Through this we leverage the full 
power of our people wherever they are. StockNet 
was used to conduct our first ever Employee 
Engagement Survey. We welcomed high 
participation and are studying the feedback. 
Our partners
The Group's partnership with Beam-Suntory 
was extended beyond Poland into the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia and we have mentioned 
our continuing partnership with Diageo. There 
is a new agreement in place with Beluga Group 
to distribute the ultra-premium vodka Beluga in 
Croatia and Bosnia. We also changed our route to 
market in the UK and moved distribution of our 
brands to Distell International. 
Following investment in Quintessential Brands’ 
Irish whiskey business, we have secured the 
right, from the owners of our existing whiskey 
agency brands, to distribute the brands from the 
investment where the brand range will enrich our 
portfolios around the Group.
Our strategy
With the turnaround of our Polish business 
underway, we carried out a comprehensive 
review of the Group's strategy during the latter 
half of the year. We concluded that the strategy 
communicated at the time of the IPO remained 
valid, but that developments in our key markets 
since then mean that there is a greater need than 
ever before to focus on our brands in order to keep 
pace with the changing needs and tastes of our 
end consumers. Our focus now is therefore on four 
pillars of growth: Premiumisation, Millennials, Digital 
and M&A. These are supported by a foundation 
of engaged and empowered talent, effective 
processes, smart resource allocation and world 
class partners bringing complementary strengths. 
Further detail is set out on pages 16 and 17.
M&A
To penetrate faster growing profit pools, a 25% stake 
was taken in Quintessential Brands Ireland Whiskey 
Limited, producer of “The Dubliner” and “The Dublin 
Liberties” whiskies. The former was the world’s 
fastest growing Irish whiskey in 2016. Quintessential 
is the second biggest spirits supplier in the UK and 
has global reach, selling in over 30 countries. We 
expect our investment to be earnings accretive 
by 2021, as their new Dublin distillery becomes 
operational in 2018. 
Outlook 
With a strengthened team and a more resilient 
Polish business, combined with a strong balance 
sheet and cashflow generation, we are 
well placed to exploit opportunities 
to expand our business.
