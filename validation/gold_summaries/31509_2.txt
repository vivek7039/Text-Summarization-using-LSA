Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic progress
2017 has been another year of strong performance as 
we continued on our journey to transform Greggs into  
a winning brand in the food-on-the-go market. We’ve 
been busy developing our great product offer to meet 
customer needs, opening more shops in new locations 
while refurbishing our existing estate and investing in 
improved customer service.
We made significant progress in the fourth year of  
our major process and systems investment programme.  
We have made a good start with our £100 million supply 
chain investment programme to increase logistics 
capacity, consolidate our manufacturing operations into 
centres of excellence to improve product quality and 
support shop growth, allowing us to compete more 
effectively in the food-on-the-go market. The result has 
been a fourth consecutive year of strong like-for-like 
sales growth and record profits.
