Strategic Review
Focused  
on executing  
the Group’s  
new strategy
After a difficult start to 2017 , I am pleased with how the business 
responded in the second half of the year. Having joined the Group 
in June, I instigated a thorough strategic review process, the results 
of which have given us clear direction and an ambition to restore 
the business to historic levels of performance. I look forward to 
building upon this as we look ahead to 2018 and beyond.

My initial perceptions reaffirmed
We presented our findings of the Strategic 
Review on 7 December 2017. The review 
not only highlighted areas of focus, but 
also reaffirmed my initial perceptions. 
We have a strong brand having served 
our customers for 60 years and our NPS 
score is above market average. Within our 
chosen markets we are joint number 2 in 
the UK tool and equipment rental market 
by revenue, we have good national 
coverage and we operate primarily in the 
highly attractive ‘repair, maintain and 
operate’ segment of the market. The 
2,900 employees across the Group are 
committed and knowledgeable, and  
were named winners of the UK customer 
experience award in 2016. Our business 
model is innovative and forward thinking, 
with multi-channel digital technology, and 
a healthy network of branches which allow 
for high levels of utilisation of our stock 
across the Group.

Our new strategy
Upon completion of the review, we 
identified three key strategic priorities: 
Delever the Group, Repair the Tool Hire 
business and Strengthen the Group’s 
commercial proposition. 
Overview of my first year 
I was honoured to be asked to lead 
HSS Hire. It is a business with a strong 
brand and leading positions in its chosen 
markets across the UK and Ireland. 
Having worked in the industry for many 
years, I have always admired HSS, 
so when the opportunity arose to lead 
this fantastic organisation, it was an 
opportunity not to be missed.
I arrived at a challenging time for the 
Group, and it was evident that a lot of work 
needed to be done. In some areas within 
the business we were experiencing 
reduced margins, the new distribution 
network had led to lower rental revenue 
growth and there was a loss of focus on 
our Tool Hire business. Repairing each of 
these areas will take time and we must 
continue to remain focused on the task in 
hand, as we implement changes across 
the Group and our business evolves. 
Notwithstanding these challenges, I 
continue to strongly believe that there 
remains huge potential at HSS. Over the 
past few months I have spent a lot of time 
with different parts of the business, and 
have been incredibly impressed by the 
motivation, achievements and commitment 
of HSS people across our Group.
Our wide ranging strategic review
During the year, we engaged an 
independent third party to work with the 
HSS management team to undertake the 
most extensive Strategic Review of the 
business to date. The review was wide 
ranging in scope and involved the analysis 
of 20 million contract lines, more than 
Delever
During 2017 we took a number of cost 
reduction actions which resulted in us 
delivering annualised savings of £13m 
compared with the Q1 FY17 runrate. This 
was achieved through working with our 
suppliers to reduce costs, reducing our 
central headcount, closing 55 branches, 
and network efficiencies. 
The Strategic Review announced in 
December 2017 outlined initiatives to 
reduce costs by a further £10m-£14m 
on an annualised basis, including up to 
£10m related to changes in the supply 
chain model. We were therefore pleased 
to announce in February 2018 that 
agreement had been finalised to make 
these changes enabling c.£11m of cost 
benefit, £1m higher than the amounts 
originally communicated. The changes are 
expected to give rise to a net cash outflow 
of approximately £3m in 2018 followed by 
net cash savings of approximately £8m 
annually over the following seven years.
Last but not least, we will drive further 
efficiencies across the business through 
eliminating duplication in some areas and 
simplifying our processes. This should 
generate savings of between £3m-£4m. 
Full implementation of each of these cost 
saving initiatives will take time and is not 
going to happen overnight; however, we 
have a clear plan in place and are focused 
on executing these changes in order to 
reduce the leverage of our business.

Chief Executive Officer’s Strategic Review 
continued
Repair
Three key areas to repair the Tool Hire 
business were identified: customer, 
product and branch. 
Customer
Taking customer first, we have identified 
several areas where we can work with 
our customers to look at ways in which 
we can improve the customer experience 
that we are able to offer them. We want 
to improve our utilisation rates and ensure 
that we are always in a position to fulfil 
the needs and requirements of each and 
every one of our customers. 
Product
On occasions, highly valuable 
products have been commodity-priced 
with certain customers. There has 
also been inconsistent pricing within 
product categories and we have seen 
circumstances where the stock profile 
does not match the profit opportunity.  
A lot of work has been done to introduce 
smart pricing to reflect asset utilisation 
and service, and we are looking at 
improving discount effectiveness and 
rationalising ranges, as well as ensuring 
that we optimise our fleet size. 
Branch
We closed a number of branches over 
the last year or so, and now feel that 
our network is of a size which is flexible 
and that we are comfortable with. It is  
a network which can be adapted and 
modified accordingly as we remain ever 
vigilant to market conditions. However, 
when we look at the branches, there is a 
variety of differing performance across the 
business which needs to be resolved. We 
are therefore looking at a number of areas 
where we can improve, to ensure that all 
our branches are contributing as efficiently 
and effectively as they possibly can. 
Strengthen
The third and final strategic priority is to 
strengthen the Group’s commercial 
proposition. The actions being taken 
here are around customer segmentation, 
geographic focus and sales channel 
development. Taking customer 
segmentation first, customers have different 
needs and therefore we have to respond in 
different ways. We have to ensure that the 
products we can offer are relevant for those 
customer segments. For geographic focus, 
we know the areas where driving initiatives 
will be much more advantageous for us. 
Our target areas have been identified, and 
we have begun working through these and 
will continue to do so over the medium to 
long term. Further progress has also been 
made on developing our sales channels, 
with investment having been made to 
improve our digital capabilities. This will 
help to enhance and improve the 
proposition and customer experience 
that we are able to offer.
Our market
The size of our addressable market for 
tool hire, powered access and power 
generation hire in the UK is in the region 
of £1.9bn. The market has grown by 1-2% 
CAGR since 2013 and is expected to grow 
at a similar rate over the next three years
1
. 
The market is highly fragmented with the 
vast majority of registered hire companies 
employing fewer than 50 staff and serving 
their local geography often from one, 
and usually from fewer than ten locations. 
The Group is one of a small number of 
‘nationals’. We are placed second or third 
in each of our three primary markets with 
between 9-14% market share.
The Group has a large and diverse 
customer base and operates across a 
diverse set of end markets. This provides 
us with some protection against cyclical 
trends that are evident in some sectors, 
such as construction. Our main customer 
groups are in the facilities management, 
retail operations, commercial fit-out, 
property, utilities and waste, infrastructure 
and energy supply services sectors. 
We also work with charities, government 
entities, house builders and 
construction contractors.
The European Rental Association notes that 
the ‘UK market is relatively concentrated’ 
but this is in contrast to the fragmented and 
less mature markets of continental Europe. 
It estimates that the larger rental players with 
between 50 and 250 employees are 50% 
of the UK market. In our view there is room 
for further market consolidation to create 
scale rental players able to deliver further 
efficiency benefits for customers, and 
enhanced returns to shareholders.
Management team
The executive team in place at HSS is 
relatively new in terms of tenure, with 
Paul Quested, Chief Financial Officer, 
being the longest-serving executive 
having joined the business in August 
2016. Notwithstanding this limited time 
within the executive team, I have been very 
encouraged since joining the business in 
June, by the dedication and commitment 
of the management team, and the strength 
and depth of the experience which 
we have across the Group. I am very 
confident that with their support, we 
will be successful in delivering on our 
strategic priorities set out in December.

2018 and beyond
The Strategic Review has been a massive 
step forward for us and gives us a real 
understanding of our business. We have a 
clear map forward, with steps identified to 
deliver significant change in performance 
within HSS. The strategy has been reset, 
with three levers: Delever the Group, 
Repair the Tool Hire business and 
Strengthen the Group’s commercial 
proposition. Our immediate focus in 2018 
is to undertake a number of cost reduction 
actions which will create a leaner 
operation, but we have to get the balance 
right and get this business working 
effectively and efficiently. We must get the 
branch optimisation right, lifting levels of 
profitability not only across the network, 
but also more widely across the 
entire business. 
Over the next few years, we will be 
examining our customer segmentation; 
deploying and working with our teams in 
areas where we see the most profitable 
opportunities is key. We will also continue 
to develop our sales channels, maximising 
our digital competitive advantage to 
increase the use and mix of innovative 
low-cost channels.
