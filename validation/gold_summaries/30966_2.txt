 CAMELLIA PLC

Camellia Plc is an international group – a global family of diverse companies with a 130-year history
employing approximately 80,000 people worldwide. Our operations are in Agriculture, Engineering, Food
Service and the holding of Investments. From the outset, Camellia’s ethos has been based on the highest
moral and professional integrity, and a commitment to doing the right thing – ethically and commercially,
globally and locally. Proﬁts are our lifeblood but not our soul.
Our business is built on two fundamental principles:
■ Long-termism. We see ourselves as custodians, holding our businesses in trust for future
generations. We believe we have a responsibility to ensure the stability, security and continuity of all
our businesses, so they can be passed on to the next generation as enduring operations. We
recognise that people and businesses take time to establish and grow to their full potential and we
are happy to wait for that to happen. We are deeply committed to improving the long-term stability
and well-being of our businesses, the communities and the environments in which we operate.
■ Sustainability. We are committed not only to the ultimate welfare of our employees but also to the
communities in which they live. We believe our businesses can and should grow with respect and
care for the environment rather than at the cost of it. We proactively invest in ensuring that the
environments where we do business are continually protected and improved, and seek to minimise
any damage our activities may cause.
Our continuing business is made up as follows:
