farm-out 80% of the Group’s interest in the Bomono 
Production Sharing contract to Victoria Oil & Gas Plc

documentation remain the subject of negotiations 
owing to various stakeholder discussions.

of this farm-out arrangement has not been received 
to date.

by $46m, reflecting the impact of the VOG farm-in 
agreement on the asset valuation.

testing) and $25m at FID.
 — Completed organisational restructuring 
commensurate with our non operated portfolio 
giving rise to significant General and Administration 
(G&A) cost reductions.
Outlook
Key objectives are to continue to deliver on our revised 
strategy into FY2018 which includes: 
 — Ongoing focus maintaining the significant reduction 
in G&A costs into FY2018.
 — Ensuring our capital is rigorously guarded to 
maximise value of every dollar invested for our 
shareholders.
 — Working with our partners on Etinde development 
options and on the appraisal drilling programme 
in 2018.
 — Leveraging partner relationships in  
de-risking Bomono.
With new leadership and a fresh approach, 
we are looking forward to the value of our 
assets being recognised in the Bowleven share 
price as we continue to progress in 2018.
