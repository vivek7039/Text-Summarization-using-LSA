OVERVIEW
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
Dear Shareholder
I am very pleased to present my first 
Annual Report as Chairman, following my 
appointment in January 2018, and am 
delighted to have joined Centaur at such 
an interesting time. A great deal has been 
achieved in the past four years in transitioning 
Centaur Media into a more focused B2B 
information group. I am looking forward 
to working with the Board and supporting 
the broader management team to take 
advantage of the opportunities ahead. 
All businesses are facing challenges driven 
by the constantly evolving digital backdrop 
and the increasing competition for attention 
and performance. Centaur is successfully 
managing its own adaption to this changing 
landscape by reducing its exposure to print 
advertising and growing its higher quality 
digital recurring revenues. 
The Group has invested in building an 
outstanding portfolio of business intelligence 
products that helps its clients by providing 
valuable information, analytics and insight, 
allowing them to maximise the value of this 
through advisory services, media channels 
and events to help connect with their 
customers. 
In the relatively short period that I have  
been Chairman, my time has been spent 
learning about the business, the market 
dynamics and the opportunities ahead.  
I have been impressed by the quality and 
commitment of the team across all areas.  
I am still in the process of fully understanding 
every aspect of the Group, and this is 
my immediate focus. However, my first 
impressions are that there is clear potential 
and I am confident we can build on the 
transformation work already completed and 
take the business forward both organically 
and through further strategic acquisitions. 
Group performance 
It has been a satisfactory year in terms of 
underlying
1
 performance with our continuing 
operations reporting an adjusted operating 
profit² of £4.1m in the year against £4.2m in 
2016. This is despite the continued decline 
in advertising revenues which has been 
compensated for by our expansion into 
capability services through the acquisition  
of MarketMakers.
Including the results of the Home Interest 
Segment to the date of disposal, our 
adjusted operating profit² was £6.6m, down 
from £9.1m in 2016 with revenue remaining 
flat at £72.6m (2016: £72.5m).
Following our strategic decision to dispose 
of our last B2C segment, Home Interest, we 
recorded a £20.9m profit on disposal of this 
area of our business. This drove a reported 
total comprehensive income of £21.9m for 
the year. Fully diluted earnings per share 
were 14.3p (2016: (3.8p)). On an adjusted² 
results basis, earnings per share was 3.2p 
(2016: 4.5p). 
Cash generation has remained excellent 
over the year and I am pleased to report 
continued excellent progress so far in 2018. 
This, combined with the excess proceeds 
of the Home Interest Segment disposal, 
gives us the firepower to drive our strategic 
growth agenda.
Strategic progress
2017 was a year when the Group was able 
to take advantage of the hard work that 
began in 2014. The measurable improvement 
of the quality of the revenue mix reflects 
management’s careful reduction of exposure 
to print and advertising revenues alongside 
development of new insight-led revenue 
streams.
The strategic transactions over the past 
year have reinforced this focus and have 
created greater opportunities to offer 
complementary services to customers. 
The disposal of the B2C Home Interest 
Segment was a key milestone, creating 
a pure B2B focused group and enabling 
the acquisition of MarketMakers, a lead 
generation powerhouse. MarketMakers is 
now fully integrated and is already having 
a positive impact across the Group. Whilst 
growing its own client base it is also creating 
opportunities to cross-sell our services to our 
existing client base. 
Board changes
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank my predecessor, Ron Sandler, for his 
significant contribution to the Group over the 
years. His advice and insight were of great 
value during this important period of change 
and transformation away from a publishing 
media business to a pure play B2B business 
information group. We wish him the very best 
with his future endeavours. 
Governance
Centaur remains fully committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance 
and the Board takes very seriously its duties 
to operate with integrity, transparency 
and clear accountability. It also pays close 
attention to understanding and managing 
risk. Detail of what this means in practice is 
contained within the Governance section of 
the Annual Report.
Our people
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our employees for their commitment and 
hard work this year. Their dedication remains 
essential in helping us to achieve our goals. 
The Group has seen a great deal of change 
but throughout this everyone has remained 
focused on providing the services and 
support our customers’ value. I look forward 
to getting to know more people across 
the business and working with them in the 
months and years ahead.
Dividend
In light of the full year performance, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 
1.5p per share, to give an unchanged total 
dividend for the year of 3.0p per share. The 
Board will continue to keep its dividend 
policy under review.
Outlook
I believe there are many opportunities 
available to the business. Last year was a 
year of important operational progress and 
2018 has started well. I am confident in the 
outlook of the Group and focused upon 
ensuring that Centaur delivers long-term 
value for our clients and shareholders.
