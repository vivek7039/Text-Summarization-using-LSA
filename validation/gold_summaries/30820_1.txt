 “ 
2017 has been another strong year 
for Taylor Wimpey as we made good 
progress towards our medium term 
financial targets and improved our 
operational performance.
”
2017 was another strong year for Taylor Wimpey and we enter 2018 in a 
good position with positive forward momentum. We have been encouraged 
by early trading patterns at the start of the year and despite some wider 
macroeconomic uncertainty, consumer confidence remains robust and 
market fundamentals are solid. 
We grew volumes to nearly 15,000 homes during the year and are focused  
on delivering much-needed homes across the UK to the highest quality and 
standard. Importantly, we are pleased to see that our investment in customer 
service has resulted in a notable improvement in our customer 
satisfaction scores.
Group financial summary
Group revenue increased by 7.9% to £3,965.2 million in 2017 
(2016: £3,676.2 million) from 14,688 completions (2016: 14,112). The 
increase was driven by increased completions and improved selling prices 
in the UK. We delivered a gross profit for the year of £1,033.0 million 
(2016: £939.9 million), 9.9% up on the prior year and a profit, before 
exceptional items, for the year of £660.3 million (2016: £589.7 million),  
12.0% up on the prior year due to the improvement in the operational  
result, lower net finance costs and lower effective tax rate. Profit for the year 
was £555.3 million (2016: £589.3 million). This represents improved underlying 
trading offset by the exceptional provision recognised in the year in relation to 
the leasehold review. More information on our financial performance can be 
found within our Group Financial Review on pages 42 to 45.
UK operational performance summary
Whilst there were some regional variations, we saw generally strong demand 
throughout 2017 and the UK housing market remained resilient. Trading in 
Central London was stable, with customer confidence improving through the 
year, while the outer London market remained robust. We traded on an 
average of eight Central London schemes in 2017, of which the average size 
was 118 plots.
In 2017, total UK home completions (including joint ventures) increased by 
4.8% to 14,541 (2016: 13,881). During 2017, we delivered 2,809 affordable 
homes, including joint ventures, (2016: 2,690), equating to 19.3% of total 
completions (2016: 19.4%). Our net private reservation rate for the year was 
0.77 homes per outlet per week (2016: 0.72). 
Private cancellation rates for the year remained low at 13% (2016: 13%). 
Average selling prices on private completions increased by 3.5% to £296k 
(2016: £286k), once again benefiting from our focus on better quality locations 
and the improvement of specification in line with product and location. Our 
total average selling price increased by 3.5% to £264k (2016: £255k). We 
estimate that market-led house price growth for our regional mix was c.4% in 
the 12 months to 31 December 2017 (2016: 5%).

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report First time buyers accounted for 41% of total sales in 2017 (2016: 38%). 
Investor sales continued to be at a very low level of c.3% (2016: 3%). 
During 2017, approximately 43% of total sales used the Help to Buy scheme, 
and we worked with 6,069 households to take the first step to home 
ownership or to move up the housing ladder (2016: 39% and 5,393). 
Approximately 77% of sales through Help to Buy in 2017 were to first time 
buyers (2016: 77%). During the year 27% of sales in the London market used 
Help to Buy London, which launched in February 2016.
During 2017, we opened 109 new high-quality outlets (2016: 105) in  
locations in villages, towns and cities where people want to live, and  
which are supported by strong demographics and local economies.  
As at 31 December 2017 we were operating from 278 outlets 
(31 December 2016: 285).
As at 31 December 2017 our order book represented 7,136 homes 
(31 December 2016: 7,567 homes) with a value of £1,628 million 
(31 December 2016: £1,682 million), excluding joint ventures. The order  
book remains strong, and has fallen slightly year on year, as we increased  
the pace of production throughout 2017.
Group strategy and returns
We believe that a long term view and a proactive approach are needed to 
deliver value through the housing cycle and in the wider environment in  
which we operate. Key to this approach is our management of risk,  
which protects shareholder value whilst still enabling us to take advantage  
of opportunities and drive further growth from the business.
We have remained disciplined in building and optimising a short term 
landbank of c.75k plots, of which 52% is strategically sourced, in the relatively 
balanced land market we have experienced since 2011. We have added in 
excess of 57k potential plots to the strategic pipeline since 2013, at a reduced 
cost and which, importantly, continues to give us increased flexibility and 
choices. Given this strength and quality of the landbank, we are focused on 
delivering value and maximising returns from our investments. We believe we 
can continue to drive further value from our landbank and our business model, 
as we focus on our customers, delivery and efficiency and also increased 
cash generation.
We believe that financial results must be achieved in the right way and as a 
responsible business we acknowledge both our obligations to the 
communities we operate in and the opportunity to work with our stakeholders 
to create value together. We will be hosting a Strategy Day in May 2018, 
where we will update the market on our views of long term strategy.
Medium term targets
Our targets are set to be stretching, and we are pleased to have made good 
progress against both our financial targets and operational metrics, since we 
set out our medium term targets in 2016. 
These targets sit within our long term strategy, ensuring we are focused on 
operational efficiency as well as strategic investments. We believe these to be 
the best medium term measures. They target further improvement across 
three key areas in the period from 2016 to 2018:
 – An average annual return on net operating assets** of 30%
 – An average operating profit* margin of c.22%
 – A total of £1.3 billion of dividends to be paid in cash to shareholders over 
the period
More information on our medium term targets and how they link through to 
our long term strategy can be found on pages 20 and 21.
With a total dividend of c.£500 million to be paid in 2018, subject to 
shareholder approvals, the Group is on track to meet its target to pay 
£1.3 billion in dividends in total for the 2016-18 period. The return on net 
operating assets** of 32.4% in 2017 is above the target level for another year 
and as such we expect to meet or exceed our return on net operating 
assets** target. We continue to deliver further expansion in the operating 
profit* margin, although as we have noted before, the target remains a 
challenging one in the time frame set out. 
Dividends
We are committed to providing a reliable dividend stream for our investors 
through the cycle. Our dividend strategy includes sustaining a significant 
ordinary dividend to shareholders on an annual basis, including through a 
‘normal downturn’, combined with a special dividend to be paid at appropriate 
times in the cycle. This enables shareholders to benefit from the success of 
our strategy at all stages of the cycle. 
In 2017 shareholders received total dividends (including ordinary and special 
dividends) of £451 million (or 13.8 pence per share).
As previously announced, and subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting scheduled for 26 April 2018, we intend to pay 
c.£340 million to shareholders in July 2018 by way of a special dividend. 
Accordingly, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting, in 2018 shareholders will receive a total dividend of c.£500 million 
(c.15.3 pence per share), comprising an ordinary dividend of c.£160 million 
(c.4.9 pence per share) and a special dividend of c.£340 million (10.4 pence 
per share).
Our people
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Kevin’s words of thanks to the 
teams and the individuals across our business. Individually, and working 
together, our people are an important competitive advantage. I believe we 
have the best people and culture in the industry. I am particularly proud of the 
personal and professional commitments our employees make towards our 
charity partners and their local communities. A great example of this is our 
Taylor Wimpey Challenge, which is now into its fourth year. To date, our 
employees from across all of our regional businesses and functions have 
participated and together have raised more than £171k for the Youth 
Adventure Trust and other charities. More information can be found on our 
case study on page 34.
A key aspiration, and goal, for the Group Management Team is to make 
Taylor Wimpey the employer of choice and establish a culture where 
individuals from all backgrounds can reach their full potential. We were 
pleased to have been named in the 'Top 20 Places To Work' in the UK, by 
Glassdoor, as voted for by employees, the only commercial housebuilder to 
make the list.
Our employee engagement survey, conducted in 2017, highlighted key 
strengths but more importantly has highlighted areas for improvement and 
these will be a key area of focus for 2018. We aim to do this annually so we 
can measure performance. More information can be found on page 22 and 
throughout this report.

Customers
Customer service continues to be a key priority for all employees at Taylor 
Wimpey and is integral to our vision for the future of the business. We aim to 
put the needs of our customers at the heart of our decision-making. During 
2017 we built on the early success of our new customer service approach, 
which focuses on getting it right first time and improving the clarity and 
openness of our communication with customers, and have continued to 
make good progress implementing this approach across the business. Whilst 
we recognise there is more to do, we are particularly pleased to see a positive 
trend in customer satisfaction feedback, with scores in the last six months 
averaging over 90%. Internally, we are pleased to see the approach 
embedding well in the business, where 95% of Taylor Wimpey employees 
believe that Taylor Wimpey aims to deliver the best customer service in the 
homebuilding industry, based on our employee survey. In an industry that is 
growing at pace, delivery of quality alongside volume growth is not always 
easy and it has been a priority to ensure that our people have the right 
resources, and that we are clear that we prioritise delivering the right quality 
over short term financial results. 
During 2017, we achieved a customer satisfaction score of 88% (2016: 85%), 
reflecting the number of customers who were satisfied with the quality of their 
Taylor Wimpey home and 89% of customers would recommend Taylor 
Wimpey to a friend, based on the Home Builders Federation (HBF) survey. 
The survey is conducted by the National House-Building Council (NHBC) at 
eight weeks after completion to monitor our performance and identify areas 
for improvement.
As we have previously announced and as Kevin sets out in more detail on 
page 7, we have made good progress in securing agreements with 
freeholders representing over 90% of historic leases with a ten-year doubling 
ground rent clause, to enable our customers to convert to an RPI-based 
structure, should they elect to participate in our assistance scheme. We 
continue to work with the remaining freeholders to address the small number 
of remaining leases. A provision of £130 million, before tax, was recorded as 
an exceptional item in the H1 2017 accounts as a result of the leasehold 
review, and remains unchanged in the full year 2017 accounts.
Research and development
Research and development is a key area of focus as we seek to understand 
what our future customers will want and need. Our Project 2020 design 
competition in partnership with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) 
attracted over 100 entries from 14 different countries. The two-stage 
competition invited architects from across the globe to design new house type 
typologies with the brief of being innovative, pragmatic, cost effective, capable 
of high-quality mass production and which would appeal to future customers 
and their changing needs.
The ‘Infinite House’ designed by OpenStudio Architects, based in London, 
was chosen and will be built into a prototype in 2018. We selected a design 
that can be easily adapted both internally and externally to suit different sites 
and customer demographics. We are using the winning design to create a 
series of prototype homes on three of our developments. We achieved 
planning permission for the sites during 2017 and construction will begin in 
2018. More information can be found within our Sustainability Report 2017.
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
 
 
 
 
Research and development 
Research and development will help us to meet the changing needs  
and aspirations of our customers. By exploring new approaches and 
technologies we can also improve efficiency in construction and reduce 
the environmental impact of the homes we build, helping to future-proof 
our business.
Demonstrating excellence through improved operational efficiency 
and discipline
We continue to improve our business through our investment in people, product, processes and systems 
through research and development and embedding improvements to our customer service processes.
 
 
Land
Land is the critical raw material for our business and the ability to purchase 
the right sites in the right locations, at the right price and the right point in 
the cycle, is an important driver of value. We have remained disciplined 
since we re-entered the land market in 2011 and have built a short term 
landbank of c.75k plots, of which 52% is strategically sourced. Given this 
strength and quality of the landbank, we are focused on delivering value 
and maximising returns from our investments.
Build
We work with selected subcontractors and build using carefully sourced 
materials to ensure that the homes that we sell are of a high quality and  
are built safely, efficiently, cost-effectively and with minimal impact on 
the environment.
Our health, safety and environmental management system covers  
all our business activities. It includes procedures and processes to keep 
noise, dust and disturbance to a minimum on all our operational sites to 
prevent pollution incidents and to protect the biodiversity of the 
local environment.
Outlets
Our selling outlets are located in villages, towns and cities where people 
want to live, and which are supported by strong demographics and 
local economies.

Health and safety 
The health and safety of individuals on our sites will always be our number one 
priority and it continues to be the first item discussed at every plc and regional 
board meeting. It remains one of the highest rated questions in our annual 
employee engagement survey, with 98% of employees believing Taylor 
Wimpey takes health and safety in the workplace seriously.
Following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in London in June 2017, we 
conducted an internal review into our current and historic developments, 
working, as appropriate, with building owners, management companies, 
independent fire safety experts and local fire and rescue services. On sites 
where there are tall buildings with Aluminium Composite Material cladding,  
we have sought advice from independent fire safety experts, and, where 
required, have put in place additional measures to ensure that the buildings 
are fully compliant with the Government’s guidance on interim fire safety 
measures. We welcome the commissioning of the independent Hackitt 
Review on building regulations and fire safety, and look forward to working 
positively with Government and other agencies to ensure that the outcomes 
are effective and appropriate for the long term.
UK current trading and outlook
We have made a good start to 2018 and are encouraged by solid levels of 
demand coming into the spring selling season. The fundamentals for new 
build housing in the UK remain good with strong customer confidence in  
our core geographies. 
Customers continue to benefit from a competitive mortgage market and 
continued low interest rates. Help to Buy is a key differentiator for new build 
housing and remains popular with customers, enabling them to take the first 
step onto or move up the housing ladder. Customer demand and pricing in 
Central London remain stable. 
The net private sales rate for the year to date (w/e 18 February 2018) remains 
high at 0.81, against a very strong comparator (2017 equivalent period: 0.91), 
and remains in line with our expectations and plans for 2018. 
As at 18 February 2018, we were c.47% forward sold for private completions 
for 2018, with a total order book value of £1,968 million (2017 equivalent 
period: £1,978 million), excluding joint ventures. This order book represents 
8,415 homes (2017 equivalent period: 8,573). In Central London c.52% of 
private completions for 2018 are forward sold, as at 18 February 2018 (2017 
equivalent period: 58%). We prioritise getting outlets open efficiently and in the 
right way for our customers. As at 18 February 2018, we are building on 97% 
of our sites with implementable planning. 
We expect underlying build cost increases during 2018 to be at a similar level 
to 2017, at around 3-4%.
Following the introduction of a number of changes to our customer service 
approach in early 2016, we have been particularly pleased to see a significant 
improvement in customer satisfaction, averaging a score of over 90% in the 
last six months. Ensuring that we get the product quality and service right for 
our customers is a key priority for us.
As previously announced, we will pay a total dividend in 2018 of c.£500  
million, subject to shareholder approvals, and confirm our intention  
to make further material capital returns in 2019 and beyond. 
Whilst we have seen no adverse impact on trading, we are conscious of the 
wider political and economic risks. We are confident that our well-capitalised 
balance sheet together with our high-quality landbank with outlets located in 
places where demand is high and where people want to live provides the 
flexibility and resilience needed to manage all types of market conditions 
through the cycle.
