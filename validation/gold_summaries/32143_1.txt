 Chief Executive Officer’s review
Good operational delivery 
and strategic progress.
 “Our strategy is inherently outward 
looking... we have been building 
positive momentum with its 
implementation during the year.”
Market environment
FY17 was another year in which threats to global 
security from both state and non-state actors 
increased. Governments are seeking help with 
the rapid development of new capabilities to defeat 
emerging threats and ensure they meet their primary 
responsibility to protect and safeguard the lives of their 
citizens. Our expertise in science and engineering is 
particularly relevant in this context; we also play a vital 
role in making connections, be they across technologies, 
domains, supply chains or internationally. 
FY17 performance
During the year we successfully achieved both 
good operational delivery and significant progress 
implementing our strategy. This was evidenced by the 
delivery of organic revenue growth for the first time in 
a number of years. Revenue and operating profit were 
stable in EMEA Services and up in Global Products, 
driven by growth in QinetiQ North America. We will 
continue to prioritise the delivery of sustainable 
growth with ongoing capital discipline.
Strategy
Our vision is to be: “The chosen partner around the 
world for mission-critical solutions, innovating for our 
customers’ advantage.” To realise our vision we are 
implementing our three strategic priorities designed 
to grow the Company by focusing on our primary UK 
customer, on international customers and on innovation. 
Our strategy is inherently outward looking, based on 
the needs of our customers now and in the future, and 
I am encouraged that our customer satisfaction scores 
increased this year. To meet future customer needs, we 
are prioritising the rapid development of new capabilities 
to defeat emerging threats by embracing value-creating 
innovation. We are also driving greater value for money 
for our customers, improving services and delivering 
savings in parallel. To do this we connect supply chains 
and choose the right strategic partners from across 
industry with complementary capabilities to ours so that 
we can offer competitive and market-leading solutions. 
As our total order intake and backlog demonstrate, 
we have been building positive momentum with the 
implementation of this strategy during the year.
UK Defence Test & Evaluation
Our first strategic priority is to lead and modernise 
UK Defence Test & Evaluation (T&E). Delivering strong 
T&E capability is critical to ensuring reliable, flexible 
and affordable delivery of military capability to protect 
national interests. By engaging with our customers, 
we have made positive progress, signing new 
agreements which nearly double our order book to 
more than £2bn and significantly improving revenue 
visibility and therefore the risk profile of our Company.
In September 2016, we secured an 11-year, £109m 
extension to the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD’s) 
Naval Combat System Integration Support Services 
(NCSISS) contract under which we lead the T&E, 
integration and development of mission systems that 
keep the UK’s surface warships at sea and fit to fight. 
This is an excellent example of our strategy in action, with 
a focus on partnership with our customers and across the 
broader supply chain as we look to develop our Portsdown 
Technology Park site as the UK Centre of Excellence for 
maritime mission systems across the entire supply chain. 
In December we signed an 11-year, £1bn amendment 
to the Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA), the 
largest and most significant contract since privatisation, 
which has significant mutual benefits for the MOD and 
QinetiQ. For the MOD, it ensures the UK has world-class 
competitive air ranges and training for test pilots and 
aircrew, and delivers the capability at less cost. For us, 
it provides the platform we need for growth by creating 
more relevant and competitive T&E capability for the UK 
armed forces as well as governments and commercial 
customers around the world.
Our focus during FY18 is to re-price the remaining LTPA 
contract, which is due on 31 March 2018, and to work 
together with the MOD and industry partners to develop 
a long-term vision for the UK’s T&E capabilities.

Chief Executive Officer
6 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The objective of this vision is to deliver future military 
capability for the next decade and beyond, addressing 
current and emerging threats. This will provide a platform 
for growth in the UK T&E market, which we estimate to 
be double that which we currently access, and improve 
our ability to win work with customers outside the UK.
International
At the beginning of FY17, we established an International 
business focused on developing and securing growth 
opportunities in prioritised territories around the world. 
This new International business has been established 
as an ‘enabler’ for the Group, bringing greater coherence 
and focus to our activities internationally in relation to 
both organic and inorganic efforts, and encouraging 
a more global mind-set. 
In December 2016 we acquired Meggitt’s Target Systems 
business, now renamed QinetiQ Target Systems (QTS), 
both to reinforce our core T&E value proposition and 
accelerate the delivery of our strategic priority to drive 
international growth. The business generates 90% of its 
revenues from outside the UK and is well aligned with 
our capabilities in the management of complex exercises 
and provision of test, evaluation and training services, 
thus expanding our core capability overseas. We are now 
uniquely placed to meet growing demand for mid- and 
high-fidelity targets to test defence capabilities against 
a greater diversity of threats. The acquisition also opens 
up new routes to market to promote our wider service 
offerings to QTS’s international customer base.
A key element of our international strategy is to build 
our presence and capability in our home markets 
outside the UK, notably the US and Australia. QinetiQ 
North America delivered very good orders and revenue 
performance in FY17. With growing defence ambitions 
and close to the rapidly evolving Asia Pacific region, 
Australia is a particularly attractive market and our 
business there had a record year for orders. In January 
2017, we also acquired RubiKon Group which brings 
integrated logistics support capabilities to QinetiQ 
Australia. RubiKon strengthens our ability to offer 
integrated whole programme solutions that are often 
required for ‘strategic partner’ style contracts which are 
being used increasingly by the Australian Government.
In FY18 we intend to build on the progress we are 
making in our existing home markets by increasing our 
sales presence in regions such as the Middle East and 
Asia Pacific. Negotiations over the UK’s exit from the 
EU add complexity to our strategy for growth in Europe. 
However, many government relationships for defence 
and security, particularly in Europe, are underpinned 
by bilateral and multilateral agreements. 
Innovation
As customers demand more capability, and as 
the boundaries between defence and commercial 
technologies become increasingly blurred, value-creating 
innovation is vital to maintaining our distinctiveness in the 
marketplace. Technical innovation has been at the heart 
of QinetiQ’s success to date, and will remain a key source 
of growth into the future. However, turning creativity and 
technical innovation into tangible value for our customers 
increasingly requires innovative thinking across the 
broader range of activities. 
In FY17, we established business winning campaigns 
supported by Internal Research and Development 
(IRAD) to drive commercial innovation, new processes, 
and innovative business models. For each campaign 
we consider the people, investments and partnerships 
we need to be successful. For example, to support 
the campaign to exploit our world-class capability 
in secured navigation receivers, we signed a global 
alliance agreement with Rockwell Collins, the 
market leader in secure military GPS receivers. 
We have identified more than 30 growth campaigns in 
pursuit of material opportunities, all of which are worth 
tens of millions of pounds and in some cases more. 
We are not going to win every campaign, but the scale 
of the total opportunity is significant over a five to 
10-year time period. We will pursue these campaigns 
with vigour in FY18, as well as extending our focus 
to more international markets.
Transformation
We are on track to transform QinetiQ to improve 
customer focus and competitiveness. During the year 
we successfully introduced a new operating model based 
on matrix working to improve our responsiveness and 
operational effectiveness. We have also driven £20m 
of productivity savings that we have reinvested in 
business winning and IRAD to support our future growth. 
I appreciate that this period of significant change has 
been difficult for many of our employees, and this is 
reflected in our engagement score which fell last year 
although employee turnover remains low. Moving into 
FY18, supporting and developing the culture required 
to deliver our transformation is a particular goal.
Air accident
In July 2016, an air accident involving a contracted-in 
Yak aircraft operating in support of the Empire Test 
Pilots’ School (ETPS) sadly resulted in the death of an 
RAF pilot and serious injury to the contractor pilot. We 
are actively supporting the subsequent official inquiries 
and will respond to all recommendations made.
Outlook – FY18 
In EMEA Services, revenue under contract for FY18 is 
in line with the prior year, and the division is expected 
to deliver modest revenue growth this year although 
the lower baseline profit rate for single source contracts 
represents a continued headwind for operating margins. 
The Group’s Global Products division has shorter order 
cycles than EMEA Services and its performance is 
dependent on the timing of shipments of key orders. 
As a result of its contracted orders and pipeline of 
opportunities, as well as the anticipated full year 
contribution from the Target Systems acquisition, 
the division is expected to continue to grow in FY18. 
FY18 cash flow will reflect increasing investment, with 
capital expenditure of £80m to £100m, to support the 
amendment to the Long Term Partnering Agreement 
announced in December 2016.
Overall for FY18, we are maintaining expectations for 
steady progress excluding the non-recurring benefits 
in FY17, supported by revenue growth and consistent 
with our strategy.
Outlook – longer term
Rapidly changing dynamics in defence and security 
markets are presenting both opportunities and 
challenges for our industry. We are well placed to 
help customers both develop capabilities to defeat 
new threats and achieve greater value for money by 
improving services and delivering savings in parallel. 
The initial progress we have made, combined with our 
ongoing assessment of the market environment, and, 
in particular, feedback from customers reinforce that 
we have the right strategy in place to drive future growth. 
Over the longer term this strategy will create and 
sustain value for all our stakeholders. Our customers 
will benefit from better products and services, increased 
responsiveness, and improved value for money. 
Our shareholders will benefit because we will deliver 
sustainable growth in revenue, operating profit, and 
high-quality earnings. And our employees will benefit 
because they will be able to utilise their experience 
more widely across QinetiQ, working in integrated 
teams and enhancing professional satisfaction.
