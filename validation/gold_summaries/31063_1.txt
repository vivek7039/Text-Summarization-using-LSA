 ARENA GROUP
16 Annual Report & Accounts 2017
CEO’s Report
I am pleased to present the Group’s first 
Strategic Report to shareholders. 2017 was a 
year of excellent progress for the Group with 
the delivery of a number of key milestones 
that have laid the foundations for the future 
development of the business.
Introduction
The history of the Arena Group is a long one and the 
Company can trace its origins back over 250 years. 
There will, no doubt, have been a number of years 
where significant milestones were achieved during this 
long history, but I do not believe that any previous year 
can match the historic milestones that the Group has 
achieved this year. 
As milestones go, the listing of the Group on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange on 25 July 2017 
has to take pride of place. The Initial Public Offering 
(“IPO”) which raised £56 million, net of expenses, not 
only significantly reduced the Group’s net debt and 
strengthened our balance sheet but has also given us 
the shareholder base to support the value accretive 
acquisitions that are an integral part of the Group’s 
ambitious strategic plan. 
The listing also helped to raise our profile as a leading 
provider of event rental solutions delivering what we 
refer to as the “Arena Standard” wherever we are in 
the world. This standard is part of the Group’s unique 
value proposition and promises that we will deliver to 
the highest standards in our industry - from any of our 
14 bases spread across three regional divisions in the 
UK & Europe, Middle East & Asia, and the US. 
Results 
The Group delivered adjusted EBITDA of £10.6m 
(2016: £8.5m) and an adjusted net income of £4.0m 
(2016: £1.2m). The statutory operating profit was 
£0.3m (2016:£1.2m). The statutory loss before tax was 
£2.9m (2016: £3.6m), which includes £4.9m of costs 
considered to be exceptional or non-recurring, as well 
as the finance costs related to the high debt and loan 
note structure in place prior to the IPO. Given these 
one-off and exceptional costs, and to give a better 
understanding of the underlying performance of the 
business, we present adjusted EBITDA and adjusted 
net income. On this adjusted basis, 2017 was a record 
set of results, with the Group’s adjusted EBITDA of 
£10.6m – exceeding £10m for the first time in the 
Group’s history. 
These results are described in more detail in the 
financial review on page 19 including a reconciliation 
of adjusted numbers to statutory figures. Our results 
were achieved from our normal contracted and 
recurring customer revenues coupled with the addition 
of a number of new multi-year contracts and one-
off events as outlined in more detail in each of the 
regional CEO review sections on pages 24 and 29.
The most significant new multi-year contract win was 
in the US with the addition of a five year contract to 
deliver the three US PGA annual events, including the 
Men’s PGA Championship, which was held in 2017 in 
Quail Hollow, North Carolina. 
Industry Overview
The Global event rental sector is a highly fragmented 
and siloed (single product/service focused) industry. 
There are very few international organisations and 
typically businesses in the sector tend to be very 
single product focused. This landscape has not 
changed significantly during 2017 – with most industry 
transactions focused on increasing the size, rather 
than the product/service offerings, of the relevant 
company. 
A number of significant transactions were, however, 
completed in 2017. 
The main European transaction of note, was the 
acquisition of De Boer Structures by Losberger- 
creating the largest structures business in the world. 
This new group has, for the first time, seen the

combination of a major structures manufacturer with a 
major structures rental business. This is a significant 
development as, traditionally, manufacture and rental 
businesses have remained distinctly separate.
In the US, the break-up of the former Classic Party 
Rentals business, based out of Los Angeles, has 
changed the landscape of the North American event 
rental sector. Classic was the largest single, event 
rental, business in the US with operations spread 
across more than ten locations from California to 
Florida. The disposal programme saw a number of 
different transactions with the largest transaction 
being the disposal of the Classic West Coast party 
rental business to Bright Rentals, based out of LA. This 
break-up has now eliminated the only truly national 
party and structures rental company in the US. This 
presents a significant opportunity for the development 
of the Arena business in the US as we outlined at the 
time of the listing.
Apart from these two major developments, the 
industry continues to see a good flow of acquisition 
activity in the smaller scale business units that operate 
within the sector. We continue to be active in this space 
as we look for value-accretive bolt on businesses that 
have the potential to enhance the performance of our 
existing business.
Growth Strategies
We outlined four key components of our strategic plan 
as part of the IPO process in 2017. 
These four components are designed to help us deliver 
not only top line revenue growth, but more importantly 
improvement in EBITDA margins that we believe will 
continue to create demonstrable shareholder value 
over the coming years. 
Geographic expansion
• Future geographic expansion will be initially 
focused on the US where the Group currently has 
approximately one per cent market share, and 
a predominantly Upper Midwest and East Coast 
presence. An improved presence on the West Coast 
would bolster the business’s national tenting reach 
and allow the servicing of national customers across 
the entire North American continent on a more 
economic basis.
Product Extension
• We intend to replicate our UK multi-product offering 
in other parts of the Group. 
• We will continue to review and expand our product 
range and service capabilities in all regions to 
ensure we are providing as broad a product offering 
as possible to our customers in each region.
• The April 2017 acquisition of Wernick Events, a 
seating and mass participation business based in 
Coventry, is a good example of this. This acquisition 
added some 24,000 tiered seats to our existing stock 
of 76,000, but also allowed us to enter the fast-
growing mass participation sports market in the UK 
where we now deliver over 300 events each year for 
Cancer Research UK and other event organisers.
Reduction of seasonality
• Our business by its nature is seasonal in each 
region. This means that typically each region suffers 
losses in the slow season. 
• We plan to continue to expand into complementary 
markets to extend the season in each region, thus 
improving asset and labour utilisation.
• The expansion of our temporary ice rink business 
in the UK is a good example of this, where we now 
deliver 30 temporary ice rinks over the winter 
season including venues such as the Tower of 
London, Hampton Court, Canary Wharf and 
Liverpool. The Group is now EBITDA profitable 
nine months out of twelve and our objective is to 
ultimately have positive EBITDA every month of the 
year as a consequence of this strategic component.
Vertical Integration / manufacturing of temporary 
structures 
• The Group already has two small manufacturing 
facilities, one in Malaysia and the other in the US. 
• These units manufacture certain parts and 
bespoke products for a number of unique client 
requirements. 
• Given the importance of being able to offer bespoke, 
innovative and cost effective product solutions to 
our customers we will look to add to these existing 
manufacturing facilities in order to continue 
providing our customers with state-of-the-art 
solutions across our regional divisions. ARENA GROUP

Acquisitions
I am pleased to report that we have, since the year end, 
made progress in a number of these areas with two 
acquisitions, each of which will contribute to the future 
growth of the Group.
Our first acquisition since the IPO was GLD 
Productions, a specialist provider of furniture into 
the music and event sectors, based in the UK. The 
deal was announced on the 2nd February 2018. This 
business has now been successfully integrated into our 
Spaceworks Furniture Hire unit in Membury and we 
believe will be a valuable addition to our UK & Europe 
Division.
We have also agreed the acquisition of Ironmonger 
Events in Hong Kong, a business operated and partly 
owned by the vendor of the structures business we 
acquired in Hong Kong two years ago. This transaction 
will allow us to offer a complete end-to-end event 
solutions business in this dynamic part of the world.
We continue to evaluate a number of other acquisitions 
and we are confident that we will have a number of 
additional acquisitions to announce before the end of 
2018.
United States Attorney’s Office investigation of Arena 
Americas
On 29 March 2018 we notified the market that our 
US subsidiary, Arena Event Services Inc (“Arena 
Americas”), had been informed by the US Attorney’s 
Office (“USAO”) that it had formally charged one of 
Arena Americas previous customers for a violation 
related to the Small Business set-aside program for 
business conducted between 2007 and 2017. 
As a result of this, Arena Americas was notified by the 
USAO that it has launched an investigation into Arena 
America’s relationship with this customer.  Since 2013, 
when Arena acquired the Americas business, total 
revenue generated from contracts with this customer 
has been $4m with EBITDA of approximately $0.5m.  
Based on other similar cases, fines of up to two times 
revenues or profits have been imposed, implying a 
possible range of fines between $1m and $8m.  Due 
to the level of uncertainty over the outcome, the 
Group has not made any provision for future costs 
in the annual financial statements related to this 
investigation.
We continue to pro actively engage with the USAO 
in order to draw this matter to a conclusion as soon 
as possible.  However, at this date, we are not in a 
position to finalise this matter with the USAO.   We 
hope to have further news within the next few months 
and will update the market accordingly.
Looking Ahead
We are pleased to have delivered a strong set of 
inaugural results, post IPO, in 2017. These results, 
on an adjusted basis, represent a significant increase 
over our adjusted 2016 numbers and were, in the main, 
delivered by strong organic growth.
We have started 2018 with the delivery of two value 
accretive acquisitions, a strong pipeline of future 
acquisitions, combined with a healthy first quarter 
trading. We remain confident that we can continue to 
grow the business organically and by way of acquisition 
over the next few years as we continue to leverage our 
new-found Plc status.
