 “The patience of shareholders
will be rewarded as we move
towards the production phase. ”
During the year the extension to the original
licence was approved for Smirnovskoye, and the
licence extension is valid until September 2019.
In relation to Drozhilovskoye, we do not see any
issues in obtaining the license as we have
satisfied all the requests for information from the
relevant ministry.  Administrative delays have
held up the licence and we are now expecting to
receive the signed licence in Q2 2018.   
The Company is now in a new phase of
development and moving towards production.
We have entered into talks with interested parties
in particular with China Molybdenum which has
expertise in processing our particular minerals.
The economics of moving to production have
changed as commodity prices have stabilised and
with the inclusion of Lithium in the profit
generation models the projects are more
economically viable.
One of the key steps moving forward is to update
and more clearly define the resources.  The
Company undertook exploration drilling in Q1
2018 at the Drozhilovskoye site, the results of
which were very encouraging, (as announced by
the Company on 19 March 2018). This drilling was
undertaken by an external geological firm and
the results of which will prove useful in bringing
partners on board to develop the site.  In
addition a Competent Persons Report is shortly
to be commissioned under the JORC code.  This
will provide further external verification of the
resources on both sites.
We are keen to press forward with the plans for
development.  The sourcing of a partner that has
skill and expertise in this area is seen as
extremely beneficial to moving the plans
forward.
Exploration drilling
The Company undertook exploration drilling
in Q1 2018 at the Drozhilovskoye site, the
results of which were very encouraging. 
In terms of funding the Company has sufficient
operational funds from its existing facility with
Amrita Investments.  The Company will seek to
source developmental funds as the project
moves forward and the quantum of funding
requirement becomes more transparent. 
The Board wishes to thank the shareholders for
their patience and we are confident of looking
forward to a productive 2018 as the Company
develops.
