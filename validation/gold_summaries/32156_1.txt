 Focused strategy delivering  
growing cash profits
Our Executive Committee
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW
“ Our convenience‑led, 
community‑focused retail & 
leisure portfolio has proved 
well‑positioned in what has been 
an uncertain twelve months at 
the macro economic and 
political levels.”
This has been another outstanding year for 
NewRiver, which is reflected in a strong set of full 
year results. These results also demonstrate that 
our focused business model, which we have strictly 
adhered to since our IPO, is clearly working well.
Our convenience‑led, community‑focused retail and 
leisure portfolio has proved well‑positioned and 
well‑placed in what has been an uncertain twelve 
months at the macro economic and political levels. 
As a business, we have maintained our disciplined 
approach to stock selection, remained active 
asset managers, progressed our risk‑controlled 
development pipeline and recycled capital 
profitably, all of which has allowed us to continue 
to deliver growing and sustainable cash profits to 
our shareholders.
Our Funds From Operations (‘FFO’) of £58.2 million 
were up 24% compared to the same period last 
year due to acquisitions made in the last 12 months 
as well as our highly active asset management 
programme. The Board recently approved a final 
quarterly dividend of 5.0 pence per share, resulting 
in a fully covered ordinary dividend for the year of 
20.0 pence per share, up over 8% compared to last 
year. We are delighted to announce an additional 
3.0 pence per share special dividend linked to our 
acquisition in Sheffield, taking the total dividend 
for the year to 23.0 pence per share, an increase 
of 24%. This special dividend demonstrates our 
commitment to continue to distribute growing cash 
returns to our shareholders. Looking ahead, the 
increase in our Q1 FY18 dividend to 5.25 pence per 
share, an increase of 5% on Q1 FY17, reflects our 
confidence in the security and sustainability of our 
cash flows.
Our assets under management now stand at 
£1.3 billion, £1.1 billion at NewRiver’s share, with our 
EPRA net asset value per share down marginally by 
3 pence to 292 pence reflecting the absorption of 
acquisition costs and Main Market move costs as 
well as a small 0.6% reduction in portfolio valuation. 
Importantly, this reduction came in the first half of 
our financial year, when real estate values were

14 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 impacted by Brexit fears, and our valuations showed 
improvement in the second half. Our IFRS net assets 
have decreased by 0.8%, due principally to the 
same factors.
During the year, we completed acquisitions totalling 
£158 million at an equivalent yield of 7.2%. In 
April 2016 we completed our largest acquisition 
to date, buying the Broadway Shopping Centre 
and Broadway Square Retail Park in Bexleyheath, 
South East London, for £120 million at a blended 
equivalent yield of 7.0%. We have been active in the 
year since acquisition, improving rental tone in the 
shopping centre by 15% and working in partnership 
with the London Borough of Bexley to design 
a masterplan for the shopping centre, retail park 
and surrounding council owned land. In April 2017, 
following a comprehensive fit out, London based 
Morleys Department Stores opened at the centre in 
the 40,000 sq ft unit formerly occupied by BHS. The 
opening of this new store has been a real success 
for Morleys, and we have benefitted from increased 
footfall across the rest of the shopping centre.
We completed the acquisition of Cuckoo Bridge 
Retail Park in Dumfries in June 2016 in an off‑market 
transaction for £20 million. At the time of acquisition, 
we identified several opportunities to drive income 
and capital growth by improving the occupier line‑up 
and have agreed heads of terms with a fashion/
homeware occupier to introduce a 20,000 sq ft full 
line store subject to obtaining planning consent 
which is anticipated in the next few months.
In September 2016, we moved quickly to acquire 
a retail warehouse in Sheffield from an open‑ended 
property fund for £18 million. As we completed 
the acquisition, we exchanged contracts with the 
occupier to accept a surrender premium of up to 
£12.25 million by May 2017, meaning that in essence 
we acquired a 110,000 sq ft prominently located 
retail warehouse on an 11 acre site for a net price 
of £6 million. In March 2017, having moved into 
advanced negotiations with a number of potential 
occupiers and purchasers, we requested and 
received the surrender premium, having received 
rent in the interim, the majority of which we are 
paying to our shareholders as a 3.0 pence per share 
special dividend. Pleasingly, the asset has been 
independently valued at 50% more than our net 
purchase price.
Across our retail portfolio we continued our track 
record of strong and improving operational metrics, 
with the increase in occupancy from 96% in March 
2016 to 97% in March 2017 reflecting the compelling 
nature of our convenience‑led, community‑focused 
portfolio to occupiers. Our highly active approach 
to asset management resulted in the completion 
of more than 300 new lettings and renewals, with 
long term deals completed on terms 3.9% ahead 
of ERV. Importantly our rents remain affordable for 
our occupiers, at £12.45 per sq ft on average. The 
combination of our high occupancy and affordable 
average rents indicates to us that retailers are 
trading profitably at our assets, underpinning the 
sustainability of our income. This affordability will 
be further supported by this year’s business rates 
revaluation, with draft rateable values across our 
retail portfolio in England, Scotland and Wales falling 
by over 19% on average. Our pub operators will also 
benefit from the rates revaluation, saving on average 
40% on business rates from 1 April 2017.
During the year, we successfully applied our active 
asset management approach to our pub portfolio. 
At the time of the Trent portfolio acquisition, we 
signed a four year leaseback agreement with 
Marston’s Plc which ends later this year.

STRATEGIC REPORT Of the 189 pubs held in the Trent portfolio, we have 
now successfully transferred the management of 
44 pubs from Marston’s, and during the year we 
secured contracted income on a further 22 pubs 
by surrendering the leaseback arrangement early 
and agreeing new 15 year RPI linked leases with 
Marston’s. The remaining pubs will be transferred 
in small batches over the remainder of the calendar 
year. We have continued to make selective and 
profitable disposals from our pub portfolio, selling 
seven pubs for £4 million in the year representing 
a 10% premium to March 2016 valuation and over 
a 30% premium to purchase price.
We have made good progress on our 1.9 million sq ft 
risk‑controlled development pipeline during the year. 
At our 465,000 sq ft consented regeneration project 
in Burgess Hill, we have pre‑let 49% of the retail 
and leisure element, up from 41% just six months 
ago, with leases now signed with Next and Nandos. 
On the residential element of the scheme, we have 
agreed terms with a residential investment company 
for a significant pre‑sale. In order to facilitate the 
development, we recently agreed terms with Lidl 
and Iceland to surrender and relocate to sites 
adjacent to the shopping centre, as well as agreeing 
to re‑locate the local council owned library. All of this 
progress means that we hope to be in a position to 
start on site later in the summer.
Elsewhere in our risk‑controlled development 
pipeline, in November 2016 we received planning 
consent at Canvey Island for a 62,000 sq ft retail 
park which is already 52% pre‑let. In the same 
month we also submitted the planning application 
for our exciting 236,000 sq ft mixed‑use 
regeneration in Cowley, Oxford. Our current 
development commitment is modest, with 
26,000 sq ft under construction all of which is 
pre‑let. Our risk‑controlled approach to development 
means we will not commit to further developments 
without substantial pre‑letting.
The convenience store programme within our pub 
portfolio continued to progress, and we handed 
over a further eight c‑stores to the Co‑operative 
in the period taking the total number completed 
to date to 11. In early 2017 we completed our first 
c‑store disposal for £970,000, representing an initial 
yield of 4.85%, and over 11% ahead of valuation. We 
are on site for the construction of a further three 
c‑stores totalling 11,000 sq ft and we have consent 
to construct a further 15 totalling 53,400 sq ft.
Our L TV was 37% at 31 March 2017, up from 27% at 
March 2016 predominantly due to the acquisition 
of our assets in Bexleyheath which completed in 
April 2016. Our interest cover remained robust at 
4.5x and our weighted average cost of debt was 
3.5%, down from 3.7% in March 2016.
We completed our move from AIM to a Premium 
Listing on the Main Market in August 2016 marking 
a significant milestone for NewRiver and we 
continued this impressive momentum into 
December, when we qualified for admission  
into the FTSE 250, FTSE All‑Share and EPRA  
indices at the first attempt.
We have a fantastic, talented and enthusiastic team 
at NewRiver and I would like to thank them all for 
their hard work and significant contribution to this 
year’s results.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
“ We believe that with our convenience and 
community specialism, strong operational 
metrics, affordable rents and conservative 
balance sheet we are well‑positioned to 
continue to deliver secure and sustainable 
cash returns to our shareholders and 
we look forward to the coming year 
with confidence.”
16 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Outlook
We believe that with our convenience and 
community focus, strong operational metrics, 
affordable rents and conservative balance sheet 
we are well‑positioned to continue to grow and 
deliver secure and sustainable cash returns to 
our shareholders.
In the context of the slowdown in the investment 
market since the EU Referendum we are pleased 
to have bided our time and believe that current 
market conditions and the pricing for typical assets 
which NewRiver wishes to acquire are beginning to 
provide opportunities for the Company.
We have never relied on the market to drive returns 
for our shareholders, instead we have ourselves 
created value by applying our proven business 
model, and focusing on the convenience‑led, 
community‑focused retail and leisure sectors where 
the UK household budget is spent day in, day out. 
We remind ourselves that the business was founded 
in 2009 during a severe recession and has grown 
into a FTSE 250 entity in less than eight years.
NewRiver is highly capable of enhancing 
shareholder value through its very active asset 
management programme and our strict adherence 
to risk‑controlled development practices. Our 
business model remains highly scalable and we 
view the future with excitement and confidence.
