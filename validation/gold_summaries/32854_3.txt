 Chairman’s review
Focusing innovation on  
patients and customers
In 2017, Shire started its first full financial 
year as a transformed company: the 
undisputed global leader in treating 
rare diseases. 
As we began the year, the integration of 
Baxalta was well under way. A company 
that had commercial operating units in 22 
countries in 2013 is now in more than 60 
countries. A clinical pipeline with 20 
programs in 2013, ended 2017 with 40 
such active programs. And our therapeutic 
footprint had expanded into three new 
dynamic areas: immunology, hematology, 
and oncology.
Shire has transformed itself, but with this 
transformation came obvious challenges. 
We had a global manufacturing portfolio 
that required careful pruning and 
disciplined, efficient management. 
In many countries we had to consolidate 
two offices into one, moving and 
reassigning experienced staff, while 
maintaining commercial momentum. 
And we set aggressive targets for our 
teams, pushing ourselves to meet the 
highest possible financial goals, some 
of which were clearly aspirational.
At the end of 2017, the people of 
Shire could look back with pride. 
The implementation of our Network 
Manufacturing Study laid the foundation 
for efficient and effective supply operations. 
And at the same time, Shire exceeded its 
challenging integration synergy targets for 
the year, saving money and managing its 
global procurement systems in the most 
cost-effective and efficient manner.
Despite these many achievements, 
Shire’s share price performance was 
disappointing. For a Board, management 
team, and company focused on improving 
shareholder value, the challenge is clear 
and we have strengthened our resolve to 
improve and succeed in 2018.
For Shire, success means delivering more 
innovative solutions to the patients who 
depend on us. We know that if patients, 
physicians, and caregivers appreciate and 
value our products, then shareholders will 
also benefit. In this way 2017 was not just 
a year of integration, but also one of 
preparation for the future.
In 2017, we launched 50 products in 
25  countries with therapies to treat 
diseases such as short bowel syndrome, 
hypoparathyroidism and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We 
significantly advanced our Research and 
Development (R&D) pipeline with 54 
major market filings around the world 
and continued to invest in areas where 
we see great need and opportunity such 
as immunology.
We maintained our dedication to our 
environment and the communities in which 
we serve. In 2017, Shire developed our new 
Responsibility strategy with commitments 
and long-term goals to be achieved by 
2025. We also held our third annual Global 
Day of Service, during which more than 
7,300 Shire employees from around the 
world dedicated more than 29,000 hours 
of their time to volunteering in their 
communities. A detailed description 
of Shire’s commitment to Responsibility 
can be found on page 35.
The accomplishments — focused squarely 
on delivering benefits to patients in need 
and the communities in which we live — 
came during a year of substantial external 
regulatory and macroeconomic challenge. 
The hemophilia market landscape shifted, 
and continues to change rapidly. The global 
political, tax, and regulatory environment in 
which we operate is constantly in motion. 
And the pharmaceutical industry must still 
manage societal challenges in funding, 
pricing, and identifying ways to support 
future innovation. 
These challenges will continue in 2018, 
making it essential that Shire maintains 
its efficient and nimble business strategy. 
Towards that end, we continue to evaluate 
the strategic and operational direction of 
the Company, including an assessment 
of our neuroscience business. While this 
review continues, we are creating two 
distinct business divisions within Shire: 
one focused on rare disease and the other 
focused on neuroscience. This will enable 
sharper management focus, greater 
strategic clarity, and distinct investment 
opportunities for both parts of the 
business. We expect the conclusion of 
our strategic review of these two business 
segments in the second half of 2018. 
Additional details on the divisions can 
be found on page 12.
For our employees, 2017 was a period of 
challenge and change. But it was also a 
year in which they all showed their grit, 
resolve, and unwavering dedication to the 
patients we serve. The Board and I would 
like to thank everyone at Shire, not just for 
their hard work, but also for their drive, 
focus, and commitment during a period of 
transformation. We would also like to thank 
our CEO, Dr. Flemming Ornskov, who has 
led the Shire team through this integration 
with great skill and has kept everyone 
focused on the goal of building a more 
resilient Shire for the long-term.
Finally, I’d like to express my sincere 
appreciation to Bill Burns, Senior 
Independent Director; Anne Minto, the 
previous Chairman of our Remuneration 
Committee; and Dominic Blakemore, 
previous chair of the Audit, Compliance & 
Risk Committee, all of whom will be retiring 
from the Board after the 2018 AGM. 
I am proud of the contributions of 
our more than 23,000 employees and 
am grateful to our patient communities 
for their partnership. And importantly, 
I remain excited and optimistic about 
the future of our Company.
4 Shire Annual Report 2017 Thank you also to former Shire CFO Jeff 
Poulton who left the Company at the end 
of 2017. The contributions of Bill, Anne, 
Dominic, and Jeff cannot be overstated. 
Shire is a better company because of their 
work; we are grateful for their dedication 
and wish them all the best in the future. 
In closing, I am proud of the contributions 
of our more than 23,000 employees and 
our Board, and I am grateful to our patient 
communities for their partnership. And 
importantly, I remain excited and optimistic 
about the future of our Company. It is our 
privilege to continue working on behalf of 
the patients who inspire us every day.
