 CEO review
Investment in primary care 
premises is an essential  
enabler for the necessary 
NHS transformations.
Jonathan Murphy 
CEO
Overview
A year of political disruption has 
contributed towards uncertainty in 
the financial and commercial property 
markets. Despite this backdrop Assura 
has continued to deliver superior risk 
adjusted returns built on a secure and 
long-term income stream funded by 
the NHS. In the past year, our property 
return was 9.7%, driven by an income 
return of 5.3% and an increase in 
property values adding a further 4.4%. 
At the end of the financial year, in 
March, Sir Robert Naylor released 
his landmark review of the NHS 
estate highlighting the crucial role 
for primary care premises in enabling 
the policy imperatives of dramatically 
increasing evening and weekend GP 
appointments, encouraging practices 
to work together in networks or hubs 
and increasing significantly the primary 
care workforce. It is now clear that 
mainstream thinking recognises that 
investment in primary care premises is 
an essential enabler to the necessary 
NHS transformation. Assura’s bespoke 
approach, one that works for the NHS, 
for GPs, for wider community health 
teams and for patients, is well suited 
to deliver what is required.

6  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Delivering long-term 
outperformance in 
property returns
Assura is a constituent of the IPD All 
Healthcare Index and over the last five 
years we have delivered an annualised 
ungeared return of 8.9% This level of 
consistent performance over a long 
period is a testament to the skills and 
dedication of our property team and 
to the specialist knowledge we have 
in our sector. 
The strong returns achieved in this 
five-year period are even more 
creditable given the development 
activity of this time has been at 
historically low levels, as development 
activity is a key driver of Assura’s 
returns in two ways. Firstly, we are 
typically able to source developments 
at an effective yield on cost that is 
100 basis points higher than through 
acquisitions. Secondly, developments 
provide evidence of construction cost 
inflation that drives rental growth. 
Our 398 medical centres have a rent roll 
of £74.4 million with the geographically 
diverse nature of the portfolio allowing 
us to serve more than 6% of the UK’s 
population. Our investment approach is 
to identify those assets we believe are 
best in class in their local catchment 
areas. By acquiring those assets that 
provide a broad range of services to 
their local communities, we believe 
these will provide greater prospects 
for lease renewal on expiry and so 
drive greater property returns over 
the long term.
A good example of this approach can 
be seen in our acquisition of Donnington 
Medical Practice in Shropshire. This 
centre serves over 12,500 patients and 
provides 17 additional services on site 
including blood pressure and coronary 
heart disease prevention, dermatology, 
minor surgery, and smoking cessation 
programmes. 
For key properties, we are not afraid 
to acquire shorter leases, and use our 
property skills to redevelop or enhance 
the premises, whilst seeking to re-gear 
the lease to a longer period.
Net initial yield movement
 
The attractiveness of the sector has resulted in a stable yield profile with modest 
yield compression in recent years.

Rental income
The key driver of our property return is the 
income from our long-term leases. In the 
year rental growth was 1.6% from settled 
rent reviews. Most of our rent reviews are 
on an open market basis, set by reference 
to rental awards agreed with the District 
Valuer on new schemes. This means 
that they are influenced by land and 
construction cost inflation over the 
medium term. Over recent years there 
has been significant inflation in these 
costs, but this increased cost is not yet 
fully reflected in our passing rents as the 
slowdown in new schemes has reduced 
the evidence of that inflation. Our portfolio 
is well placed to capture this rental growth 
once new developments recommence 
and this gives us confidence for the 
medium-term prospects for rental growth 
in our sector.
Capital growth
The balance of our ungeared annualised 
return is generated from capital growth, 
which has seen a like-for-like valuation 
growth of 5.6% in the past year. This 
increase has primarily come from 
a movement in yields with our net 
equivalent yield moving by 23 basis 
points in the past year. The portfolio 
net initial yield as at 31 March 2017 
was 5.10%.
We completed two developments 
during the year at a total development 
cost of £13.8 million. This has added 
£0.7 million to our annual rent roll. 
We also add value through active asset 
management of our properties, working 
with our GP tenants on proposals for 
physical extensions or agreeing new or 
extended lease terms. During the year 
we agreed four extensions, 15 new 
leases and 10 lease extensions. 
Together this asset management 
activity added a further £0.4 million 
to our rent roll. 
The combined impact of our investment 
and asset management activity has 
been to achieve a 7% growth in EPRA 
NAV to 49.4 pence per share.

contributor to the £236 million increase 
in investment property in the year. 
This has enabled our rent roll to grow 
by 17% to £74.4 million. 
Our in-house development team is 
currently busier than it has been for a 
number of years. Although completed 
schemes in the year numbered only two 
sites, for a gross development cost of 
£13.8 million, the number of potential 
opportunities has increased markedly. 
We are currently on site at a further six 
schemes with a gross development cost 
of £31 million, which is a significant uplift 
from this time last year. The pipeline 
remains strong, with a further eight 
schemes with a gross development 
cost of £36 million where we expect 
to be on site within the next 12 months.
This increased level of activity is 
encouraging. The schemes we are 
working on are being driven by pressing 
local requirements; however, we are yet 
to see the full effect of national policy 
imperatives or programmes. The 
potential for the Sustainability and 
Transformation Plans (“STPs”) and the 
Estates and Technology Transformation 
Fund is real, though we are not yet 
seeing that potential converted into 
significant investment.
We remain optimistic that these 
central initiatives will result in increased 
investment in the future. We have the 
skills, resources and capital to support 
and benefit from these plans when they 
convert into action. 
Funding further growth
At the year end we had an immediate 
acquisition pipeline of £86 million 
and we continue to identify new 
opportunities that meet our 
acquisition criteria.
To support this continued expansion 
of the portfolio, we have been active 
in sourcing new funding over the past 
year. In May 2016, we agreed a £200 
million unsecured revolving credit facility 
with a club of four banks at an initial 
margin of 150 basis points. At the year 
end we had utilised £100 million of 
these facilities and so to provide further 
scope for expansion we have now, in 
May 2017, increased this facility to 
£250 million on the same terms.
Maximising operational 
efficiency
The property additions have been 
integrated by our in-house property 
management team, which is delivering 
sector-leading tenant satisfaction 
across our portfolio. In our annual tenant 
satisfaction survey over 95% of our 
tenants said they would recommend us 
as potential landlords to other GPs, and 
our GPs remain our greatest source of 
referrals for new business. We remain 
focused on understanding their evolving 
needs and demands, so we can be at 
the forefront of the significant investment 
required in improving premises in 
the future.
Our team of portfolio and investment 
managers has responsibility for 
identifying value enhancing asset 
management opportunities, such as 
lease extensions and redevelopments 
within our existing estate, as well as 
new acquisition opportunities.
This structure enables us to ensure that 
we can maximise the efficiency with 
which we can translate increased rental 
income into underlying profit and hence 
dividends. In the year we have delivered 
a 58% growth in EPRA earnings to 
£40.3 million. This has been achieved 
from 21% growth in our investment 
property value and a reduction in our 
EPRA Cost Ratio from 17% to 14%.
The overall impact of all of these factors 
has enabled us to increase our quarterly 
dividend from January 2017 by 9% to 
0.60 pence per share.
Continued focus on our 
specialist sector
Assura represents a unique proposition 
in our sector as we act as investor, 
developer and manager of our 
properties. This gives us an unrivalled 
knowledge and understanding of the 
requirements of GPs for their premises. 
We also maintain a database of every 
primary care property in the UK that 
enables us to identify and analyse 
potential acquisition opportunities. 
This exceptional market knowledge has 
been a key contributor to our continued 
success in expanding our portfolio 
during the year and we closed the year 
with a portfolio of 398 properties and 
a valuation in excess of £1.3 billion.
The ongoing growth in the portfolio 
has largely been achieved through 
continued acquisitions. In the year 
we completed £156 million of property 
additions, which was the largest

8  Assura plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In October 2016, Assura issued £100 
million of unsecured 10-year notes at a 
fixed rate of 2.65%. This was Assura’s 
first issue in the US private placement 
market and demonstrates our ability 
to attract a new source of long-term 
funding at an attractive rate. This 
unsecured funding increases operational 
flexibility and reduces transaction costs 
associated with financing the expanding 
property portfolio. 
These new facilities highlight that the 
increased financial strength of Assura is 
enabling us to source new unsecured 
funding at attractive rates. We have 
sustained a strong, long-term and 
diversified debt profile, with 81% of our 
borrowings now at fixed rate with an 
average maturity of 8.7 years, while 
delivering a reduction in our weighted 
average cost of debt from 4.84% 
to 4.06%.
The loan to value ratio at the year 
end was 37%, which provides further 
capacity for growth as we maintain 
a medium-term target range of 40% 
to 50%.
Market developments
Our purpose is simple: to provide GPs 
and patients with the buildings they 
need now, for the NHS of today and 
tomorrow. Providing a wider range 
of health services closer to home, 
from a broader range of primary care 
professionals, is both more convenient 
for patients and significantly less 
expensive for the NHS. Without the right 
buildings, however, the plans cannot 
be delivered. The outdated and unfit 
converted residential stock of surgery 
premises must evolve into purpose built 
medical centres, with the capacity and 
the capability to meet the challenges 
the NHS will face in the future.
Given the complex pressures on our 
National Health Service, it is perhaps 
no surprise that the prosaic matter of 
bricks and mortar rarely makes it to the 
top of the policy agenda. However, in the 
past year the importance of improving 
the quality of physical infrastructure has 
been explicitly recognised as being part 
of the solution. 
Local STPs delivered this year set 
out the optimal design for services 
in 44 geographical areas. As ever, 
there is a huge variety in the detail of the 
documents. There is a common thread 
across all the plans that the primary 
care estate will be a crucial enabler 
of what they are trying to deliver. 
The plans highlight the need for a 
significant increase in the primary 
care workforce – with the potential 
scope going significantly beyond 
the recruitment of new GPs. More 
community pharmacists, nurse 
practitioners, physician associates and 
mental health therapists will operate 
from the primary care setting; however, 
if primary care premises do not have 
the capacity to host them, these 
desperately needed boosts to staffing 
levels simply cannot be achieved. 
A larger workforce represents a shift 
into a greater provision of primary care 
at scale. This reflects that larger scale 
practices can more easily manage extra 
services and extended hours, as well as 
potentially delivering greater efficiencies 
in operations and back office functions. 
To this end, there are a number of different 
ways that GPs can work together: 
through formal alliances, federations and 
clusters of merged practices. All models 
of working at scale rely upon larger and 
more modern buildings. 
Yet the level of government investment 
in primary care premises remains at 
historically low levels. The Estates and 
Technology Transformation Fund, 
offering £900 million of much-needed 
investment for both GP premises and 
surgery technology, has not resulted in 
significant progress for buildings. 
Demand for funding far outstrips supply, 
and the pace of projects cannot hope 
to match this demand. We must wait 
to see how much of the pledged 
£325 million of additional capital for 
the most advanced STPs filters through 
to improve primary care estate, and we 
await more detail on NHS England’s 
vision to create 150 urgent treatment 
centres to take the pressure off 
A&E units.
Of course, health policy and health 
economics are extremely complex, so 
we engage regularly with the NHS and 
government to make the case for further 
investment in primary care infrastructure, 
both through our expanding in-house 
capability and through our chairing of the 
British Property Federation’s Healthcare 
Committee. We believe that our model 
offers the best solution to the NHS’s 
capital problem for primary care estate, 
so we work hard to ensure policymakers 
have a clear understanding of the benefits 
it can bring. 
There is no doubt that the policy 
backdrop is more positive than it has 
been for a number of years. However, 
there is a risk that this fails to convert 
into significant investment on the 
ground. In recent years investment 
has dropped to historically low levels 
despite a number of seemingly positive 
central initiatives. 
Outlook
With a general election just a few weeks 
away, all eyes will be on the next steps 
for NHS policy after 8 June. Whatever 
the make-up of Parliament, however, 
the fundamentals for primary care estate 
will remain steadfast: to reduce pressure 
on hospitals, improve access to general 
practice and help the people who rely 
on health services the most to reach them 
closer to home, GP surgery buildings and 
primary care premises must be fit for the 
future. Assura is uniquely placed both to 
deliver and support in this time 
of unprecedented change.
