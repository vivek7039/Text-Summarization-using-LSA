 Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholders,
In my first report as Chairman, I am pleased to say that 2017  
has been a year of considerable progress in delivering the 
strategy whilst improving financial performance. After ten 
months in the business working alongside the management  
team and Non-Executive colleagues, I remain convinced that  
we have the right strategy and the right team to deliver it.
Financially, we have seen good growth in net rental income, 
strong like-for-like rental growth, good sales profits from our 
regulated tenancy portfolio and a significant reduction in our 
operating costs, all of which have helped drive a significant 
increase in adjusted earnings.
While there is real focus in the business on pursuing our PRS 
strategy, I am pleased to say that there has been an equal  
focus on our existing business. By getting to know our customers 
better we have been able to continue to improve the service we 
provide. By looking at every area of our invested portfolio we 
have found potential opportunities to improve performance.  
We have strengthened our governance structures and processes 
to enhance our control environment and prepare the business for 
growth. Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, we have redoubled 
our efforts to ensure our customers and employees are kept safe.
For our PRS business, significant efforts have been made  
to secure further assets and to generate new development 
opportunities for the longer term. While our existing PRS assets 
are performing well, it is securing the opportunities for growth, 
completing them on time and to budget and making them 
operational that will enable us to deliver our strategy. 
As Grainger rapidly transforms into an increasingly customer-
driven organisation, it is clear that its culture and people are key to 
its long-term success. During the course of the year my colleagues 
and I have been able to meet with a large number of the 
dedicated Grainger teams around the country, who have a real 
passion for what they do. Going forward, our focus on delivering 
a culture that has customers at its heart will continue to grow.
During the course of the year there have been some changes to 
the Board. Baroness Margaret Ford stepped down in February 
having served eight years as a Non-Executive Director with the 
last two as Chairman. Nick Jopling, Grainger’s Property Director, 
stepped down in September having been with the Company for 
seven years. Belinda Richards has decided to step down at the 
AGM in 2018 having served over six years on the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. I would like to thank all of them for their 
significant contribution to the success of the Company and wish 
them well for the future. I would also like to welcome Justin Read 
to the Board as a Non-Executive Director who joined at the same 
time as I did in February.
Finally, I am pleased to propose an increase in our final dividend 
to 3.26p per share, bringing the total for the year to 4.86p per 
share, up 8% on the prior year, reflecting the growth in net  
rental income. Looking forward, our goal is simple – to generate 
superior total returns for our shareholders in this exciting new 
growth market, the PRS.
