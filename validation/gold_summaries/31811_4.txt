 Our Discovery Engine
Our suite of combined proprietary technologies forms the core of our state-of-the-art 
Drug Discovery Engine that spans novel target identification and drug molecule design.
Our vision
C4XD is committed to becoming the world’s most productive Drug Discovery Engine, 
supplying the pharmaceutical industry with a sustainable source of commercially attractive 
drug assets. We commit our resources to the early discovery of novel therapeutic targets 
for high value disease areas and generate new drug molecules against these targets rather 
than competing with others by running clinical studies. We are ambitious and aim to produce 
four or more pre-clinical candidates every year once the Company reaches “steady state”. 
Our sustainability will be driven by licensing our assets to the pharmaceutical industry and 
using the revenue generated to drive our engine harder.
We continue to invest in our proprietary suite of drug discovery technologies and our highly experienced and 
uniquely trained scientific team. Combined, we believe this makes us uniquely positioned to achieve our goal.

Taxonomy3
®
 is used to analyse complex “healthy 
versus disease” genetic datasets. It identifies and 
characterises defined patient groups and is able to 
identify previously unknown genetic linkages and 
interactions between genes and biological pathways 
in a broad range of diseases. T axonomy3
®
 fuels our 
drug discovery portfolio by generating novel targets 
in these genetically defined patient sub-groups.
Our pioneering drug design technology comprises 
both Conformetrix and MolPlex. These synergistic 
technologies enable C4XD to enter novel chemical 
space and rapidly gain knowledge about the bioactive 
form required for a successful drug, allowing the 
design of highly potent and selective molecules.
