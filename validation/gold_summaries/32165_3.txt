 8 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017
CHAirmAn’S STATemenT
r eview of the year
This year we have delivered a set of results which demonstrate 
the underlying robustness of our business. Adjusted profit before 
tax has increased by 5% to £60.6 million and profit margins have 
increased to 16.4%. This performance has been delivered despite 
a highly volatile background in global dairy markets. 
In the first half of the year, milk volumes were strong across 
the UK and falling milk and cream prices reflected this. However, 
after two years of pronounced deflation, UK and global dairy 
markets strengthened in the second half of the year as supply fell. 
In this environment, we increased the price we pay our farmers for 
milk by 38% between the summer of 2016 and March 2017. The 
impact on cream prices was even more pronounced and butter 
input costs doubled in the second half of 2016.
Despite this background, we increased profits and delivered 
a strong branded performance, especially across our butters, 
spreads and oils portfolio. Furthermore, 2016/17 saw the start 
of demineralised whey and GOS production at our Davidstow 
creamery. Sales of functional ingredients represent an important 
future growth opportunity for the business. 
Developing brands
Developing brands is at the heart of our business and 2016/17 
saw good progress across our portfolio. Cathedral City, Clover 
and Frylight have each benefited from refreshed packaging during 
the last 12 months and the level of overall marketing activity was 
increased compared to the prior year. We aired two new TV 
advertisements for Cathedral City and Frylight and supported 
a significant programme of consumer-facing and in-store 
advertising, and promotional activity across our key brands.
innovation at the core 
I am delighted that our success in innovation and product 
development was recognised this year. Clover won the spreads 
category ‘Product of the Year 2017’ award in the world’s largest 
consumer survey award for product innovation. This is testimony 
to the work undertaken to remove all artificial ingredients from the 
recipe. Furthermore, in October 2016 Frylight won the Institute of 
Grocery and Distribution ‘Health and Wellness’ award. 
Innovation is critical in order to continue to grow our business 
and 13% of the Group’s revenue in 2016/17 resulted from products 
that are less than three years old. This is well ahead of the 10% 
target we set ourselves. 
Value-added ingredients
We have now completed our investment at our cheese creamery 
at Davidstow, Cornwall. We are producing demineralised whey, 
an added value by-product of the cheese-making process. 
Demineralised whey is the base ingredient for infant formula and 
by March 2017 over 80% of production was meeting the exacting 
standards required for use in infant formula recipes. 
Furthermore, we have also started manufacturing GOS at 
Davidstow. GOS is a prebiotic which is added into premium infant 
formula to help aid digestion and growth in babies. 
Both of these products are being marketed and sold into 
global infant formula manufacturers by our partner, Fonterra. We 
also continue to research other potential applications for GOS in 
both human nutrition and animal feed. In December 2016 Dairy 
Crest announced that it had entered into a research partnership 
with Danisco Animal Nutrition, part of DuPont, to explore further 
the potential uses of GOS in poultry and swine. If successful, this 
work would help to broaden the potential market for GOS beyond 
infant formula.
our culture and values
Our success has been built on our links to the countryside, 
our dairy heritage and the people in our business. From this 
foundation we will grow through a shared passion to create 
exceptional food, loved by every generation.
Dairy Crest remains committed to doing the right thing in the 
way we conduct ourselves and do business. Following the sale of 
the Dairies business, we have refined our corporate responsibility 
agenda into 14 new pledges. These pledges set demanding 
targets across areas such as environmental impact, employee 
safety, diversity and development, delivering to our consumers 
and contributing to the communities in which we operate. We will 
measure ourselves against these pledges and report on progress 
annually.
increased dividend recommended
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 16.3 pence per 
share, making a full year dividend of 22.5 pence per share. In 
line with our progressive dividend policy, this is a 1.9% increase 
on last year. The dividend is covered 1.6 times by adjusted basic 
earnings per share. A key part of our strategy remains to continue 
to increase dividends each year, aiming for a target cover range of 
1.5 to 2.5 times.
Summary
Our performance this year is not only a result of the Group’s long-
term strategy but also a reflection of the significant contribution 
and dedication of all of our employees, for which I would like to 
thank them.
The Board remains confident in the future prospects for Dairy 
Crest. The business has a strong management team who are 
delivering against a clear business strategy of building brands, 
adding value, driving simplicity, generating cash and reducing risk.
