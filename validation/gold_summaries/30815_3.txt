 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In my first full year as Chairman,  
I am very pleased to report that 2017 
saw stability being restored to Essentra 
after a year of challenge and change in 
2016, with our new corporate strategy 
being unveiled by Chief Executive, Paul 
Forman, at the time of our HY 2017 
results. The Board was extensively 
engaged in the strategy review process 
and fully supports the future direction 
set out by Paul, which provides the 
roadmap for future sustainable growth 
across the Group based on the highest 
standards of business ethics and best 
practice governance.
Board composition
As previously reported, Paul Forman joined 
the Board as Chief Executive with effect 
from 1 January 2017 . Paul’s proven track 
record of international experience at  
senior level – in particular in strategy and 
acquisitions – has already shown itself to  
be extremely relevant and beneficial in 
restoring widespread stability to Essentra. 
Paul has provided a clear and data-driven 
strategy which he and his team have 
developed and communicated, which will 
deliver sustainable, long-term shareholder 
value, excellent customer service and a 
motivated and engaged workforce.
In July, as the result of a robust selection 
process led by the Nomination 
Committee, my colleagues and I were 
delighted to welcome Mary Reilly and Ralf  
K. Wunderlich to the Board as independent 
Non-Executive Directors, both of whom 
have extensive international experience 
across a wide range of industries. Mary 
was a Partner at Deloitte LLP for more 
than 20 years and has served on a number 
of Boards in a non-executive capacity 
since 2000, while Ralf – who is currently 
based in Singapore – has an extensive 
knowledge of the packaging industry,  
and has lived and worked across 
three continents. 
Separately, in December, Terry Twigger 
advised the Board that he will be retiring 
as a Director and from his current roles  
as Senior Independent Director (“SID”)  
and Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
following the Company’s 2018 Annual 
General Meting (“AGM”). Terry joined 
Essentra as a Non-Executive Director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee in 
2009, and was subsequently appointed as 
SID in 2014. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank Terry for his dedication and 
significant commitment to Essentra during 
his nine-year tenure. He has been unfailing 
in his support and guidance throughout, 
and I and my fellow Board members will 
miss both his financial insight and wise 
counsel. We wish him all the very best  
for a long and healthy retirement.
My Board colleagues and I are very pleased 
that Tommy Breen, who joined the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director in 2015, will 
assume the role of SID following the 2018 
AGM and will bring significant experience 
to the position. Replacing Terry as our new 
Audit Committee Chair will be Mary Reilly. 
With her extensive accounting, finance 
and international management 
background, we have no doubt that Mary 
will prove an excellent successor to Terry 
and build further on the important work  
of the Committee which he led with 
considerable skill and expertise. I would  
like to wish both Tommy and Mary every 
success in their new roles. 
As previously advised, Peter Hill and Colin 
Day retired from the Board following the 
Company’s 2017 AGM.
Strategic review
While there was significant focus on 
stabilising the Company during 2017 – not 
least those handful of manufacturing sites 
where we have previously experienced 
operational issues – at the same time,  
we simultaneously developed a clear  
and objective assessment of the various 
businesses within the Essentra organisation 
together with their future potential. We 
have only just started upon this path, but 
the review has confirmed that Essentra is  
a fundamentally strong organisation with 
many positive features to build upon. 
Such a detailed evaluation of any business 
potentially results in tough decisions.  
This was indeed the case with our folding 
cartons site in Newport where, having  
given a number of strategic options careful 
consideration, the Board regrettably 
concluded that the proposal to close the 
facility was the most appropriate route 
given that it was not anticipated to make 
a realistic improvement to profitability in 
the near, or even long, term. The decision 
was in no way a reflection on the quality  
or dedication of our employees there, and  
my fellow Board colleagues and I would  
like to acknowledge the supportive and 
professional way in which they engaged  
in the consultation process.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT In conjunction with the strategic review,  
the Board evaluated the appropriate 
deployment of capital in the business – 
including the amount which is returned  
to shareholders by way of dividends.  
While our financial Key Performance 
Indicators will focus on all value drivers, 
further to the strategy review there is  
a clear and increased emphasis on cash 
generation and returns. These financial  
and capital allocation priorities have been 
aligned to new metrics for both short  
and long-term management incentives, 
upon which we have already consulted  
with shareholders and are subject to 
approval at the 2018 AGM.
People and culture
Change for the better is still change, which 
can be disconcerting for those involved. 
Accordingly, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees for their 
continued commitment to building a better 
Essentra together. We are proud of our 
international presence in 33 countries and 
we recognise the vital contribution which 
our people make. Indeed, during the course 
of the year, I had the pleasure of visiting  
a number of our facilities – from our head 
offices in Milton Keynes, UK and Chicago, 
US and our Health & Personal Care 
Packaging sites in Portsmouth, UK and 
Charlotte, US, to our Components 
European manufacturing hub in Kidlington, 
UK and our Filter Products joint venture in 
Dubai – and can testify to the skill, passion 
and hard work of our employees. In 
particular, my fellow Board members and  
I would like to pay tribute and give our 
sincere thanks to our 345 colleagues in 
Puerto Rico who, in the face of significant 
personal challenge following hurricane 
Maria, have shown incredible fortitude  
and dedication in attending work and 
supporting our customers, many of whom 
were facing similar hurricane-related issues.
Separately, I attended the leadership 
conference in June, during which the 
output of the strategic review was 
discussed at length with approximately  
100 of our senior management team.  
The lively debate and contribution over the 
three-day offsite was hugely encouraging, 
as was the positive energy for change.
Consistent with Paul and the senior 
management team, the Board is 
committed to making Essentra a great 
place to work, where talent can thrive. We 
therefore whole-heartedly support his focus 
on building employee engagement and, in 
particular, on his priority of creating a safe, 
respectful and diverse environment for our 
people. While we are coming from a low 
base in certain aspects of morale and 
motivation following a challenging 2016,  
my Board colleagues and I are nevertheless 
encouraged by the improvement in 
engagement which has been reported in 
our 2017 surveys, and the focus which is 
being given to following up and implementing 
post-survey action plans in a timely manner .
The Board is committed to achieving  
and maintaining the highest standards  
of occupational health and safety and 
environmental protection, as well as 
making Essentra an exemplary workplace 
with regard to diversity and inclusion. Each 
Board member is required to visit one of the 
Essentra sites each year and to undertake a 
health and safety “walk” around the site to 
focus on these important matters. The 
Board thus fully endorses the priority which 
these critical workplace practices are now 
being given under Paul’s stewardship, which 
is expanded upon in the Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 10 to 17 .
A stronger company
Last year saw substantial change at 
Essentra, and restoring the Company  
to sustainable, profitable growth will take 
time. However, while there is much still  
to do, we made significant progress  
and widespread improvement during  
2017 so we are already well underway.
