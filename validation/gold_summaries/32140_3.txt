Solid platform  
for the future
Overview 
I am pleased to report that the actions 
undertaken by management have 
enabled us to report substantially 
improved results; revenue and profits 
have increased, the hire fleet has been 
reduced, utilisation rates increased, and 
net debt
1
 has fallen significantly. The 
business has been stabilised and we have 
created a solid platform for the future.
Having previously identified the 
underlying issues that had affected 
the Group’s performance last year, 
management has improved engineering 
efficiency, addressed equipment 
availability, structured the sales force  
to ensure that we address large and SME 
customers alike, embedded ownership 
and accountability at a regional level, 
and invested in upgrades to our IT and 
management information systems; all 
of which have led to improved business 
performance.
Customer focussed initiatives were 
launched to improve responsiveness 
and service levels, including customer 
surveys, and these have also made 
a major contribution to our strong 
performance.
 “ 
I am pleased to report that the 
actions undertaken by management 
have enabled us to report 
substantially improved results.”

Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 05
Results overview
Revenue increased to £369.4m (2016: 
£329.1m), following actions to better 
address the SME market and improve  
non-hire revenues. Overhead costs have 
been tightly controlled with further 
savings realised during the year, partially 
offset by bonuses payable due to the 
good results. 
The hire fleet reduced by 11.4% to 
£194.8m as a result of targeted disposals 
and improved asset utilisation, whilst  
net debt
1
 fell significantly to £71.4m 
(2016: £102.6m). Return on capital 
employed
2
, a key measure, increased  
by 140.6% to 7.7%; excluding disposals 
ROCE
2
 was 8.4% (2016: 3.0%). The 
Group has a strong balance sheet, and 
substantial headroom with which to  
grow organically or through targeted 
value enhancing acquisitions in order  
to strengthen our market position.
Acquisition
On 19 December 2016 we announced 
the acquisition of the brand, business 
and assets of Lloyds British Testing 
Limited (‘Lloyds British’) from the 
Administrator, PwC. Lloyds British is a 
specialist business, which carries out 
testing, certification, and inspection 
of lifting equipment, and training from 
locations across the United Kingdom. 
The acquisition cost of £3.8m was paid in 
cash in full on completion; the business 
is now fully integrated and is enhancing 
Speedy’s overall offering in the specialist 
lifting market.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 0.67 pence per share, an 
increase of 67.5%. If approved at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting  
the total dividend for the year would be 
1.00 pence per share (2016: 0.70 pence). 
The dividend will be paid on 11 August 
2017 to shareholders on the register  
at close of business on 7 July 2017.
Board 
David Shearer joined the Board as a  
Non-Executive Director on 9 September 
2016 and was subsequently appointed  
to the Audit and Nomination Committees. 
On 31 March 2017 David was appointed 
to the Remuneration Committee. I 
reverted to Non-Executive Chairman on 
30 September 2016, and in accordance 
with best practice stepped down from 
both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees on 31 March 2017. We have 
a strong Board, combining a wealth of 
industry and operational expertise with 
which to take the business forward.

Summary
The business has responded well to the 
actions undertaken, and I am pleased 
that the hard work by all our colleagues 
throughout the year has been reflected  
in these results. 
We have substantially improved our 
efficiency and ROCE
2
 this year and  
I am confident we can deliver further 
profitable growth.
