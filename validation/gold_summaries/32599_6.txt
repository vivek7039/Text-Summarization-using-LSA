Management has focused on reducing 
vacancy rates and optimising territory 
sizes during the year, rather than 
increasing absolute agency numbers.

A Modern Lens on a Traditional Business
E-loans for the Online Customer
The core business of Morses Club PLC is 
Home Collected Credit (HCC). However, 
our growth strategy incorporates a plan 
to broaden our products and services. 
Morses Club launched Dot Dot Loans – 
an online instalment loan product – in 
March 2017 . The operational model and 
target demographic are fundamentally 
different from the HCC product. Every 
loan is applied for and approved online, 
and repayments are collected from the 
customer’s bank account, on an agreed 
date each month.
Dot Dot Loans typically targets C1/C2/D 
profile customers with a moderate but 
steady income. We anticipate that the 
two products will see only a small overlap 
of customers.
The new brand website is mobile-
responsive, designed to meet the needs 
of this different set of consumers who 
may have access to a wider range of 
financial options, and who expect fast, 
easily-accessible products. 
Why an e-loan?
HCC customers make up approximately 
30% of the 10 million people in the 
non-standard credit market. Dot Dot 
Loans helps us to access the remaining 
eight million UK consumers who want 
online instalment credit. By adding 
brands to the Morses Club product 
portfolio, we are strengthening our 
brand presence. 
Why Dot Dot Loans?
We based the e-loan product branding 
on the results of consumer research 
conducted in August 2016.
1
 Dot Dot 
Loans speaks to consumers in a clear 
and friendly manner, giving all the facts 
without lots of financial jargon. The 
brand differentiates itself from its 
competitors and will have the same 
focus on responsible lending, good 
customer outcomes and treating 
customers fairly as Morses Club.
