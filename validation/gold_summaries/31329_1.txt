 Overview
The clear focus in 2017 was to navigate 
our Group towards becoming the highest 
quality provider of specialist education and 
behavioural health services for children and 
young people. To that end, I am pleased to 
report that we made significant progress 
across the following key objectives:
• Maintained focus on quality.
• Completed the Transitional Services 
Agreement (TSA) with Cygnet in June 
2017, allowing us to focus purely on  
our Children’s Services business.
• Began right-sizing our cost base to  
align our business with its sole focus  
on Children’s Services. We continue to 
identify further operational efficiencies.
• Strengthened our executive  
management team.
• Identified four detailed execution 
components to deliver our medium-term 
plan alongside KPIs against which to  
be measured.
Business performance
During what has been a year of significant 
change following the sale of the Adult 
Services business I am pleased to report 
that the underlying business has performed 
in line with our expectations. This is a huge 
credit to all the teams across the Group. 
At the same time, we are proud to have 
improved the lives of the children in our care 
with 80% of our services rated “Good” or 
“Outstanding” with our regulators at year 
end (2016: 83%).
Revenue increased by 8% to £196.0 million 
(2016: £182.1 million) including £2.4 million 
one-off other income during the period from 
the TSA. Underlying growth in revenue was 
6% driven by an increase in average fee 
levels, which reflected a planned shift to 
focusing on higher severity services. 
Focus on 
execution
Cambian Group is now focused  
on being a market leading provider  
of specialist children’s services.”

Chief Executive’s strategic review
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 15%, 
to £18.7 million (2016: £16.2 million) with 
adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.5% (2016: 
8.9%) reflecting the growth in revenue as 
well as cost savings made in our head 
office functions. These positives were offset 
by one-off impacts resulting from the sale of 
the Adult Services business and a provision 
made for changes to legislation regarding 
staff “sleep-ins” at our facilities.
Operating profit before exceptional  
items was £2.4 million (2016: £0.2 million 
loss) with a statutory operating loss of  
£8.8 million (2016: £7.6 million loss). The 
loss from discontinued operations following 
the sale of the Adult Services business was  
£3.6 million (2016: £155.0 million profit).
Average occupancy was broadly level 
at 1,286 places (2016: 1,294) with an 
underlying transition towards higher severity 
cases during the year. Average utilisation 
increased to 78% (2016: 74%) following a 
planned reduction in operational capacity  
to 1,643 (2016: 1,744).
Average occupancy in the fostering division 
was 634 (2016: 645) with 649 placements  
at the end of the year. 
Creating a strong Children’s  
Services platform
The completion of the TSA allowed us to 
focus on reducing our central costs to align 
our business with its new scale and focus 
on Children’s Services with an efficient 
overhead structure. We reduced our cost 
base in the second half of the year and are 
continuing to identify further operational 
efficiencies that will be delivered during 
2018 and 2019.
During the period, I am pleased to report 
that we have significantly strengthened 
our management team to ensure we 
are able to execute on our strategy. Our 
key appointments include the following 
experienced leaders:
• Anoop Kang, formerly at Kier Group and 
Balfour Beatty, joined us as CFO.
• Rob Walker, previously at Mencap, joined 
us as People Director.
• Dr Sharon Menghini, formerly Director of 
Children’s Services at a number of local 
authorities, joined us as Quality Director.
• Tommy McDonald-Milner, previously 
Chief Executive of Minerva Education and 
Options Group, joined us as Managing 
Director of Special Educational Needs.
• Lynn Webb, formerly Chief Operating 
Officer at Foster Care Associates, joined 
us as Managing Director of Fostering.
I am delighted to reiterate the strategic 
intent for the Group, announced in January 
2018, which outlines our ambition over the 
medium-term:
• Highest quality – aligned to our vision 
to be the highest quality provider of 
specialist education and behavioural 
health services to children and young 
people in the UK.
• Focus on higher severity children –  
a continuation of the strategy that we 
started in 2016. We currently hold a 
market leading position with consistent 
and robust demand for our services. 
Average fee levels are higher than the 
industry average and commensurate  
with the higher severity needs of our 
children and young people.
• Building a platform to change lives  
and create value – consisting of the 
following factors: 
 – a specialist focus on higher  
severity children;
 – established quality and safeguarding 
protocols;
 – the in-house skills and expertise 
necessary to operate the platform;
 – defined models for care and  
therapeutic intervention;
 – real time data and measurable 
outcomes for the children we look after;
 – value for money for the customers who 
refer children to us;
 – a defined strategy for recruitment, 
training and development;
 – a national footprint;
 – fully operational real estate and sales 
and marketing functions;
 – a strong brand backed by a culture  
of innovation;
 – robust business information and 
systems; and
 – a strong balance sheet.
We also defined our aspirations for the 
Group by outlining our medium-term 
KPIs. Our ambition is to increase revenue 
by a compound annual growth rate of 
more than 5% with an adjusted EBITDA 
margin in excess of 16%. We have also 
set targets to increase our average scores 
with our regulators to over 85% “Good” or 
“Outstanding”, increase occupancy levels to 
more than 85% and to continue to increase 
our average daily fee through re-positioning 
to higher severity services.
Our capital expenditure plan targets 
investment of £50 million on growth and 
capacity increases, £15 million to £20 
million to enhance and upgrade our existing 
facilities and £15 million to £20 million on 
systems and IT investment by 2020. Our 
ambition is to deliver a return on capital 
employed on new projects in excess of 20% 
and over 85% operating cash conversion.
This plan is targeted while maintaining a 
strong balance sheet, net debt to adjusted 
EBITDA of less than 1.5x and a progressive 
dividend policy backed by consistent  
EPS growth.

We have defined four components to execute our strategy. 
Build the industry’s  
best leadership  
and workforce
Drive capacity  
led growth
Put in enabling  
systems and data 
Optimise cost  
and operations 
We will continue to build our leadership 
teams, ensuring we have the right 
people in place across the Group to 
manage our facilities and also mentor 
and develop all Cambian staff to ensure 
high quality standards of care. This 
will require investment in training and 
quality assurance. We will strengthen our 
procedures and recruitment resources to 
build a leading workforce capacity with 
highly qualified and experienced staff 
running our teams across the Group. 
We will also focus on our employee 
engagement, producing measurable 
improvements in their engagement in the 
business with the aim of reducing staff 
turnover to less than 20%, minimising 
reliance on agency staff to less than 3% of 
our total employee cost and improving our 
employee net promoter score to +45%.

Finally, we will deploy £15 million to 
£20 million over the next three years to 
enhance and upgrade existing facilities 
as we improve the environments of those 
in our care as well as completing the 
re-positioning of our facilities to higher 
severity services. We shall also begin a 
measured return to increasing capacity by 
developing new facilities organically, using 
our experienced in-house property team,  
 
as well as continuing to evaluate targeted 
bolt-on acquisitions as we begin to  
deploy £50 million with a targeted return 
on capital employed in excess of 20%. 
These investments combined have led us 
to a comprehensive plan for investing  
£85 million in capital expenditure by 2020.

As important to the future will be the need 
to capture high quality data – not only 
to monitor both the performance and 
development of our staff, and to manage 
the performance of our business, but also 
to give high quality clinical evidence of the 
quality of the outcomes that we offer our 
children. We will invest over the next three 
years in integrated systems and IT that  
 
will allow us to achieve these important, 
and differentiating, back and front office 
capabilities across finance, HR and IT as 
well as the therapeutic interventions and 
outcomes of our service users.

We will continue to optimise our cost base 
and identify further operational efficiencies 
across the Group. In addition, we will 
maintain our relentless focus on the 
quality of service delivery across the Group 
and industry leading regulatory scores.

Execution components and 2018
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 Quality and regulatory
Our aim is to be the highest quality  
provider of specialist education and 
behavioural health services for our  
children and young people.
At year end 80% of our services were  
rated “Good” or “Outstanding” with Ofsted 
or the Care Quality Commission (CQC) 
(2016: 83%). This performance is against 
a backdrop of the continued raising of 
quality standards in the sector reflected 
in an increasingly stringent regulatory 
environment and an enhanced rigour of 
inspections. We welcome this evolution in 
the drive to improve the focus on quality 
of care and appropriate outcomes for our 
children. Our success in achieving our 
targeted regulatory ratings, and occupancy 
levels, is directly aligned to our ambition 
of building the industry’s best leadership 
and workforce over the medium-term. 
This journey may not be linear, with some 
areas of outstanding practice and others 
where additional focus may be required. 
The percentage of our facilities rated “Good” 
and “Outstanding” may fluctuate in the 
short-term as we continue to re-position to 
higher severity and improve the capability  
of our workforce. 
Our independent Quality and Safeguarding 
Committee, chaired by Dr. Graham Rich, 
provides rigorous oversight of our regulatory 
and safeguarding performance and has 
been strengthened by the appointment of 
Dr Sharon Menghini as Director of Quality.
We are continually examining ways in 
which we can improve our standards of 
care and are investing significantly in better 
selection, training and induction of staff. 
It was therefore particularly disappointing 
that Cambian was featured in a current 
affairs television programme broadcast in 
December 2017, which included undercover 
video footage taken, without notice or 
permission, at a number of care facilities 
managed by independent providers; three 
of which are operated by Cambian. Since 
then, we have identified areas where we 
believe we can improve our service and 
discussed these in detail with our regulator, 
Ofsted, prior to implementing them.
Summary and outlook
2018 will be a year of consolidation and we 
will continue to invest in the systems and 
support for our staff necessary to deliver on 
our plans to return, in a measured fashion, 
to capacity led growth.
The year has started broadly in line with the 
Board’s expectations taking into account 
the temporary setback following the current 
affairs television programme, in December 
2017, and further investment in quality and 
workforce capability. Our focus this year 
is to continue to improve quality whilst re-
positioning services to higher severity with 
corresponding fee increases.
We remain confident for the medium-
term outlook and the Group’s longer-term 
potential, while in the short-term we expect 
to continue to make progress in 2018 and 
look forward to the future with confidence.
