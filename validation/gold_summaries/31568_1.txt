 Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
12 – 13
OVERVIEW
FY2017 was a year of global growth and growing 
commercial momentum. We have seen significant increases 
in our revenues, customer numbers, geographic coverage 
and in our skilled developer base. Alongside this, we have 
doubled our employee base and opened 3 new offices 
globally. We have also seen significant growth in industry 
recognition of the RPA sector, and strong, global 
endorsement of Blue Prism’s leading position in the market. 
As our business has developed, so has the market we 
serve. The RPA market is now advancing beyond the 
early hype stage and our indirect partner channel 
continues to grow and diversify in recognition of this 
shift. This channel was responsible for sourcing all new 
customers in FY2017 and there was a healthy number of 
upsells given that two thirds of our customer base joined 
the roster in FY2017. In addition, all 21 expected 
renewals in the year were secured.
We are pleased to report that total recognised revenue 
for the year ended 31 October 2017 increased by 155 per 
cent to £24.5m (FY2016: £9.6m) driven by sales from 
both new and existing customers. Sales momentum built 
throughout the year such that our exit run-rate (monthly 
recognised, recurring licence revenue) stood on  
31 October 2017 at £2.8m per month (FY2016: £0.95m  
per month): a strong foundation for FY2018 and beyond.
EBITDA losses for the period were £9.4m (FY2016: £5.2m) 
and adjusted EBITDA losses for the period were £8.3m 
(FY2016: £4.7m), being EBITDA before share-based 
payments, foreign exchange gains/(losses) and IPO costs 
(FY2016), to remove the effect of volatile share-based 
payments expenses , foreign exchange gains/(losses)and 
one off IPO costs, both representing continued 
investment in our global expansion. Cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 October 2017 were £16.3m 
(31 October 2016: £11.8m).

EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY
The Group set out a growth strategy at the time of its 
IPO based on 4 strategic objectives. During the past  
12 months we have continued to make meaningful 
progress against each, as follows:
BUILDING SCALABLE DEVELOPMENT, SALES  
AND DELIVERY CHANNELS
Blue Prism’s sales strategy is to achieve broad and scalable 
sales growth through a global channel of distribution 
partners. This partner sales channel includes a wide  
range of highly engaged partners, comprising some of 
the world’s largest consulting firms such as Accenture,  
EY, IBM, KPMG, Deloitte and HCL as well as specialist 
technology and digital transformation firms, such as 
Thoughtonomy, DXC, RPAi, Symphony and Reveal Group. 
All of the 324 new customers in FY2017 were sourced 
through the channel for the first time (FY2016: 90 per 
cent), including an increase in reseller deals.
The Group launched a partner certification programme 
during the period, designed to maintain the highest levels 
of quality assurance in our sales and delivery model.  
11 partners are now certified and, in March 2017, EY 
became the first partner to achieve Gold status, followed 
later in the year by Accenture. As interest in RPA 
continues to increase, our focus remains to ensure the 
Group is best equipped to service increasing demand by 
maximising and optimising this partner distribution 
channel.
The Group has seen strong levels of industry recognition 
and community support, as evidenced by the scale of 
attendance and quality of sponsors at our Blue Prism 
World events. Almost 2,000 customers and partners 
attended events in San Francisco, New York, London, 
Tokyo and Sydney. With premium sponsors including 
Accenture, EY, Deloitte, KPMG, IBM, and Capgemini, we 
go into 2018 with the confidence of having leading names 
in the sectors we serve supporting our long-term vision.

INCREASING BUSINESS WITH THE 
GROUP’S CUSTOMERS
During the first 6 months of the year, the Group 
introduced an account management function to help 
improve the effectiveness of customer management 
following the initial sale. This has proven effective in 
driving increased adoption in the legacy direct accounts. 
We have been working on rolling this out into the 
indirect model with early signs of success. In FY2017 the 
Group secured 264 upsells across 131 customers, a 
meaningful increase on the 81 upsells secured across  
47 customers in the prior financial year. 49 of the 131 
customers who upsold during the period upsold more 
than once with approximately 27 per cent of all 
customers buying more licences in the period. Renewals 
of existing licences also continue to be healthy with all  
21 of those due in the period secured (FY2016: 12). 
These increasing levels of adoption are a result of our 
customers’ engagement with RPA and the subsequent 
return on investment they see from increased use of our 
software.
The Financial Services sector is one of many realising real 
benefits from RPA. For example, a leading Middle East 
retail bank is using Blue Prism software robots to process 
over 15,000 transactions daily, bringing greater 
operational efficiency, accuracy and speed along with a 
70 per cent reduction in fraud. Elsewhere in the sector, 
within the first 12 months of its Blue Prism deployment, 
BNY Mellon rolled out 222 robots in 35 of its different 
businesses, spanning 147 different business functions. 
Turnaround time has been reduced by an average of 62 
per cent, including reducing one particular process from 
10 days to 24 hours while also improving error rates.
Blue Prism RPA has also delivered significant business 
benefits, within just 6 months of deployment, to a 
leading Fortune 500 financial services provider in the  
US – with over $3tn of life insurance in force worldwide. 
Blue Prism’s software robots were deployed to support 
an enterprise-wide programme of strategic revenue 
growth, which needed to be deployable at speed and 
across all its subsidiary businesses and functional areas. 
Using Blue Prism enabled the organisation to improve 
customer experience and reduce costs by eliminating an 
onerous, lengthy re-underwriting backlog. It took just 
10 months to put the robotic operating model in place, 
and since deployment Blue Prism RPA has resulted in a 
$500,000 one-time cost avoidance and delivered more 
than $3m savings from run rate cost reductions annually.
In addition to process automation, the value of Blue 
Prism’s RPA can be realised in its positive impact on 
customer experience. A leading global payments services 
provider – which in 2016 completed 791m transactions 
for its consumer and business clients – needed to 
improve customer experience whilst expanding 
automation capabilities throughout the organisation. 
Automating more than 15 processes to date, Blue Prism 
delivered end-to-end automation of financial 
transactions whilst enabling the Company to maintain 
full regulatory compliance, and with seamless 
integration with existing infrastructure. It took only half 
a year to see the returns on investment of using Blue 
Prism RPA, with $1.3m worth of savings generated in the 
first 6 months, resulting in a 3.6 times return on the 
investment in the RPA programme. Employee 
satisfaction and productivity also increased with 12 FTEs 
reassigned to more cognitive, value-added tasks, as 
employee attrition reduced due to the elimination of 
repetitive and non-value added work.
Similarly, the advantage of Blue Prism’s RPA technology 
can be seen in the scale of impact delivered, and value 
generated, for a major player in the retail sector. Shop 
Direct, one of the UK’s largest pure-play digital retailers, 
has automated approximately 130 processes to date 
using Blue Prism and continues to return 328,000 hours 
annually (and rising) back to its business. As a result,  
the Company was also able to generate £16m in 
incremental revenue from just one single process.
It is also possible to combine the operational benefits of 
RPA with social benefits. At Lighthouse Works in Florida  
– a not-for-profit social enterprise which exists to support 
people in living, learning and earning with vision loss – 
Blue Prism software robots are helping employees 
complete tasks such as scheduling, billing and claims 
processing, thereby expanding the scope of jobs that 
visually challenged workers can complete. After deploying 
Blue Prism’s RPA, blind workers could complete tasks in 
their entirety 4 to 6 times faster and 3 times more 
efficiently than before, for an estimated cost saving of 
nearly 65 per cent.
The breadth of RPA use cases is phenomenal with Blue 
Prism software already in use across more than 40 
industry sectors. It is hard to imagine an industry that 
could not benefit from RPA. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

EXECUTING ON THE GROUP’S US 
MARKET STRATEGY
The Group has continued to invest in the US which is a 
market of strategic importance. We are pleased to report 
that Blue Prism has grown its US customer base by 419  
per cent over the last financial year and the Americas 
operations now accounts for 36 per cent of Group revenues 
(FY2016: 28 per cent). In absolute terms, the Group’s US 
customer base has advanced from 26 customers at the end 
of FY2016 to 135 (or 28 per cent of total customers) at the 
end of FY2017 (FY2016: c.17 per cent). US customers include 
BNY Mellon, Western Union, Pfizer, AIG, Fannie Mae, 
Walgreens and IBM.
Investment in people is the most important part of our 
expansion plans and, during the financial year, the 
Group grew US employees by 150 per cent to 65 (FY2016: 
26). This team now represents c.35 per cent of the 
Group’s total global employee base.
The Group will continue to invest in the US so it can meet 
the growing demand for RPA in what remains the world’s 
largest and most important software market. Against this 
backdrop, we are encouraged by progress in the Group’s 
home EMEA market and emerging APAC market. In FY2017 
the Group’s APAC customer count grew from 3 at the close 
of FY2016 to 52 at the close of FY2017, with a recognised 
revenue contribution of £2.2m.

REINFORCING THE GROUP’S MARKET LEADERSHIP 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RPA ADOPTION
The launch of Version 6, billed as the “Operating 
System” edition of our software, has helped to build on 
Blue Prism’s profile as a thought leader in the RPA 
market. This latest release of our software is designed 
with the specific requirements of enterprise level 
deployment as an execution platform, or “operating 
system”, supporting the digital enterprise.
During the year, advances have been made with our 
Technology Alliance Program (“TAP"). Originally 
designed with the architectural objective of positioning 
Blue Prism as the de-facto “operating system” for digital 
workforce deployments, the programme has enjoyed an 
encouraging reception from customers, partners and 
commentators. We have already announced TAP 
collaborations with partners including Microsoft, 
Appian, Captricity, and IBM. 
We believe that the TAP offers Blue Prism the potential 
to find new revenue streams. For example, Appian 
offers Blue Prism as an extension to its low code 
application development and BPM platform and extends 
its automation footprint. FY2018 will see us invest in 
further commercialisation and extension of the 
Technology Alliance Program.
Skills shortages can, as with any early market, hold back 
customer adoption. In FY2017, the Group established a 
formal Education Services department to bring customer 
and partner education under one roof. This has resulted 
in a 389 per cent increase in accredited Blue Prism 
developers to 3,096, a 408 per cent increase in (now 
outsourced) accreditation exams to 4,176 across 44 
countries, and the introduction of new accredited roles 
to align with our ROM delivery framework and 
methodology.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Customer and sales growth 
The 609 software licence deals secured during the 12 
months ended 31 October 2017 equates to more than 3 
times the number of software licence deals won in the prior 
year.
Software licence deals FY2017 FY2016
New 324 96
Renewals 21 12
Upsells 264 81
Total 609 189
We experienced impressive growth in the number of new 
customers: two thirds of our current customer base 
signed-up to Blue Prism in the period bringing the total 
to 477. Given that most customers buy on a “land and 
expand” strategy, this represents a meaningful sales 
opportunity for us over the medium term providing we 
can continue to ensure that customers get real value 
from their use of the software.
Existing customers also continued to increase their 
adoption of our product at a healthy rate. 264 upsells 
were secured across 131 customers in FY2017, 
representing a 225 per cent increase on FY2016. All 
renewals that were due in the period were achieved.
It is increasingly apparent that customer success is more 
likely when customers, supported by our partners, adopt 
Blue Prism’s Robotic Operating Model (“ROM"). The ROM 
is a best practise delivery framework and methodology 
designed to provide assurance and light touch governance 
to maximise business benefits whilst meeting security, 
scalability and compliance objectives. We promote the 
ROM vigorously and have created a full partner 
enablement programme so that our partners may 
integrate it into their wider methodologies. Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Employees
As at 31 October 2017, Blue Prism had 187 employees 
worldwide, compared to 86 at the end of FY2016 and 127 
at the end of H117. Whilst this level of growth inevitably 
places challenges on the Company, the management team 
has worked hard to build new organisational 
infrastructure. In particular, we have strengthened the 
management team with key appointments including Shail 
Khiyara, Chief Marketing Officer; Pat Geary who stepped 
into the newly-created role of Chief Evangelist; and Nicola 
Bergstrom who joined Blue Prism to lead Human 
Resources. We also implemented a new, scalable, 
accounting platform and invested in a corporate 
development team to co-ordinate and build the people, 
systems and processes needed for a larger organisation. 
Having made extensive use of our own robots in product 
development, we are now starting to scale their use into 
other parts of the business for flexibility, accuracy  
and efficiency.
Our Public Company status and employee share ownership 
schemes are enabling us to attract high quality talent. We 
will continue to invest in people to support our growth 
plans, and in systems and processes to provide an 
organisational platform for the next phase of 
Blue Prism’s growth.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
This has been a successful year for Blue Prism. Our 
product and the global partner sales channel built to 
commercialise it have delivered real sales momentum, 
strengthening our market position and underpinning 
our belief in our long-term potential. In FY2018, the 
focus remains on addressing the global demand for RPA 
software through our indirect go to market model with 
particular investment in geographical expansion and  
in our Technology Alliance Program.
The Group has had a strong start to the first quarter  
of FY2018 and as such now expect revenues for the full 
financial year to be comfortably ahead of existing 
market expectations. Funded by the anticipated net 
proceeds of the placing we have announced today, the 
additional investment planned for FY2018 to support 
our global growth is expected to increase our revenue 
growth in the next financial year. The 2018 financial year 
shows every sign of being yet another exciting year of 
growth for Blue Prism.
