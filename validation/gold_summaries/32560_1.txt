Introduction
I am pleased with the progress made 
this year, as we continue to build on our 
position as an agile, online fashion retailer. 
Ladieswear was a particular highlight, 
delivering the best performance for 
almost a decade as we gained significant 
market share. This was the result of 
changes made to design, buying, 
merchandising and sourcing over the 
past few years. 
We continue to place customers at the 
heart of everything we do. During the 
year we further improved our delivery 
proposition, maintained our assertive 
price positioning and continued focus on 
customer loyalty. I am pleased to report 
that our work paid off, with our customer 
satisfaction score increasing further to 
86.4%, the second highest customer 
satisfaction score in the UK retail sector. 
We have a clear focus on our three fashion 
Power Brands – JD Williams, Simply Be 
and Jacamo – and revenue here increased 
by 6.3%, a good performance. We also

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
18
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 successfully turned around the 
performance of our Traditional segment 
during the year, with revenue down in 
the first half but growing in the second.
Our online metrics remain strong, with 
new customers coming to us online 
exceeding 75% for the first time. 
71% of our traffic now comes from a 
mobile device. Within this, smartphone 
sessions – the device of choice for UK 
consumers today – increased by 49% 
to account for 46% of all traffic. 
Our performance in FY17 overall was in line 
with expectations. Spring Summer 2016 
started poorly across the sector, but we 
improved performance as we progressed 
through the first half. The second half was 
stronger, with a good Autumn Winter 
season and two record-breaking weeks 
for the business over Cyber fortnight. This 
trend is visible in our profit performance, 
with Adjusted PBT down 19 .8% in the first 
half and flat in the second.
Our size and age agnostic attitude, our 
dedication to continuous improvement 
in the customer experience and our 
relentless focus on helping our customers 
look and feel amazing through our trusted 
family of fashion brands all put us in a 
strong position. We look to the future 
with confidence.

We are pleased with the progress we 
have made on our systems programme. 
To date, we have successfully introduced 
a new finance system, our new 
Merchandise system, Cybersource and 
PowerCurve, both important parts of 
our Credit release, our Simply Be Euro 
foundation site and, most recently, 
our new USA website. 
The next release, which represents a 
major milestone in the programme, will 
be the High & Mighty website, which 
remains on track to replatform to Hybris 
in May. This release will also include the 
first go-live of our new Financial Services 
system. This sees a significant amount of 
core technical functionality delivered.
In line with the agile approach to running 
IT projects, we have then made an 
adaptation to the rollout plan compared 
to that previously communicated. 
Following the High & Mighty go-live we 
have now decided that Fashion World 
will be migrated onto the new systems 
after peak trading 2017 . Crucially, the 
pace of our development will be 
unchanged, and new releases will be 
added to the High & Mighty and USA 
sites on a monthly basis. 
The benefits of this approach are that:
• It significantly reduces the commercial 
risks, as new technology developments 
going forward will all be tested in a live 
environment, including through peak 
trading, before the major brands 
are migrated
• It minimises the time we will be 
operating at scale in two different 
technology worlds
We plan to migrate all brands onto the 
new platform by the end of Summer 
2018, as previously guided. The overall 
programme costs and benefits, and 
the timing of those benefits, are 
all unchanged. 
Future opportunities
International
We launched our new USA site in 
September. Through a series of 
post-launch releases we have now 
delivered the enhanced experience 
scoped for our customers, which gives 
us the foundations for our future 
international expansion. We recently 
announced the appointment of our 
first International Director, who will 
help us make the most of our significant 
growth opportunity, both in the 
USA and in other geographies.
Brand partnerships
We are increasingly partnering with 
other retailers in two ways. Firstly, we 
added over 100 new third party brands 
on our sites during the year, further 
broadening our customer offering. 
We have also started to sell capsule 
collections on other retailers’ sites. 
These offer a complementary way 
of driving sales and awareness of 
our brands in a cost-effective manner. 
We will continue to look at other 
opportunities like this going forward.
Fit 4 the Future on track
 – First UK site with our new Financial Services system,  
High & Mighty, planned for launch in May 2017
 – Programme completion on track for Summer 2018
 – Continued focus on risk minimisation

Outlook
The fashion sector remains as competitive 
as ever. Added to this, the depreciation of 
sterling and the recent increase in inflation 
both represent significant input cost 
headwinds to our business. Against this 
backdrop, our significantly increased 
trading agility and in-season flexibility puts 
us in a much better position to be able to 
quickly react to changing market 
conditions, ensuring our product offer 
remains competitive.
