Strategic Report
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Good performance
considering the
very challenging conditions
During a sustained period of structural change in our business,  
we remain focused on delivering against our strategic objectives.  
Led by a strong performance of the i newspaper, adjusted EBITDA  
is in line with expectations. 
Trading
In 2017, we worked hard to combat the 
continued downward pressure on print 
publishing revenue, both in advertising and 
circulation. A key component of our plan 
saw a wholesale modernisation in  
the organisation and operation of our sales 
teams for local markets, as we seek to build 
a class-leading centralised tele-sales 
operation with deep local market 
knowledge. After an initial bedding in 
period, these changes are starting to 
show results.
Statutory revenue reduced from  
£222.7 million in 2016 to £201.6 million in 
2017, of which £9.9 million of the reduction 
related to the sale of 13 titles in the East 
Midlands. The Group reported a loss  
of £78.6 million in 2017, compared to 
£247.3 million in 2016. The loss resulted 
from non-cash asset impairment charges 
of £64.4 million, mark-to-market on the 
bond, as a result of increases in value, and 
exceptional costs. Adjusted operating profit 
was £33.1 million, down from £36.9 million 
in 2016, reflecting the challenging trading 
environment in which the Group operates.
Strategy
As I reported last year, 2017 started with the 
sale of 13 titles in the East Midlands and 
East Anglia to Iliffe Media Limited in 
January 2017. This helped to strengthen  
our balance sheet, reducing net debt  
and increasing liquidity and enabled the 
Group to cancel its revolving credit facility.
We have progressed our Strategic Review 
of our financing options in relation to the 
£220 million 8.625% senior secured notes 
(the ‘Bonds’) which become due on 1 June 
2019 (which we announced on 29 March 
last year). We have updated stakeholders at 
relevant times throughout the intervening 
period and on 2 November 2017 we 
announced the formation of  
an ad hoc committee of Bondholders  
(the ‘Bondholder Committee’) to consider 
in greater detail certain potential 
amendments to the Group's capital 
structure and to the funding arrangements 
for its final salary pension scheme. This 
review is ongoing and the Board is satisfied 
with the continued support of the Group's 
major stakeholders during the review 
process. Any proposal that results from 
these discussions will remain subject to 
negotiation and the consent of relevant 
stakeholders, and there can be no certainty 
that a formal proposal will be forthcoming. 
In the event that consensual amendments 
to the Group’s capital structure cannot be 
agreed with relevant stakeholders, 
alternative options for the restructuring  
or refinancing of the Bonds prior to June 
2019 will be explored as part of the 
ongoing Strategic Review process.
Throughout this period our management 
team remain focused on our key strategic 
aims: growing the Group’s overall audience 
(particularly in the biggest towns and cities 
that we serve), continuing our successful 
growth of the i newspaper and inews.co.uk, 
and seeking to maintain profitability,  
whilst improving customer, reader,  
and staff satisfaction.
Industry issues
We believe strongly in both the protection 
of individuals and bodies through an 
effective press complaints mechanism and 
the rights of a free press which is not 
subject to the oversight of a government, 
or government approved, regulator. 
Together with the majority of our industry, 
we remain whole-heartedly committed  
to IPSO – the Independent Press Standards 
Organisation (along with the vast majority 
of our industry). The industry was forthright 
in its concern over the potential 
introduction of s.40 of the Crime and 
Courts Act 2013 which, if enabled, could 
have operated to make newspaper 
publishers who are not members of a 
statutorily approved body liable for the 
costs of dealing with complaints against 
them – even where those complaints were 
dismissed or shown to have no merit.  
We commended the Government when  
it confirmed that it would repeal this 
measure. It is therefore of great concern 
that, through an amendment to the Data 
Protection Bill, currently making its way 
through Parliament, that the House of 
Lords has sought to reintroduce the same 
penal measures. Our papers are seeking  
to draw the impact that this will have on 
papers of all sizes to the attention of our 
readers and asking them to engage with 
their elected representatives to address 
this issue.
On a more positive note, recruitment is 
underway for 31 local democracy reporters 
following an innovative deal between  
the News Media Association (NMA) and 
the BBC which will see 150 journalists 
employed across the industry to cover local 
democracy reporting. In February 2018, the 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
announced a review to preserve the  
future of high quality national and local 
newspapers in the United Kingdom. At  
a time when more people are recognising 
the value of trusted and verified news 
sources, we welcome the review and will 
support the NMA in its engagement with 
the panel of experts to be appointed to 
conduct the review. On 12 March 2018,  
it was announced that Ashley Highfield 
had been appointed to this advisory panel. 7

Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Dividend
Johnston Press plc, and Johnston 
Publishing Ltd, its largest subsidiary, do not 
have distributable reserves. This restricts 
the Company’s ability to pay ordinary 
dividends. No ordinary or preference 
dividend is proposed for the year.
Board
After serving for nine years, Ralph Marshall 
stepped down as a Non-Executive Director 
at the Annual General Meeting in May. 
Under the terms of the shareholder 
agreement with Usaha Tegas which owns 
10.63% of the Company’s ordinary share 
capital, Jamie Buchan was appointed  
as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 June 2017. Ralph’s service over many 
years has been of enormous value to the 
Board and I would reiterate both my 
thanks and those of my colleagues.  
We are very pleased to have welcomed 
Jamie to the Board.
I have continued in the role of Interim 
Chair since the start of 2017 and the 
Company will make an announcement  
at the appropriate time when the position 
changes. I would like to record my thanks 
to Mike Butterworth who has undertaken 
the role of Senior Independent Director  
on an interim basis as well as chairing  
the Audit Committee during this period.
In considering candidates to fill Board 
vacancies, the Nomination Committee  
has regard to the benefits of, and the need 
to encourage, diversity (including gender) 
within the Board’s membership and this is 
a specific consideration of the recruitment 
process and is included in the Committee’s 
Terms of Reference. The Board has 
adopted a written diversity policy for 
this purpose.
The Board regularly reviews both the 
balance of its membership and the issues 
it considers when it meets. The agenda  
for the Board’s meetings continue to be 
structured in such a way as to scrutinise 
both strategic and operational matters and 
the meetings are held in an atmosphere  
of constructive challenge and debate. I am 
satisfied that the Board remains effective.
Employees
In recent years it has become the norm  
to report on the profound changes 
experienced by the Group and, as will 
become clear, 2017 was no different. I have 
once again been struck by the hard work 
and dedication of all employees, which  
has been key in our ability to adapt to  
the changing environment in which we 
operate. On behalf of the Board I would 
like to put on record our grateful thanks  
for the professionalism and application  
of all our colleagues across the Group, 
which is invaluable to the business.
On 28 March 2018, the Group reported  
on its Gender pay gap. In common with 
many organisations we have more men 
than women in senior positions and this 
factor has contributed significantly.
We will address the pay gap over the next 
3-5 years and have already committed  
to a series of actions in this respect. More 
details of our action plan, together with  
the gap data, can be found on our website:

Outlook
Current trading remains very challenging 
and is expected to remain so for the 
remainder of this year. The management 
team are focused on delivering against  
the stated strategic objectives. We continue 
to invest in digital growth, while also 
continuing to look for ways to take cost  
out of the business, in mitigation of print 
revenue declines.
