Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017
A year  
of growth
Chairman’s  
statement
Our Recruitment division has again seen 
significant organic revenue growth, of 10%, 
and, with two further acquisitions in 2017, 
their total revenue has increased by 14%, 
achieved against the backdrop of 
uncertainty around Brexit and the impact 
that it has had on lowering migration. Our 
PeoplePlus division has met the challenge of 
delivering the final years of the existing Work 
Programme, continuing to be the best 
performing supplier to the DWP and 
positioning itself to become a leading 
supplier of Apprenticeship Levy training. 
Other opportunities during 2017 included 
winning the Fair Start programme in 
Scotland. 
Performance
2017 was the final year of our five-year 
plan to “Burst the Billion”, aiming to 
grow Group revenues to over £1bn by 
2017. Group revenues of £957.8m (2016: 
£882.4m), up 9%, leaves us just short 
of this target. However, the exiting run 
rate of 2017 exceeds this target and 
remains a significant achievement 
compared to the starting point of 
revenues of £367m in 2012, when the 
five-year plan began. The five-year 
underlying operating profit target of 
£30m was comfortably exceeded, being 
achieved two years early, in 2015.
Underlying profit before tax* reduced 
by 1% to £36.3m (2016: £36.7m). Whilst 
a reduction, this is a good achievement 
given the Work Programme run-off 
in PeoplePlus that began in March 
2017. Reported profit before tax 
increased by 28% to £24.1m (2016: 
£18.9m), primarily due to exceptional 
reorganisation costs incurred in 
2016 not being repeated in 2017.
Cash generation was again strong, 
with free cash flows (being EBITDA plus 
working capital movement, less tax paid 
and capex) amounting to £37.9m. Net 
debt** fell by £20.2m, from £36.7m at 
the end of December 2016 to £16.5m 
at the end of December 2017. This 
provides the Group with a solid base 
from which to continue to generate 
shareholder value into the future.

Dividends
The Group is in a robust financial position 
with good cash generation and a strong 
balance sheet. Our financial position at the 
end of 2017 and confidence for the future 
enables us to propose an increased final 
dividend of 15.7p (2016: 15.3p), payable on 
Tuesday 3 July 2018. The Group’s dividend 
policy, whilst in a net debt position, is to 
maintain a dividend cover ratio of between 
4.0 and 4.5 times our underlying diluted EPS. 
Our proposed final dividend will ensure the 
full year dividend cover is within this range 
at 4.22 times. Further details on the Group’s 
dividend policy can be found within the 
Chief Financial Officer’s Report on page 23. 
Board changes and  
senior management overview
I am pleased to announce that, with 
effect from 24 January 2018, Chris 
Pullen is appointed as Chief Executive 
of Staffline Group plc. Chris succeeds 
Andy Hogarth who will step down from 
his current role while remaining on the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director. 
Andy Hogarth has been Chief Executive of 
Staffline Group plc since 2003, during which 
time the Group has grown to almost £1bn in 
revenue. The Recruitment business is now 
the largest blue collar OnSite business in 
the UK. The PeoplePlus business supports a 
large portfolio of contracts across central, 
local and devolved government, focusing 
on People, Skills and Jobs, and is the 
largest provider of the Work Programme in 
the country. I am delighted that Andy will 
continue to lend his considerable experience 
and insight to Chris and the Board in his 
new role as a Non-Executive Director.
Chris Pullen joined the Group in 2015 from 
Regus plc to develop the Group’s Mergers 
and Acquisition strategy and became Group 
Chief Financial Officer in June 2016. In 
these roles, Chris has made a significant 
contribution to the development of the 
Group and now has an excellent insight into 
the Group’s overall operations. He is ideally 
positioned to lead the business through 
its next stage of strategic development. 
I can also report that Diane Martyn, Group 
Managing Director, is stepping down 
from the Board on 24 January 2018, but 
will continue to work with the Group on a 
part-time basis to support the strategic 
goals of the business. Diane has also 
made an immense contribution to the 
Group’s success, and we are delighted 
she will continue to be part of it. 
Mike Watts is appointed as Group 
Chief Financial Officer with effect 
from 24 January 2018. He joined our 
PeoplePlus division as Finance Director 
in February 2017 where he has already 
made an excellent contribution to the 
business. Prior to Staffline, Mike was at 
Capita plc where he was Finance Director 
of a number of businesses. Mike is a 
Chartered Accountant, having qualified 
with PwC and has a Ph.D from Cambridge 
University in Materials Science.
The Group has developed an extremely 
experienced senior management team 
under the PLC Board, and has the 
right leadership capability in place to 
achieve the strategic objectives of our 
Recruitment and PeoplePlus divisions.
Simon Rouse joined the Group in 
November 2017 as Managing Director 
of PeoplePlus from Capita, where he 
was a Portfolio Managing Director, 
leading a number of contracts across 
both the private and public sector. 
Mark Underwood joined the Group 
in 2012 and has been Managing 
Director of the Specialist Recruitment 
Businesses (Driving Plus, Agriculture 
and Branch network operations). 
These have been key to the success of 
Recruitment’s “new division” strategy. 
Mark is now appointed as Managing 
Director of our Recruitment division.
I am delighted that we have an experienced 
management team in place to deliver the 
Group’s next development plan. Most 
members of the team have worked together 
for a considerable time and have vast 
knowledge of Staffline, our customers and 
the markets in which we operate. I would 
also like to thank the whole team for all their 
continued efforts, support and contribution.
Outlook
For a number of years now, the Group has 
maintained its objective of being the largest 
provider of people in the UK blue collar 
market, with specialist knowledge of the 
food, logistics/driving and manufacturing 
sectors. The Board and I are confident 
that the Recruitment division can continue 
to grow its market share through further 
organic growth, as well as suitable 
acquisitions which strengthen our offering. 
The restructuring of PeoplePlus has 
positioned the division well to provide a 
strong Apprenticeship Levy offering, as well 
as being agile enough to take advantage 
of other opportunities in the employability, 
justice and wellbeing sectors. Similar to 
2017, 2018 is seen as a transitional year 
for this division, with the Work Programme 
revenues tailing off and the further 
development of our Skills, Employability 
and Health and Wellbeing offering. 
Key priorities for the  
two divisions in 2018 are: 
Recruitment:
• Continued organic growth – focus on 
our core business
• Continued strong cash conversion – 
focus on margin and payment terms
• Bolt on acquisitions – enhancing 
continued organic growth
• New digital platform – differentiation  
in a tight labour market
PeoplePlus: 
• Optimisation of Work Programme 
business 
• Deliver growth in our Prisons’ Offender 
Learning and Skills Services contracts
• Develop and grow private skills market 
business through the Apprenticeship 
Levy
• Develop and grow our presence in 
Wales, Scotland and local government
• Develop new market propositions in 
health and wellbeing and corporate 
learning and development
Despite the change in sales mix within 
PeoplePlus, we expect the Group’s 2018 
profit to be slightly higher than in 2017. 
Continued strong cash generation should 
either result in net debt being eliminated in 
2018 or provide the resources to acquire 
additional businesses. The Group is in an 
excellent position to continue to generate 
shareholder value through growing 
cashflows in future years.
