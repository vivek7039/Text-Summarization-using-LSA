 I am pleased with the progress made in the year, 
another year of strong trading activity contributing 
to continued growth across the business. 
2017 has seen us make excellent progress, investing to build 
capacity through our strategic plan to enable us to install, 
own and manage a significantly increased number of utility 
metering assets for our energy supplier customers – particularly 
in the Smart Domestic market. This platform and increased 
capacity across all aspects of our operations puts us in a 
strong position to continue to grow our share of the UK’s 
smart domestic meter installation programme over the 
next three to four years.
Whilst continuing our profitable growth, the link to our 
heritage remains strong, with a focus on serving our 
customers. Our core values of investing in our people, 
systems and capacity remain as important to us today 
as they have been over the last 22 years. We have grown 
to 825 staff on a national basis and our people are key to 
delivering excellent customer service. I would like to thank 
all our employees for their highly valued contribution to 
serving our customers.
We now manage over 2 million utility metering and data 
assets on behalf of a continually expanding customer base 
of energy suppliers in both the Industrial and Commercial 
(I&C) and Domestic markets. This now includes a total 
portfolio of over 420,000 smart domestic meters.
In November 2017, we refinanced the business, extending the 
term of our £280m revolving credit facility and completing 
a £150m equity placing, providing us with a strong financial 
platform to help our customers complete their domestic 
smart meter programmes. I would like to thank our existing 
and new long-term investors and funders for their support.
Delivering our strategy
Last year we strategically changed our operational delivery 
model to gain direct control over a large proportion of our 
installation capacity and the end-to-end IT platform which 
underpins it. The value of this approach can be seen in the 
last year as SMS has performed strongly – deploying more 
capital and generating more incremental annualised 
recurring revenue than in the two previous years combined. 
This long-term annualised and index-linked recurring 
revenue has increased by 38% during the year, driven by 
the management and systems capacity in which we have 
invested. This enables us to provide energy suppliers 
with complete confidence in our ability to deliver 
their mandated rollout targets.
The UK domestic smart meter rollout is 
a government programme, requiring 
each energy supplier to offer 
installation of a smart meter 
in every home and business 
across the UK by 2020.

STRATEGIC REPORT
08
Willie  
MacDiarmid, 
Non-executive 
Chairman The business continues to operate with a market-focused 
structure, with three main service lines:
Asset management: We fund, at highly competitive rates, 
new meter and data assets which we install direct or adopt 
from third parties.
Asset installation: We have built one of the largest 
independent and national dual fuel metering installation 
services, enabling energy suppliers to achieve their mandated 
obligations under the government’s smart meter programme.
Energy management: We have an extensive team of experts 
who provide a full range of energy services, including risk 
management, bureau, energy efficiency, carbon reduction, 
generation and storage. 
Our technology, IT development and data security capabilities 
underpin all of these service lines and also provide new 
opportunities to innovate our services to the benefit of our 
customers beyond smart metering, particularly as we consider 
opportunities to install other long-term assets.
The safety of everyone involved in or associated with our 
business is of the utmost critical importance to us. “Safety 
Matters” (please refer to page 25) has been put at the heart 
of our business culture. We are proud of our assurance activities, 
which always ensure that health and safety is our top agenda 
item. However, we are not complacent and continue to invest 
and rigorously challenge, evaluate and assess the risks within 
our business to ensure that we are doing everything possible 
to ensure the health and safety of all our stakeholders. 
Dividend
We are pleased to announce a proposed final cash dividend 
of 3.46p for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 2.73p). 
In addition to the interim dividend of 1.74p (2016: 1.37p), this will 
make a total dividend of 5.20p (2016: 4.10p), a 27% increase. 
The final dividend will be paid on 31 May 2018 to those 
shareholders on the register (record date) on 27 April 2018 
with an ex-dividend date of 26 April 2018.
Outlook
We enter 2018 with a solid financial platform, a strong and 
growing utility metering installation capacity and ownership 
proposition, and the capability to innovate our services for 
our customers’ benefit over the long term.
We are in a strong position to continue to benefit from the 
Domestic Smart metering market and are continuing to increase 
the range of services to reduce customers’ carbon emissions 
and transform the UK energy system for the future.
We are committed to investing in metering installation and 
our ownership capacity, listening to and serving our customers’ 
needs and innovating our service proposition. 
We are confident that our proven and established leadership 
team will continue to build on our success as we deliver our 
strategic plan and take the business to the next phase of growth.
Willie MacDiarmid
Non-executive Chairman
This represents our largest market opportunity to increase 
the utility meters under management and as a result grow 
our index-linked recurring revenue, with c.43 million meters 
still to be installed across the market. Our strategy has 
positioned SMS to have control over the systems, people, 
processes and capacity to deliver on the market opportunity.
We plan to continue to increase our metering installation 
and management capacity and run rates with our growing 
customer base to enable SMS to continue to grow the two 
million assets currently under management.
Our strategic priorities, in 2018, will be to:
1.  Continue to install and own utility metering infrastructure 
and secure rental and data revenues from our contracted 
energy suppliers in the I&C market.
2.  Build on our strategic positioning and investment in 
capacity to take advantage of the Domestic Smart market 
opportunity in the UK. This is founded on our proven 
end-to-end delivery capability, increasing capacity and 
track record of customer service and operational delivery.
3.  Innovate our services to build big data, energy 
management, financing and installation capabilities that 
enable our customers to reduce their carbon emissions, 
and facilitate our investment in infrastructure asset classes 
which provide long-term recurring revenue.
People and systems
Our Board has evolved in 2017. In March we announced that 
Glen Murray, who had served as Chief Financial Officer of 
SMS since 2011, had decided step down from the Board and 
leave the business. I would like to thank Glen, on behalf of 
the Board, for his significant contribution to SMS over the 
last six years. We appointed David Harris as his replacement, 
who unfortunately resigned in August for health reasons. In 
September, we welcomed to the Board David Thompson as 
Chief Financial Officer. David had already made a significant 
contribution to the SMS success story in his previous role as 
Group Finance Director and is ideally placed to help drive 
the continued growth of the Company. In January 2018, 
Kelly Olsen joined us as a Non-executive Director, bringing a 
wealth of experience as an information technology specialist. 
Kelly is chairing a newly created Information and Technology 
Committee of the Board, with a remit to review and provide 
strategic guidance on development of the Company’s 
technology programmes. This is recognition of the importance 
of technology, information security and IT systems in providing 
the platform for our business to deliver a first-class customer 
experience. It will also provide a solid foundation for future IT 
investment, ultimately contributing to future shareholder returns.
We have continued to invest heavily in our people during 
2017, most notably through our in-house training academy 
to increase and develop our capacity for the domestic smart 
meter rollout. This capability is also key to our leading health 
and safety and technical assurance management controls, 
which are at the heart of everything we do.
