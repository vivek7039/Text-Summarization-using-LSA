GREGGS AT A GLANCE
Becoming the 
customers’ favourite 
for food-on-the-go
Greggs is a strong and trusted brand and 
we draw on our heritage in fresh bakery to 
compete successfully in the food-on-the-go 
market. Having made strong progress in 
recent years, we have set the bar higher 
with our vision and strategic plan reflecting 
longer-term ambitions and commitment  
to putting the customer at the heart of  
our strategy.
Our purpose
Our business began in the 1930s, serving fresh 
bakery products to working families in the North  
East at prices everyone could afford. Today we’re  
just as keen for Greggs to have a positive impact on 
people’s lives. With ambitions to grow to over 2,000 
shops nationwide and ownership of our supply chain, 
we are in a unique position to make good, freshly 
prepared food accessible to everyone.
Our vision
In recent years we have shown we can be a winning 
brand in the food-on-the-go market and our vision is  
to become the customers’ favourite for food-on-the-
go. To achieve this, we have been working hard to see 
the business through the eyes of our customers. We 
continue to invest in understanding their needs and 
ensure we have amazing teams in place to deliver the 
fast and friendly service our customers know and love. 
Insight provided by our award-winning Greggs Rewards 
app and dedicated customer insight team helps to 
inform decision making throughout the business and  
better meet customer needs every day.
Our operations
Ownership of our supply chain means that we  
can make good, freshly prepared food accessible 
to everyone at great value in an extremely 
competitive market place. By managing our own 
logistics operation we can remain focused on the 
customer, delivering what our shops and 
customers need on time and in full.
Our target market
Greggs is a brand with universal appeal and we 
have been working hard to ensure we understand 
our customers and evolve our offer in response to 
their changing needs as we continue our journey 
to become the customers’ favourite for food-on-
the-go. 
 
Our market locations
As the internet changes the way we shop and 
food-on-the go eating habits evolve, we have  
built on our existing estate of shops to take 
Greggs where our customers want us to be.  
As a result, we can now be found in retail parks, 
shopping centres, industrial estates and office 
parks. We are also located where our customers 
need us when travelling, with shops in travel  
hubs, roadside locations with parking and now  
in Drive Thru format. Through our franchise 
partnerships we are also in motorway service 
stations and petrol forecourts.
