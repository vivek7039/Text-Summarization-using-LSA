 TRADING PERFORMANCE
W
e made good 
progress in 2017, with 
volumes and revenues 
comfortably ahead of 
the prior year. These 
included a full-year contribution from 
Hope, which was fully integrated into 
the Group less than 12 months after 
completion of the acquisition, and from 
Sherburn Minerals Limited (Sherburn).
We delivered healthy growth in volumes 
of aggregates and ready-mixed concrete, 
with asphalt volumes broadly maintained, 
against the background of more difficult 
markets, exacerbated by some major 
project delays and challenging weather 
towards the end of the year. It is also 
important to note that our revenue 
growth reflects - and will continue to 
reflect - the increasing internalisation of 
aggregates and cement following the 
acquisition of Hope.
Group revenues rose by 43 per cent to 
£652.4 million, generating underlying 
EBIT of £80.4 million and an underlying 
EBIT margin of 12.3 per cent. We remain 
committed to achieving a medium-term 
underlying EBIT margin target of 15 per 
cent by 2020. The Group continued to be 
strongly cash-generative, with net debt 
reduced by a further 31 per cent to just 
under £110 million.
All three divisions delivered improved 
performances, reflecting a resolute 
emphasis on outstanding customer 
service, coupled with rigorous cost 
control and a sharpened focus on 
operating efficiency. The businesses are 
each reviewed by their respective leaders 
on pages 29 to 37 .
THE MARKET
Construction output continued to grow 
in 2017, rising by three per cent despite 
a softening of the market during the 
second and third quarters. As always, 
there were marked geographical 
disparities, with generally stronger 
demand in England than in Scotland 
and many regional variances within both 
countries. Growth was led by healthy 
increases in residential and infrastructure 
development, which together account for 
the majority of our end-use markets.

and the outlook for 2018 can be found on

WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT
Once again we invested well ahead 
of depreciation in mineral assets, 
capacity and operational improvements 
throughout the Group, including three 
new quarries, which will facilitate further 
internalisation of material to our concrete 
and asphalt plants.
We have a long-term ambition to 
strengthen our position in the UK 
asphalt market and to this end in 2017 
we commenced installation of a new 
plant at our rail-linked quarry at Dowlow 
in Derbyshire and a replacement plant 
at our Furnace quarry in Scotland. 
The planned acquisition of Minffordd 
quarry from Tarmac will give us another 
new plant, expanding our asphalt 
network to 28 plants nationwide.
Investments last year in equipment 
upgrades at Tom’s Forest and Dowlow 
quarries are already producing 
improved performances. We have also 
been operating formal OEE (Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness) and REE 
(Running Equipment Effectiveness) 
programmes for some time at selected 
sites in Breedon Southern and these are 
now being rolled out across Breedon 
Northern. They are enabling us to make 
clearly measurable improvements to 
the efficiency and running costs of our 
fixed plant and drive selective capital 
investment, thereby ensuring that all 
our operations are fit for purpose in the 
years ahead.
We completed a major planned 
programme of capital investment 
in Breedon Cement, encompassing 
significant upgrades to our Hope Cement 
Works, quarry equipment and road and 
rail fleets.
ACQUISITIONS
In May we secured another valuable 
route to market for our aggregates and 
cement with the purchase of Pro Mini Mix 
Concrete, Mortars and Screeds Limited 
(Pro Mini Mix), a mini mix operator in 
the West Midlands. This was followed in 
August by the acquisition of Humberside 
Aggregates Limited (Humberside 
Aggregates), bringing with it around 
three million tonnes of mineral reserves, 
opening up new markets for us in East 
Yorkshire and Humberside and enabling 
us to internalise supplies to our concrete 
plants in the region.
Q&A
Group CEO answers key 
questions on 2017
Q:
What were the highlights of 2017?
A:
The integration of Hope, which we completed shortly before the 
first anniversary of closing the deal, was a major achievement 
for everyone concerned. The entire Group is now on a common 
IT platform, with strong and well-structured central functions, 
well equipped to service Breedon through the next stage of 
its development. We were also very pleased to complete the 
acquisitions of Pro Mini Mix and Humberside Aggregates, 
which expanded our service network and brought us additional 
reserves of valuable minerals. Our planned acquisition of 
quarries and an asphalt plant from Tarmac is an elegant means 
of acquiring additional reserves and asphalt capacity, whilst 
simultaneously streamlining our ready-mixed concrete network.
Q:
How do you maintain Breedon’s unique culture as you 
continue to grow?
A:
It is obvious that, as the Group grows, we need more robust 
processes. But that does not mean making those processes 
lengthier. We will keep our reporting lines short, our central 
overhead to a minimum, and devolve as much responsibility as 
possible to our managers – giving them the training they need 
to assume accountability with confidence. Investment decisions 
will continue to be made quickly and we will remain close to 
our customers, continuing to give them the outstanding service 
they have come to expect from us, whether they are small local 
purchasers or one of the many major national concerns with 
which we are increasingly partnering.
Q:
What are you doing about succession-planning?
A:
We decided very soon after the acquisition of Hope to 
restructure our management on Regional and Area General 
Manager lines, in order to ensure that we had ambitious and 
capable people in those key roles on which the business 
depends. All our General Managers run substantial businesses 
in their own right and they provide us with an excellent pool 
of talent on which to draw in the future. We are supporting 
them with significant investment in training and leadership 
development, so that each of them is properly equipped to reach 
their full potential as future leaders of the business.
Q:
What criteria do you use to decide how and where to invest 
in the business?
A:
We have always said that Breedon will expand through 
a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. 
Acquisitions must be earnings-enhancing, bring tangible 
strategic benefits and deliver meaningful value for our 
shareholders. The same is true of organic investment: we apply 
rigorous tests to every item of capital expenditure, demanding 
a healthy rate of return and speedy payback. We also make 
decisions fast: if the case for expenditure is strong and 
well presented, we can give it approval within days or even 
hours. This approach has enabled us to deliver widespread 
performance improvements in our quarries and plants.

01
STRATEGIC  
REPORT 02 03 04 We have a business of significant scale 
and national reach with fully vertically 
integrated operations, from cement 
production at the UK’s largest plant to 
an extensive network of downstream 
product units. The addition of two 
cementitious import terminals has also 
opened up new strategic relationships 
with European producers which will 
potentially bring valuable benefits in 
the future.
We have a tried and tested operational 
management team who have the 
experience and bandwidth to exploit new 
market and acquisition opportunities 
to the full in the years ahead, backed 
by robust processes which ensure that 
we can move quickly when potential 
investments become available. 
Furthermore, the consolidation of 
our back-office systems following the 
acquisition of Hope has given us capacity 
to further expand the Group without 
adding materially to our overhead.
There is no doubt that 2018 will continue 
to be challenging in some areas of the 
construction market. However, our bias 
towards housebuilding and infrastructure 
development will ensure that we are well 
positioned to take advantage of healthy 
forecast growth in these sectors and 
we also have further acquisitions in the 
pipeline. We therefore remain confident 
of our ability to continue delivering value 
for our shareholders in the current and 
future years.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT CONTINUED
Revenue
up 43%
Underlying
EBIT up 
35%
Net debt  
down 31%
In December, we announced the planned 
acquisition of four quarries and an 
asphalt plant from Tarmac, in exchange 
for 27 of our ready-mixed concrete plants 
and a cash payment of £4.9 million. 
This acquisition is in line with our strategy 
of expanding our aggregates portfolio 
and streamlining our concrete network, 
whilst enabling us to replace third-party 
aggregates providers with our own 
sources of supply. Subject to approval 
from the Competition and Markets 
Authority (CMA), the transaction is 
expected to be completed in the next 
couple of months.
SAFETY
We set out in 2017 to embed a culture 
of safer behaviour in the business, 
encouraging all our colleagues to 
recognise the importance of moving 
towards Zero Harm. This led to a 
further 25 per cent reduction in the 
frequency of employee lost-time injuries 
across the Group which, although 
not as great a reduction as we had 
targeted, is nonetheless an encouraging 
improvement. I am particularly pleased 
to note a significant fall in the severity of 
injuries reported, which signals that our 
colleagues are embracing the challenge 
to make Breedon a safer place to work.
A detailed review of our safety activities 
is provided within the Corporate Social 
Responsibility review on pages 43 to 45.
OUTLOOK
Breedon is an appreciably stronger 
and more strategically well positioned 
business today than it was two years 
ago. The acquisition of Hope, followed by 
Sherburn, Pro Mini Mix and Humberside 
Aggregates, have consolidated our 
position as the UK’s leading independent 
construction materials producer. Our  
planned acquisition of quarrying and 
asphalt assets from Tarmac will give us an 
even more powerful platform for growth.
