 In May 2015, we announced a five year 
strategic plan to transform De La Rue from 
a banknote and passport manufacturer 
into a technology-led security product and 
service provider. The plan aims to deliver: 
• Better business mix
• Higher quality earnings
• Improved profitability
• Improved cash flow
• Better return on capital 
• High performing culture

  Address key issues 
In a constantly changing market, 
we must be more flexible and agile in 
managing our customer relationships, 
product pipelines and delivery. We face 
a number of risks that could have 
material impacts to the business. 
These include volatility of earnings which 
is caused by unpredictable demand in 
the banknote print and paper markets. 
Working with third party partners gives 
us added flexibility, helping reduce 
risk and manage surge in demand. 
At the same time, we use the insights 
and analytics we have gathered over 
decades to help our customers improve 
their forecasting. 
The banknote paper market has been 
oversupplied for a number of years and 
we expect this to continue. In the short 
term, cutting production costs and 
driving efficiency will help to maintain 
profitability. For the longer term, we 
continue to explore our strategic options.
We completed the sale of the 
underperforming Cash Processing 
Solutions business on 22 May 2016.

  Driving efficiency
Driving down costs enables us to remain 
price competitive while protecting 
margins. We are working hard to improve 
manufacturing efficiency. In 2012, we 
launched our Operational Excellence 
programme to modernise banknote 
production and deliver continuous 
improvement through best practice. 
We successfully completed Level 2 
of the programme during the year.
To optimise our cost base, we are 
restructuring our manufacturing footprint 
to ensure it is aligned with long term 
average demand, while also benefiting 
from the greater flexibility delivered 
by changes in working practices. 
Launched in December 2015, this 
programme will complete in 2018/19 
and is expected to generate c£13m 
cash savings per year.

Watch the interview with CEO Martin Sutherland  
www.delarue.com/about-us/our-strategy We are also creating a leaner and 
more agile organisation. We began 
changing our systems and processes 
in 2015/16 and are now upgrading our 
finance and management information 
systems to increase efficiency and 
improve decision-making. We have 
also significantly improved a number 
of commercial processes which have 
shortened our timescales to submit 
bids and win new business.
3
  Diversifying revenues
More than half of the Group’s revenue is 
generated from Banknote Print and Paper. 
In order to diversify our revenue streams 
and benefit from a more balanced product 
mix, we have increased investment in 
areas with potential for high growth – such 
as Polymer and Identity Solutions – or high 
profitability, including Security Features 
and Product Authentication & Traceability 
(PA&T). We also aim to increase recurring 
revenues from software solutions and 
services. In addition, our focus on long 
term agreements will help to reduce 
volatility in banknote earnings caused 
primarily by unpredictable demand. 
To grow our sales pipeline, we are 
targeting direct sales of product 
components to state print works 
(SPWs), system integrators and other 
commercial printers. Our renewed focus 
on direct sales will not only increase 
our addressable market, but also even 
out the peaks and troughs we experience 
in orders for finished products.
We aim to maximise internal synergies 
by leveraging our existing products. 
In addition, we also aim to build stronger 
customer relationships via a network 
of new regional offices and a direct sales 
force, reducing reliance on third party 
partners. During the year, we set up sales 
hubs in Dubai and Miami and relocated 
sales staff to be closer to our customers 
in Africa and Asia. These changes will 
help us better understand customer 
needs, ensuring we offer the right 
products and services.

  Investing in innovation
Innovation drives product differentiation 
and is therefore the engine for our 
growth. We plan to double our 
investment in R&D in the years to 2020, 
prioritising product development in high 
growth and high margin businesses. 
Our product development programme 
is based on a number of technology 
platforms we have developed in material 
science. This approach allows us to 
maximise our technology know-how 
and create various platform-based 
applications for different products.
Innovation drives 
product differentiation 
and is therefore the 
engine for our growth.
Cash Supply Chain 
DLR Analytics™ 
Although some industries have been using 
big data for many years, the central banking 
sector is just beginning to realise its power. 
Based on our know-how and vast database 
of cash cycle management, our DLR Analytics 
tool is a proprietary software solution that enables 
central banks to monitor the movement, utilisation 
rate and inventory of cash. The data generated 
helps central banks better manage their cash 
cycle at lower cost, guides their decision-making 
and shapes policies, while also reducing the risk 
of running out of cash.

  Strengthening our  
financial position
One of our key objectives is to focus 
on strengthening our financial position 
by increasing profit and prudent cash 
management. In April 2017, we extended 
the maturity date of our existing £250m 
committed revolving credit facility by 
two years to December 2021.
We have also created a joint working 
group with the pension trustees to 
explore ways to proactively improve the 
management of our pension obligations. 
6
  Driving culture change
We continue to foster a dynamic, agile 
and results-focused culture that will drive 
business growth in the years to 2020 
and beyond. 
To encourage a high performing culture, 
we have implemented performance 
management and all employees now 
have a set of individual objectives aligned 
to Group strategy. 
To ensure that we have the right skills 
and capabilities to take our business 
forward, we have changed 50% of the 
senior leadership team over the last two 
years and continue to upgrade the skill 
set of our sales force. 
We continue to invest in extensive 
training, development and recognition 
programmes. In June 2016 we launched 
the second phase of the Leadership 
Development Programme. This focuses 
on developing the agility and capability 
to lead and inspire colleagues in a matrix 
organisation, and is helping to build a 
strong pipeline for succession planning.
Being ethical and always acting with 
integrity is at the heart of our ability 
to work with more than 140 countries, 
and we use regular ethics training and 
assessment to reinforce this approach 
across the company. 
We are proud to join the 12,000+ 
participants of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC), a voluntary initiative 
based on the principles of human 
rights, labour rights, the environment 
and anti-corruption. These principles 
will guide how we function across our 
business and how we engage with our 
local communities. De La Rue has been 
helping to create inclusive, sustainable 
societies for 200 years and we will 
continue to do so. UNGC will provide 
us a framework to report our progress. 
Read more about our progress on pages 
42 to 49.
We aim to accelerate technology 
development through partnerships and 
acquisitions – and in December 2016 we 
acquired the US-based brand protection 
company, DuPont Authentication, 
for $25m. Not only does DuPont 
Authentication develop and own the 
highly specialised Lippmann holographic 
technology
1
, but it is one of the very 
few companies worldwide that can 
mass-produce 3D Lippmann holograms. 
In addition to our ongoing work to 
enhance our two proprietary software 
solutions – DLR Identify™ and DLR 
Certify™ – we have initiated a digital 
strategy with a number of initiatives, with 
the objective of modernising the business 
and improving competitiveness. 
The fact that around 40% of denominations 
in circulation globally and 60% of 
denominations issued in 2016/17 were 
designed by De La Rue endorses our 
design capability as one of our core 
strengths and differentiators. During the 
year, we have changed our approach 
to increase interaction between the design 
team and customers.
1
 Lippmann holographic technology, also called 3D 
holographic, is a type of hologram that projects volume or 
a 3D image of the object. Compared with the conventional 
embossed holograms which produce colourful 2D images, 
it requires advanced replication technology. Only a 
handful of companies worldwide are capable of producing 
3D holograms. 
Cash Supply Chain 
Bank of England £5 note design 
We were exceptionally proud to work in 
partnership with the Bank of England on the 
ground-breaking new £5 note. We collaborated 
with the Bank and its other suppliers to create 
the highly secure and iconic new design, which 
we are now printing. We are also working closely 
with the Bank on the designs for the new £10 
and £20 notes and look forward to their issue 
in the near future.

24  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 Reclassification of results between 
Product Authentication & Traceability 
and Identity Solutions
Historically the results of one of the 
Group’s manufacturing sites have been 
included in the PA&T segment as this 
segment represented the majority of its 
business. However, due to growth in 
IDS business within this site, we have 
started reviewing information including 
the results of this site split between 
IDS and PA&T. In order to align the 
Group’s external reporting segments 
to the information reviewed internally, 
the results of this site have been split in 
the current year between the IDS and 
PA&T segment. The 2015/16 figures have 
also been adjusted for comparability. 
See note 1 in the accounts for 
further details.
Currency 
Currency comprises Banknote Print, 
Banknote Paper, Polymer, and 
Security Features. Each business line 
faces different market dynamics and 
growth prospects. 
Banknote Print 
While overall volumes of cash are 
growing globally at c4% a year, 
issuances and orders of cash remain 
lumpy. This creates unpredictability in 
our production schedule and, in turn, 
profitability. We aim to reduce this 
unpredictability by optimising production 
capacity and by using outsourcing to 
create extra flexibility to deal with surge 
in demand. 
Our manufacturing footprint restructuring 
programme, designed to optimise 
our capacity, has now completed its 
first phase. Two print lines have been 
decommissioned in Malta and machine 
upgrades in other sites are going to plan. 
In November 2016, we refined the plan 
to improve our blend of outsourcing and 
in-house production, and this led to a 
decision to retain the remaining banknote 
print line in Malta. The plan to deliver 
c£13m annual cost savings from FY18/19 
remains unchanged, although some 
of these savings are expected to be 
reinvested in the business.
Operational review
Our 2020 Strategic Plan has a dual 
focus. Based on the market dynamics 
of each business line, we have identified 
two different strategic priorities: 
Invest and Build 
Invest in the business lines that are 
exposed to higher growth markets and 
enhance our capabilities in order to deliver 
sustainable growth, specifically Polymer, 
Security Features, Identity Solutions (IDS), 
and Product Authentication & Traceability 
(PA&T).
Optimise and Flex 
Drive efficiency and flexibility in the 
business lines that are facing markets 
with unpredictability or slower growth, 
specifically Banknote Print and 
Banknote Paper.
Product Authentication 
DuPont Authentication 
In line with our 2020 Strategic Plan, our acquisition 
of DuPont Authentication for $25m in January 
2017 has given us access to new capabilities. 
DuPont Authentication produces photopolymer 
holographic films and 3D holograms based on 
the highly specialised Lippmann technology. 
Headquartered in Utah, USA and with operations 
in Delaware, the business has a well-established 
global customer base in brand protection and 
identity authentication. Its flagship product, Izon
®
, 
is used on a number of globally recognised 
brands, such as Lenovo and Brother, as well 
as on one of the world’s most secure passports.

Strategic report Corporate governance Accounts
 Annual Report 2017  De La Rue  25 We are focusing on driving direct 
sales to SPWs in order to increase 
machine utilisation. 
During the year, we launched a cost 
reduction programme which aims to 
reduce the spoilage rate and improve 
throughput. While total volume grew by 
18%, unit production cost also increased 
due to the increased cost of imported 
raw materials such as cotton. 
In the meantime, we continue to engage 
in complex and constructive dialogue 
with a number of paper-makers in 
order to identify a long term solution 
for the business. 
Polymer 
This business has gained significant 
traction since the launch of our polymer 
substrate, Safeguard
®,
 in 2012. Today, 
as the only integrated polymer provider, 
we are well positioned to achieve 
further growth.
We aim to grow our market share by 
targeting existing polymer customers 
as well as paper and coin customers 
looking to switch to polymer. In 2016/17 , 
we increased our production volumes 
from 100 tonnes to 380 tonnes. 
In August, we agreed to enter into a joint 
venture that would see the Government 
of Kenya acquire a 40% interest in our 
wholly-owned Kenyan subsidiary for 
£5.0m. This will further strengthen our 
ties with the country and secure our 
position as a supply hub of currency 
and security solutions in East Africa. 
We expect this to complete in the current 
financial year.
We seek to build outsourcing partnerships 
in banknote print to provide added 
flexibility, reduce risk and manage surge 
demand. At the same time, we aim to 
increase earnings visibility through LTAs 
with customers. We also look to smooth 
demand by helping our customers improve 
their cash requirement forecasting. In May 
2017 , we launched DLR Analytics™ – a 
software solution that helps central banks 
manage their cash cycle by drawing on 
insights and intelligence from the collected 
data and our database. It is currently 
piloted with 26 customers.
Banknote Paper 
Although demand for banknote paper 
has increased in recent months, 
we believe that the long term market 
dynamics remain unchanged. 
The number of Safeguard
®
 customers 
reached 15, representing c40% of total 
polymer banknote issuers. We also won 
our first coin-to-note customer. 
We continue to invest in developing 
security features suitable for both 
polymer and paper substrates to 
increase differentiation. For customers 
who issue both polymer and paper notes 
in different denominations, substrate 
agnostic features provide a degree 
of consistency which helps to build 
public confidence. 
We are also working closely with 
suppliers to reduce production 
costs, an initiative that will combine 
with our increased scale to further 
improve profitability.
Security Features 
As security features tend to last the 
lifetime of the banknote design, they 
provide a reliable revenue stream. 
The most versatile product in our 
portfolio, security features can be applied 
across all other product lines. 
We aim to grow revenue by cross-selling 
banknote features to IDS and PA&T 
customers. At the same time, our 50%+

Seychelles new currency
We worked closely with the Central Bank of 
Seychelles to produce fully integrated designs

26  De La Rue  Annual Report 2017 market share in commercial banknote 
design provides an ideal platform to 
increase direct sales of security features 
to SPWs. 
A rolling programme of investments 
in R&D maintains our competitiveness 
and creates high barriers to market 
entry. In September 2016, we launched 
holographic foil on polymer with the 
issue of the Gibraltar £100 note – and 
holographic technology is also being 
applied to laminate features for the ID 
market. We launched six new products 
in May 2017, including four security 
features that were developed using 
our existing technologies.
We aim to accelerate technology 
development through partnerships 
and bolt-on acquisitions, such as the 
purchase of the Lippmann technology. 
While its main applications are 
authentication labels and anti-tampering 
packaging, this 3D hologram technology 
can also be applied to identity 
documents and, with modification, 
to banknotes. 
Overall, the Currency business benefited 
from an improved mix in Banknote Print 
and higher volumes in Banknote Paper, 
which partially offset the impact of the 
security features contract that concluded 
in the prior year. Revenue fell by 1% year 
on year to £350.6m (2015/16: £353.3m). 
The lower revenue and change in sales 
mix resulted in a 9% decline in adjusted 
operating profit.
We achieved good volumes in Banknote 
Print of 7.1bn notes (2015/16: 7.1bn) in 
the year despite the decommissioning 
of two print lines as part of the 
footprint restructuring programme. 
This demonstrated not only our sales 
capability, but also the flexibility of 
our manufacturing capacity following 
the restructuring.
Banknote Paper volumes increased by 
18% to 11,800 tonnes (2015/16: 10,000 
tonnes), primarily driven by stronger 
external sales. Prices of raw materials 
such as cotton and ink have increased 
substantially in recent months and are 
expected to remain high throughout the 
coming year. 
Polymer almost quadrupled in volume to 
380 tonnes in the year, demonstrating 
continuing good momentum. Margins are 
expected to improve over time as we 
continue to reduce production costs and 
build scale.
Security features were adversely 
impacted by the material contract which 
concluded in the prior year. Both revenue 
and operating profit were lower than 
the prior year. However, underlying 
performance, i.e. excluding the impact 
of the concluded contract, was 
encouraging. We launched four new 
features in May 2017 – TrueImage™, 
TextMark™, enhanced Gemini™, 
Kinetic StarChrome
®
 Portrait – further 
strengthening our product portfolio.
At the year end the 12 month order 
book for Currency including estimated 
call-off orders for contracts was £311m 
(2015/16: £278m).
Identity Systems 
We are the world’s largest commercial 
passport producer, with 32% market 
share by volume. At the same time, 
we are looking to grow digital and 
service revenues via two separate 
initiatives: firstly, by selling more to 
existing customers, using our end-to-
end identity management solution, DLR 
Identify™, to help them migrate from 
MRP to ePassport; and secondly, by 
offering full eBorder solutions including 
biometrics verification and border 
control via partnerships. In addition, 
we plan to re-enter the national ID market 
by leveraging our relationships with 
existing customers.
In 2016/17, we won a new multi-year 
contract, renewed three service contracts 
and gained three new customers for 
passport books. We also continued to 
drive direct sales of individual passport 
components, such as passport paper 
and laminate, to SPWs and other 
commercial operators. 
In June 2016, we launched DLR 
Identify™ CRVS
2
 – an extension of DLR 
Identify™, which enables governments 
to record life events of their citizens 
such as births, deaths and marriages. 
These data establish the rights of 
individuals to services such as education 
and health care while also enabling 
governments to plan ahead with 
greater confidence.
Identity Solutions 
Kenya ePassport 
Building on a long term partnership, we have 
recently delivered a new ePassport solution and 
document with polycarbonate bio-data page for 
the Republic of Kenya. Part of the Government’s 
Vision 2030 programme, this complete solution 
means that Kenya is the first member of the East 
African Community to launch a fully compliant 
ePassport that meets both international and 
regional specifications.

 Civil Registration, Vital Statistics. 
As part of the manufacturing footprint 
restructuring programme, we have 
created a centre of excellence for identity 
and security print in Malta, which includes 
the installation of a new polycarbonate 
line. This new capability has further 
strengthened our product offering 
for both passport and national ID. 
Identity Solutions performed well in the 
year. Revenue grew by 5% to £80.6m 
(2015/16: £76.5m), with an improved 
margin of 14.1% (2015/16: 10.8%) from 
better mix of orders. This reflected 
an increased proportion of revenues 
from software and services, as well 
as increased focus on component 
sales. Adjusted operating profit in the 
period increased by 37% to £11.4m 
(2015/16: £8.3m). 
We continue to invest in skills and 
capabilities. During the year, we more 
than doubled our R&D investment 
and added seven new sales people. 
This increase in investment was paid 
for by overhead reduction and efficiency 
in the Currency business.
Product Authentication 
& Traceability 
Product Authentication & Traceability 
(PA&T) operates in two main markets: 
tax revenue protection for governments; 
and brand protection for private 
enterprises. We aim to grow recurring 
revenues in both markets by increasing 
solution sales.
As one of the largest tax stamp 
providers, we continue to strengthen 
our position by leveraging existing 
relationships and expanding our offering 
with service and digital solutions. 
Cameroon became the first customer for 
our track and trace system DLR Certify™ 
during the year, and we are now pursuing 
a number of other opportunities.
We have renewed our focus on the 
fast growing but fragmented enterprise 
brand protection market. Our objective 
is to expand by targeting international 
brands with complex supply chains 
and distribution networks which require 
close monitoring. We also aim to 
accelerate growth through partnerships 
and acquisitions. For example, DuPont 
Authentication’s flagship product Izon
®
 
is recognised as the premier anti-
counterfeiting technology for brand 
protection and is used on a number 
of well-known brands such as Lenovo 
and Brother. 
Furthermore, we are driving direct 
sales of components, such as 
security labels and security features 
IP licensing, to system integrators 
and packaging companies.
PA&T delivered an excellent performance 
in the year. Revenue increased by 20% 
to £34.6m (2015/16: £28.8m), driven 
by growth in tax revenue protection. 
The segment benefited from lower 
production cost, which was partly 
offset by increased investment in R&D 
and sales. Adjusted operating profit 
in the period was up 29% to £9.0m 
(2015/16: £7.0m).
We completed the acquisition of 
DuPont Authentication on 6 January 
2017. Integration of the business was 
completed in April 2017. Excluding the 
acquisition, revenue in the segment grew 
by 13% and adjusted operating profit 
was up 24%.
