action to reduce the cost base 
of both segments to reflect 
the new market realities. 
Despite these issues and their 
impact on the results, we are 
pleased to report encouraging 
underlying progress within our 
core Strategic Marketing segment. 
This segment lies at the centre 
of our long-term growth strategy 
and now represents some 42% 
of Group revenues and 75% of 
Adjusted operating profit. In 
particular, we have seen important 
progress in our pursuit of organic 
growth here, through a number 
of significant new wins coupled 
with increasing collaboration 
between our various businesses 
and further internationalisation.
STRATEGIC REPORT  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Performance 
highlights
Group revenue of £393.2 million  
was 7% higher than the comparable 
period in the previous year, 
bolstered by our Strategic 
Marketing segment, which 
delivered growth of 13%. Excluding 
the effects of acquisition and 
currency movements, organic 
growth across the Group was 5%. 
Revenue within our Books segment 
was 12% ahead of the previous year 
while revenue within our Marketing 
Activation segment was broadly in 
line with the previous year.
The Group’s statutory loss  
before tax of £44.1 million  
(2016 – loss of £5.7 million) 
includes Adjusting Items of  
£68.2 million (2016 – £36.1 million), 
of which £66.1 million relates  
to non-cash items in the current 
period. The non-cash Adjusting 
Items include amortisation  
of acquired intangibles of  
£10.0 million, an impairment 
charge of £33.1 million, mainly  
in the Marketing Activation and  
Books segments, and contingent 
consideration expense of  
£23.0 million. Other Adjusting 
Items include costs related to  
the St Ives Defined Benefits 
Pension Scheme of £1.9 million 
and restructuring costs of  
£3.0 million offset by gain on 
disposal of properties of  
£2.8 million.
The Group’s Adjusted profit  
before tax declined to  
£24.1 million (2016 – £30.4 million) 
and Adjusted basic earnings per 
share decreased by 24% to  
13.39 pence (2016 – 17.61 pence).
The year saw further growth 
in our Strategic Marketing 
segment despite a number 
of project cancellations and 
deferrals in the last quarter of 
the previous financial year, which 
impacted revenue growth and 
operating margin during the first 
half of the 2017 financial year. 
However, we are encouraged 
by the progress that has been 
made in the second half of the 
year to replace the cancelled 
work and return the segment 
to its previous levels of organic 
growth and operating margin. 
Balance Sheet
Net debt as at 28 July 2017  
was £54.6 million, down from the 
£80.8 million as at 29 July 2016, 
representing a net debt  
Introduction
Overall, it has been a challenging 
year for the Group, which is 
reflected in the reported results 
for the period, albeit with a 
much improved performance 
during the second half. Our 
focus has been on addressing 
the issues of the past whilst 
taking decisive action to improve 
efficiency of our two legacy 
segments and further strengthen 
the Group’s balance sheet. 
The principal challenges remain  
in our legacy Marketing Activation 
and Books segments where, 
despite their strong market 
positions, increased competition 
continues to exert downward 
pressure on margins. In response, 
the Board has taken immediate  
 
We continue to make good progress 
with our collaboration agenda with

with more than one business across

to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of  
1.6 times (29 July 2016 – 2.0 times). 
Further reducing the Group’s 
indebtedness remains a priority  
for the Board.
Dividend
The Board has reviewed St Ives’ 
near-term dividend policy to 
reflect the impact of the issues 
experienced in the Group’s 
legacy businesses and the costs 
involved in the ongoing cost-
reduction initiatives. In doing so 
it has balanced the importance 
of dividends to shareholders, 
the importance of investing in 
the further organic growth of the 
Group’s core Strategic Marketing 
segment, and the strengthening 
of the balance sheet. Against 
that background, the Board has 
proposed a final dividend of  
1.30 pence per share, giving a  
full-year dividend of 1.95 pence 
per share, a decrease of 75% 
against last year’s full-year dividend 
of 7.80 pence. The Board will  
re-evaluate the longer-term 
dividend policy in due course. 
If approved by shareholders,  
the final dividend of 1.30 pence 
will be paid on 18 December 2017 
to the shareholders on the register 
at 24 November 2017, with  
an ex-dividend date of  
23 November 2017.
Strategic priorities
The Board remains confident in 
our long-term strategy for further 
growth, which is built around 
the Group’s Strategic Marketing 
segment and remains centred 
around three key priorities:
Collaboration
We continue to make good 
progress with our collaboration 
agenda with over 200 of our clients 
currently working with more than 
one business across the Group; a 
39% increase compared with the 
150 reported in the last financial 
year. These include major brands 
such as Standard Life, Paddy 
Power and Expedia. 
In addition, we continue to see an 
increase in demand for integrated 
solutions from clients within our 
Strategic Marketing segment, 
which, while aligning to our 
collaboration agenda, has led us 
to review and evolve our operating 
model within the segment. This 
has also resulted in us bringing a 
number of our Digital and Data 
businesses closer together. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES

ensure that the cost base reflects 
the future level of volumes we  
now expect.
Overall, we remain confident in 
the long-term growth strategy 
currently being pursued in 
Strategic Marketing, and in the 
quality of our businesses within 
that segment, as illustrated by 
the major international clients 
and contracts they continue to 
attract. However, we recognise the 
need to address, decisively, the 
effect that the legacy businesses 
are having on the Group’s overall 
performance and on our ability to 
generate value for shareholders. 
This, together with further 
strengthening of our balance 
sheet, remains a top priority for  
the Board looking forward.

Internationalisation
Many of our businesses now 
deliver international solutions for 
clients. Most notably, 39% of our 
Strategic Marketing revenue now 
comes from clients based outside 
the UK (2016 – 37%), with nine 
businesses within this segment 
currently servicing clients on an 
international basis. 
Our strategy for developing our 
overseas footprint remains client-
driven with new office openings 
only taking place in territories 
where we can identify lucrative 
client-led opportunities. We 
will continue to be disciplined 
in our implementation of this 
strategy, targeting opportunities 
in large markets or in those 
with the potential for significant 
and sustainable growth, where 
offices are capable of generating 
appropriate returns within a 
reasonable period of time. 
Acquisition
Given the recent challenges 
across the Group, we are currently 
prioritising organic over acquisitive 
growth, including leveraging  
the investments we have made  
in existing propositions and  
in new offices.
In the longer-term, the acquisition 
of further complementary 
marketing services businesses that 
add value to our existing portfolio 
and operate in our chosen growth 
areas of Digital, Data and Insight 
services will continue to be an 
important element of the growth 
strategy of our core Strategic 
Marketing segment.
Outlook
 
Trading across our Strategic 
Marketing segment has recovered 
and we have been encouraged 
by new projects being won 
from existing and new clients. 
Our pipeline for the first half of 
the new financial year is very 
encouraging and we are excited 
by the opportunities that the 
increased collaboration between 
our businesses is generating.
While trading conditions within 
our Marketing Activation segment 
continue to be very challenging, 
we have taken decisive action to 
increase efficiency and reduce 
costs, and remain focussed on 
diversifying into other sectors. 
Similarly, within our Books business 
we have taken further steps to  
 
Tesco turned to mobile services 
provider The App Business 
(‘TAB’) to respond to an 
ever-increasing demand for 
convenience among London-
based grocery shoppers. The 
answer was Tesco Now, a service 
with no minimum basket order, 
delivering groceries quickly and 
on demand. 
Tesco had already conducted 
experiments to collect shopper 
data, providing early insight 
for a discovery phase run by 
TAB’s strategy team. Research, 
focussed workshops and in-depth 
shopper interviews clarified 
customer expectation, objectives, 
and predicted order time and 
location.
Service priorities were set for 
the app, empowering the joint 
team to make leaner, faster 
decisions. With Tesco being such 
a strong brand, it was essential 
for the app to behave and feel 
like an integrated channel. TAB’s 
designers developed a sleek user 
interface that maintained the 
familiar Tesco brand experience 
on mobile.
In parallel, Tesco created a 
sophisticated middleware 
layer, optimising data for fast, 
efficient delivery to mobile. 
This was a prerequisite for a 
speedy, modern, intuitive mobile 
experience, and also allowed 
Tesco Now to integrate with 
back-end systems.
Communication and scheduling 
were critical. TAB and Tesco 
worked side by side to build 
their respective components 
via a modular architecture. 
This delivered acute flexibility, 
ensuring Tesco Now can grow, 
evolve and be maintained 
efficiently in the future.
Working alongside Tesco’s 
experts, TAB’s test engineers 
conducted extensive usability 
and exploratory trials. TAB 
took an innovative approach, 
automating the core end-to-end 
journeys that customers make 
through the app. Short, quick 
feedback loops embedded in  
the app will continue to provide 
data on emerging pain points and 
highlight areas of improvement 
for future releases. 
TAB and Tesco’s mutual focus and 
dedication have been a decisive 
factor in the pilot project’s 
success to date, with further  
roll-out planned.
