Our 357,000 sq ft regional distribution development 
in Warrington let to Amazon for 15 years
Last year was a record for distribution 
warehousing take up, driven by the rapid 
growth in online retailing.
Our letting to Amazon at Warrington  
occurred just five weeks after we completed 
the development. This warehouse will 
be integral to their same day and next 
day delivery proposition.
