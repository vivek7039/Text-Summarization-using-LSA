Chairman’ s Statement
Chairman’ s Statement
The AstraZeneca Board sets the Company’s
strategy and policies and monitors progress
towards meeting our various objectives. 2002
was a busy year involving strategic reviews of 
markets, development and key technologies
as well as the full range of corporate
governance matters including a review of the
functioning of the Board itself. 
AstraZeneca has always taken corporate
governance very seriously and this positions
us well in today’ s demanding environment. 
The new US Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and
other similar initiatives are requiring changes
to corporate governance processes in a
number of areas, which will further reinforce
good practice. AstraZeneca has a good
reputation and track record and we are
committed to maintaining this, supported by
our Code of Conduct, internal auditing to
ensure group-wide compliance and clear and
transparent financial reporting. In addition, the
Board has nominated Sir Peter Bonfield as
the senior Non-Executive Director contact for
investors wishing to raise any potential
corporate governance issues.
During the year , we made good progress in
further developing our overall corporate
responsibility (CR) programme. This included
publication and wide communication of our
CR Policy and Management Standards. This
work is led by a cross-functional, cross-
territorial CR Committee which reports to
Dame Bridget Ogilvie, the Non-Executive
Director with responsibility for overseeing CR
within AstraZeneca. I am pleased to report
that our continued progress in 2002 was
recognised by our inclusion for the second
year running in the Dow Jones World
Sustainability Index, with an improved rating
over 2001 and for the first time in their
European Index.
AstraZeneca has contributed fully to national
and international proposals for improving
access to medicines in developing countries.
These proposed policies strive to ensure that
2002 was a year of both
opportunity and challenge for
AstraZeneca and the
pharmaceutical industry in
general.
The demand for modern medicines continues
to grow, driven by demographic changes,
expanded geographic markets and new
technologies. T o some extent, these positive
drivers are being offset by pressure on prices,
escalating R&D and marketing costs,
increased regulatory demands and uncertain
financial markets.
After a successful merger, it has been
important for AstraZeneca to continue
productivity improvements throughout the
Company in R&D, production, sales and
administration. This continuous process of
increasing productivity will safeguard a
competitive position in coming years. 2002
has also been a year of increased
investments in certain developing countries.
A stronger market position in these fast-
growing countries will support AstraZeneca’s
long term growth ambition. Finally , and most
importantly , the Company has maintained
a high innovation rate with a resulting strong
product portfolio on the market today and 
in the pipeline.
The year has seen much progress. Sales 
increased 9% and earnings per share before
exceptional items increased 7%. The ordinary
dividend to shareholders recommended by
the Board was maintained in dollar terms, 
with a second interim dividend of $0.47
(28.5 pence, SEK 3.99) per Ordinary Share 
to be paid in April 2003 bringing the total
dividend for the year to $0.70 (43.2 pence,
SEK 6.20). The share re-purchase
programme continues in 2003. Despite these
achievements, in today’ s difficult financial
markets, the share price performance has
been disappointing for both shareholders
and the Company .

the long term needs of patients in both
developed and developing countries can be met

During the year , Lars Ramqvist retired from his
role as Non-Executive Director of
AstraZeneca and we welcomed John
Buchanan as a new Non-Executive Director.
In June, Claes Wilhelmsson retired as an
Executive Director of AstraZeneca and Åke
Stavling stepped down as an Executive
Director at the end of January 2003. Claes
and Åke played important roles in the
formation and integration of AstraZeneca and
undertook key responsibilities for R&D and
Business Development respectively . My
Board colleagues and I thank them and Lars
warmly for their contribution to the Company .
I would also like to thank my colleagues on
the Board for their excellent contribution.
Everyone at AstraZeneca was delighted to
learn of the knighthood bestowed on our
Chief Executive, T om McKillop in the Queen’s
2002 Birthday Honours for services to the
pharmaceutical industry . I would also like to
pay tribute to AstraZeneca employees
worldwide who contributed to our success
through their creativity , commitment and hard
work.
In 2003, we will continue to implement our 
product portfolio transformation strategy and
initiatives to improve our overall efficiency and 
thereby address the growing competitive
pressures. It will be another challenging year ,
but one we face with confidence.
