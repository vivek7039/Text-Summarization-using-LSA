STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Prudent capital 
allocation is at the core 
of everything that we 
do, and we spend each 
dollar in a way that 
creates the greatest 
value for our 
shareholders. 
Delivering on our focus
I was pleased to welcome Esa Ikaheimonen 
as Chief Financial Officer and Bill Higgs as 
Chief Operating Officer, both of whom bring 
the qualities and experience to help us deliver 
on these goals.
A primary aim was to maximise the 
generation of free cash flow from our 
producing oil assets in the KRI. In the 
year, monthly payments totalling $263 
million were received from the KRG, with 
our ongoing focus on cost and disciplined 
capital allocation helping to convert 
this into $142 million in free cash flow, 
before bond interest payments. 
This figure was boosted in the second half 
of the year by additional proceeds received 
under the RSA. This was a very positive deal 
for Genel, and helped to fulfil our second aim 
for 2017 of converting the receivable into 
cash generation. 
Writing off the past receivable in favour 
of increased future cash flows helped to 
simplify our balance sheet while significantly 
increasing cash flow. Under the RSA, Genel 
receives override payments of 4.5% of Tawke 
gross PSC revenues for the five year period 
from 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2022, while 
capacity building payments (‘CBP’) on the 
profit share element of our Tawke entitlement 
are eliminated over the entire life of the field. 
This definitive agreement was the positive 
culmination of a constructive dialogue with 
the KRG, and has already provided significant 
benefits to Genel, with the promise of more to 
come. $19 million was received in 2017 under 
the override, and the elimination of CBP 
resulted in a $7 million benefit to Genel in Q4. 
Cash-generative oil assets
The receipt of 4.5% of gross Tawke 
PSC revenues means that the positive 
performance of Peshkabir adds material cash 
flow to Genel. The successful Peshkabir-2 
well was followed by the equally successful 
Peshkabir-3 well, and production of c.5,000 
bopd from the former was commingled with 
the latter to end the year at a very consistent 
15,000 bopd from the field. Working with 
the operator, we will continue to focus 
on Peshkabir in 2018. 
The Peshkabir-4 well spud in February, 
and will potentially be followed by a further 
five wells in 2018. Field production is 
expected by the operator to reach 30,000 
bopd by the summer and continue to ramp 
up in the second half of the year. This is 
very encouraging, and when added to the 
robust production from the main Tawke 
field, highly cash-generative.
Despite operational activity at the Tawke PSC 
being focused on maximising the potential 
of Peshkabir, general Tawke field production 
was solid in 2017. Work done at Taq Taq 
also provided encouragement. While the 
field declined year-on-year as anticipated, 
production was relatively stable in the second 
half of 2017, with the TT-29w well providing 
a positive result in December 2017. The well 
encountered a deeper free water level 
and more extensive oil bearing cretaceous 
reservoirs on the northern flank of the field 
than previously forecast, and potentially 
opens up further development avenues. 
This well result, and the stabilisation 
of production, led to a 12% reserves 
replacement at Taq Taq for 2P, and 
40% reserves replacement at the higher 
confidence 1P level, as upwards technical 
revisions partially offset the five million 
barrels of production in 2017. 2P reserves 
more than doubling at Peshkabir also 
bolstered reserves at the Tawke PSC, 
and prudent expenditure will allow ongoing 
cash generation from across the Genel 
portfolio for years to come.
Opportunities for growth
Prudent capital allocation is at the core of 
everything that we do, and we spend each 
dollar in a way that creates the greatest value 
for our shareholders. The most cost-effective 
way of spending is to invest in our producing 
assets, as money spent is cost-recoverable. 
In 2017, 66% of our capital expenditure was 
spent on our producing fields. As payments 
are received monthly, this is currently 
recovered through cash receipts within 
approximately 90 days.
This focus on expenditure and value creation, 
with a cash investment of $345 million in 
buying back bonds at below par reducing 
gross cash debt from $675 million to $300 
million, helped to reduce our net debt as at 
end-2017 to $135 million. This was a 44% 
reduction year-on-year from the end-2016 
figure of $241 million, providing Genel with 
the financial flexibility to take advantage 
of new opportunities. We are focused on 
finding those opportunities that promise 
to add to our financial strength, and capital 
allocation will remain biased on near-term 
cash generation. Below: Operations at Taq Taq GENEL ENERGY

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S 
STATEMENT CONTINUED
Bina Bawi and Miran remain 
a significant opportunity for 
Genel, and we will work to 
convert that opportunity into 
shareholder value in 2018.

Some of these near-term cash-generative 
opportunities can be found within the Genel 
portfolio. The significant increase in high-
value Bina Bawi 2C oil resources we saw in 
the recent CPR by RPS Consultants offers 
a tangible opportunity. As Bina Bawi oil is 
both high-quality and in close proximity 
to the Taq Taq field and associated export 
infrastructure, it is an attractive near-term 
development candidate for the Company. 
This would be the beginning of tangible value 
crystallisation of our Bina Bawi and Miran 
assets, another key strategic focus for Genel. 
In 2017 we moved towards this goal through 
the finalisation of PSC amendments together 
with the Gas Lifting Agreements (‘GLA’s) for 
both fields, incorporating the commercial 
terms as announced in the term sheets 
signed in 2015. This provided certainty and 
allowed the progression of talks with potential 
partners, which were slowed down following 
developments in the KRI in the second half of 
2017. Entering 2018 we are now in a stronger 
position to move the project forward, with 
upstream materially de-risked. The updated 
CPRs, announced in January 2018 confirmed 
a c.40% increase in gross combined 2C 
resources to almost 15 Tcf. Even at a 1C 
level, gross raw gas resource estimates are 
significantly higher than the gas volumes 
agreed under the Gas Lifting Agreements. 
The extension to the schedule for satisfying 
the conditions precedent, signed in January 
2018, provided further clarity over the 
timetable, and the bolstered financial position 
of the Company means that we are well-
positioned to progress with the building 
blocks of value creation. We have optionality 
about the progression of the project, with 
the ability to take the upstream towards FID 
with 100% ownership, should this be the 
best way to maximise shareholder value. 
Expenditure will remain prudent, as the 
upstream development matches the progress 
of the midstream. An extended well test at 
Bina Bawi will then provide valuable data on 
well deliverability and gas composition, and 
we will proactively engage with potential 
farm-in partners at the best possible time and 
terms for Genel. Bina Bawi and Miran remain 
a significant opportunity for Genel, and we 
will work to convert that opportunity into 
shareholder value in 2018.
Genel will also make appropriate expenditure 
on our African exploration assets, which 
offer longer-term opportunities. Following 
the completion of over 3,000 km of 2D 
seismic in Somaliland, which was purchased 
from the government, the first in this highly 
prospective area for over 25 years, we are 
excited about the long-term opportunities 
and see significant geological potential on 
the Genel acreage position. This 10-month 
seismic acquisition project was completed 
with an impeccable HSE and security record. 
There were successful elections held in 2017, 
and increasing international investment 
is opening up opportunities. Of particular 
note is DP World’s almost half a billion 
dollar investment in the port at Berbera, 
which being just 100 km from our licence 
offers a clear route to market. 2018 will see 
the processing of the Somaliland seismic, 
which will then guide the optimal strategy 
to maximise future value.
Offshore Morocco the conversion of our 
well commitment to a 3D seismic acquisition 
programme was both cost-effective for 
Genel and will help materially de-risk the Sidi 
Moussa licence. It is worth noting ENI’s recent 
acquisition of the licence block adjacent 
to Sidi Moussa. 
Outlook
Genel is a highly cash-generative business, 
and we expect to continue to generate 
significant free cash flow throughout 
2018. Prudent expenditure will progress 
the significant near-term opportunities 
within the portfolio, and our sound 
financial position allows us to explore the 
possibility of bolstering our portfolio and 
adding to the strength of our core assets. 
I look forward to updating all stakeholders 
on our progress throughout the year.  ANNUALREPORT2017
