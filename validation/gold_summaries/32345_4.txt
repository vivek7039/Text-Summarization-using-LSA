Sector specialists with engineering 
embedded in our DNA
Deep sector expertise
In February 2017, we announced that 
we were going to realign the business 
around the four core sectors in which 
we operate. Grouping our business into 
Marine, Land, Aviation and Cavendish 
Nuclear brings us even closer to our 
customers and markets, allows our 
teams in each sector to really focus on 
the capabilities we offer and makes 
the Group easier to understand for all 
our stakeholders. Most importantly, 
it provides us with a better platform 
for future growth, both in the UK and 
globally. We are still the same company, 
doing the same things, but aligning to 
sectors will help us do it better.
The realignment will help us achieve 
our growth ambitions. Supported by 
technology and technical training, 
it enables easier identification 
and development of international 
opportunities through Global Growth.
Each sector has a strong base of both 
defence and civil customers, with 
operations of scale in the UK and 
internationally and importantly all 
four have growth opportunities across 
the globe.
Furthermore, each sector is underpinned 
by deep technical knowledge and 
expertise and is already demonstrating 
a willingness to embrace Babcock’s 
transformational change and 
performance improvement models. 
Through infrastructure, assets, 
technology or regulation, all four 
sectors are characterised by high 
barriers to entry. Each of our sectors 
is now customer‑facing and shares deep 
sector technical knowledge, experience 
and understanding of its industry. 
Moving to a sector‑based reporting 
structure that is more closely aligned 
with our markets serves to provide 
clarity and focus. This resonates with 
our employees, our customers and our 
shareholders, creating a stronger base 
from which to build future growth.

Our sectors
Historically we have consistently built up our expertise and commercial positions across 
four key sectors: marine, land, aviation and nuclear. The realignment into our four new 
sectors provides employees, customers and investors with a clearer, more aligned 
Babcock and an improved platform for growth.
Our capabilities
Over the years we have continued to 
develop our capabilities and specialist 
skills in our four sectors, each of which 
provides good opportunities for growth 
in both the UK and, increasingly, 
internationally. The realignment will 
enable us to effectively leverage our 
capabilities and share expertise across 
the Group through four key enablers:
Marine
Delivers a wide array of complex through‑life 
marine engineering services ranging from 
supporting UK and international naval 
fleets, commercial marine, engineering 
consultancy, weapons handling, equipment 
support, intelligence and cyber‑security and 
technical training, all delivered through unique 
owned and managed infrastructure to defence 
and civil customers across the globe.
Technology
We have deep sector‑specific technical 
expertise with decades of experience; we 
understand risk and resilience and are able 
to deliver availability with innovation. We 
are equipment‑agnostic which enables 
us to work with any OEM to specify and 
support its products. We have the ability 
to identify and integrate technology into 
our through‑life support.
Training
Technical training is an integral part of our 
engineering offering. It is a fundamental and 
ongoing requirement and a core part of our 
expertise. Driving technical training across 
the Group allows us to share innovation and 
successful methodology across sectors to 
ensure our customers make the best use 
of their critical resources.
Infrastructure
We have experience of operating and 
managing complex and critical infrastructure 
assets in highly regulated environments, from 
unique owned marine facilities, critical 
air and land fleets, nuclear licensed sites, 
naval, air and army bases, technical training 
sites to customer‑owned aircraft.
Global Growth
A fundamental driver of Babcock’s realignment 
is the aim to grow our international 
business. This focus will allow us to recognise 
international opportunities and support all 
four sector teams to sell and deliver innovative 
services and transformation models to targeted 
markets and customers. We will:
• drive local country business development to 
identify and build a pipeline of opportunities
• invest in skills and frameworks needed to 
capture international opportunities
• bring together local and UK sector teams to 
support both bidding and delivery
• provide skilled people to drive, facilitate and 
establish new business across the Group.
Aviation
Delivers a wide array of critical engineering 
services to defence and civil customers, 
ranging from technical training of advanced 
fixed and rotary wing pilots, engineering, 
equipment support and maintenance, airbase 
management and logistics, to the operation 
of owned and customer‑owned aviation 
fleets delivering emergency and offshore 
services across the globe.
Land
Provides large‑scale critical fleet management 
and training for customer‑owned defence, 
emergency services, global airport and 
commercial vehicle fleets – comprising 
around 80,000 vehicles – while also providing 
engineering services and technical training for 
customers worldwide.
Cavendish Nuclear
Delivers complex nuclear engineering on major 
nuclear decommissioning programmes and 
projects across the UK and nuclear engineering 
services in training, operation support, 
newbuild programme management, design 
and installation and critical safety to both 
public and private customers. In the UK and, 
increasingly, internationally.
