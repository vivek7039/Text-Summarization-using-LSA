STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 
I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to address Informa 
Shareholders, as the Group comes to the end of a year  
of operational progress and improved performance that 
included the integration of Penton Information Services,  
as well as the successful completion of our programme of 
measured change and improved performance, the 2014-2017 
Growth Acceleration Plan (GAP). 
COMPLETION OF GROWTH ACCELERATION PLAN
In 2017 , Informa delivered a fourth consecutive year of growth  
in revenue, adjusted earnings, cash flow and dividends. The year 
also saw the Group fulfil its ambition to return all four Operating 
Divisions to positive underlying revenue growth. 
These results are built on the foundations of the previous four 
years, and the measures taken under GAP to increase the 
Group’s focus on customers and vertical industries, build market 
positions and strengthen overall operational capabilities. 
This started with talent and experience, including appointing  
new Divisional CEOs and a dedicated CTO in each Division.  
It continued through proactive portfolio management, exiting 
businesses and markets that were not core or where we were 
sub-scale, and expanding in geographies and verticals where the 
growth opportunities were most attractive, particularly in the US. 
INVESTMENT, EXPANSION AND THE INTEGRATION 
OF PENTON INFORMATION SERVICES
Significant capital has also been invested inside and outside the 
Group. Internally, this has included around £80m on improving 
systems and technology capabilities, enhancing customer 
platforms and supporting innovation to bring new products to life. 
Externally, the Group has pursued a targeted and disciplined 
acquisition strategy, building scale in the US and a leading 
position in B2B events, most significantly through adding Penton 
in late 2016. The effective integration of Penton has been a major 
focus for management in 2017 to ensure the Group makes the 
most of future opportunities created by the combination.
REACH AND DEPTH IN INTERNATIONAL VERTICALS 
Through these measures and more, the Group has positioned 
itself to take advantage of growth in its end markets. Within the 
broad and global market for knowledge and information, Informa 
has chosen to focus on verticals that are international, with high 
levels of growth, innovation or development, where supply chains 
tend to be fragmented and where specialist intelligence and the 
ability to connect with business partners and peers is 
therefore highly valued. Examples of these industry 
verticals can be found throughout this report. 
Informa is an international Group, with an increasing 
weighting to the US, and your Board remains alert to 
economic and regulatory developments in all key jurisdictions in 
which the business operates. Most recently, this has included the 
likely effect of changes to US tax legislation through the 2017 Tax 
Cut and Jobs Act and the potential impact of Britain’s exit from 
the European Union, the latter of which is not considered material 
due to Informa’s relatively low exposure to the region.
DELIVERING PERFORMANCE FOR SHAREHOLDERS
The combination of operational capability and increased 
international reach and depth in vertical markets has delivered  
a steady improvement in Informa’s performance in recent years, 
culminating in underlying revenue growth of more than 3% in 2017 . 
More importantly, it has created a platform for continued growth 
and scale in the future, and your Board firmly believes this Group 
and its management team has the potential for more. 
The approach for 2018 and beyond is led by this ambition, and 
this is why the Directors fully support the Group’s recommended 
offer for UBM plc, formally announced on 30 January 2018, to 
create a leading B2B information services group. 
It is a unique opportunity to combine the strengths of both 
companies, build on the success of Informa’s Growth Acceleration 
Plan and UBM’s Events First strategy, and create an enlarged 
Group with the scale and specialist capabilities to capture this 
market’s long-term growth potential. 
These decisions and actions have been taken with a view to 
creating value for Shareholders and our wider stakeholders.  
From higher growth and greater professional opportunities to  
a continued positive impact on our communities, the ambition is 
to build a robust and high performing business that benefits all.
For Shareholders, this is in part reflected through a commitment 
to dividend returns. In 2014, the initial target was to increase 
dividends by at least 2% per annum. This commitment has 
steadily been increased, reflecting confidence in the Group’s 
improving performance. In 2017 , the Board approved a final 
dividend per share of 13.80p, taking total divdends for the year  
to 20.45p, an increase of 6%.
GOVERNING THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE  
AND GROWTH 
Your Board will continue to oversee, support and challenge, 
where appropriate, management’s plans for 2018. 
We are pleased to recognise our responsibilities to ensure  
the Group grows and operates in a way that benefits wider 
stakeholders. During 2017 , Informa’s colleagues were a  
particular focus. The Board received the views of colleagues 
through formal feedback channels and first hand, conducting a 
number of enjoyable and insightful town halls in the US and UK. 
It has been a particular pleasure to meet new colleagues and 
businesses who joined through the acquisition of Penton, and 
who have embraced Informa’s culture with enthusiasm. 
Culture remains a matter of regular Board discussion and we fully 
support management’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a 
working environment based on respect and openness, which 
enables all colleagues to fully participate in the life of the Group 
and is an important contributor to the Group’s ongoing success. 
Thanks to all Informa colleagues for their hard work and valuable 
contributions to 2017’s performance, to the management team, 
and to Shareholders for their continued support.

VIEW FROM THE BOARD: THE GROWTH 
ACCELERATION PLAN 
What was the thinking behind GAP?
In 2014, the Board believed Informa had an opportunity 
to do more in its markets. The market for knowledge 
and information was growing but also specialising. 
This meant making some changes to how the Group 
operated, to the portfolio mix and how capital was 
allocated. It meant scaling in some areas and 
streamlining in others, and making additional 
investments. GAP was conceived as a four-year 
programme to improve growth in all the Group’s 
businesses and build a platform for future growth  
and scale.
What changes have you seen? 
The change has been measured, but when you 
compare the Group of 2013 with the Group of today, a 
lot has been achieved in reshaping and strengthening 
the Group. What was a quite fragmented business is 
now organised through four clear Operating Divisions, 
with real focus around customers and end market 
verticals. Operational capabilities and talent have 
been strengthened, particularly in technology, and 
culturally there is greater alignment between the 
Group’s success and individual actions and contributions.
What role has the Board played in GAP? 
The Board has overseen and closely monitored  
the progress of each GAP objective, through  
regular engagement with senior managers from 
across the business, encouraged and supported 
executive management, and provided feedback  
and challenge where required. 
We have also taken the opportunity to bring new 
skills onto the Board over this period as Directors 
have retired, appointing new colleagues with 
particular technology, international and/or FTSE 100 
experience to provide support in areas specifically 
relevant to Informa’s development. 
How does this carry over to 2018 and beyond?
Informa enters 2018 a better business; more robust, 
predictable, with an improved growth trajectory  
and, as intended, a platform for future growth and 
further scale. Informa’s recommended offer for  
UBM builds on this platform, bringing benefits  
of scale and future opportunity. GAP is what has  
made this possible, installing the capabilities to  
help ensure the combination generates value and 
rewards Shareholders long into the future.
