 We continue to make good progress with the 
implementation of our strategy and we have 
delivered a good set of results, growing the 
business organically and driving efficiencies to 
fund £8.5 million of incremental investment in 
R&D, sales and wider business infrastructure.
Safe and ethical working is the top priority for 
the Group. 2017 was a disappointing year from 
a safety perspective. Our lost time accident rate 
(accidents per 100,000 hours worked) increased 
from 0.27 to 0.39 in the year. In part this was 
the result of a serious road traffic accident in the 
USA when a minibus carrying members of our 
Thermal Products operations team to our plant 
was hit by another vehicle. Nineteen employees 
were injured in this incident. However, we have 
also seen increased accident rates in several 
businesses beyond this one serious accident, 
and we have further work to do to improve. 
Our ‘thinkSAFE’ programme, launched in 2015, 
is the vehicle for us to do this and we will be 
increasing the breadth and intensity of activity 
on safety further in 2018. 
We are now two years into the initial three-year 
implementation phase of our strategy. We laid 
out six execution priorities for the first three 
years and I am pleased with the progress we 
have made against those during the year. It will 
take several years to see the full benefits from 
the changes and investments that we are making, 
but we have made a good start and are starting 
to see some early successes across the business. 
The foundation for this has been our operational 
improvements. These accelerated during the 
year, and consequently we have been able to 
invest more in the business during the year in 
technology development, sales and increasing 
functional capability and depth.
 > The net debt* to EBITDA* ratio at the 
year-end improved to 1.2x (2016: 1.6x), 
following the disposal of two businesses. 
The Group remains well within its banking 
covenants and has good headroom and 
balance sheet capacity for appropriate 
future investment. 
 > On a statutory reporting basis operating 
profit improved to £158.1 million 
(2016: £107.3 million) and profit before tax 
improved to £135.8 million (2016: £87.9 
million), both of these benefited from 
year-on-year movements in exchange rates 
and specific adjusting items of £45.7 million 
(2016: £(1.7) million charge, 2015: £(16.0) 
million charge). See pages 30 to 39 for 
further details.
Group strategy
Our long-term strategy is to build a Group 
with distinctive capabilities and performance 
in three areas:
 > materials science capability and technology.
 > application engineering capability.
 > customer and end-market focus.
We have strengths in these areas today, and 
developing these capabilities further will be our 
focus in the coming years. Through the application 
of our core skills in these areas we will add value 
as a Group. 
We will apply these skills in markets that are 
growing and where we can operate at scale, 
on a global basis. We will apply these skills to 
solve difficult materials-based problems for our 
customers, ethically and safely and where they 
value our differentiated solutions. This set of 
capabilities provides a resilient and distinctive 
source of differentiation and is an enduring 
strategic goal for the Group.
2018 is the final year of our initial 
implementation phase and we will 
be investing a further £8 million in our 
capabilities, largely in technology and 
sales, funded through further operational 
improvements. These are important 
investments to build the long-term health 
of the Group and will position us for more 
resilient financial performance and faster growth 
in the years to come. 
Group results 
The trading conditions were difficult coming into 
the year with improvements evident in sentiment, 
but limited progress in our markets. Conditions 
have improved through the year with improved 
order momentum in the major industrial 
geographies from the second quarter onwards. 
With the better market conditions, and the 
impact of strategic and structural changes, 
the Group has performed well:
 > Group revenue for 2017 was £1,021.5 
million, 3.3% above 2016 at reported 
exchange rates. On an organic constant 
currency basis * Group revenue was 
higher by 1.4%. 
 > The 2017 Group headline operating profit* 
margin was 1 1.7% (2016: 1 1.8%) with the 
impacts of divestments largely offset by 
operational efficiencies and the benefit 
of higher revenue.
 > Group headline earnings per share* 
was 22.5 pence (2016: 22.7 pence).
 > Capital expenditure was £34.4 million 
(2016: £39.5 million). The Group has 
continued its investment in additional capability 
and capacity to support future growth. 
 > Operating cash generation* was good, with 
a cash flow from operations of £129.5 million, 
excluding the one-off payment to the US 
pensions scheme, (2016: £128.3 million). 
Net debt* at the year end was £181.3 million 
(2016: £242.5 million).

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Strategic Report To reach this goal we need to develop our 
capabilities further and address performance 
gaps in the business. In February 2016 we set six 
execution priorities that we are pursuing through 
to the end of 2018 to strengthen the Group and 
deliver resilient financial performance and 
faster growth:
1. Move to a global business structure.
We completed the move to a global business 
structure in March 2016. The change in structure 
has improved global co-ordination across the 
Group and has sharpened accountability within 
each of our global business units. This is an 
important change to enable the wider changes 
we need to make and we completed this without 
any loss of business momentum.
2. Improve technical leadership. 
Our objective is to strengthen our technical 
teams and increase our investment in research 
and development to around 4% of sales (from 
2.8% of sales in 2015) over the next two to 
three years. 
We have increased our investment in technology 
development by £5.1 million in 2017, to £34.3 
million, representing 3.4% of sales. We have 
expanded the technical teams in our new Carbon 
Science Centre of Excellence and in our new 
Metals and Joining Centre of Excellence. Further 
recruitment is underway in both places to expand 
the teams during 2018. We have also added 
technical resources to our Structural Ceramics 
Centre of Excellence to develop new products 
and processes for the structural ceramics 
business. It typically takes a number of years for 
these new developments to come to market, 
but in the case of our Metals and Joining Centre 
of Excellence, we have been able to accelerate 
new development of a new cored-wire alloy 
and product samples were in trials with customers 
by the end of the year. These are vital investments 
to enhance the future differentiation and growth 
of the business and we are planning to invest 
a further £5 million in technical resources and 
technology development in our Centres of 
Excellence and across the business in 2018.
3. Improve operational execution. 
Our objective is to strengthen our operational 
capabilities, reduce operational costs to fund 
reinvestment in the business, and improve 
delivery and quality performance.
We made very good progress with our 
operational improvements in 2017 with a 
net £8.5 million of savings generated to fund 
reinvestment in the business in the year (against 
our target of £6 million). These were generated 
from a wide range of improvement projects 
in every business including larger lean projects 
looking at end-to-end waste elimination, 
smaller scale continuous improvement projects, 
procurement projects and further use of 
automation. We made a number of changes 
to strengthen our operational teams and 
continuous improvement capabilities during 
the year and we are well positioned to deliver 
the further £8 million improvements we are 
targeting in 2018. 
4. Drive sales effectiveness and 
market focus. 
Our objective is to strengthen our sales capability, 
and increase the intensity of effort with new 
customers and in new markets.
We carried out five pilot projects to test 
new techniques and tools and to build our 
understanding of the best approaches for us to 
use across the Group. In our Thermal business 
in China, and in Electrical Carbon in North 
America, we assessed the segmentation of 
our customers and alignment of sales resources 
to customers, the sales process and the sales 
management tools we should use. In our 
Thermal automotive business we developed a 
new strategy for the market using new market 
assessment tools and set new product and 
market priorities and targets. In our Thermal 
business in Europe we deployed new 
segmentation and pricing tools and developed 
a standard set of approaches for use across 
the Group. Finally, in our European Seals and 
Bearings business we developed a new sales 
structure with revised key account management 
and sales responsibilities to shift the way that 
business goes to market. 
Through these pilots we delivered significant 
improvements in local capabilities and 
approaches, and we also developed our 
understanding of the tools and techniques 
we should apply across the Group. We will 
continue with that deployment during 2018. 
We also completed the design of our framework 
for sales incentive plans and prepared for the 
deployment of new sales incentives to four 
different sales teams in the first quarter of 2018.
We will test these new approaches and make 
adjustments before deploying across the key 
sales teams during 2018 and early 2019. 
5. Increase investment in people 
management and development. 
We are aiming to strengthen our leadership 
capability and deepen functional capabilities across 
the business, including in sales and engineering.
We launched our new Leadership behaviours 
to our senior leaders during the year. These are 
now built into our performance management 
process and during 2018, our leaders will be 
measured both on what they achieve and how 
they achieve it to ensure we drive the behaviours 
we need to support the delivery of our strategy. 
In addition to the work on sales incentives, we 
have also made a range of changes to incentive 
schemes for the wider leadership population 
to provide a clearer line of sight from the 
performance of the individual and the impact 
on their compensation. As part of this we have 
introduced greater balance between short-term 
(in-year) and long-term (multi-year) incentives. 
Finally, we have strengthened our leadership 
population, in particular with the introduction 
of more capability in finance, HR, operations 
and EHS functions.
6. Simplify the business.
We have completed two divestments which 
have materially simplified the Electrical Carbon 
and Technical Ceramics global business units. 
Through these divestments we have exited 
businesses where we were sub-scale and where 
there was limited synergy with the remainder of 
the Group. We have sharpened the focus on the 
core business and reduced overhead costs. 
We received proceeds of £79.5 million from the 
sales and have used that to reduce our net debt* 
position, creating funds for reinvestment in the 
business in due course. 
Looking forward
As we enter 2018, global markets are generally in 
good health with positive sentiment and growth 
expected in most large industrial geographies. 
We expect the business to grow at closer to our 
market growth rates in 2018. During 2018, we 
will be investing further in the long-term health of 
the business, and we will be investing selectively 
in capacity to support growth where we are 
capacity constrained and can see attractive 
opportunities to invest. 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees 
for their hard work and support during 2017.
