Dear fellow stakeholders
In 2018, Polymetal celebrates its 20th anniversary;  
perhaps still youthful by global metrics but, nevertheless, a 
respectable milestone for a business built from the ground 
up in an emerging market. During that time, the Company has 
delivered a production compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 24%, developed 16 mines from scratch, added 6.7 Moz of 
gold equivalent and 9.5 Moz of palladium equivalent in newly 
discovered resources, paid out more than US$1 billion in 
dividends and attained industry leadership in processing 
refractory gold ore. We have expanded our operations within 
three mining jurisdictions in the former Soviet Union (Russia, 
Kazakhstan and Armenia) and have maintained a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange since 2011.
Playing to our strengths
Over the last 20 years, we have built on our core 
competencies: using a hub-based system (Dukat, Omolon 
and Okhotsk); mastering POX technology and trading 
refractory gold concentrates (Kyzyl, Albazino, Mayskoye); 
operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at 
locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations 
in the Russian Far East). Consistently focusing on high-grade 
assets has also ensured that we have delivered superior 
returns on capital.
Financial prudence pays dividends
Adherence to strong capital discipline has been the foundation 
of our strategy – in careful project selection with a preference 
for high grade and low-capital-intensity, in value-accretive 
mergers & acquisitions (M&As), as well as in our dividend 
policy. From free cash flow for 2012-2017 totalling US$1.3 
billion, Polymetal paid out US$1.0 billion in dividends, providing 
tangible returns to shareholders with a sector-leading three-
year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 61%.
Leading by example
At the same time, Polymetal recognises its duty of care for its 
entire stakeholder base, as evidenced by its practice of good 
governance and sustainable development in the regions in 
which we operate. The Board and management are fully 
committed to a sustainability agenda with a renewed focus  
on health and safety. In other areas, Polymetal’s position as an 
industry leader in sustainability is acknowledged both by local 
communities and by an increasing number of international 
rating agencies, most recently the World Wildlife Fund and 
Sustainalytics. We are also signatories to the International 
Cyanide Management Code.
Polymetal is at the start of another dynamic stage in its 
history. Our investment in new projects – Kyzyl, and 
potentially into Nezhda, Prognoz and a second Amursk POX 
line – is expected to enable Polymetal to deliver superior 
shareholder returns and industry leadership over the long 
term. I look forward to making this journey, along with the 
Company’s stakeholders.
