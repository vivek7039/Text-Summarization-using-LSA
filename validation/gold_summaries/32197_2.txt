ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
PRIDE IN OUR
PERFORMANCE
LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Liontrust Asset Management Plc (the “Company” or “Liontrust”, or together with its subsidiary entities, the 
“Group”, as the context requires) is a specialist fund management company that takes pride in having a 
distinct culture and approach to running money:
The company was founded in 1994 and was 
listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.
We are an independent business with no 
corporate parent, our head office is on the Strand 
in London and we have branch offices in 
Edinburgh and Luxembourg.
We believe in the benefits of active fund 
management over the long term and all our fund 
managers are truly active.
We focus only on those areas of investment in 
which we have particular expertise. We have 
seven fund management teams: five that invest in 
UK, European, Asian and Global equities, one 
team that manages Multi-Asset portfolios and a 
Sustainable Investment team.
Our fund managers are independent thinkers and 
have the courage of their convictions in making 
investment decisions.
Our fund managers have the freedom to manage 
their portfolios according to their own investment 
processes and market views without being 
distracted by other day-to-day aspects of running a 
fund management company.
Each fund management team applies distinct and 
rigorous investment processes to the management 
of funds and portfolios that ensure the way we 
manage money is predictable and repeatable.
Staying true to their documented investment 
processes helps to create an in-built risk control for 
our fund managers, especially in more challenging 
environments, by preventing them from buying 
stocks for the wrong reasons.
We aim to treat investors, clients, members, 
employees, suppliers and other stakeholders fairly 
and with respect. We are committed to the Principles 
of Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) and they are central 
to how we conduct business across all our functions.
