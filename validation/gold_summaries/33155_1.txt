for our stakeholders

busy and successful

I am delighted that 
the focus on our 
strategic priorities 
continues to deliver 
positive results for 
our stakeholders.”

WHAT HAVE BEEN THE HIGHLIGHTS  
OF 2015?
Our focus on generating sustainable income growth 
continues to succeed, and we have grown EPS by 13%. 
This enables us to once more increase the dividend for 
our shareholders, which at 22.3p per share is up 9 .3%  
on last year and with compound annual growth of 7 .7% 
since 2011.
NAV per share was up 11% principally due to a total 
property return of 12.4%, significantly beating IPD .
This strong financial performance is in part thanks to 
the high quality of our portfolio. We continue to recycle 
capital into those assets and developments which are 
best positioned to create value for shareholders. A key 
highlight of this year was our acquisition in Ireland 
which provides a market-leading platform in Europe’s 
fastest-growing economy. Acquiring a portfolio of loans 
requires some extra steps before we own the properties 
but, once the transaction is complete, we will operate 
one of Europe’s leading shopping centres, Dundrum 
Town Centre, Dublin. We also increased our investment 
in the UK’s second city, Birmingham, through the 
acquisition of Grand Central shopping centre in joint 
venture with CPPIB. Birmingham offers an increasingly 
wealthy catchment and improving public infrastructure 
investment. To fund these transactions, we are on track 
with a programme of disposals and we remain focused 
on maintaining a prudent balance sheet.
Like-for-like NRI growth of 2.3% is higher than last year 
as we continue to see a growing demand for prime retail 
and leisure space. Against a backdrop of falling vacancy, 
combined with our Product Experience Framework 
initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive future rental 
income growth. 
This year we successfully relocated our UK offices  
to more cost-efficient sites, moving our London 
headquarters to Kings Place, King’s Cross. Costs were 
tightly controlled across the business and we reduced 
total administrative costs, alongside investing further in 
important areas such as digital and marketing. There is 
still more to be done however, especially as a result of 
additional property costs from the strategic 
development properties we hold. 
In 2015, we completed an impressive four developments, 
adding 64,900m
2 
of incremental retail space. This 
included Le Jeu de Paume, a new regional shopping 
centre in Beauvais; the Winter Garden restaurant and 
leisure extension at Silverburn, Glasgow; a next-
generation fashion park in Rugby with Elliott’ s Field; as 
well as an M&S-anchored extension to Cyfarthfa Retail 
Park, Merthyr Tydfil. We also made good progress at our 
major London development schemes.
HOW IS THE INVESTMENT PROPOSITION 
FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN 2016 
DIFFERENTIATED VERSUS PEERS?
We are better positioned than ever to take advantage of 
the improving consumer backdrop and to continue to 
generate earnings growth ahead of our peers. As well as 
owning prime real estate, driving rental growth requires 
a thorough and hands-on approach to asset 
management. This is where we are differentiated by our 
embedded Product Experience Framework, which is 
designed to deliver a consistently great experience for 
shoppers and retailers across our portfolio.
Furthermore, we remain the only European REIT with 
strategic exposure to the premium outlets market. Our 
investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets materially 
boosted our portfolio returns in 2015. We aim to further 
grow our exposure to this market, which is set to benefit 
from strong occupational demand driven by growing 
global tourism.
2016 will see the opening of Victoria Gate, Leeds which, 
together with Victoria Quarter, will create the leading 
aspirational retail offer in the north of England. The 
next 18 months will also see us make advancements on 
our major London development schemes including 
moving towards starting on-site at Brent Cross and 
Croydon. These schemes are set to deliver retail assets 
of the future and further differentiate our long-term 
investment proposition.

WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS FOR 
RETAILERS TAKING MORE SPACE? 
The increase in occupancy across the Group to 97 .7% 
reflects the continued strong demand from retail and 
leisure tenants for prime space. With the growth in 
multichannel retailing, tenants are looking to position a 
greater share of their stores in the best locations. This 
trend plays well to our strategy of owning and operating 
prime shopping centres in key regional destinations.  
We have successfully worked with major international 
tenants during 2015 to create flagship stores, including 
three Victoria’s Secret stores and a new two-level  
Hugo Boss at Cabot Circus. 
Retailers are also creating more innovative store 
designs and formats. We are delighted with the  
River Island Style Studio at Bullring, a new concept for 
the brand, offering customers a VIP personal-styling 
service in a relaxed and contemporary setting. The store 
has performed exceptionally well since opening, and is 
now one of the best in River Island’s portfolio. 
Increasingly discerning retailers want a portfolio of 
stores to match the full range of ways in which their 
customers shop. We are well-positioned to respond to 
retailers’ requirements for a multi-format presence.  
Fat Face is a good example of this, upsizing its footprint 
at Union Square in Aberdeen in April and also taking its 
first store on a retail park in England when we opened 
the doors at our newly developed shopping park at 
Elliott’s Field, Rugby. In fact, the trend for traditional 
fashion and department store brands to bring their full 
offering closer to the convenience shopper was evident 
throughout the year, with names such as Debenhams, 
M&S and Next all taking space across our retail parks.
Furthermore we are able to offer retailers a European 
footprint covering the UK, France and now Ireland. In 
France, our focus on reinvigorating the portfolio is 
delivering results. The team are focused on identifying 
the new and emerging international brands that will 
resonate with our pan-European customers. 
During the year, we welcomed 25 new brands to our 
French portfolio, notably including four retailers’ first 
store in France. 
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING TO SUPPORT 
RETAILERS IN YOUR CENTRES?
It is our responsibility as a landlord to drive healthy 
footfall for our retail tenants and create new 
experiences for shoppers to encourage greater dwell 
time. We saw visitor numbers up 1.1% in UK shopping 
centres this year. This result was encouraging and we 
outperformed the wider market, which was down 1.9% 
year-on-year (according to Springboard). 
No doubt a significant factor in our success is our 
Product Experience Framework, which drives a 
constant and evolving programme of events, pop-ups 
and interactive experiences for shoppers. We have 
launched click & collect in four of our centres with 
strong results. More than 85% of shoppers using the 
service at Brent Cross go on to shop, drink or dine whilst 
in the centre. Our investment in digital infrastructure 
and technology across the shopping centre portfolio is 
also demonstrating encouraging results. Our ‘Plus’ app 
has now been rolled out across the entire estate of 
shopping centres in the UK and France. The app, a 
personalised shopping companion, enables us to 
communicate in real-time with our shoppers in a 
tailored way. It gives us greater insight into consumer 
shopping habits which we can then analyse and share 
with our retail tenants to improve the customer offer.  
To date, the app has achieved over 140,000 downloads.

WHAT DIFFERENTIATES YOUR OFFER  
FOR SHOPPERS?
For us, being the Best at Retail means being at the 
forefront of new retail trends and concepts. As retail 
specialists we are able to draw on the strength of our 
relationships to ensure we bring the right mix of leading 
international brands and new, innovative concepts to 
our shopping destinations across Europe. During the 
year we welcomed premium British fashion brand All 
Saints to Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille, 
representing the brand’s debut in a French shopping 
centre; and, leveraging our reputation for retail 
excellence in France, we secured leases with Sandro and 
Séraphine at Victoria Quarter, representing firsts for 
both aspirational French boutiques in Leeds. VIA 
Outlets introduced more international luxury brands, 
thanks to the partnership with Value Retail, including 
Brooks Brothers at Landquart, Zurich and Desigual at 
Kungsbacka, Gothenburg. 
To differentiate our offer and give consumers more 
reasons to visit our centres with greater frequency we 
are increasingly looking beyond pure retail to provide 
entertaining and exciting experiences. We opened the 
impressive Wintergarden at Silverburn, a £35 million 
10,900m
2
 dining and leisure development, anchored by 
a 14-screen Cineworld and featuring 11 new restaurants, 
including Carluccio’s, Five Guys and Glasgow’s first 
Thaikhun. In the first six months after opening the 
Wintergarden the centre saw a 4% increase in customer 
dwell time and a 5% increase in sales, demonstrating 
the importance of creating customer experiences that  
bring the whole family together. 
Across our UK shopping centre portfolio, leisure and 
dining now accounts for 14% of space, and with trends 
showing additional growth in the casual dining market 
we see opportunities to increase this further in 2016. 
Our restaurants and leisure team look for fresh new 
brands to attract diners as well as tried and tested 
favourites. Restaurants which debuted with us, such as 
Wham Bam Tikka at WestQuay and Thaikhun at Union 
Square, have become popular favourites and expanded 
to other parts of our portfolio.
We are also responding to this trend at our retail parks, 
introducing the latest food and beverage offerings.  
Ed’s Easy Diner, Caffé Nero and Nando’s have all taken 
space at Elliott’s Field in Rugby. Our retail parks have 
seen strong footfall up 4.2%, as they become even more 
popular for shoppers looking for convenience. This was 
nearly double the market level of 2.3%. We are now 
introducing facilities and services to our retail parks 
which are similar to those found at shopping centres 
including customer service suites, free wi-fi, mobile 
phone charging points and Amazon lockers to leverage 
the growing demand for click & collect.  
Our retail venues also give shoppers a vibrant array of 
entertainment. The Disco Bull Head, a sound and music 
installation, at Bullring (which you can see on the front 
cover of our report) was designed by leading artist Josh 
Harker and was seen by nearly two million visitors. This 
summer we also created a beach at Brent Cross, 
complete with sandy shores and seaside entertainment! 
We recognise that while these events are stimulating for 
our shoppers, we also need to ensure a comfortable and 
safe environment in which to spend time. This year we 
have undertaken a full sensory audit of our centres to 
see how light, sounds, smell and the feel of a centre 
affects our shoppers. Over the course of the year we 
have also made significant investment in upgrading our 
customer service desks. As ever, the safety of customers 
and staff in our centres is a priority and our security 
procedures are constantly reviewed in close 
consultation with local and national authorities.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW RELOCATION OF HEADQUARTERS  
TO KING’S CROSS, LONDON
In June we moved into our new London headquarters at Kings Place, 
King’s Cross. The office, which overlooks Regent’s Canal, is set over 
2,200m
2
 and offers modern, flexible workspace for more than  
150 colleagues. 
Moving away from the property industry’s traditional Mayfair 
heartland not only allows us to benefit from significant cost savings 
but also reflects our strategic focus on retail real estate. The modern 
design provides colleagues with a digitally-enabled, agile workspace 
which enhances collaboration across our various asset, leasing and 
development projects. The Retail Showcase provides our retail leasing 
teams with a state-of-the-art marketing suite which we use to 
demonstrate the benefits of our portfolio to prospective tenants. 
Situated close to St Pancras International rail terminal, it brings us 
closer to our French business, fostering cross-border collaboration 
and partnerships.
We were awarded an SKA Gold sustainability rating at Kings Place.
More happened for our people
over a third of these employed in professional and 
senior professional roles. By the end of 2015, 27% of 
senior management roles across the Group were held 
by women, well on the way to meeting our stated 
aspiration of at least 30%. Irrespective of internal 
targets, we are never complacent and we recognise 
there is more to do in 2016. 
As a FTSE 100 employer, we take seriously our 
responsibility to train and nurture the talents of those 
embarking on a career in the property industry. Since 
the launch of our UK Graduate Programme in 2011,  
I am pleased to report that three graduates have 
successfully completed the two year programme and 
gained RICS accreditation, becoming permanent 
employees within our business. 
We also recognise our responsibility to promote the 
benefits of a rewarding career in retail real estate to the 
next generation of retail property specialists. In my role 
as President of BCSC, I was delighted to award successful 
apprentices of the Retail Path scheme with certificates at 
the BCSC Gold Awards evening in December. The 
scheme, backed by BCSC Retail Trust and the National 
Skills Academy, was piloted in shopping centres across 
the UK. These included Highcross, Leicester, where five 
apprentices took on 12-month placements giving them 
unique exposure to a range of centre management and 
retail-based skills and experiences. Two of the five have 
now graduated from the scheme and won permanent 
roles with retailers at Highcross.  
CAN YOU OUTLINE THE PROGRESS YOU 
HAVE MADE EMBEDDING YOUR VALUES?
Our values of ambition, collaboration, respect and 
responsibility continue to enhance our culture and 
influence the way we operate. The relocation of our  
UK headquarters from Mayfair to King’s Cross not only 
marked a shift in how we see ourselves as a business,  
but also introduced a more agile and collaborative 
culture and working environment. You can read more 
about the move in the case-study below. 
Our ambition is best demonstrated in the strategic 
acquisition in Ireland which was the largest in our 
history and broadens our European platform. I am 
proud of the hard work and dedication of all employees 
who came together to make the deal happen. We have 
recently established a local office in Dublin and we 
anticipate a number of opportunities for both current 
and new colleagues.
During the year we continued to develop our diversity 
and inclusion strategy, encouraging respect and 
understanding within the workplace. Unconscious bias 
workshops were held for senior managers in our UK and 
French teams, with key messages filtering through and 
embedding across our business. We are now planning to 
extend the workshops to all colleagues in 2016. 
Encouragingly, these initiatives are translating into 
positive action at a resourcing level, with half of all new 
employees recruited during the year being female, and

12 12 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 CREATIVE CAREERS AT BULLRING
We are increasingly aware of the importance of digital and creative 
development skills for the employment market. In November, 
Bullring, Birmingham, hosted ‘Creative Careers 0121’ – a careers fair 
with a difference. The event, aimed at children, young people, parents 
and educational providers, showcased the creative industries and 
provided access to a variety of professionals already shaping our 
digital world through business and enterprise. Attendees were 
provided with tips, networking connections and opportunities for 
young people looking to start a career in the digital and design sectors.  
More happened for communities
Our sustainability initiative forms part of the Product 
Experience Framework and underpins our operational 
decisions. This is particularly the case in developments 
where we look to combine thoughtful and sustainable 
building techniques with iconic design, producing 
destinations where customers feel proud to shop. We 
were delighted to achieve BREEAM Excellent at the 
design stage for Le Jeu de Paume, Beauvais, our new 
shopping centre north of Paris. This was in addition to 
receiving industry recognition for our sustainability 
initiatives throughout the year, notably for the B&Q 
Eco-learning store at Cyfarthfa Retail Park in Merthyr 
Tydfil and the Costa Eco-Pod at Wrekin Retail Park in 
Telford. These initiatives continue to demonstrate our 
commitment to sustainable development and our 
leadership of the wider sector.
During the year, we also launched the ‘Moving Towards 
Net Zero Buildings’ commitment in collaboration with 
The Prince of Wales’ Corporate Leaders Group and 
property services company Jones Lang LaSalle.   
The commitment, which seeks to drive a coordinated 
approach to the delivery of nearly zero energy  
buildings for new build by 2020, has already attracted  
a number of leading European signatories from  
across the built environment.  
HOW ARE YOU DELIVERING  
POSITIVE PLACES FOR THE COMMUNITIES 
YOU SERVE?
The positive social impacts that our business creates  
are both significant and long term.  
During the year, our investment in extensions, 
developments and refurbishments generated over  
4,500 construction jobs alone. Over 85% of these jobs 
went to local people. Once completed, these projects  
are expected to deliver a further 2,600 employment 
opportunities in the retail and hospitality sectors. This 
can only be achieved by working closely with our supply 
chain, tenants and local authority partners to ensure that 
the requisite skills and training opportunities are in 
place. For example, at Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, we 
worked with the local council, construction contractors 
BAM, and tenants M&S and Next. We invested in skills 
and training provision for the local community, resulting 
in the creation of close to 500 local jobs at the recent 
extension of Cyfarthfa Retail Park. These numbers 
demonstrate the vital role that our industry can play  
in creating sustainable careers and stimulating local 
economies across our many communities.
At a corporate level, we encourage colleagues to play a 
greater role in volunteering in the communities in which 
we operate. In 2015, staff volunteered over 400 days, a 
clear illustration of our culture and values in practice. 
Hammerson’ s Community Day, now well established, 
saw high levels of participation with colleagues taking 
part in a range of 27 activities, including a river clean-up 
and mentoring young people. 
HOW ARE YOU LEADING THE SECTOR  
ON SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES?
As a founding member of the Better Buildings 
Partnership (BBP), we have been instrumental in 
leading the sector. The organisation, which brings 
property owners and occupiers together to share new 
ideas and importantly work together to reduce carbon 
emissions, is chaired by our Head of Sustainability, 
Louise Ellison. In 2015, members of the BBP achieved  
a 5% year-on-year reduction in energy consumption 
across their portfolio.
