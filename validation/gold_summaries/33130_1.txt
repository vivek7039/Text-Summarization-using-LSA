 Annual Report 2002

I am delighted to provide a review of the trading
companies in my new position as Chief
Executive of DICOM Group. Since being founded
11 years ago and as a result of the vision and
leadership provided by my predecessor Otto
Schmid, the Group has shown an exceptional
development. We were established as a Swiss
company trading IT peripherals and have gone
through a substantial evolution since. Today, we
are recognised as the worldwide leader in our
target markets, active in over 60 countries
around the globe.
In the past most enterprises have heavily
invested in a broad range of IT solutions that
automate their business transactions and
support decision making. However connectivity
between input devices and applications is
frequently inadequate or absent resulting in
data and document access being imprecise,
slow and hence expensive.
The EDC solutions offered by DICOM Group
solve this dilemma at an attractive cost to
benefit ratio. We have been able to grow the
EDC Division by approximately 30% year over
year since our flotation in 1996, through our
technological leadership and strict adherence to
our successful sales channel concept.  Building
on this success it is my goal to improve the
Group’s market position in the EDC market,
whilst also adding businesses that are
complementary to our core area of activities.
DICOM Group achieved excellent results in its
core EDC Division last year in contrast to
further deteriorating conditions in the IT
industry. Our business partners and customers
have continued to report that IT budgets remain
under tight scrutiny. EDC investments, however,
were broadly saved from this development as
they allow quick payback periods to be
achieved.
EDC now contributes more than 68% to total
Group turnover. Turnover with own products
and services showed substantial growth during
the year and contributed 39% and 17%
respectively of sales. Third party products sold
by the EDC Division accounted for the balance.
It is our strategy to leverage our position in the
EDC market to make DICOM Group’s products
available to the high and low end of the EDC
market. As a result we have allocated
significantly more funds to research and
development.  Last year we increased spending
by 41% to £7.4m (2001: £5.3m). This
commitment has allowed us a high rate of
product innovations for existing products and
the launch of entirely new products at the same
time.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS
Our award winning Virtual ReScan™ (VRS)
product line, which optimises both image quality
and the scan process, continues to do very well.

CHIEF EXE C UTIVE’ S
REVIEW which is underscored by the successful
participation in a rising number of large EDC
projects. Consequently the number of Ascent
Capture software licences sold to date has
increased significantly to 32,500 (30 June 2001:
22,500). 
EUROPE
DICOM Europe, our European sales and service
operations, provided solid growth and better
margins. In the Group’s major territories an
improved performance was achieved in contrast
to the general slow-down in the IT industry. The
drive to provide consulting and other services
continues to improve the quantity and quality of
the Group’s service revenues.
ASIA
In June we announced that our stake in DICOM
Asia was increased from 40% to 80%. This
acquisition strengthens our involvement in
South East Asia, the Greater China region and
Australia and reinforces the Group’s ongoing
strategy to grow both organically and by
acquisitions. During the past four years, DICOM
Asia has successfully managed to expand its
reach, customer base and capabilities in very
challenging market conditions. We are currently
increasing our activities in the Greater China
region and also intend to exploit fully our leading
position in the high growth Asian market.
DICOM Group is better placed than ever to
capitalise on its increased global presence, with
sales and support services in every major
market in the world and a product range which
is the most comprehensive in the industry, at the
cutting edge of today’s technology in EDC
software.

The software version of VRS (v2.1) now supports
more than 40 document scanner models with
real time image enhancement features. Several
larger projects were secured. The ASIC version
of VRS, which is being sold on the basis of OEM
agreement for use in document scanners, is
being sold to both new scanner manufacturers
and for new scanner models thereby increasing
its future sales prospects significantly. In May
2002 we were awarded an US patent for VRS.
Ascent Capture 5.5, a major release of the award
winning capture application, was launched in
May 2002 offering broader product functionality
and improved support for high performance
databases. With these improvements Ascent
Capture has been able to gain further market
share in the high end sector of the EDC market.
In June 2002, we launched Ascent Ricochet. It is
the first software product on the market that
extends professional EDC features to every
desktop in an enterprise, government
organisation or not for profit organisation. It
permits Multifunctional Products and digital
copiers to be used as document scanners.
Almost all organisations have copiers and
scanner in use.  This new product brings added
efficiency and features to these equipment
investments.
Blue chip software houses and system
integrators have continued to integrate Ascent
Capture products and VRS into their solutions as
a result of ongoing focused sales and marketing
initiatives. Ascent Capture, also described in the
EDC market as “The Operating System of
Capture”, continues to move upmarket – a trend
