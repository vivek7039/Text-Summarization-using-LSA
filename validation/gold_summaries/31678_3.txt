 Performance and dividend
The Group produced a strong trading 
performance in FY17, which was in line 
with our expectations. Good revenue 
growth and rising gross margins 
contributed to a double-digit increase in 
earnings. The business is also highly cash 
generative and we further increased 
the net cash on the balance sheet.
This performance underpins our ability 
to reward shareholders through our 
progressive dividend policy. At the time 
of the IPO, we promised to pay a healthy 
dividend, recognising that this was 
important to investors in an environment 
where many companies were having to 
reduce or scrap their dividend payouts.
Last year’s total dividend was 4.0 pence 
per share which, taking into account the 
timing of the IPO, was equivalent to a 
dividend for the full year of 6.0 pence. 
After paying an interim dividend of 
2.2 pence per share this year, the 
Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 4.4 pence per share, 
to give a total dividend of 6.6 pence. 
This represents growth in the total 
dividend of 10.0% against the FY16 
full-year equivalent. The final dividend 
will be paid on 28 February 2018 to 
shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 26 January 2018. The shares 
will go ex-dividend on 25 January 2018.
The Board has also decided to adopt a 
policy of aiming to pay dividends at a level 
which will be two times covered by annual 
earnings and will implement this policy 
fully by FY19.
This was Watkin Jones’ first full financial year since 
its IPO. Having spent much of the previous year 
organising as a public company, FY17 was a year 
of confident delivery.

Strategic report I believe that the Group’s financial and operational  
performance and its strategic progress all demonstrate  
that Watkin Jones is a business that delivers on its promises.
Board, management and people
There were no changes to Board 
membership during the year. The Directors 
continue to work well together, and towards 
the end of 2017 we began our first formal 
appraisal of the Board’s performance to 
identify areas for further development.
The Group’s success this year reflects 
the strong leadership of the Executive 
Directors, Mark Watkin Jones and Phil 
Byrom, and their colleagues. 
Mark, Phil and the team have continued to 
successfully manage the pipeline, control 
costs, ensure delivery and implement our 
strategy for growth. I want to thank them 
and everyone in Watkin Jones for their 
significant contribution.
The Group has an experienced and stable 
senior team and we spent time this year 
assessing their capabilities, investing in 
development and considering succession 
planning. We are also proposing to introduce 
a long-term incentive plan during FY18, 
to help us retain our senior people and 
reward performance. More information on 
the plan can be found in the Remuneration 
Committee report on pages 47 and 48.
It is with regret that Mark Watkin Jones 
has notified the Board of his intention to 
stand down as the Group’s Chief 
Executive Officer once a suitable 
successor has been appointed, following 
an orderly handover period. For personal 
reasons, Mark is not able to undertake a 
full-time executive role over the longer 
term and he and the Board believe that it 
is in the Group’s best interests to recruit 
a successor. 
The Board will initiate a formal search 
process to identify a new Chief Executive 
Officer. The Board is keen to retain the 
benefit of Mark’s valuable knowledge 
and experience and the intention is that, 
following the transition, the Board will 
look at how this might be achieved, 
including the option of him becoming 
a Non-Executive Director of Watkin Jones.
After 15 years at the helm, the Board 
understands Mark’s desire to relinquish 
the Chief Executive Officer position and 
the associated demands of this role. 
Mark has played a pivotal part in shaping 
the Watkin Jones strategy and success. 
Under Mark’s leadership, Watkin Jones 
has gone through a transformational 
period, a key part of which has been the 
establishment and development of a 
strong senior management team who 
have increasingly taken on the day-to-day 
responsibility for the running of 
the business and who are capable 
of supporting the Group’s long-term 
growth aspirations. 
The Board will be seeking a successor to 
Mark who can build on this platform and 
maintain the Group’s track record of 
profitable, cash generative growth.
The Board would like to thank Mark for 
his enormous contribution and is also 
delighted that he has indicated his 
willingness to continue to support his 
successor and the business 
going forward.
Looking forward
The Board is confident about the outlook 
for the Group. The development pipeline 
gives us excellent visibility of our revenues 
and earnings, protecting our performance 
and giving us the time to adjust our plans 
if necessary. While Brexit is a source of 
uncertainty for many businesses, it is 
unlikely to be a significant issue for the 
Group. EU students are only 7% of the 
market and the demand for UK higher 
education is such that universities will 
continue to fill their places, no matter 
what happens to EU student numbers.
While we see growth opportunities across 
all parts of the Group, over the medium 
term we see the greatest upside potential 
in build to rent. The Board is encouraged 
by our progress to date in that market and 
the Group now has the foundations to 
develop a second major business over 
the coming years.
