The addition of d
2
w turns ordinary polymer (at the end of its useful life and  
in the presence of oxygen) into a material which is biodegradable in the  
open environment. 
d
2
w is a masterbatch that is added to polymer during manufacture. It offers 
seamless integration into the manufacturing process and is added at only  
1%, which means little or no extra cost.
Plastic products incorporating d
2
w:
   •  can be made in existing plastic factories, with their existing workforce  
and machinery.
   •  meet all the relevant international standards, with proven performance in 
terms of degradation, biodegradation and eco-toxicity - i.e. British Standard 
8472, ASTM D6954, UAE 5009:2009, AFNOR AC T51-808 and  
SASO Standards.
   •  have (during their useful life) the same characteristics as conventional polymer  
i.e. it is waterproof, lightweight, strong and flexible.
   • are suitable for food contact according to FDA and EU food  
 contact regulations
   • can be recycled with conventional polymer and can be made from recyclate.
Products made with d
2
w also have the crucial advantage in that if they escape 
collection and end up in the open environment as litter, they will degrade and 
biodegrade until there is nothing left, in the same way as nature’s waste, only 
quicker and leaving nothing behind. No Toxic residues and No Microplastics
Several countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East have already legislated  
to require everyday plastic items to be made with oxo-biodegradable 
technology, because it works.

p is a suite of masterbatches which offer extra protection from bacteria, insects, fungi, 
algae, odour, fouling and fire. This year the product range has been expanded to include  
a corrosion inhibitor and a range of products specifically for food packaging, consisting  
of an ethylene-adsorber, an oxygen-absorber, an odour-adsorber and a release-agent  
to help prevent food from sticking to the inside of packaging.

Antibacterial  
Fights healthcare and food industry 
infections. Tested against dangerous 
organisms including MRSA, E-coli, 
Listeria, Salmonella, Pseudomonas  
and Aspergillus Niger.
Natural  
Antibacterial suitable for use in food and 
non-food applications. In compliance 
with FDA Food and Drug Administration, 
USA and EFSA (European Food Safety 
Authority) requirements. 
Antimicrobial  
The primary purpose is to prevent 
bacterial and fungal contamination whilst 
preserving the aesthetic and functional 
properties of the plastic article.
Odour adsorber  
Inorganic masterbatches and additives 
designed to inhibit the development of 
odours in plastic products and to prevent 
spoilage of fruit and vegetables.
Insecticide technology  
Insecticidal plastic masterbatches 
used to control pests. Typically used in 
mosquito nets, agriculture, horticulture, 
forestry and home applications.
Flame retardant  
Flame retardants decrease the  
ignitability of materials and inhibit 
the combustion process – limiting the 
amount of heat released.
Pest control  
Rodents can cause dangerous damage 
to plastic products such as cable 
insulation, warehouse pallets,  
non-food packaging and boxes etc. 
Symphony has developed additive 
masterbatches with products that  
repel these pests.
Anti-fouling  
Anti-fouling paint is a specialised coating 
applied to the hull of a ship or boat to 
reduce the growth of aquatic organisms.
Vapour corrosion inhibitor 
d

p VCI additives are a range of products 
to be used in protection of surfaces 
against the corrosion and oxidation  
of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
Ethylene, moisture and odour adsorber 
Highly active adsorbent masterbatch 
for the removal of undesirable odours, 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 
water vapour from plastic packaging to 
reduce spoilage of fruit and vegetables.
Oxygen absorber 
d

p OA is a powerful inorganic chemical 
compound, produced from a natural ore 
and manufactured to a high purity.
Release agent 
A modern synthetic product produced 
from one of the most common of the 
earth’s elements. It plays a key role in the 
improvement of the flow and processing 
of resins as well an enhancing the slip 
and lubricity of plastic products.
