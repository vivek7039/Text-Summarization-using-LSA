Delivering as planned
During the 2016 placing, completed in 
June, Lombard Risk presented a two-year 
plan, setting out some clear objectives in 
terms of delivery and financial performance. 
At the halfway point of that two-year plan, 
we are delighted to be sharing positive 
news and significant progress on all fronts.
Financial performance
In terms of financial performance, the 44.8% 
increase in top-line revenue to £34.3m 
validates the Board’s belief that a step 
change was possible. This dramatic increase 
over the 10.3% achieved last year not only 
eclipses the 15% compound annual revenue 
growth from the previous five years, but also 
maintains the momentum generated during 
the first half. It is an excellent performance, 
ahead of market expectations, and one 
of which we are understandably proud.
We anticipated making a loss in this 
year, a year of significant investment 
for the Group, although the loss before 
tax we are reporting is much less than 
anticipated at £1.6m, with an adjusted 
EBITDA significantly ahead of market 
expectations during the year at £2.6m. 
We do capitalise certain of our research 
and development costs, and stripping 
out this accounting treatment would 
show a cash loss before tax of £5.6m.
We start the new fiscal year with 
confidence, with our recurring revenues 
at £12.4m, up 21.0%, and an order book 
of £10.1m against £7.5m a year ago, an 
increase of 35.0%. This is the year that 
Lombard Risk is targeting a return to 
cash profitability, and the team is fully 
focussed on fulfilling this commitment.
Finally, it is also very pleasing to report 
that following rigorous working capital 
management the Company’s cash 
balance at the year end stood at £7.0m, 
again significantly stronger than the 
market anticipated.
Delivering the future
In addition to the expectations we set 
around our ability to improve the financial 
performance of Lombard Risk, we set out 
an important strategic agenda showing 
how we would use the proceeds from the 
placing. In addition to critical investments 
in our core platforms, these included the 
creation of a new development centre, 
closer to our London headquarters in 
Birmingham. The Company has grown a 
strong offshore capability in Shanghai over 
the last decade, which has made a crucial 
contribution to our product development. 
However, in recent years, rising costs and 
pressure for talent from both local software 
firms and giant international brands has

Strategic report Delivering the future continued
increased the pressure on our team, adding 
to the complexities of managing a remote 
centre. Supporting our clients and keeping 
pace with the rapid changes in our key 
markets demanded a new solution.
After an extensive analysis of the 
infrastructure and talent availability in 
cities across Europe and mainland UK, 
we were delighted to select Birmingham 
as the centre for future investment 
in our delivery capacity. With strong 
communications links to London and 
a deep talent pool, it is a natural choice 
for technology companies, as evidenced 
by the speed we could set it up, opening 
the doors on 23 November 2016. Our 
launch has been well received, we have 
forged strong links with the local business 
and education communities, and most 
importantly we have been securing 
excellent technology talent at the 
rate we had planned.
Cross-product 
collateral management
Existing and new clients have benefited 
from the continued expansion of our 
world-class collateral management system. 
The regulatory release of COLLINE
®
 in May 
supported clients who needed to comply 
with Dodd Frank and IOSCO guidelines 
for trading uncleared derivatives, and we 
were delighted by both the response and 
take-up across our existing customer base. 
Our clients continue to strengthen their 
operations in a period of intensive change, 
injecting control, reducing both costs 
and operational risk and complying with 
the rapidly evolving regulatory framework. 
As similar regulations are adopted in 
Asia, and the Dodd Frank and IOSCO 
framework extends to new waves of 
market participants, Lombard Risk is 
well placed to continue this success.
With another major release in January, the 
addition of exchange-traded derivatives to 
COLLINE
®
 once again underlines the value 
derived from creating a truly cross-product 
collateral solution, designed to work across 
asset classes from the ground up. Attracting 
new Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”) 
clients in Europe and North America,
as well as presenting an important upgrade 
to existing customers, its immediate 
success validates our strategy to offer a 
comprehensive and up-to-date solution 
suitable for the biggest Tier 1 organisations.
However, our collateral expertise is 
equally relevant across the market, to 
participants of all sizes, and building on 
our success of hosting COLLINE
®
 in the 
cloud for some clients, we launched 
AgileCOLLATERAL
®
 in November. With a 
focus on control, combining simplicity 
of both on-boarding and day-to-day 
operations, AgileCOLLATERAL
®
 offers 
the power of COLLINE
®
, tailored to the 
operational model of clients of any size.
Keeping pace with the regulators
Work has continued to deliver our 
vision to establish AgileREPORTER
®
 as the 
leading regulatory reporting solution across 
North America, Europe and Asia. Deployed 
as either an integrated package with our 
strategic partner Oracle, or implemented 
directly on top of existing data sources 
by Lombard Risk, we have clients live 
on both versions of the platform.
Creating a single platform to meet 
the future challenges of regulatory 
reporting whilst maintaining the value 
of our clients’ previous investments is 
the primary goal of AgileREPORTER
®
. 
With critical new returns such as the 
European Central Bank (“ECB”) AnaCredit 
and the Federal Reserve 2052a supported 
by the new web-based front end, we 
have comprehensive migration paths 
for our extensive customer base.
The Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision’s regulation number 239 
continues to dominate our and our 
clients’ thinking alike, with the emphasis 
on robust, timely, accurate and complete 
returns driving a step change in both data 
architecture and requirements for data 
lineage. AgileREPORTER
®
 is designed 
with all these characteristics in mind, 
and in addition seeks to offer clients cost 
savings by reusing core components, 
with advanced workflow tooling 
allowing for the optimisation of 
regulatory reporting resources.
A quality client base
Lombard Risk’s extensive client base has 
always been a huge asset to the Group, 
both from a commercial perspective 
and also in terms of the market insights 
that such a diverse global community 
brings. Our clients range from some of the 
largest Tier 1 banks, through our specialism 
in supporting foreign branches, to some 
of the smallest buy-side participants in 
the derivatives markets. This group offered 
over 200 opportunities for services and 
additional modules in addition to several 
long-term renewal extensions on both 
sides of the business during the year. 
In addition to our valued existing 
client base, we were pleased to add 
four major collateral customers, close 
two AgileREPORTER
®
 for Oracle Financial 
Services Analytical Applications (“OFSAA”) 
deals with our partner Oracle, and welcome 
several other reporting clients, including 
a major greenfield challenger bank, 
choosing AgileREPORTER
®
 to meet 
its reporting requirements.
Delivering to such an extensive client 
community requires a highly skilled 
professional services organisation, 
and we pride ourselves on the quality 
of our implementation support. With a 
high number of projects being managed 
to an externally imposed regulatory 
deadline, and multiple clients having 
to meet those deadlines simultaneously, 
we have become adept at leveraging 
our extensive use of client feedback 
to provide the highest levels of support.
Critical partnerships
We have continued to work closely with 
our strategic partner Oracle America Inc., 
adding the ECB and European Banking 
Authority (“EBA”) reporting schedules to 
those previously developed for the Federal 
Reserve. The magnitude of the client 
investment projects involving an end-to-end 
solution offered in partnership with Oracle 
has meant that deal progression has been 
slower than both parties would have liked, 
but with five clients signed and a strong 
pipeline in North America, Europe and 
Australia we are extremely optimistic 
about the opportunities being pursued 
for fiscal year 2018.
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
6 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual report and accounts 2017 In November, we announced an exciting 
new relationship with Atos, taking our 
cloud-based collateral management 
solution to the German market. This 
important milestone represents critical 
progress in allowing us to open key 
geographies with local expertise, and 
represents a key strategic step. After 
a year of internal, organic growth, 
we anticipate partner arrangements such 
as Atos and Oracle playing a major role 
in driving our future expansion.
The collateral management landscape 
continues to evolve at a frenetic pace. 
As a truly cross-asset-class collateral 
management system, the key strengths 
of COLLINE
®
 lie in a combination of that 
asset class breadth, industry standard 
connectivity, inventory management, 
and intelligent automation. We continue 
to work with other partners such as 
AcadiaSoft and Razor Risk to extend 
our reach whilst playing to our core 
competencies. As the market evolves, we 
continue to look ahead and co-operate 
with our industry-leading partners for 
the benefit of all our mutual clients.
Lombard Risk is an innovative software 
company with an outstanding services 
organisation supporting our clients. 
We continue to engage with consulting 
partners not only to extend our reach, 
but also to give clients implementation 
and integration options with some 
of the world’s leading firms including 
Accenture and PwC.
Leadership and talent
Lombard Risk has continued to invest in 
talent at all levels of the organisation to 
support our growth. After major changes 
to the executive leadership last year, 
the focus has been on sales leadership, 
sales executives, product expertise and 
technology talent, including of course 
the build-out of our new technology 
centre in Birmingham.
On a geographic basis, the focus 
has been on developing and upgrading 
talent in North America and Europe, 
with additional strategic hires in Asia. 
With strong partnerships in Australia 
and Japan, and well established offices 
in Hong Kong and Singapore, the Group 
is well positioned for significant advances 
in that region.
Investment in our people globally remains 
a key priority for the firm. Lombard Risk’s 
expertise, a direct consequence of 
maintaining its talent, remains a long-term 
differentiator that is extremely hard to 
replicate. With a focus on employee 
engagement, training, talent management 
and development, this is an advantage 
we intend to keep.

Conclusion
We said we would use the funds raised 
in June 2016 to develop a world-class 
development centre in Birmingham, 
make our category-leading collateral 
management system cloud-ready, 
and accelerate the delivery of our vision 
for the future of regulatory reporting. 
We justified this short-term investment 
expenditure with our belief that a step 
change in revenue growth was achievable 
and that the opportunity was immediate 
and had to be exploited immediately. We 
have delivered on all those commitments 
and face fiscal year 2018 with excitement 
and confidence.
Finally, after a turbulent fiscal year 
2016, I would like to thank the Board, 
the Executive Committee, the extended 
leadership group and the whole 
Lombard Risk team for their extraordinary 
efforts in 2017. It is those efforts, applied 
daily, which have delivered such a strong 
performance, and it is a privilege to 
lead such a focussed and committed 
group of people.

Risk’s product development and will assist in accelerating

the evolving and complex challenges facing the market, 
and is bringing both product and technical development
