Customer satisfaction levels were maintained with 
over 57% of responses being in the top two ‘satisfied’ 
categories in our survey. We recognise there is more 
to be done to improve the customer experience 
throughout the journey, from booking to arriving at 
the final destination, and this will be a key focus in 
the year ahead. More and more people are using our 
Flybe.com website to book their flights, increasing 
by 2ppts to 83.7%. Investing in digital transformation 
and delivering the best possible experience for our 
customers are key elements of Flybe’s strategic plan.
Flybe was named again as the best u K airline for 
punctuality, placing us sixth worldwide (up from 17th 
last year), in the comprehensive, globally-renowned 
2016 Punctuality l eague report published by o AG, 
the air travel intelligence specialist. Flybe operates 
a rigorous aircraft maintenance programme, with 
continuous improvement to aircraft reliability through 
development of modifications to our fleet. t his has 
resulted in an improvement in our technical despatch 
reliability to 99.0%.
Business review continued
o perating on average more than 400 daily flights 
in crowded airspace, busy airports and in often 
challenging weather conditions means that such 
official, independent ot P recognition is especially 
important. We understand that time is of the essence 
for all of our customers, whether they are travelling for 
business or leisure. t ravelling with a reliable, punctual 
operator remains a key consideration for customers 
when deciding which airline to choose.
We are a truly regional airline. Most of our customers 
prefer to fly from local airports as it offers them 
convenience, easy access and a time saving 
opportunity. We have a balanced split between male 
and female passengers. We have been able to attract 
more leisure passengers last year. t his year we will 
focus on understanding our customers so we can fulfil 
the needs of both leisure and business travellers.
t he o nline Regional t ravel Group l td (o Rt G) remains 
a key customer of Flybe for business travel, leisure and 
inbound tour operations for Jersey, Guernsey and the 
Isle of Man. Chairman of the group brian Kelly, who 
celebrates 35 years in business in 2017, states Flybe is 
a crucial u K regional and short-haul european carrier.

Passengers benefitting 
from more choice of flights 
between l ondon Heathrow 
and Scotland following 
the launch of new Flybe 
flights from edinburgh and 
Aberdeen
In March 2017 Flybe became 
the first regional airline to begin 
operating at l ondon Heathrow 
since 2013. t his was following a 
european Commission ruling on 
redeploying slots from british 
Airways following its merger with 
Aer l ingus. l ondon Heathrow 
also introduced a £10 reduction 
in domestic passenger charges 
in January in an effort to boost 
domestic connections at 
the airport.
Passengers flying from 
edinburgh and Aberdeen into 
l ondon Heathrow will benefit 
from more choice on these key 
routes. t he new routes offer 
convenient transfers with Flybe’s 
codeshare partners – emirates, 
Virgin Atlantic, etihad Airways 
and Singapore Airlines – plus 
connections onto the extensive 
Star Alliance network serving 44 
global destinations directly from 
l ondon Heathrow.
With our unrivalled network of 
regional airports, we continue to 
develop routes and codeshare 
relationships to connect our 
customers to destinations in 
the u K, europe and the rest 
of the world.
emphasising the role l ondon 
Heathrow plays in boosting 
communities and businesses 
across the u K, the Government 
Minister for Aviation l ord Ahmad 
of Wimbledon commented: 
“Flybe’s flights from both 
edinburgh and Aberdeen to 
l ondon Heathrow will offer 
competition, choice and vital 
trading opportunities for people 
and businesses in Scotland. 
t hese routes are good news 
for Scotland, and for britain as 
a whole, in delivering better 
regional connectivity to important 
global markets.”
From Scotland to London Heathrow
I travel most weeks to our factory in 
the north west from the south and have 
been doing so for six years. t he most efficient 
way to travel is by taking advantage of Flybe’s 
Southampton to Manchester route. Flying is by far 
the most cost-effective, quickest and hassle-free 
way to make this journey on a regular basis.
your slogan ‘faster than road or rail’ is very 
true; it is also a great deal less stressful. 
Flybe’s convenient timetable allows me to travel 
up and back in a day or the flexibility to return 
at an appropriate day and time to suit my 
business agenda.
I would also compliment Flybe on the 
professionalism of the call centre and cabin 
crew, in particular their approachable manner 
and helpful attitude. I would recommend Flybe 
whether travelling for business or pleasure 
without any hesitation.”
Chris Arthur 
o rganica (u K) l imited
Providing reliable, competitively priced, 
commercial and leisure links to our islands 
remains vital for the communities that live there. 
t he importance of Flybe in the u K domestic 
market has been highlighted in recent years with 
the continued demise/consolidation of other 
regional airlines due to their use of planes that are 
unsuitable for multi-daily rotations. t he link Flybe 
provides is so important in allowing tourists and 
leisure travellers to fly to and from the islands; but 
also for business purposes, to enable effective 
trade with the rest of the u K.”

Flybe Aviation Services (FAS)
based in exeter, Flybe Aviation Services l imited (FAS), 
is a stand-alone entity containing our maintenance, 
repair and overhaul (MRo) business. Focusing on civilian 
heavy maintenance activity, FAS provides third party 
maintenance coverage for the bAe, At R, bombardier 
and embraer aircraft types, as well as MRo services for 
Flybe’s own fleet. 
During 2016/17 FAS received more than 125 aircraft 
for maintenance in the exeter facility which covered 
over 10 different airframe types. Aircraft came from 
more than 20 different customers across five different 
continents. t he greater part of aircraft which were 
maintained came from repeat customers Finnair, 
Air baltic and Aegean. During the period FAS also 
signed agreements with three worldwide aircraft 
leasing companies, GeCAS, Falko and NAC, all of 
whom put aircraft through the facility in 2016/17.
Workload in FAS, measured by man-hours, delivered 
519,400 hours in 2016/17. Man hours on third party 
aircraft saw an increase of 7.4 ppts to 58.1% of total 
FAS work (2015/16: 50.7%) with the balance being 
work on behalf of Flybe. t he business delivered 
revenue of £50.1m and a profit before tax of £3.4m 
(2015/16: revenue £42.8m; profit before tax £2.5m). 
FAS continues to take steps to retain its position as 
a leading regional aircraft maintenance provider in 
europe, with the focus strongly placed on quality and 
timely outputs delivered through a safe environment 
and an efficient cost base. 
In addition, FAS is the leading supplier of MRo services 
to the u K’s Royal Air Force through Airbus Military. t he 
brize Norton base has continued to grow and leads the 
way globally in base maintenance activities of this type.
Flybe Training Academy
Flybe continues to develop and promote talent within 
the aviation industry through the training programmes 
it provides at its exeter t raining Academy. t he state-of-
the-art building has 26 classrooms, a simulator hall with 
two full flight l evel D simulators, embraer 170/190 cabin 
door trainer and aircraft mock-up, and an engineering 
apprentice workshop. 
t he t raining Academy is a fully approved eASA part 
147 facility for technical engineering training and is 
purpose-built for delivering pilot and cabin crew training 
programmes. During 2017/18, the number of cabin crew 
delegates increased by 10.4% to 868.

offers training for third party businesses for engineering 
(c87% of engineering delegates were third party) 
and ground operations, and can also provide hire of 
time in flight simulators. t he building also provides 
an impressive and unique setting for the training and 
conferencing requirements of local businesses.
Since 2008 the t raining Academy has hosted the 
jointly-run engineering Apprenticeship programme 
with exeter College with 180 students across the 
academic years.
Airbus, through its Defence and Space 
division, has been contracted by the u K 
Ministry of Defence (Mo D) for the servicing and 
maintenance of the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) new 
A400M Atlas strategic and tactical transport 
aircraft. Flybe Aviation Services l imited (FAS) 
was selected by Airbus as the MRo for the base 
maintenance of the fleet, and has been working 
with Airbus in support of the Royal Air Force  
on-site at RAF brize Norton, the fleet’s home 
base in oxfordshire, since 2015.
FAS is providing an agile and flexible service 
for the base maintenance of the A400M fleet, 
bringing competitive commercial practice, while 
responding to the demands of introducing a new 
military aircraft type into service. As a valued 
partner, FAS has been successfully working with 
Airbus alongside the Mo D and the RAF to ensure 
the delivery of military capability. As well as 
establishing a benchmark level of performance 
for the initial A400M scheduled C checks, FAS 
has played a key part in developing innovative 
procedures for complex maintenance tasks, such 
as the on-wing change of the aircraft’s Propeller 
Gear boxes. We look forward to strengthening 
and broadening the relationship with FAS in the 
coming years.”

 > Maintenance costs increased by 73.6% to £39.4m. 
Capacity increased by 12.3%, which along with the 
disproportionate impact of the increased flying of 
e195s which have substantially higher maintenance 
costs per hour, resulted in an increase of £7.4m 
on underlying maintenance costs. Approximately 
70% of maintenance costs are spares purchased 
in u S dollars, and the fall in the value of sterling 
contributed to an increase of c£6m in costs. 
t he remaining increase is largely driven by 
increased flying in our White l abel operation, 
which is offset by a corresponding increase 
in revenue;
 > Depreciation and amortisation increased 21.8% 
to £39.1m due to more aircraft being owned rather 
than leased. Included within the amortisation 
cost is £0.5m of accelerated amortisation on an 
identified group of intangible assets where the 
useful economic life has been reduced due to the 
planned implementation of a digital platform; and
 > Net other operating gains totalled £18.8m 
(2015/16: £7.0m) resulting from the aforementioned 
£26.0m of currency gains offset by £7.2m of losses 
on disposal of assets including £4.3m related to the 
one-off write-down of It intangibles arising from the 
new digital platform. 
t he MRo business, Flybe Aviation Services (FAS) 
generated a profit before tax of £3.4m (2015/16: 
£2.5m) as third party revenues increased 39.5% to 
£31.8m. t he A400M facility in brize Norton maintained 
its strong contribution to the FAS result. In 2017/18 it 
is anticipated that there will be a reduced contribution 
from the A400M service contract as FAS moves from 
the start-up phase into business as usual. 
Overview
t hrough deploying the added legacy fleet 
commitments along with an evolving route network 
and improved customer offering, total revenue 
increased by 13.4% to £707.4m (2015/16: £623.8m). 
Seat capacity increased by 12.3% to 12.7 million 
seats, and passenger numbers increased by 7.6% to 
8.8 million. Passenger yield (on seats sold) has been 
resilient, holding broadly flat at £70.20 but revenue 
per seat has fallen by 3.6% to £48.84, reflecting the 
increased capacity and competitive market conditions. 
o ur cost base is predominantly driven by the 12.3% 
capacity growth with operating costs increasing by 
15.4% from £615.1m to £709.8m. Costs this year are 
adversely affected by the fall in the value of sterling 
but as we hedged most of our currency requirements 
there is a total (spot and hedged) currency gain of 
£26.0m within other operating gains. At a line level, 
the main cost variances can be summarised as follows:
 > Fuel costs fell 3.6% from £104.9m to £101.1m 
with a gain of £16.0m (15.8%) arising from falling 
fuel prices (net of £7.1m of adverse u S dollar 
movements) offset by c£(12.2)m (12.1%) of higher 
costs arising due to increased flying;
 > Net airport and en route charges increased by 
26.0% to £148.2m due to a combination of higher 
airport charges, currency and increased flying;
 > Ground operations costs increased by 16.1% 
to £94.3m due to increased flying and 
currency impact;
 > Staff costs increased 15.8% to £120.2m mainly due 
to the increase in capacity and the 2.0% salary 
increase awarded as part of the three-year pay deal;
 > Aircraft rental costs increased 20.2% to £97.5m due 
primarily to the fall in sterling as most agreements 
are denominated in u S dollar, and the increase in 
capacity. At constant currency, aircraft rental costs 
numbers were c8% higher;
Flybe made an adjusted loss before tax
2
 of £(6.7)m 
(2015/16: profit of £5.5m). t his is adjusted by non-
cash revaluations on our u S dollar loans that are 
intended to be natural hedges against the value of each 
aircraft, whose value is denominated in the dollar rate 
prevailing when acquired. Including these non-cash 
revaluations, Flybe made a loss before tax of £(19.9)m 
(2015/16: profit of £2.7m). 
Flybe continues to have a strong balance sheet 
with free cash of £115.1m at the end of March 2017 
(2016: £163.6m) net of restricted cash of £9.2m 
(2016: £7.8m). Net debt at 31
st
 March 2017 was  
£(64.0)m (2016: net funds of £62.2m). t his change 
was mainly due to £140.3m of capital expenditure 
primarily reflecting the cost of buying more owned 
aircraft (£98.4m) and other capital expenditure relating 
to components (£17.8m), capitalised maintenance 
(£16.7m), plus It and other items (£7.4m).

increasing by 10.1% to 153,000 (2015/16: 139,000). 
t he increased flying of the e195 fleet contributed 
approximately half of the additional seats. Flybe served 
8.8 million customers on its network, a 7.6% increase 
(2015/16: 8.2 million). t he combination of overcapacity

aircraft was removed and in return Flybe committed 
to sub-leasing 24 smaller used Republic Q400 aircraft 
between 2015 and 2019. In 2015/16 Flybe took delivery 
of five Republic aircraft.
Flybe subsequently entered into a contract in March 
2016 with Nordic Aviation Capital (‘NAC’), to cancel 
obligations to lease nine of the 24 used bombardier 
Q400 turboprop aircraft it was committed to under 
the terms of the embraer and Republic agreement, 
and in return to take ownership of 10 Q400 aircraft it 
was under contract to lease, for a cash consideration 
of u SD131.8m (£103.0m). t his earned Flybe a return on 
capital employed of c12% and provided much greater 
flexibility for aircraft deployment or divestment. of the 
10 aircraft, five were delivered in 2015/16, and another
