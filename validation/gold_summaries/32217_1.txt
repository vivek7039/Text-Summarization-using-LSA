 Chief Executive’s 
statement
ULS has continued  
to make good 
progress, building  
on its clear strategy 
of growing market 
share, revenue and 
profit, through a 
combination of 
organic growth 
and tactical 
acquisition activity.
Ben Thompson
Chief Executive 
Officer
Overview of operational performance 
ULS agreed that it would focus on the 
following as part of its growth strategy:
• Build new technology to attract more 
lender-related conveyancing;
• Forge inroads into providing 
conveyancing to customers who 
traditionally would have bought 
conveyancing through Estate  
Agents; and
• Acquire businesses that directly or 
indirectly assist ULS in growing its  
overall conveyancing market share.
 
All of the above have progressed well 
throughout the year, contributing to a 
revenue increase of 8% and underlying 
profit growth of 15%. 
Strategic progress
The Group has made strong progress over 
the last year, with healthy organic growth 
achieved against a market where housing 
transactions have continued to fall 
markedly below long term historical 
averages. In addition, the last year has 
been a tough market, with tax changes 
impacting landlords and the Buy-to-Let 
market, and the slowdown in activity 
following the EU Referendum.
In 2016, ULS took a 35% stake in 
HomeOwners Alliance (HOA), with an 
option to acquire the business between 
three and five years following completion 
of the investment. 
ULS Technology Annual Report 2017 14 The Group is pleased to report that it  
has successfully tailored and embedded 
its technology within HOA’s website and 
that this has delivered new conveyancing 
growth over the last year.
The Group has won new conveyancing 
contracts with two mortgage lenders, 
having invested efforts into building a 
complete suite of technology and services 
to help lenders provide their customers 
with the best possible moving experience. 
This new proposition to lenders includes 
services offered by Legal Eye, which ULS 
acquired in 2015. ULS intends to continue 
its growth into lender related conveyancing 
through the coming year and beyond.
One of the other new markets into which 
ULS can grow is the Estate Agency 
conveyancing market. ULS has historically 
not been involved in this market, but has 
now built two routes through which it can 
offer its technology and services to 
customers selling and buying homes 
through this sector:
1. Via its own Estate Agency comparison 
technology accessed through 
HomeOwners Alliance 
(www.estateagent4me.co.uk);
2. Through Conveyancing Alliance Limited. 
ULS has spent the last year or so honing 
and piloting new technology to enable 
home sellers to compare the performance 
of traditional and online Estate Agents free 
of charge on one technology platform. The 
Group has now successfully embedded 
this technology into HomeOwners Alliance, 
which promotes this online via its own 
portal. Through this promotion, ULS 
attracts customers who wish to move 
house and need help selecting a suitable 
conveyancing service, thereby enabling 
the Group to make inroads directly to 
customers in this market.
ULS has been pursuing complementary 
acquisition opportunities, and at the end  
of 2016, acquired Conveyancing Alliance 
Holdings Limited. CAL constitutes a 
perfect fit for ULS, in that they have 
experienced strong growth with small 
mortgage broker firms, whereas ULS has 
successfully grown with larger firms. Also 
CAL has enjoyed comparable success 
partnering independent Estate Agents  
to provide conveyancing services.
CAL is therefore the second channel  
that ULS has acquired and will use to  
grow conveyancing market share in the 
Estate Agency sector, helping customers 
to access a breadth of choice at 
comparatively low cost, and move  
home as seamlessly as possible.
This tactical acquisition of CAL was 
highly earnings enhancing for ULS  
and enables the Group to continue  
its deliberate strategy of growing its 
conveyancing market share, through 
adding to its existing channels as  
well as accessing new ones. 
Outlook
We approach the new financial  
year in the knowledge that we  
are successfully increasing our 
conveyancing market share in a 
smaller housing transactions market. 
We intend to continue outperforming 
the market through further enhancing 
our technology and services that  
we provide to our business partners 
and their customers. We see that 
technology and processes will 
continually need to be further  
honed and improved, as technology 
progresses and advances at pace.  
We are committed to doing things 
better than our competitors, with 
customers central in influencing our 
thinking and technology design.
Our expectations are for a slightly 
smaller housing market in terms of 
transactions. We will strive to further 
increase our market share organically 
through expansion into more lender 
related conveyancing and through 
becoming more involved in 
conveyancing in the Estate Agency 
sector. There is a lot of upside  
potential from this organic growth.
In addition, we will continue to look 
actively at acquiring businesses that 
help us to progress our strategy more 
quickly and will acquire where 
appropriate and possible to do so.
We are pleased with how ULS has 
grown over the last year and look 
forward to what we expect to be 
an exciting and rewarding new 
financial year.
