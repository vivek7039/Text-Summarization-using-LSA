 Hargreaves Lansdown ⁄ Report and Financial Statements 2017 04
Empowering our clients to save and invest with confidence is 
why we are in business, and I am pleased to report that we have 
delivered record levels of net new business and profits this year 
alongside maintaining our usual high client service standards. 
The Board recognises the importance of developing a team 
which contains the best talent in the industry. We have overseen 
a transition to new executive leadership this year and I am 
encouraged by the energy and commitment they bring to making 
our business even better in the future. This is my last Annual Report 
as Chairman and I am confident that I am leaving a business that 
is well positioned for our next phase of growth.
Overview of the year
Our year commenced in the shadow of the surprise EU referendum 
result, which led to market volatility, uncertainty, which still 
remains, and consequent weak investor confidence. As a result, 
asset gathering in the first half was adversely impacted. The 
business responded positively to this challenge in the second half, 
bringing innovative fund propositions to our client base, launching 
our new mobile app, running successful digital and transfer mailing 
campaigns and maintaining our client service levels through a busy 
tax year end. This resulted in £6.9 billion of net new business for 
the full year, testament to the strength of our offering, brand and 
market position. 
This flow of new business combined with significant market growth 
to drive AUA to nearly £80 billion as at 30 June 2017 . While we have 
continued to invest part of the resultant revenue increase in our 
business to support growth, client service and broadening our 
offering, we were still able to deliver 21% growth in profit before tax 
to £265.8 million.
Board changes
It has been a busy year for changes to our Board and Executive 
Committee. As announced last year, Ian Gorham decided to step 
down as CEO and this took effect from 9 February 2017 . The Board 
thanks Ian for his outstanding contribution to Hargreaves 
Lansdown. Ian was replaced by Chris Hill who initially joined as CFO 
in February 2016, before becoming deputy CEO in September 2016. 
His appointment followed a full assessment undertaken by the 
Nomination Committee. In turn, this led to the need for a new CFO. 
Following an extensive search and rigorous assessment process, 
we were delighted that Philip Johnson joined in February 2017 and, 
after receiving regulatory approval, was appointed to the Board in 
April 2017 . Philip brings considerable experience as a plc CFO 
and expertise from across the financial services industry. Together 
I believe Chris and Philip are a great combination to lead the 
business into its next phase of growth.
