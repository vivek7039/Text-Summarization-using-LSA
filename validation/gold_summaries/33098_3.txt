 Chairman’s Review
RESULTS
Normalised Total Pro t for the year to 31 
December 2014 increased by 41 .0% to £65.3 
million (2013: £46.3 million). Normalised 
Income Pro t, which excludes pro ts or losses 
from the sale of properties (essentially the 
repeatable earnings of the business), increased 
by 22.3% to £48.2 million (2013: £39.4 million). 
Normalised Income Pro t per share increased 
by 14.5% to 7 .1p (2012: 6.2p). Had it not been 
for the fall in the value of the Euro compared 
with 31 December 2013, Normalised Total Pro t 
for 2014 would have been £1 .9 million higher. 
Basic earnings per share were 17 .6p (2013: 
9.1p) and diluted EPRA earnings per share were 
5.2p (2013: 5.0p). Pro t before tax increased by 
100.9% to £131 .2 million (2013: £65.3 million). 
The Group’s EPRA Net Asset Value was 102p 
per share (2013: 91p), an increase of 12.1% 
despite the adverse currency movement. 
DIVIDEND
Hansteen has paid a covered dividend every 
year since the  rst dividend distribution in 
2006 and during that period, it has increased 
by 66.7%. Our dividend policy is designed 
to re#ect the high income generated by the 
business and we remain committed to a 
prudently progressive dividend policy. The 
Board already increased the interim dividend 
paid on 20 November 2014 by 5.3% to 2.0p per 
share (November 2013: 1 .9p per share) and will 
pay the second ongoing dividend, increased 
by 3.4% to 3.0p per share (May 2013: 2.9p) 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 5.0p, 
a 4.2% increase on 2013. 
 
In 2014, Hansteen took advantage of a strong 
investment market to sell £315.3 million 
of property from the owned or co-owned 
portfolio, crystallising pro ts of £26.1 million 
over the 31 December 2013 valuation and £47 .7 
million over gross acquisition cost. The Board

Proﬁt increased by

I am pleased to present the results for  
the year ended 31 December 2014  
and the Company’ s Strategic Report.
Hansteen’s aim is to provide investors with consistent, high and 
realised returns from predominantly industrial property. 2014 has been 
a year in which all elements of our business model have excelled and 
I am delighted to report record results in terms of pro ts and value 
growth, re#ected in an increased interim dividend together with a 
special dividend.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Chairman’s Review proposes to re#ect this success in the payment 
of a special dividend of 3.0p per share, which 
will be paid in addition to the ‘ongoing’ interim 
dividend also of 3.0p per share.
The total dividend of 6.0p will be payable on 21 
May 2015 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 24 April 2015. A Property 
Income Distribution of 1 .4p is included in this 
second interim dividend payment.
OUR BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
Hansteen is a leading owner and asset 
manager of a very diverse portfolio of European 
industrial property, mainly located in Germany, 
the UK and the Netherlands. We look for 
investments that are priced attractively and 
which will create a sustainable and high-yielding 
industrial property portfolio. We also assess 
other more opportunistic and management 
intensive acquisitions which, although lower 
yielding, will provide greater potential for capital 
growth. Our strategy is achieved through a 
detailed assessment of opportunities in the 
UK and Continental Europe. In many cases 
our purchases are ‘off market’ and can involve 
patiently assembling or reconciling stakeholder 
interests in a deal. Our acquisition of the HBI 
portfolio in the Netherlands is a good example 
of this. 
After purchase, our strategy is to maximise the 
rental income and occupancy of our properties 
through active asset management initiatives 
leading to increased values. We aim to realise 
and distribute these pro ts to our shareholders 
over the course of a property cycle either by 
sales of individual lots or by larger portfolio 
disposals. 
Our people are at the centre of our success. We 
have 15 of ces with experienced management 
teams across the UK and our regions in 
Continental Europe. We work hard at creating 
the right relationships with our stakeholders so 
that we are in the prime position to act when 
opportunities arise.
BOARD CHANGES
Stephen Gee retired as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2014 and Richard Mully will retire as 
a Non-Executive Director of the Company at the 
Annual General Meeting on 8 June 2015.
As part of the process of succession planning 
for Non-Executive Directors, Melvyn Egglenton 
and Rebecca Worthington were welcomed 
to the Board on 10 June 2014. Melvyn and 
Rebecca were also appointed as members 
of both the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee, effective from the 
same date.
Richard Mully will retire from the Board at the 
Annual General Meeting in June 2015. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank Richard 
Mully for his substantial contribution and 
commitment to Hansteen’s growth and success 
over the past nine years. His knowledge and 
experience of continental property markets has 
been exceptionally valuable to the Board.
FOUNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The LTIP is based on the growth of EPRA NAV 
plus dividends, which was put in place for the 
Joint Chief Executives at the time of the initial 
#oatation in 2005 and which has not paid out 
to date. However, if the current performance 
continues until the end of 2015, the joint Chief 
Executives will receive a signi cant reward. 
Details are set out below in the  nance report. 
The potential award can only be estimated at 
this stage and is dependent on the performance 
over this three year period.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Chairman’s Review OUTLOOK
Further improvements in both the occupational 
and investor markets across all three of our 
core regions have enabled the business to 
produce another year of record results. We 
have sold a signi cant amount of property into 
a very buoyant UK investment market releasing 
capital and allowing Hansteen to make some 
noteworthy acquisitions. These acquisitions, 
having a high initial yield and a material vacant 
element,  t our business model perfectly.
Hansteen has a very diverse, high yielding 
portfolio of light industrial property located 
across Germany, the UK and Benelux. The 
income from the Group’s portfolio has proved 
robust throughout the recession years and 
should continue to be so in the future. Our 
asset management teams have proved adept at 
improving occupancy and the rent roll and also 
at realising opportunities. Business con dence 
and the underlying economy are improving in 
each of our regions providing an improving back-
drop to our business. However, these levers 
for growth have now been supported and in 
some areas outstripped by the extraordinarily 
low interest rate environment within which we 
are operating and, more recently the weight of 
capital buying property for yield.
Our optimism for the future must however be 
tempered by the current uncertainties in the 
euro zone and the potential for the volatility of 
the Euro.
At the time of our last half year results we 
highlighted that the then current interest rate 
environment was extraordinarily low. Since 
then rates have approximately halved and 
there is a general acknowledgement that these 
rates are likely to stay low for longer than 
was hitherto expected. Such a background 
to the operation of a high yielding property 
business is outside the experience of most 
people working today but the likelihood must 
be that it will provide scope for continued 
yield compression and further liquidity in the 
property sector.
Improvements in both the occupational and investor 
markets across all three of our core regions have 
enabled the business to produce another year of 
record results
