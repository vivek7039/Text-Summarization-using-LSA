 Chairman’s introduction  
and compliance statements
Good governance is 
essential for enabling 
our Board to operate 
effectively in the 
leadership of the Group 
and in promoting the 
success of the Company 
in the long term.
Paul Walker
Chairman
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present Halma's Corporate 
Governance Report. This Report 
aims to provide shareholders and other 
stakeholders with an appreciation of 
how our Group is managed and the 
governance and control framework 
in which Halma operates. Good 
governance is essential for enabling 
our Board to operate effectively in 
the leadership of the Group and in 
promoting the success of the 
Company in the long term. 
Our culture of openness, transparency, 
constructive challenge and support, 
facilitates management in embedding 
our governance and control procedures 
throughout the business.
The Board is committed to maintaining 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and this Report sets out 
how we have applied the main 
principles and relevant provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014. 
Leadership
Our focus on improving the quality 
and performance of Halma's 
management team continued 
throughout 2016/17. Senior 
management appointments have 
been made in a number of key areas 
to support Halma's growth strategy, 
including sector talent, M&A, 
communications and strategic 
development in Asia Pacific.
At Board level, we promoted Jennifer 
Ward in September 2016, to an 
expanded role and main Board position 
of Group Talent and Communications 
Director. In October 2016, Jo Harlow 
joined the Board as a non-executive 
Director. Jo offers complementary and 
new skills to our Board and her global 
experience in innovation, product 
development and marketing has been 
particularly valuable. As I highlighted 
in last year's Report, Carole Cran 
assumed the role of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee in July 2016 and 
successfully led a competitive audit 
tender process during the year.

right balance of skills, experience and 
knowledge on our Board to deliver

innovative and entrepreneurial. 
Compliance statements
Throughout the year ended 1 April

the provisions as set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 
(a copy of which is available on the 
Financial Reporting Council's website 
at www.frc.org.uk). The Group's 
approach to risk management and 
internal control is set out on pages 
20 to 21. 
The Directors confirm that they 
consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
Company's position and performance.
How the Board supported strategy 
Governance at Halma, like its business model, is ingrained in the operating culture throughout the organisation and 
within the Board of Directors. With a model that has had great success in terms of consistent dividend growth and 
financial performance, the Board has not needed to oversee any large scale changes but has not been complacent and 
has continued to improve the discipline around its processes and procedures to ensure that they are fitting for a company 
that is near the top of the FTSE 250.

The Board has set a clear strategy for 
growth and provides businesses with the 
necessary resources and support to enable 
them to contribute to the Group's growth 
objective.
 — Our autonomous, but supportive, business 
model has enabled our Process Safety sector 
companies to respond rapidly to changing 
market conditions and to diversify into new 
markets, while maintaining a presence in the 
oil and gas markets. 
acquire

The Board monitors the diversity of the 
Group's portfolio of businesses to ensure 
that proposed acquisitions or new market 
niches of strategic interest complement 
the strategic objectives of the Group.
 — The increase in M&A resource within the sectors 
during 2016/17 has enabled the Group to build 
more relationships and explore more opportunities 
to collaborate with other businesses, which will 
assist us in securing appropriate acquisitions to 
support our growth objective.

The Board empowers local management 
to operate with relative autonomy, within 
a clear structured governance framework 
that provides the necessary tools and 
guidance without stifling the agile and 
entrepreneurial approach that underpins 
Halma's business model.
 — Our biennial HITEx conference, which 
encourages innovative thinking and 
collaboration between our businesses, was 
attended by over 200 of our business leaders, 
providing our companies with the tools and 
insight that they will need to adapt their 
respective businesses quickly to changes in this 
digital age.
innovate

The Board recognise that part of Halma's 
fundamental strength is derived not 
only from its selection of specialist 
technologies in markets with resilient 
growth drivers but also in targeting 
investment in the development of new 
and existing products and services. 
 — Investment in developing new products and 
services in existing and adjacent markets is a key 
strength that our businesses can leverage by 
being part of Halma. Our R&D investment 
across the Group has been over £50m in the 
past year.
Halma's business model is set out on 
pages 4 and 5 and an explanation of 
the strategy and longer-term 
objectives of the Company is 
contained within the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 67.
Board priorities
Our priorities for 2017/18 are to: 
focus on delivering a robust 
performance across all sectors 
during a time of political and economic 
change in many regions; build on the 
foundations we have established with 
talent and innovation; continue to 
encourage our businesses to innovate, 
collaborate and seek out opportunities 
that keep pace with digital 
developments; and seek acquisition 
opportunities in new and existing 
markets which complement our 
strategy and portfolio and can 
deliver the growth that we expect.
