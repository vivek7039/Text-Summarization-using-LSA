Chief Executive’s Review
B
loomsbury has had a year 
of strong progress – with 
excellent revenue growth and 
good strategic development through 
investment in the Bloomsbury 2020 digital 
resources growth strategy. Book sales, 
and print in particular, continue to be 
resilient in spite of political and economic 
uncertainty. 
Bloomsbury achieved excellent revenue 
growth of 15% for the year ending 
28 February 2017 (9% at constant currencies) resulting in total 
revenues of £142.6 million (2016: £123.7 million). Profit before 
tax and highlighted items was £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million), 
£1.0 million below the prior year in line with the guidance we gave 
in May 2016 to reflect our £0.6 million investment in the Bloomsbury 
2020 digital resources growth strategy and also the end of the 
seven–year term of the Qatar Foundation contract in December 
2015.
During the year revenues generated by each of Bloomsbury’s four 
territorial offices grew. The Group’s ambitious plans to grow in 
Australia, announced in July 2016, saw Bloomsbury Australia grow 
revenues by 50% (26% at constant currencies) from £7.0 million 
to £10.5 million. Revenues in Bloomsbury India grew 46% (30% at 
constant currencies) and the business made an operating profit 
for the first time. 61% of Bloomsbury’s sales now originate from 
customers outside the UK (2016: 54%).
Book sales grew by 18% year on year to £133.3 million, with digital 
sales, included in this total, increasing by 7% to £16.0 million. Digital 
growth was driven by strong sales of digital resources. Rights and 
services revenues were £9.3 million (2016: £10.6 million), being 7%  
of total Group revenues compared to 9% in the previous year. 
The Consumer division, and Children’s publishing in particular, 
delivered an excellent performance, with its fourth year in a row of 
double digit revenue growth. The Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter 
and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling and illustrated by Jim 
Kay was a major international seller. Book sales in the Non-Consumer 
division grew by 5% but, as expected, the division saw a reduction 
in rights and services revenues following the end of the term of the 
Qatar contract and last year’s strong rights performance.
A key strategic focus in 2016/17 was the Bloomsbury 2020 digital 
resources growth strategy. During the year we built a new platform 
to host our digital resources. Our programme is on schedule, with 
two resources launched onto the new platform. We are encouraged 
that digital resources revenues exceeded our expectation, growing 
by 50% year on year to £3.9 million. Our guidance on future 
investment and returns for this growth strategy is unchanged. 
Due to the strong trading in the year, the Group was able to make 
a bonus provision of £1.0 million (2016: Nil).
“This has been a very strong year for 
Bloomsbury with excellent revenue growth in 
all our territories. Our Children’ s publishing, 
in particular, had an exceptional year, 
delivering double digit revenue growth for the 
fourth year in a row. 
W e are well-placed for the coming year.  
W e are launching three further major  
digital resources, as planned, and have  
an exciting publishing list from new and 
existing authors. ”

Chief Executive’s Review
Highlighted items of £2.6 million (2016: £2.7 million) include  
£1.7 million (2016: £1.8 million) of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets. Other highlighted items in this period of £0.9 million are 
primarily as a result of the strategic restructuring of the US operation. 
The effective rate of tax for the year was 22% compared to 6% for 
the year ended 29 February 2016. The rate last year was low as it 
included the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses and  
a double tax relief benefit.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, were 
12.63 pence (2016: 15.24 pence). Total diluted earnings per share  
for the year were 9.81 pence compared to 12.93 pence in 2016.
Cash generation was strong with cash and cash equivalents net  
of bank overdraft of £15.5 million at 28 February 2017 (2016:  
£5.2 million). Our focus on working capital continues – stock 
has reduced by 5% or £1.3 million year on year, using constant 
currencies. We are working to achieve a similar stock reduction 
in the new financial year. Our strategic priority for cash is organic 
investment to grow and enhance our existing business. Including 
capital expenditure, during the year we invested an additional £1.5 
million of cash in Bloomsbury 2020. 
Another strategic priority for cash is the growth of our dividend. 
The Group has a progressive dividend policy while aiming to keep 
dividend earnings cover in excess of two. Investment in Bloomsbury 
2020 is leading to earnings cover falling below that level in the 
short-term, but the dividend is underpinned by strong cash cover. 
The Board has committed during this period of investment to 
maintain its progressive dividend policy on the basis that earnings 
cover will improve as the return on Bloomsbury 2020 accrues. The 
Directors are therefore recommending a final dividend of 5.6 pence 
per share, which subject to shareholder approval at our AGM on 18 
July 2017, will be paid on 20 September 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 August 2017. Together with 
the interim dividend, this makes a total dividend for the year ended 
28 February 2017 of 6.7 pence per share, a 5% increase on the  
6.4 pence dividend for the year ended 29 February 2016. Including 
the full year dividend increase, over the past 12 years the dividend 
has increased steadily at a compound annual growth rate of 7%.
Consumer division
The Consumer division, which consists of Adult and Children’s 
trade publishing, has had an exceptional year, significantly due 
to an excellent Children’s performance. Revenue for the division 
increased by 28% to £85.4 million (2016: £66.4 million). Operating 
profit before highlighted items increased by 33% to £7.9 million 
(2016: £6.0 million). There was good revenue growth in all territories; 
23% in Australia, 17% in the US, 55% in India and 21% in the UK  
(all at constant currencies).

The division won many important awards, notably the Financial 
Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award for The Man 
Who Knew, a biography of Alan Greenspan by Sebastian Mallaby; 
and Bloomsbury Children’s Books became the first publisher in 
50 years to win both the Carnegie and Greenaway Medals for One 
by Sarah Crossan and Chris Riddell for illustrating The Sleeper and 
the Spindle by Neil Gaiman. The Children’s team were shortlisted for 
the Independent Publishers Guild Children’s Publisher of the Year 
and the British Book Awards Children’s Publisher of the Year. These 
awards recognise the high standard and quality of our authors and 
illustrators and support our strategy to focus on acquiring global 
commercial rights, targeted and strategic marketing and brand 
management of our major authors. 
Children’s revenues increased by 48% to £55.9 million (2016: 
£37.7 million). Operating profit before highlighted items increased by 
44% to £7.6 million (2016: £5.3 million). Sales of Harry Potter titles grew 
by 88% in the year. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Illustrated 
Edition was published to great acclaim in October 2016. We sold rights 
to Jim Kay’s Harry Potter illustrations, in which we control world rights, 
in 30 languages. The film tie-in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 
– Newt Scamander: A Movie Scrapbook sold well following the release 
of the film, the first of five, in November 2016. Sales of Sarah J. Maas 
titles grew by 87% year on year. A Court of Mist and Fury, the second 
book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, was number one on 
the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list. Her new Throne of Glass 
novel – Empire of Storms – was on the New York Times Series bestseller 
list for nine weeks reaching number two and was also number two on 
the Bookseller UK children’s chart. The success of Sarah J. Maas and 
other Young Adult publishing contributed significantly to Children’s 
e-book sales increasing by 19% to £3.4 million. Neil Gaiman reached 
number one in the Nielsen BookScan original fiction chart with Norse 
Mythology. Bloomsbury Children’s UK market share value grew by 
21% year on year to 4% (source: Nielsen BookScan). During the year 
we created a Children’s Non-Fiction team to enhance focus and 
growth in that part of the division.
Adult revenues increased by 3% to £29.5 million (2016: £28.7 
million). Operating profit before highlighted items of £0.3 million 
(2016: £0.7 million) was affected by a reduction in higher margin 
e-book revenues and increased advance provisions. William Boyd’s 
Sweet Caress, Ann Patchett’s Commonwealth, Hannah Rothschild’s 
Improbability of Love and Natasha Pulley’s The Watchmaker of Filigree 
Street all sold strongly. In cookery, Tom Kerridge’s Dopamine Diet 
sold over 140,000 copies and went to number one in the overall 
Nielsen BookScan chart in the UK on publication. Le Manoir Aux Quat’ 
Saisons by Raymond Blanc also sold well. Peter Frankopan’s The Silk 
Roads was in the Sunday Times paperback non-fiction chart for 11 
weeks and in the US, Dreamland by Sam Quinones won the National 
Book Critics Circle non-fiction award. Bloomsbury Adult in the UK 
grew market share by value by 2% year on year (source: Nielsen 
BookScan).
Sales of Harry Potter titles grew during the year helped by the release 
of the next in the series of illustrated editions and a film tie–in.
Bloomsbury’s bestselling fiction authors enjoyed an impressive year. 
Sarah J. Maas topped the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list 
whilst Neil Gaiman topped the UK Neilson BookScan original fiction 
chart.

Chief Executive’s Review
During the year a new Publishing Director joined the Adult team in 
London and we launched a new crime imprint, Raven Books, run by 
a new Editorial Director. Crime is a constantly growing segment of 
the market. Bloomsbury’s first book in this imprint, The River at Night 
by Erica Ferencik was published in January 2017. It is nominated 
as The Bookseller’s Book of the Month for June. The US Consumer 
division has been restructured and a new Editorial Director for 
Fiction was appointed in January 2017. 
Non-Consumer division
The Non-Consumer division consists of Academic & Professional, 
Special Interest and Content Services. Both revenues in the division 
of £57.2 million (2016: £57.3 million) and adjusted operating profits 
of £4.1 million (2016: £7.1 million) were affected by the end of the 
term of the Qatar Foundation contract in December 2015, our 
£0.6 million net incremental investment in Bloomsbury 2020 and the 
benefit of a full year of results from certain Family Law titles, which 
were acquired in January 2016. Academic & Professional revenues 
make up 65% of total division revenues and were up 1%. Within 
this, Education had revenue of £2.5 million (2016: £3.9 million) and 
operating profit before highlighted items of £0.3 million (2016: 
£0.7 million) in the year ended 28 February 2017. The £1.4 million 
reduction in revenues year on year is due to a strong year for 
rights sales last year. Excluding Education, Academic & Professional 
revenues grew by 5%. 
The Bloomsbury 2020 digital resources growth strategy, announced 
in May 2016, will make Bloomsbury a leading non-consumer 
publisher in the B2B academic and professional information market 
and significantly accelerate the growth of digital revenues. The 
plan is to increase the output and speed to market of a range of 
new digital products, provide a robust scalable set of platforms, 
and improve the strength, depth and geographical spread of our 
institutional digital sales team. Bloomsbury Digital Resources, a 
separate team within Non-Consumer, has been set up under its own 
Managing Director and Sales Director to bring this to fruition more 
quickly. During the year ended 28 February 2017, the focus of this 
plan was to deliver the digital platform upon which to host the new 
services and hire the new content acquisition, sales and marketing 
teams as well as launch two new resources on the new platform. 
All this was achieved as planned during the year. Academic & 
Professional digital resources revenues grew by 58% to £3.7 million 
(2016: £2.4 million), well above our expectations. Over 40% of digital 
resources revenues originated from outside the UK, with the largest 
single territory being North America at 33% (2016: 18%) which had 
194% revenue growth year on year. Bloomsbury now has over 1,700 
active institutional customers worldwide for its digital resources 
(2016: 1,009), a growth of 68%. All our existing major digital resources 
saw revenue growth. In the year, as planned, we launched four 
new major digital resources: Fairchild Books Library, The Fashion 
Photography Archive, Arcadian Library and Bloomsbury Popular 
Music – the latter two hosted on our new platform. In addition, there 
were a number of modules added to existing products including

BBC Drama and Hollow Crown added to Drama Online, which now 
reaches over one million students worldwide. The pipeline of new 
resources is strong – over the next year we will be launching three 
new resources: The Bloomsbury Design Library, The Bloomsbury 
Food Library and Bloomsbury Cultural History, as well as three new 
modules to Drama Online.
Including e-book revenues, Academic & Professional digital 
revenues in total grew by 25% year on year to £6.9 million, more 
than four times the industry growth rate of 6% for academic and 
professional digital revenues (Source: Publishing Association 
Yearbook 2016). 
The Academic division generally had a good year, with a sizeable 
increase in output of titles, a third Dartmouth prize in seven years 
and a new strategic partnership for the Classics list with leading 
exam board Oxford Cambridge and RSA, making Bloomsbury the 
largest publisher in UK secondary schools classics. Bloomsbury’s 
expanding digital resources sales mitigated the ongoing flat US 
print library budgets. The effect of retailer text book rental and used 
book programmes on higher education text book sales in North 
America, while structurally significant for the market, is restricted 
within Bloomsbury to the Fairchild Books list. Fairchild comprises 7% 
of Non-Consumer revenues and less than 3% of Group revenue. 
Through Bloomsbury 2020, we are able to exploit the Fairchild 
content digitally on Bloomsbury Fashion Central, with direct 
institutional sales. 
The integration of the Family Law titles, acquired in January 2016, 
into Bloomsbury’s Professional division was completed during 
the year. Family Law contributed £0.9 million of revenue (2016: 
£0.3 million) and £0.5 million of profit (2016: £0.3 million), in excess 
of our expectations. Excluding these results in both years, Group 
revenues grew by 15% (9% at constant currencies). 
In the year, Bloomsbury was shortlisted for Academic, Educational 
and Professional Publisher of the Year at the Bookseller Industry 
Awards, for the fourth year in a row. 
Our focus on special interest niches is succeeding, with revenues 
up by 5% to £18.4 million (2016: £17.5 million). The value of our 
strategy is the ability to pinpoint market sectors and promote and 
sell direct to a community of shared interest. Our chosen niches 
are military history (through Osprey), natural history (through 
Helm and Poyser), sport (through Nautical, Reeds, and Wisden), 
popular science (through Sigma) and reference (through Who’s 
Who, Whitaker’s, and www.writersandartists.co.uk). In each of these 
areas we have strengthened our editorial positioning, and invested 
in digital marketing, new products and widening our portfolio. In 
particular, Wisden has seen one of its highest sales for many years. 
The division launched the Green Tree imprint in February 2017 with 
the goal of publishing the best in health and wellness books – a 
natural extension from our expertise in sport and fitness publishing. 
Bloomsbury Popular Music and Arcadian Library were 
launched during the year on our new digital platform.

Chief Executive’s Review
Bloomsbury Content Services had revenue growth of 9% to 
£1.9 million (excluding the loss of £1.5 million revenue year on 
year from the end of the term of the Qatar contract). This organic 
growth was in content marketing and publishing services, with new 
customers including the Royal Bank of Canada and the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The agreement with 
the Institute of Labor Economics for the provision of publishing, 
marketing and digital services for the IZA World of Labor knowledge 
hub was extended for a further 18 months from January 2017. A new 
and enhanced version of the website was launched in February 2017.
Outlook 
In 2017/18 we will continue to expand Bloomsbury 2020 digital growth 
resources by launching three further digital services. 
June 2017 is the 20th anniversary since Harry Potter and the 
Philosopher’s Stone was first published. To celebrate, there will be 
new editions of this title and a series of events. There is a new edition 
of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them with a foreword by 
J.K.Rowling and six new beasts. There are also two new illustrated 
Harry Potter editions, the Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter and the 
Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Illustrated Edition of Fantastic Beasts 
and Where to Find Them. In addition our strong publishing list for  
the new year includes Utopia for Realists by Rutger Bregman, Lincoln 
in the Bardo by George Saunders, A Court of Wings and Ruin by  
Sarah J. Maas, The Strange Death of Europe by Douglas Murray and  
Breaking Mad by Anna Williamson.
Trading in the new financial year is in line with our expectations.
