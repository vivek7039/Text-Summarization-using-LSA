 Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 04
Strategic report
2017 has been a year of heightened global 
and political uncertainty and prospects of 
continued volatility across markets. In a 
world where change is happening at an 
ever‑increasing pace, our strategy to be the 
UK’s leading income focused REIT is well 
placed. I am therefore pleased to report 
another solid set of results, with underlying 
earnings per share at 2.75 pence, in line with 
recent guidance and EPRA NAV per share up 
3.5 per cent to 41.4 pence.
Results and dividend
Underlying earnings increased by 7.6 per 
cent to £49.8 million (2016: £46.3 million). 
Underlying earnings per share are in line with 
guidance at 2.75 pence and form the base 
from which we will grow income in line with 
our medium‑term growth target of 3.0 to 
5.0 per cent per annum.
EPRA NAV increased by 3.5 per cent to 
41.4 pence per share (2016: 40.0 pence per 
share) supported by a 3.0 per cent like‑for‑like 
increase in the value of the Group’s portfolio. 
The Board has declared a second interim 
dividend of 1.3 pence per share taking 
dividends declared for the full year to 
2.6 pence per share. The full year dividend 
reflects a pay-out ratio of 94.5 per cent 
of underlying earnings, delivering on our 
strategic priority of distributing superior 
income returns which are fully covered 
by underlying earnings and aligned with 
operating cash flow. The total dividend for 
the year of 2.6 pence per share reflects a 
6.3 per cent yield on EPRA NAV, over 50 per 
cent higher than the UK‑REIT average of 
4.1 per cent.
Strategic priorities
In February 2017 we held an inaugural Capital 
Markets Day and set out the Company’s 
strategic priorities which have the goal of 
delivering superior, sustainable and growing 
income returns. Following a period of 
significant growth and transactional activity 
these priorities underline our ongoing 
ambition to become the UK’s leading  
income focused REIT. 
Our initial earnings target of 2.7 to 2.8 pence 
per share has been achieved and in only six 
months we have made material progress in 
improving the quality of the portfolio so as to 
deliver long‑term sustainable income returns 
and enhanced growth prospects.
Scalable business
There are a number of long-term benefits 
associated with greater scale, including greater 
access to capital markets and liquidity, a lower 
cost of capital, overhead efficiencies and 
operational flexibility. However, these benefits 
will remain secondary to securing the right 
income focused investment opportunities for 
our shareholders. 
The acquisition of a further 32.8 per cent 
stake in International Hotel Properties Limited 
(“IHL”) by way of a scheme of arrangement, 
as announced in August 2017, will result in the 
issuance of approximately 45.9 million new 
Redefine International shares. In addition, 
the Company will reach agreement later 
today to acquire a further 5.0 million shares 
(representing an 8.9 per cent stake) in IHL 
from Redefine Properties on the same terms 
as the scheme of arrangement. 12.5 million 
new Redefine International shares will be

Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
issued	in	consideration	(representing	0.7 per	
cent of the current issued share capital). 
The completion	of	these	two	transactions	will	
result in the Group’s overall interest in IHL 
increasing	to	58.9	per	cent.	IHL	will	be	delisted	
and	the	portfolio	will	be	managed	as	part	
of the Group’s existing hotel portfolio. Last 
valued at £104.4 million, the assets include 
the	Hampton	By	Hilton	at	Gatwick	Airport,	
the Holiday Inn Express, Edinburgh and 
four Travelodge hotels providing long‑ dated 
uncapped CPI‑ linked income. The acquisition 
is expected to provide a yield on equity of over 
10	per	cent	which	will	be	earnings	enhancing	
and provide exposure to assets demonstrating 
strong trading performance. This acquisition 
clearly demonstrates our ambition to increase 
scale through investing in the right earnings 
enhancing opportunities.
Income focused portfolio
Our strategic priority to improve our 
portfolio’s exposure to more resilient property 
fundamentals supports our target to deliver 
secure,	sustainable	and	growing	income.	
Our investment	philosophy	is	simple;	we	look	
to invest in and extract value from assets 
which	can	deliver	consistent	and	growing	
income	returns.	Equally,	we	look	to	recycle	
capital from assets providing limited further 
rental	and/or	capital	growth	expectations,	
where	business	plans	have	been	successfully	
executed and value creation maximised.
It has been a productive year in terms of 
both investment and disposal activity. Over 
£148 million	was	generated	from	asset	sales	at	
a	premium	of	12.2	per	cent	to	book	value	with	
a further £11.0 million sold post year end. 
The disposals completed during the year are 
testament to our strategy as set out above. 
These	actions,	combined	with	disciplined	
reinvestment, are continuously improving 
the quality of the portfolio and its ability to 
deliver	long‑term	sustainable	and	growing	
income returns.
The Company is at advanced stages of 
negotiation on the sale of a portfolio of 
German retail assets for approximately 
€200 million.	The	sale	would	include	the	
repayment of associated debt facilities. 
This opportunistic	disposal	capitalises	on	an	
exceptionally strong investment market and 
an approximate 17 per cent increase in the 
value of the Euro relative to Sterling over the 
investment period.
The Company intends to recycle the disposal 
proceeds	into	new	investments	which	
are	in	line	with	the	Company’s	strategy	of	
enhancing the quality of the portfolio and its 
growth	prospects.	A	number	of	investment	
opportunities	have	been	identified	which	
are at various stages of due diligence. In 
particular, the Company is currently in 
exclusive negotiations to acquire a portfolio of 
high	quality	assets	in	the	UK	which,	if	acquired,	
would	utilise	the	majority	of	the	disposal	
proceeds. The income yield is expected to be 
commensurate	with	the	yield	achieved	on	the	
disposal and likely to be accretive to investors 
over	the	medium	term.	However,	there	
can be no guarantee that such acquisition 
will	proceed	to	completion,	and	a	further	
announcement	will	be	made	by	the	Company,	
as appropriate, in due course.
Our relentless focus on maximising income 
delivered from the portfolio is evidenced 
by the continued high level of occupancy 
achieved at 97.7 per cent (2016: 97.7 per cent). 
235	leasing	events	were	completed	during	
the	year	reflecting	a	3.9	per	cent	(£0.6	million)	
increase on passing rent and a 0.7 per cent 
increase on ERV. Excluding temporary leases, 
gross annualised rental income increased by 
5.0 per cent and 4.9 per cent on passing rent 
and ERV respectively. 
The redevelopment and expansion of existing 
assets remains an important part of our 
strategy to enhance the quality of the portfolio 
and deliver attractive income returns on 
marginal investment. Capital expenditure 
during	the	year	totalled	£19.6	million	with	
current	capital	projects	anticipated	to	provide	
a 7.6 per cent yield on cost.
Efficient capital structure
We are focused on further strengthening the 
balance	sheet	by	mitigating	refinancing	risk	
and	efficiently	reducing	leverage,	whilst	also	
limiting the impact on income. 
The Group’s loan‑ to‑ value ratio of 50.0 per 
cent,	reflecting	transactions	post	year	end,	
is at the top end of our medium‑ term target 
of 45 to 50 per cent. The acquisition of a 
further 44.0 per cent interest in the Leopard 
portfolio during the second half of the year 
raised leverage temporarily above 50 per cent 
but this has been largely addressed through 
successful disposals and the acquisition of the 
controlling interest in the IHL hotel portfolio 
post year end. 
Our investment 
philosophy is simple; 
we look to invest in 
and extract value 
from assets which 
can deliver consistent 
and growing 
income returns. Redefine International P.L.C.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s  
report 
 continued
The	Group’s	weighted	average	cost	of	debt	
stands at 3.1 per cent (2016: 3.4 per cent), 
below	our	medium‑term	target	of	3.2	to	
3.4 per	cent.	The	reduction	in	our	interest	
costs has provided enhanced interest cover 
at a	Group	level	of	3.2	times	(2016:	2.7	times).
The long‑ term debt secured against four of 
our	UK	Shopping	Centres	was	successfully	
restructured in the second half of the year 
to reduce leverage and interest costs. 
The aggregate	facility	of	£167.8	million	was	
reduced to £146.1 million, extended to 
April 2042	and	included	the	termination	of	the	
historic	profit	share	arrangement	on	Grand	
Arcade, Wigan. The aggregate prepayment 
and restructuring costs of £27.6 million 
provided a marginal return of approximately 
10	per	cent,	resulting	in	an	efficient	reduction	
in leverage. 
Financial discipline 
In	February	2017,	we	aligned	underlying	
earnings	to	the	EPRA	measure,	adjusted	
for	limited	Company	specific	non‑cash	
adjustments.	Utilising	this	industry	standard	
metric	will	provide	a	closer	alignment	of	
earnings	to	operating	cash	flow.	Our	dividend	
for	the	year	was	fully	covered,	with	the	 
pay‑out	ratio	of	94.5	per	cent	within	our	
target of 90 to 95 per cent. Progress against 
our	medium‑term	financial	targets	has	been	
positive	with	key	metrics	largely	on	target	or	
moving in the right direction.
Growing our business sustainably
On the Corporate & Social Responsibility 
front, the Group has been proactive in 
ensuring	compliance	with	forthcoming	Energy	
Performance	Certificate	(“EPC”)	regulations.	
Over	500	EPCs	have	been	reviewed	or	
renewed	eliminating	compliance	risk	in	
advance of the 2018 deadline. On Green 
initiatives,	we	have	improved	our	GRESB	
rating	for	the	second	year	running,	and	we	
have conducted tenant surveys at our UK 
Shopping centres to help us develop better 
experiences for occupiers and customers 
alike. For certain centres this has resulted in 
the implementation of electric vehicle charging 
bays, provided free of charge to customers. 
2016 marked ten years since the Group’s 
listing	and	to	celebrate	we	have	been	paying	
it	back	with	community	projects	called	‘Ten	
4 Ten’. Each centre has invested ten days 
during	the	year	towards	initiatives	designed	to	
support	the	communities	in	which	we	operate.
Outlook 
The income return from direct real estate 
in the UK has contributed approximately 
75 per cent	of	total	direct	real	estate	returns	
over the long‑term, and our income focused 
portfolio	is	well	placed	to	capitalise	on	this	
trend	in	the	future.	With	growing	global	
appetite for predictable income returns, 
we believe	our	income‑led	strategy	to	deliver	
market leading shareholder distributions 
remains extremely attractive. 
The expectation of rising interest rates in 
the UK in the near term appears increasingly 
likely. Despite this, interest rates remain 
exceptionally	low	by	historic	standards	and	
the outlook for longer‑term rates remains 
benign, suggesting that the search for yield 
is likely	to	endure	as	a	key	investment	theme.	
Our	income	focused	and	diversified	portfolio	
provides limited exposure to any single sector 
or	occupier	with	the	opportunity	to	allocate	
capital	to	assets	and	sectors	where	we	identify	
the best opportunities. We are increasingly 
looking to invest in locations and sectors 
with	long‑term	structural	support	driven	by	
occupier demand, infrastructure investment 
and strong demographics. 
Significant	progress	has	been	made	in	
strengthening	our	balance	sheet	and	we	will	
continue	to	target	a	lower	leverage	structure	
over	time.	Notwithstanding	this	objective,	
the Group’s average debt maturity is already 
in	excess	of	seven	years	and	with	material	
covenant headroom and interest cover 
over three times, this has resulted in limited 
refinancing	risk	and	strong	cash	flow	cover.	
All our medium‑term targets remain in place. 
Our	growth	target	of	3.0	to	5.0	per	cent	per	
annum in underlying earnings per share 
reflects	the	confidence	we	have	that	our	
business	will	continue	to	deliver	superior,	
sustainable	and	growing	income.	Earnings	
growth	is	driven	with	focus	on	all	aspects	
of our income statement. The continuous 
improvement in the quality of our portfolio 
is	supporting	rental	growth	expectations.	
We are seeing strong occupier demand for 
our logistics, hotels and retail park assets 
(47 per	cent	of	the	UK	portfolio)	supported	
by 38.9 per cent of the overall portfolio being 
subject	to	inflation‑linked	and	fixed	rental	
increases.	In	addition,	we	have	a	number	
of income‑led asset management initiatives 
planned	and	underway	to	support	our	growth	
targets. Weighted average cost of debt has 
reduced	to	3.1	per	cent	which,	combined	
with	improvements	in	our	EPRA	cost	ratio	is	
providing positive operating leverage.
We remain committed to becoming the UK’s 
leading income focused REIT and to delivering 
upper quartile income returns relative to other 
UK‑REITs.
