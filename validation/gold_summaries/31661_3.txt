 10 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
— CHAIRMAN’ S S T A TEMENT
I am very pleased to be able to report continued 
advancement across the course of the financial 
year and beyond. The Group has made significant 
additional strides since September with the sale 
of almost half of our remaining commercial and 
leisure assets and the redeployment of some of the 
proceeds into the important purchase of Priors Hall 
in Northamptonshire. The project is one that our 
management team has been tracking for several 
years and which we worked hard to buy.
Urban&Civic was established for the very purpose 
of challenging the standard approaches to large‑scale 
housing delivery. We are determined that strategic 
sites can make an increased contribution in our 
chosen markets within 100 miles of London and 
the largest provincial cities. Our Master Developer 
model places a premium on quality and accelerated 
delivery and has gained real traction with our 
housebuilder customers. The model involves faster 
planning through taking project responsibility, 
then working with expansionist housebuilders 
to shorten the period between consent being 
granted and first construction. The licence structure 
encourages build‑ out by those housebuilders, whilst 
contracted minimum annual payments underpin 
the Group’s future cash flows. The arrangements 
are capital‑ light to our customers and, at the same 
time, provide Urban&Civic with a good future 
security of income.
Priors Hall is part constructed and slots at the 
front of a chronology of what are now six strategic 
projects. The purchase will enable us to preserve 
balance by taking on some new major propositions 
that are not yet adopted in Local Plans.
The much publicised Oxford to Cambridge rail line 
is being designed to encourage incremental 
housing as well as to re‑ establish transport links 
across the middle of the country. Those clear 
objectives play to the strengths of our management 
in combining placemaking with transport.
Shareholders should not take the recent realisations 
as a sign that we are giving up on commercial 
development. Instead the intention is that 
anything of scale will be forward funded in future. 
The stamp duty increase to five per cent announced 
in the March 2016 Budget has gone a large way to 
negating any yield advantage on the sale of investment 
properties. Certainly that is the case in the area in 
which we are most competitive, large town/small 
city retail and leisure schemes, promoted by the 
relevant local authority, which is often also the 
existing landowner.
Institutional pre‑ funding is also consistent with 
the Board’s stated policy of a high level of financial 
prudence. Gearing is moving up a little as strategic 
spend increases but substantively all of the Group’s 
project facilities are from the Homes and Communities 
Agency, whose interests are aligned closely with 
ours. The stature of our partnerships with Aviva, 
Dioceses of the Church of England, the Ministry of 
Defence (via Defence Infrastructure Organisation) 
and Trusts from Nuffield College and Oxford 
University are testimony to our financial approach 
and our insistence on doing things the right way.
Jon Di‑ Stefano, the chief executive of Telford Homes Plc, 
has joined the Board as a Non‑ Executive Director. 
He brings knowledge and understanding both of 
quality housebuilding and adapting a business to 
incorporate high levels of institutional partnership 
funding. We are delighted to have him as we are sad 
to see Bob Dyson stand down at the forthcoming AGM 
in February. Bob was on the Board of Terrace Hill 
originally and has played a key role in transitioning 
through to the current positioning for future growth. 
He leaves with our grateful thanks. A circulation 
of our Non‑ Executive Directors will continue, in 
accordance with good practice in the UK Code 
of Corporate Governance.
Conditions are not getting any easier and uncertainties 
abound. Equally, the barriers to large‑ scale housing 
projects are considerable and we have moved far in 
a comparatively short time. Employment levels in 
our selected areas of high population growth are at 
record highs. There is much now in the corporate 
tank but still more that can be achieved. 
We continue to work to that end.
