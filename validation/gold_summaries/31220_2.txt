At a glance
Altyn’s main asset is its 100% interest in the
Sekisovskoye gold mine in North East Kazakhstan
with probable reserves of 2.26Moz.
The Company is continuing to develop the
underground mine at Sekisovskoye, and its
exploration asset at Karasuyskoye. The Company
spent US$1.4m in relation to exploration costs at
Karasuyskoye in the current year. 
The mining licence for Sekisovskoye is valid until
18 July 2020 with an automatic pre-emptive
contractual right to extend after this period.
The Company was awarded the subsoil
exploration contract for the Karasuyskoye ore
field for a 6-year term in 2016 with the right to
extend for another 4 years if there is a
commercial discovery of resources. The site
encompasses an area of approximately 198km
2
,
and geological data purchased by the Company
indicates that there are several mineralised zones,
each with the potential to contain significant
gold resources.
Throughout 2014, the Company worked on a
Competent Persons Report (CPR) in relation to
the Sekisovskoye mine site and the results of the
findings were announced in November 2014. The
significant highlights are summarised in the
mineral resources statement on page 12. It is the
intention of the Company to update the CPR in
the near future to also incorporate the site at
Karasuyskoye.
The Company’s principal shareholders, the
Assaubayev family (through their investment
vehicle African Resources Limited), have provided
strong financial support and commitment to the
current development of the Company. The
family’s shareholding currently stands at 69.8%.
Our focus
During the current year the underground mine and infrastructure
have been prepared to ramp up production once the necessary
equipment is in place. In the current year the focus was on the
development of access and preparation of the ore bodies.
The key highlights are documented below:
Underground development & exploration
▲ The transport decline was taken from the developmental level
of 225masl down to 150masl.
▲ Access portal, for the second transport decline was completed
during H2 2017.
▲ The processing plant was overhauled involving a number of
replacement parts/equipment, to ensure efficient working at
higher volume levels.
▲ Capital investment of US$2.6m (2016: US$5.6m) which included
a new load-haul-dumper (LHD), and drilling machine at
Sekisovskoye.
▲ Exploration work continued on the prospective Karasuyskoye
site with extensive drilling in a number of areas on the site in
order to better define the ore bodies and grade content.
Financial highlights
▲ Turnover increased in the year to US$21.6m (2016: US$15.9m).
▲ 16,747oz of gold sold (2016: 12,602oz), an increase of 4,145oz.
▲ Average gold price achieved (including silver as a by-product),
US$1,293oz, (2016: US$1,259oz).
▲ Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation and excluding impairment) of US$3.7m (2016:
US$260,000).
▲ EBRD loan was repaid in the year, in the current year capital and
interest amounting to US$3.5m was repaid.
▲ In February 2018 the Company converted US$9.7m of the
US$10m bond issued to African Resources into 233,333,333 new
ordinary shares. It is the intention to convert the remaining
shares and interest into ordinary shares in Q3 2018.
Operational highlights
▲ Gold poured 16,717oz, (2016: 10,970oz) a 52.4% increase
year-on-year, the production was constrained by the closure of
the processing plant for maintenance and availability of the
necessary equipment.
▲ Operating cash cost US$774/oz, (2016: US$846/oz).
▲ Gold recovery rate 83.54% (2016: 80.20%) improvements in
processing production techniques.

The Sekisovskoye deposit is the Company’s flagship
asset and is located close to the village of
Sekisovka, approximately 40km from the North East
Kazakhstan regional capital, Ust Kamenogorsk.
The mineral rights at Sekisovskoye are held by a
100% owned subsidiary of the Company, DTOO
GRP Baurgold , and the processing plant is owned
by the 100% owned subsidiary of the Company
TOO GMK Altyn MM.
The Sekisovskoye deposit was discovered in 1833
with surface mining taking place during the
periods 1833 to 1847, 1932 to 1935, and 1943 to
1946. From 1975 to 1986, a range of exploration
work was carried out. Between 1978 and 1982
“AltaiZoloto” of the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Industry,
KazSSR, mined the oxidised area of the ore body. In
2003, under Hambledon Mining’s ownership
(subsequently renamed to Altyn Plc), further
exploration work was undertaken and gold
production from the mine and processing plant
commenced in 2008.
In 2014, the Company released the findings of the
mining consultant, Venmyn Deloitte’s Competent
Persons Report on the mine, which demonstrated
JORC reserves of 2.26Moz, JORC resources of
5.14Moz and a development plan to increase annual
gold production to 100,000oz. This is to be achieved
by accessing higher grade reserves through the
continued development of the underground mine
and by increasing the processing plant’s throughput
capacity from the current 850,000t per year to
1 million tonnes per year.
The extraction of the gold reserves is now
undertaken solely from the underground mine. The
Company is in the process of enhancing the
production from the underground mine gradually
increasing production with the aim to achieve upto
1,000,000t in the future.

Karasuyskoye Ore Fields
In May 2016, the Company was awarded the
subsoil exploration contract to conduct further
testing at the site Karasuyskoye ore field for the 6
year term with the right to extend for another
4 years in case of commercial discovery of
resources.
The geological data that the Company acquired
indicates that there are several mineralised zones at
Karasuyskoye and this leads the Company to
believe that this project has the potential to contain
significant gold resources. The Company is
validating the geological data by twinning previous
drill holes and undertaking additional metallurgical
test work. The initial results are very encouraging
and this work will facilitate the preparation of an
independent Competent Persons Report (CPR) to
international standards, it is to be completed in the
near term.
On completion of the (CPR), the Company
envisages progressing towards mining from the
Karasuyskoye Ore Fields, initially using cash
generated from existing operations, external
funding will be considered as the project
progresses and the cost of development is
considered.
