 of The Yield Book, FTSE Russell is the most diverse 
index business globally in product terms and is  
well positioned to seek to benefit from the strong 
underlying industry trends, including the demand  
for broader multi-asset capabilities. As a result, FTSE 
Russell has further enhanced its position as a leading 
global index provider with approximately US$15 
trillion of assets benchmarked to its indexes.
Indexes are firmly embedded across the investment 
process and FTSE Russell has the ability to provide 
customers with a comprehensive product range and 
a deeper data and analytics offering. Institutional 
clients remain the core client base for FTSE Russell. 
The decisions made by these clients around index 
selection, investment products and strategies have  
a great influence on the entire investment sector, 
creating a demand for products and services to 
execute the strategies, for example ETFs and 
structured products, tracking the indexes they use. 
Currently, over US$600 billion of ETF assets under 
management track FTSE Russell indexes. FTSE 
Russell is also well positioned in emerging markets 
with a strong track record of developing country-
focused benchmarks. A number of indexes and 
partnerships were launched over the year including 
in Malaysia, China, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. 
The combination of client relationships and product 
capabilities also drives innovation, often in 
partnership with our customers, in areas such as 
environmental, social and governance (ESG). For 
example, FTSE Russell announced that the world’s 
largest pension fund, The Government Pension 
Executing our Strategy
London Stock Exchange Group delivered another 
strong performance in 201 7 . We continue to 
successfully execute our strategy to grow and 
diversify the Group, operating on an Open Access 
basis in partnership with our customers. We have 
seen growth across all of our core business pillars – 
Intellectual Property, Risk and Balance sheet 
management and Capital Formation – and have 
continued to invest in new initiatives and acquisitions 
to drive further expansion and efficiencies. The Group 
is strategically, operationally and financially well 
positioned to capitalise on a range of opportunities 
ahead and to enhance shareholder returns. 
Confidence in our outlook led us to set financial 
targets at an Investor Update event in June, which  
will deliver growth in Group EBITDA margin to c.55% 
by 2019. 
As a leading financial markets infrastructure group, 
we have continued to grow our global footprint, 
including strengthening our presence in Asia and  
in the United States. We have also made selective 
acquisitions that develop our client offering, while 
meeting our strict strategic and financial criteria. 
This included increasing our majority shareholding  
in LCH, the acquisition of Mergent and the acquisition 
of The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices, 
which provides opportunities to significantly enhance 
FTSE Russell’s fixed income analytics and index 
business. These acquisitions also help to expand  
LSEG’s presence in the United States, and our global 
distribution capabilities. 
MiFID II Opportunities
The implementation of MiFID II, which took place  
on 3 January 2018, was a key focus for a number  
of our businesses and the transition to the new 
regulatory regime has in overall terms been very 
smooth for LSEG. I would like to thank everyone 
involved in the programme, which was a truly 
collaborative effort across the Group and provides  
us with further opportunities to differentiate 
ourselves with our customers. 
Importantly, MiFID II embeds and recognises Open 
Access as a key principle in financial markets, and is 
one we have been operating under for a number of 
years. The new rules will introduce greater competition 
in financial markets, promoting transparency and 
innovation while helping to reduce costs and leading 
to better risk management. Our Open Access 
philosophy positions us well as we have a proven 
track record of operating businesses in partnership 
with our customers. As we stated in our Investor 
Update in June, a number of these businesses,  
such as LCH, CurveGlobal, Turquoise and MTS, are 
already beginning to benefit from the new MiFID II 
environment and we expect that they will be able  
to further grow their customer offerings.
Intellectual Property
In our Information Services Business, FTSE Russell 
continued to perform strongly delivering double-digit 
revenue growth, up by more than 30%. This is  
a consolidating sector where FTSE Russell has 
successfully differentiated itself through its global 
reach and breadth of offering. With the acquisition  
“ We continue to 
successfully execute  
our strategy to grow  
and diversify the  
Group, operating on  
an Open Access basis  
in partnership with  
our customers”

Chief Executive’s statement Investment Fund of Japan (GPIF), selected the new 
FTSE Blossom Japan Index as a core ESG benchmark. 
The index uses FTSE Russell’s innovative ESG Ratings 
data model and highlights a growing trend among 
asset owners to integrate ESG considerations into 
their investment strategies.
Also within Information Services, UnaVista, the Group’s 
platform for all matching, validation and reconciliation 
needs, continues to help c.6,000 clients from around 
the world to meet their regulatory reporting including 
additional requirements under MiFID II. 
Risk and Balance Sheet Management
In our Post T rade business, LCH Group achieved 
another strong performance with record volumes 
across multiple clearing services in 201 7 , driven by  
new business as well as additional flow from existing 
customers. SwapClear cleared over US$870 trillion of 
notional driven by significant on-boarding of new 
clients across Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific. 
The SwapClear service now has more than 1 00 
members and over 200 dealers clearing in 55 countries 
and remains the leading OTC rates liquidity pool in the 
world. Compression volumes also continued to rise, 
with over US$600 trillion compressed, up 59% on 201 6, 
a further example of how the cycle of trading, clearing 
and compressing is becoming increasingly routine. 
The OTC clearing services delivered good, double-digit 
revenue growth in the year.
LCH is well-placed to address capital and margin 
challenges prevailing in the vast FX market, which 
trades around US$5 trillion a day. The introduction  
of new bilateral margin rules has been a catalyst for 
members to start centrally clearing with over US$1 1 
trillion in notional cleared through ForexClear in 201 7 , 
compared to US$3.2 trillion in the previous year. The 
search for greater efficiencies is also driving growth 
in LCH’s repo and CDS clearing services, which both 
continued to expand their product offerings. LCH 
SwapAgent, a new service for the non-cleared 
derivatives market, processed its first trades and  
also extended the efficiencies and infrastructure  
of clearing to the non-cleared Cross-Currency Basis 
Swap market.
The Group’s post trade services in Italy also recorded 
a good performance with Monte Titoli delivering the 
benefits of T2S to its members.
Capital Formation
LSEG’s range of debt and equity markets provides 
firms across the globe with access to deep and liquid 
pools of capital. Our markets in London and Italy 
helped companies raise over £44 billion in new and 
further issues welcoming companies such as Pirelli, 
Allied Irish Bank and Eddie Stobart. London Stock 
Exchange was the largest European exchange with 
108 IPOs in 201 7 and second globally by money 
raised. The ongoing success of London’s AIM market, 
which saw a near 45% increase in new capital raised, 
is also being replicated on AIM Italia with 24 new 
admissions in 201 7 .
Our commitment to support growth SME companies 
was also demonstrated through ELITE, which has 
continued to expand globally, with partnerships 
secured in West Africa, Brazil, China and Saudi  
Arabia in 201 7 . We also confirmed the launch of  
the first ELITE Basket Bond, which is made up of  
10 innovative Italian ELITE companies. Over 700 
companies from across 27 countries are now part  
of the ELITE community and we expect this number 
to continue to grow over the coming year. 
In May, we launched our new International Securities 
Market (ISM) in London, an additional market for the 
issuance of primary debt targeted at institutional  
and professional investors, with a healthy pipeline  
of issuers. London Stock Exchange also continues  
to be at forefront of innovative green finance with  
the number of green bonds issued double that of  
the prior year. 
CurveGlobal, the new interest rate derivatives 
platform, has built a firm foundation since launch 
reflecting a growing appetite for more capital-
efficient and open alternatives to existing derivatives 
trading services. CurveGlobal is proving itself to be a 
highly efficient differentiator in the exchange traded 
derivatives space, offering genuine choice and 
liquidity to the market. Productive partnerships with 
inter-dealer brokers and technology providers are 
also helping to increase flow to the platform. 
Significantly, in the context of Best Execution rules 
under MiFID II, CurveGlobal products listed on LSE 
Derivatives Market (LSEDM) continue to be best price 
or tied the majority of the time.
Our pan-European trading platform, Turquoise, is 
working with customers as they adjust their trading 
strategies in response to MiFID II. Turquoise Plato 
Block Discovery, for example, set new records in  
201 7 with total value traded in the year up 600%  
to €54.5 billion.
LSEG Technology
The main focus of Technology is to underpin and 
support the development of in-house solutions for our 
capital markets, clearing and information businesses. 
Our technology, combined with our deep expertise in 
financial markets infrastructure, enables us to deliver 
market-leading services that put us at the forefront  
of new product ideas and innovation. In 201 7 , we 
announced that we would better position our 
technology offering by bringing several products and 
businesses together under a new LSEG Technology 
brand. As part of the re-organisation, we divested  
2 small technology assets as we focus on the key 
development opportunities ahead.
We have continued to work on the application  
of a range of emerging technologies, including 
distributed ledger technology, cloud-enabled 
computing, machine learning and big data. LSEG 
takes an “active investment” approach, where we  
seek to combine the best of our domain expertise  
in financial markets infrastructure and technology 
with the best of the partner companies we choose  
to work with. For example, we are collaborating with 
IBM to create a distributed shared registry containing 
a record of all shareholder transactions and helping  
to open up new opportunities for trading and investing 
for European SMEs.
Summary
LSEG operates in a dynamic global industry and  
there will continue to be both new challenges and 
opportunities ahead. LSEG continues to perform 
strongly in an evolving macroeconomic, regulatory 
and political environment, including Brexit. With the 
UK set to leave the EU in March next year, LSEG has a 
responsibility to ensure the orderly functioning of our 
markets and to contribute to the financial stability of 
the global economy as a whole. LSEG currently serves 
clients in a number of geographies across the United 
Kingdom, Europe, United States and Asia and, as such, 
we have plans and options for continuing to provide a 
seamless service. Our partnership approach with our 
customers continues to enable us to understand their 
needs against a changing regulatory and market 
backdrop and to develop our products and services  
to help our clients with the challenges they face. 
In summary, our strategic ambition remains the 
same – to deliver best in class capabilities, drive 
global growth and develop our customer partnership 
approach. Our highly capable and experienced 
management team remains focused on the 
opportunities ahead, to deliver the financial targets 
we have set for the next 2 years, while at the same 
time continuing to invest and expand. The Group is 
well positioned for further successful development 
and growth.
