 04 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
A strong finish  
from a difficult start
The Group ended on a high in a year of two halves. I am pleased to report  
a strong performance in the second half of our financial year, confirming  
the effectiveness of our strategic approach and the success of the diversified  
business model we have developed in our established produce operations. 
RESULTS
As we anticipated in the interim report, the 
second half saw a much improved trading 
result as we began to recover higher raw 
material costs in our core Greenvale potato 
business, enjoyed a strong season for Jersey 
Royals and started to realise the benefits of 
our new ERP system. This has delivered a 
Group operating profit before exceptional 
items for the year of £8.4m (2016: £9.2m),  
in line with our expectations, and a profit 
before tax of £6.6m (2016: £3.5m) despite 
the increased loss before tax of £1.0m  
(2016: loss £0.2m) reported in the first half.
DIVIDEND
The Board recommends an increased final 
dividend of 5.026 pence per share (2016: 
4.88 pence). Together with the interim 
dividend of 2.44 pence per share (2016:  
2.44 pence) paid in April, this makes a total 
dividend for the year of 7.466 pence (2016: 
7.32 pence), a rise of 2.0%. Subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), the final dividend 
will be paid on 5 December 2017 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 3 November 2017.
BOARD CHANGES
I will be retiring at the AGM on 29 November 
2017, as will Non-Executive Director (NED) 
Sean Christie. Having served two full 
three-year terms, Senior independent  
NED Sir David Naish will also be retiring by 
rotation. Barrie Clapham will resume the 
position of Chairman on an interim basis  
as the Group commences a recruitment 
process to find a more permanent 
successor. Liz Kynoch will continue in her 
role as NED, as will Robert Johnston, the 
principal representative of the Jerry Zucker 
Revocable Trust, the largest shareholder  
in the Group, who joined the Board as NED 
on 9 June 2017. The Board will continue  
to work in a sustainable way to deliver 
incremental shareholder value over the 
longer term.
STRATEGY 
Following the restatement of the  
Company Strategy at the interims in  
March, the Board has decided to revert  
to the original strategy of growing the 
business through strategic acquisitions of 
quality businesses that offer synergies and 
product or customer diversification. At the 
same time we will continue to explore  
and fund the organic growth opportunities 
of the subsidiary companies. 
PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board, I would like  
to express sincere thanks to all our 
employees for their hard work in delivering 
these results, and for their continuing 
commitment to ensuring we provide  
our customers with products and service  
of the highest quality. Maintaining and 
improving these high standards is key  
to our future success. 
OUTLOOK
Looking to the year ahead, harvest is now 
progressing, although with the majority  
of the potato crop still in the ground, 
favourable weather is required during 
October to see the harvest safely secured. 
Assuming harvest proceeds as it should,  
an increase in the planted area will see a 
gross crop yield that will exceed demand 
and therefore deflate raw material prices.  
A solid start to the year sees trading in line 
with forecast and the new business gains, 
and new contractual arrangements with 
established customers give us much 
enhanced visibility on both volume and 
margins in our core retail potato business. 
We are achieving improved efficiencies in 
our two fresh potato processing sites,  
and anticipate further significant efficiency 
benefits from the implementation of our  Directors’ Report

REASONS TO INVEST IN PRODUCE INVESTMENTS
Produce Investments is a diverse business with a solid core at its foundation 
and continues to seek acquisition opportunities offering good returns and 
exciting growth prospects. The core business supplies fresh products 
364 days of the year, into a defensive category with high levels of 
customer penetration.
1. Improved margins
The Group continues to seek 
opportunities to add businesses that 
deliver higher margins and enhance 
profitability and shareholder returns.
2. Acquisition 
opportunities
The recent acquisitions demonstrate the 
Groups appetite and ability to complete 
and deliver on acquisitions. Management 
will continue to seek out and explore 
opportunities to further expand  
the Group through the addition of 
appropriate complimentary businesses.
3. New customers
The Group’s strategy is to continue to 
grow its sales with other key customers. 
The acquisition of both Rowe Farming 
and The Jersey Royal Company gives 
access to potential new customers.
4. Products diversification 
Our strategy is to seek opportunities that 
provide growth outside the fresh potato 
sector. This could come from processed 
products or other fresh vegetables 
where our key strengths in commercial 
and supply chain management can  
add value and deliver synergies.
new ERP system. All this allows us to feel 
confident in the Group’s ability to achieve 
good progress during the current year.
As a business predominantly growing and 
selling produce in the UK, our principal 
concern about Britain’s withdrawal from 
the EU is ensuring the continued availability 
of high quality seasonal labour. While  
we have encountered no difficulties in 
recruitment to date, and return rates of 
seasonal staff remain high, clear direction 
from the Government is required to ensure 
a Brexit agreement that maintains access 
to this essential resource. 
The Group continues to generate cash  
and we are well placed to continue our 
well-established and proven strategy  
of widening both our product range  
and customer base within our existing 
produce operations, and to exploit other 
opportunities for profitable acquisitions  
as these arise.
