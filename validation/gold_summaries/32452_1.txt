STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive’s statement
I am pleased to report the results for the year ended 31 March 
2017 for Collagen Solutions and the considerable progress we 
have made towards realising value from multiple growth initiatives.
Building on momentum and strengthened financials
Firstly, and perhaps most significantly, we strengthened our 
financial position substantially at the end of the financial year by 
securing £10.8 million financing inclusive of £6.8 million in equity 
and a venture debt facility of up to £4.0 million via Norgine 
Ventures. This positions us to continue to grow our core business, 
invest in our proprietary devices, and satisfy our contingent 
payment obligations related to the successful acquisition of 
Southern Lights Biomaterials.
Investments in our commercial organisation last year have begun 
to deliver results. While the sales cycles in our core business can 
be from 12–18 months, we have seen the early benefits with nine 
new agreements during the year under review, mostly towards the 
end of the period. Critically, we hired our new VP Global Sales and 
Marketing, Brad Selman, to continue this momentum and develop 
and lead the commercial team to deliver accelerated growth over 
the next few years.
Another key executive team position filled was the new General 
Manager of Collagen Solutions New Zealand (formerly Southern 
Lights Biomaterials), Kevin Darling. Kevin’s strong commercial and 
operational background has been key to continuing the momentum 
of the New Zealand business, especially as we see greater growth 
opportunities in our tissue business.
Finally, we prioritised and initiated three projects related to our 
proprietary products platform, as well as strengthening our R&D 
leadership by appointing Chris Wattengel, VP Global Research and 
Development. Chris’ experience in medical device development, 
regulatory approvals, intellectual property and biomaterials will 
be vital to ensuring the success of these programmes. 
Revenue growth
Revenue and other income during the year ended 31 March 2017 
was £4.09 million, including £3.95 million in sales and £0.14 million 
in other income, and represented 26% growth on the prior year. 
This growth was organic and driven largely by gains in Europe and 
Asia, where the first investments in commercial activities were made.
Revenue from North America grew by £0.12 million to £1.92 million, 
an increase of 6%. This region was the last to benefit from new 
sales team hires and new business was offset partially by some 
sales volume reductions amongst a few customers. Revenue from 
Asia grew by £0.42 million to £1.60 million, an increase of 36%, our 
fastest-growing region, driven by new business wins and a 
dedicated commercial manager in place in Seoul. Revenue from 
EMEA grew by £0.28 million to £0.42 million, an increase of 190%, 
driven by new customers and as a result of commercial activities 
by the team in the UK. 
OUR COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS 
OF LAST YEAR DELIVERED NINE 
NEW AGREEMENTS AND POSITIVE 
MOMENTUM, AND OUR RECENT 
FUNDRAISING STRENGTHENED

Funding
+£10.8m During the year the team delivered nine new supply, development 
and distribution agreements, including distribution partnerships 
in Korea and Japan. Most of these agreements closed in the 
second half of the year. In addition, the Company has seen its 
pericardium tissue business grow by 30% resulting in a specific 
initiative to diversify and increase its tissue supply base in 
Australia and New Zealand to meet the additional demand. 
Innovation and product development
The Company has historically been committed to extensive 
research and development investments and has made continued 
progress in biomaterials innovation, both for our core supply, 
development, and manufacturing business and also our 
proprietary products programmes. 
With Australia-New Zealand tissue sourcing becoming a more 
significant part of our core business, we were pleased to have 
been granted a patent from the Australian Patent Office for the 
use of our novel ultra-thin processed pericardium material, which 
can be used for heart valve replacement medical devices and 
other applications. Patent coverage has already been established 
in New Zealand and the US. 
Related to our bone graft substitute programme, we have added 
substantial expertise in this field with our new Scientific Advisory 
Board as well as Chris Wattengel’s background. With this group’s 
guidance, we’ve completed surgeon and industry voice of 
customer feedback, identified the regulatory and pre-clinical 
pathways and established a revised plan to meet these needs, 
resulting in a mid-2019 estimate for regulatory clearance. We also 
filed a provisional US patent application covering novel properties 
of a bone graft substitute formulation. The provisional patent 
covers several novel, proprietary characteristics related to the 
product’s superior handling properties and inorganic particle 
retention, which will enhance ease of use for the surgeon 
and ensure that the substitute remains at the operative site. 
Our wound healing project is based upon core technology we 
developed over several years, with promising results presented at 
multiple conferences, including the recent Society for Biomaterials 
Annual Meeting in Minneapolis. The Company’s scientists presented 
new data related to the potential for a fibrillar collagen-based 
matrix that protects autologous cells during delivery and promotes 
cellular adhesion to a wound site. The potential of the research 
may address the limitations of current split or full-thickness 
autologous skin grafts, particularly in large wound sites. We have 
completed surgeon and industry voice of customer feedback, 
identified the regulatory and pre-clinical pathways and targeted 
our pre-clinical trials to begin in early 2018 with wound market 
clearance expected to follow in late 2018.
Additionally, the Company’s cartilage ChondroMimetic
®
 programme 
has advanced significantly since the acquisition of the assets of 
Orthomimetics at the end of 2015. With first human use in 2009 and 
original launch in 2010, ChondroMimetic
®
 offers a rare opportunity to 
come to market with over seven years of in-patient results. We recently 
initiated the extension of the original clinical study to review the results 
of the first patients from a safety study conducted in 2009, and have 
begun manufacturing validations of the product at our Glasgow UK 
facility. The long-term extension study will collect seven to eight years 
of data from up to 15 of the original 17 patients. Our CE mark submission 
is pending this study conclusion and completing internal validations, 
with a target commercialisation outside the US in mid-2018.
Finally, we recognise the need for close co-ordination between 
our global commercial and R&D teams as well as the expertise 
needed for successful development and regulatory approvals of 
our proprietary medical devices. We recently announced our plans 
to relocate our US R&D from San Jose to Minneapolis, where we 
will realise some operational cost savings by merging the two sites, 
and also enhance our global R&D and commercial co-ordination 
with leadership and both teams at the same Minneapolis site.
Strategic initiatives
Last year was the first implementation of our global strategic 
planning process resulting in several initiatives we felt critical 
to our future growth. I am pleased with the results the team 
delivered on these initiatives and look forward to accomplishing 
similar success on our initiatives for FY 2018.
Our 2017 initiatives generally focused on three areas: sales 
channel development, marketing brand launch and operational 
excellence. Our sales channel development initiative resulted in 
the recruitment, hiring and training of a full specialised direct sales 
team and support including our new VP of Global Sales and 
Marketing as well as sales process improvements that led to nine 
new customer agreements in the fiscal year. 
Our marketing brand launch initiative resulted in the execution 
of a full integrated marketing communications programme leading 
to an increase in several customer touch-point metrics in terms 
of commercial leads, web traffic and social media engagement. 
Finally, we successfully completed several initiatives to improve 
operational excellence including a new OEM programme that 
improved time-to-close deal flow and throughput, contributing 
to nine new agreements during the year.
Looking forward to FY 2018 we are continuing our strategic initiative 
programme and selected four ‘Vital Few’ initiatives aligned with our 
strategic pillars of Customers, Our People, Products and Capabilities, 
and Growth which are summarised as follows:
• 
Customers: identify and attain more high-value customers.
• 
Our People: implement an employee-driven individual 
development plan programme.
• 
Products and Capabilities: secure and create a stronger 
pericardium business.
• 
Growth: successfully develop and partner our three key 
proprietary products.
Conclusion
The critically important financing of the Company that closed at 
the end of the last financial year has put us in a strong position to 
execute on our growth initiatives, including fueling our proprietary 
products development, and was a significant focus of the Company. 
We delivered growth based on commercial investments made 
in the prior year and also recruited necessary talent in R&D, 
commercial and general management to execute on these growth 
initiatives, and continue towards our shared vision to be the 
industry’s first choice for regenerative biomaterials.

Chief Executive’s statement continued
What are the top achievements from last year?
While the team was very busy and accomplished several important 
goals last year, two stand out as critical achievements. First, our 
successful fundraising at the very end of the fiscal years was necessary 
in order to meet our operating and other obligations, as well as 
to ensure the multiple growth initiatives we’re excited about can 
come to fruition. Second, we are pleased to see the commercial 
investments made last year beginning to demonstrate results 
including delivering nine new agreements mostly in the back half 
of the year.
How is your strategy developing?
We remain enthusiastic about the strategy we set forth last year, 
strengthening our supply, development and manufacturing ‘core’ 
business with commercial investments and leveraging that platform 
to create a portfolio of proprietary products. As we continue to 
receive feedback from the marketplace we believe this strategy 
is sound and our focus on orthopaedics and wounds in particular 
for our proprietary products is the right direction.
How are you strengthening your team?
I am pleased with the talent we’ve added to the executive team this 
year. First, Kevin Darling became our General Manager of New Zealand 
in October, succeeding Geoff Bennett who remains on our Board and 
continues to actively support our business as a Board member and 
leader of our China initiative. Kevin’s combination of commercial 
and operational experience has made a tremendous contribution 
to ensure the continued momentum of the New Zealand business. 
Brad Selman joined us as VP Global Sales and Marketing in 
February and has already worked to enhance our sales team and 
processes substantially. Finally, Chris Wattengel brings a critical 
skill set in finished devices with his 16+ years of directly relevant 
biomaterials and OEM experience. 
These new members are great additions to the executive team, which 
also includes our COO, Tom Hyland, with over 30 years of collagen and 
medical technologies experience and our CFO, Gill Black, who has 
been instrumental in strengthening our financial position as well as 
deeply involved in operationally supporting the growth of our business. 
In addition, each of these leaders has also enhanced their own teams 
with new talent. So, overall, I can say we’ve substantially strengthened 
the team over the past several months. 
We have assembled a highly experienced and dynamic Scientific 
Advisory Board (SAB) with a combination of significant industry 
backgrounds and complementary technical and scientific 
knowledge within the field of regenerative medicine. In addition 
to providing advice on and direction to our current development 
projects and core business, the SAB will help us to assess future 
market directions and to guide our activities towards the 
development of both commercially and clinically relevant next 
generation products. The SAB consists of Andrew Lynn, PhD, who 
is a successful entrepreneur and founder of Orthomimetics Ltd., 
which developed ChondroMimetic
®
; Professor William (Bill) Walsh, 
PhD, who has over 27 years of academic and industry-related 
research experience in orthopaedics and other surgical fields; 
Tom Buckland, PhD, who was a co-founder of ApaTech Ltd., research 
and development director with Baxter Inc., and managing director 
of NuVasive (UK) Ltd; and Stewart White, PhD, the founding CEO 
of Collagen Solutions and Collbio with international operations, 
business and product development experience.
What does the R&D pipeline look like?
The R&D side of our strategy has evolved the most in selecting our 
key three projects (cartilage, wound healing and bone grafts) and 
doing the in-depth work to refine the customer requirements and 
novel product attributes. While we have several new product concepts 
that were taken to various stages of development in multiple areas of 
tissue engineering, we are going to focus on these three projects to 
ensure they are developed to deliver a compelling value proposition 
to our customers supported by the appropriate data.
What is critical for the Company this year?
We have multiple growth initiatives, each with significant upside 
potential, so it’s critical we focus on realising value from these. Our 
‘Vital Few’ initiatives are so-named because we think these are the 
critical initiatives for the Company for success and this is where we will 
focus. On the commercial side, it’s about continuous improvement 
of our sales pipeline and processes to identify and attain more 
high-value customers. Our people development is critical to 
everything we do, and we believe the employee development plans 
will improve our employee engagement and effectiveness. We see 
upside potential in our tissue business, which led to our initiative 
with respect to tissue supply and growth. Finally, we are focused 
on advancing our proprietary products and securing 
partners for successful commercialisation.
