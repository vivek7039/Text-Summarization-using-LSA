 Our customers
Throughout 2005 as previously, a key
aim has been, and will continue to be to
make Hanson a truly customer focused
company. We believe we should treat our
customers in the same way we would
expect to be treated ourselves – with
courtesy and respect. 
2005 performance summary
I am very pleased with the performance
we have delivered in 2005. We have
achieved double digit earnings growth,
completed a significant number of
valuable acquisitions and increased 
our returns to shareholders. 
Operating highlights
Group turnover
†
increased by 9.8% to
£3,71 5.7m (£3,383.0m), of which 4.2%
was due to the acquisitions we made in
2005. Excluding acquisitions, most of the
5.6% increase was due to increases in
selling prices. Price increases have been
necessary to recover those higher input
costs that could not be absorbed through
cost initiatives. Cost control is an integral
part of our operational culture and 
we continue to strive to be the lowest
cost producer.
In total, group operating margin
†
increased by 0.3ppts, despite the
significant increase in costs, and the
operating profit before impairments
†
increased by 1 5.4% to £488.8m.
Excluding acquisitions and property
income, operating profit before
impairments
†
from the existing business
grew by 1 3.6%. The majority of our 
six divisions contributed to this growth
with a 38.8% increase from the UK
Aggregates division, 25.1 % from
Australia & Asia Pacific, 20.2% from US
Aggregates and 8.7% from US Building
Products. These are excellent results
and more than offset the difficult markets
for our UK Building Products and
Continental Europe divisions in 2005.
Investing highlights
£1 91 .8m of capital expenditure was
invested in capital projects to maintain
and to enhance our existing operations.
In line with our ongoing capital
expenditure policy, we aim to remain
disciplined and biased towards projects
which will have superior risk/return ratios.
In the USA, construction has begun 
on replacement pipe and precast
manufacturing plants in T exas, Arizona
and Florida and the construction of 
a new greenfield roof tile plant near
Jacksonville in Florida. In addition, 
we completed the quarry replant at
Bridgeport, Dallas and secured further
mineral reserves in California. In the 
UK, capital expenditure includes kiln
refurbishment, plant automation and
information technology projects. Plant
upgrades were completed in Australia
and additional mineral reserves have
been secured in Spain.
Acquisitions and disposals
Our strategy to enhance shareholder
value includes the acquisition of
companies which extend our existing
operations or geographies. In addition,
our aggregates acquisition strategy helps
maintain our long-term mineral reserves
and resources position, which totalled
1 5.9bn tonnes at the end of 2005. 
Eleven transactions were completed 
in 2005 for a cash cost of £342.9m
(£88.4m) and included the acquisition
of Mission Valley Rock, which secured
over 54m tonnes of reserves in the San
Francisco Bay area. The acquisition of
Sherman Pipe expanded our presence
in the southeast region of the USA. 
In the UK, the acquisitions of Thermalite
and Marshalls Clay Products have
extended our building product ranges.
Disposal proceeds received in 2005
totalled £50.3m in the year and included
the sale of Hanson’s 50% interest 
in Campbell Concrete and Materials 
in T exas and 1 9 ready-mixed concrete
plants in Spain. 
Safety
We continued to improve the safety 
of our employees. For the first time 
since the group safety records were
maintained there were no employee
work related fatalities in 2005. Our
focus in 2006 is to reduce the number
of accidents and unsafe acts. 
Operating outlook
Demand in the US is expected to 
remain strong but may decline in the 
UK and Australia. The increase in 
energy costs incurred in the latter 
part of 2005 will impact our annual cost
base in 2006, despite our cost reduction
initiatives. We will work closely with our
customers to deliver premium products
and services whilst remaining disciplined
on selling prices.
