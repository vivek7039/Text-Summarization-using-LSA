 upheaval which met with some employee opposition 
and undoubtedly had an impact on morale and 
performance. The business should now be in a  
much stronger and positive position with the  
project fully implemented.
Mecca suffered from declines in visits, but managed  
to outperform its main competitors and continued  
to maintain good cost control. More importantly,  
we have trialled a number of bingo variants – for 
example, Big Bingo Bash, Bonkers Bingo – which are 
showing promise, and, with the recently launched 
Luda, there is plenty to drive growth.
Our digital business had a strong year with profits  
up significantly. With 15% revenue

 growth we are 
outstripping UK market growth for digital gaming, 
with Grosvenor continuing its stellar trajectory and 
Mecca showing good progress in the lower growth 
digital bingo sector. We changed our digital operating 
structure, making way for a multi-brand approach, 
and made a number of new hires into key positions, 
such that we feel that we now have a very strong 
team. We also continued to develop our Sheffield 
Customer Solutions Hub, which has gone from strength 
to strength and gives us real competitive capability.

Q&A
How would you characterise  
this year’s performance?
Overall, we are satisfied with where we ended up for 
the year, with some obvious caveats and considerations. 
We suffered a dip in retail visits and performance last 
summer and struggled to recover, leading to a weaker 
first half of the year than we would have expected. 
But an improvement in performance in the second 
half of the year together with some cost reductions  
led to a much stronger second half, contributing 
£46.9m of operating profit
1
 compared to £36.6m  
in the first half.
Grosvenor applied a much more stringent application 
of customer diligence with respect to evidencing source 
of funds, which, together with lower gaming margins 
on our VIP activity, led to lower than anticipated 
revenues. Grosvenor also implemented what it termed 
‘Project One’, changing and harmonising pay and 
benefits across the casino estate. This was a considerable

Strategic report
18 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 In Spain, where the economy continues to recover, 
our Enracha business had a very positive year with 
revenues and profits
1
 up 23% and 72% respectively. 
Although just nine bingo clubs, with a digital service 
fully launching in 2017/18 and with possibilities on 
the retail side, we are excited about Enracha’s 
continuing growth potential.
We also continued to look at how we could best run 
the centre of our organisation, closing our central 
London office and moving to a larger and more 
modern Maidenhead headquarters. The resulting 
workspace has led to a much more unified 
organisation and a positive environment.
Where do the Company’s priorities lie 
in the next 12 months?
Beyond achieving performance targets and all our 
brands showing solid growth, we are focused on  
five specific areas which will help drive growth and 
long-term value. In the course of 2017/18, we will 
launch a single account and wallet product across  
our Grosvenor channels. It will see the delivery of  
a complex solution combining different systems  
and technologies from a range of partners and 
suppliers. The result will be a joined-up retail and 
digital business with customers being able to move 
seamlessly between the two, which should drive 
activity and volumes in both. We will also be 
launching a number of new digital brands this year, 
which should also help digital growth. Although 
Mecca and Grosvenor are strong, established brands, 
they appeal to a certain customer segment and having 
additional brands will give us an improved ability to 
‘cross-sell’ customers into new brands and reactivate 
dormant customers.
Grosvenor’s nine London casinos generate 
approximately half of its profit. Whilst successful 
clubs in their own rights, they have historically been 
run fairly independently and have not utilised their 
combined benefit to full effect. Implementing a clear 
Grosvenor London strategy is therefore a priority for 
the year. We have just opened our first new Luda site, 
bringing bingo-led entertainment to the high street, 
in August 2017. Opening further Ludas and making 
the concept a success will also be an area of focus for 
the year. Finally, with rising operating costs, including 
increases in the National Living Wage and higher 
inflation, we are focused on keeping central and 
above-club costs disciplined whilst improving our 
support capability.
What is your view on the regulatory 
outlook for the gambling industry?
The whole gambling sector is waiting for the 
Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) to 
publish the recommendations of their review of stakes 
and prizes on gaming machines, social responsibility 
measures and gambling advertising: what has been 
termed the ‘Triennial Review’. The DCMS has delayed 
publication a couple of times, latterly because of the 
general election, and the Review is now expected in 
October or November of this year. There is media 
speculation that stakes on B2 machines or ‘fixed odds 
betting terminals’ in betting shops will be reduced, 
but curbs being placed on TV advertising are also a 
possibility. Neither of these issues would have a big 
impact on our business: we do not have B2 machines 
in any of our premises and we are not a significant 
TV advertiser.
As part of the consultation process, we, together  
with the rest of the casino industry, argued for a 
harmonisation of 1968 Act and 2005 Act casino 
licences, which would mean that 1968 licences  
(the vast majority of our licences) would be entitled  
to a higher number of slot machines based on a 
higher gaming machine-to-table ratio. Only 3% of  
the UK’s slot machines are currently located in casinos 
and we estimate that harmonisation of licences would 
only move this to 4%. We believe a harmonisation of 
licences would open the way for increased investment 
and further non-gaming amenity to be contained 
within casinos, more akin to the US or continental 
casino model.
From August 2017, remote gaming duty at 15% will 
be due on any bonuses or freebets given to digital 
customers. Based on last year’s numbers this would 
have translated to £3.3m additional gaming tax.  
There is always scope for the government to increase 
gambling taxes but, given this recent move, we would 
be surprised if there were any further changes imminent 
on the digital side.
Land-based bingo is taxed at 10% (reduced from 20% 
in 2014), casino table games are subject to a 15-50% 
tax scale based on volumes, and most slot machines 
are subject to 20% machine gaming duty. Changes to 
tax are impossible to predict but we do not anticipate 
that these rates will change in the short term.
“Beyond achieving performance 
targets and all our brands 
showing solid growth, we are 
focused on five specific areas 
which will help drive growth  
and long-term value.”

Operating  
review 32
www.rank.com | 19 Beyond regulation, we believe that the gambling 
industry has suffered a deterioration in trust in the 
eyes of customers, politicians and the media in the 
last few years. This has been reflected in the increased 
negative media coverage of the gambling sector. 
Whilst much of this criticism is justified and we 
support continued scrutiny of our industry, we believe 
that much is being done in and around the industry 
to promote responsible gambling and to minimise 
gambling-related harm that often gets overlooked.  
As this develops we believe the industry will regain 
some of that lost trust and be viewed in a more 
positive light.
Land-based retail businesses 
throughout the UK are struggling. 
What is your perspective on your  
own retail growth?
In general retail terms, there has been an undoubted 
shift from much of the high street to the digital world 
with some high-profile casualties along the way. 
However, where that shift has been most marked  
is where customer interaction is predominantly 
transactional: where the convenience and choice 
offered by a digital transaction trump anything  
on offer on the high street. But when there is an 
experiential element to a good or service, the digital 
world often provides a less compelling proxy. In our 
bingo venues and casinos, we offer both transactions 
and experiences and have the added advantage that 
when it comes to gaming, many customers still want 
to play with or draw their winnings in cash. So, we 
have no doubt that both casinos and bingo venues 
will prosper long into the future but, to maximise 
their ongoing potential, they will need to focus more 
on the experiential side of things and continue to 
adapt and change their offer. We feel we are well 
positioned on both fronts.
Will Brexit have an impact on  
your business?
With the exception of our Enracha business (4% and 
7% of Group revenues and profits respectively), the 
majority of our revenues and costs are in pounds 
sterling and we have no direct benefit from a single 
European market. A significant number of our 
employees are non-British EU nationals, so their 
continued right to residency in the UK is important  
to us – something to which the UK government has 
now committed. Our digital operations are based out 
of, but not licensed in, Gibraltar (we hold both UK and 
Alderney digital licences), meaning that any change to 
Gibraltar’s access to the EU market would not impact 
us. Were the border between Gibraltar and Spain to 
close we would need to enact contingency measures, 
similar to other gaming companies, as many of  
our employees currently live in Spain rather than 
Gibraltar. However, we see no imminent threat of  
this happening and have appropriate plans in place.
How has the introduction of company-
wide values evolved in the last year?
We launched our STARS values in July 2016, 
representing Service, Teamwork, Ambition, 
Responsibility and Solutions. This is the first time  
that Rank has had a single set of values across its 
businesses and reflects the fact that our businesses  
are increasingly bound together by the same set of 
opportunities and challenges.
Since their launch we have tried to embed our values 
into our business processes and daily working lives. 
An example of this has been threading our values 
through the lifecycle of an employee: assessing 
potential candidates based on evidence of displaying 
our values; adapting our employee appraisal process, 
such that our people are assessed on their adherence 
to our values as well as their individual objectives;  
and incorporating a values assessment as part of exit 
interviews. But beyond this example, there are many 
different areas, both in our venues and at the centre, 
where our values now play an important part in 
our company.
We believe our values are key both to business success 
and to shaping an organisation that has the right 
culture and ethos for dealing with many of the 
complexities of gambling, including the sometimes 
negative impact it can have on customers. As such,  
we will continue to evolve how our values are used 
and embodied in our business and to try to track  
and measure our progress.
