Q&A
What is your vision for Diurnal?
In the long term, we aspire to be the company that physicians 
first think of when treating patients with a broad range of endocrine 
disorders. In the near term, we aim to become the pre-eminent 
company in the treatment of diseases of cortisol deficiency.
What are your lead pipeline programmes and 
what unmet medical needs are they addressing?
Our two lead programmes, Chronocort
®
 and Infacort
®
, both address 
diseases of deficiency in cortisol, a key hormone involved in 
maintaining health for life.
Chronocort
®
 is initially being developed for congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (CAH), an inherited condition where patients are unable 
to produce cortisol, leading to a poor quality of life and lower life 
expectancy. Current treatments are unable to provide the correct 
amount of cortisol during the night, leading to a build-up of potent 
sex hormones, called androgens, which cause damage to the body . 
Chronocort
®
 is deigned to mimic the body’s natural – or diurnal 
– rhythm and hence control the level of these androgens. 
Infacort
®
 is being developed to treat children who lack cortisol 
– a condition known as adrenal insufficiency (AI). Despite the 
active ingredient of Infacort
®
 having been available for around 
60 years, there is surprisingly no approved paediatric product. 
Infacort
®
 is designed to provide an accurate and appropriate 
dose of this life-saving medicine in a child-friendly formulation.
How big are the markets that these 
programmes are addressing?
We estimate that there are over 60,000 patients suffering from 
CAH across the US and Europe, which we believe translates to 
a total potential market of over $400m. The paediatric AI market, 
which we will address with Infacort
®
, is around 4,000 patients in 
Europe and a similar number in the US, giving a potential market 
opportunity of around $60m. Whilst this is a relatively small market, 
Infacort
®
 is important as it will mark Diurnal’s first commercial launch.
Beyond the initial launch of Chronocort
®
 in CAH we have plans 
to develop the product for the much larger adult AI market, where 
there are potentially over 400,000 patients in the US and Europe.
When do expect your first drug  
to be approved and in which territory? 
Our most advanced product is Infacort
®
, where we anticipate 
recommendation for approval in Europe in late 2017 . This will 
represent a major milestone for the Group – few UK companies have 
successfully taken a product from concept to full commercialisation.
How will you commercialise  
the drugs in your portfolio?
A key benefit of working in diseases of cortisol deficiency is that 
there are a relatively small number of prescribing centres, usually 
based around teaching hospitals. This means that the market can 
be addressed with a modest sales force. During the last year, we 
have been working closely with Ashfield Healthcare to build the 
foundations of our commercial organisation in Europe, and now 
have individuals based in the five largest European markets: UK, 
Germany, France, Spain and Italy. This team will market Infacort
®
 
and, in due course, Chronocort
®
 to endocrinology specialists. 
In the US, where market access for a new product launch requires 
a deep expertise, we will most likely seek to partner with a company 
focused on hospital products, ideally with existing products in 
the endocrine space.
What key newsflow can we expect from  
the Group in the 2017/18 financial year? 
We envisage a very busy 12 months ahead, with a number of 
key events that will position the Group well to achieve its vision. 
Firstly, we anticipate approval of Infacort
®
 in Europe, leading to 
the first commercial sales during 2018. For our late stage pipeline, 
we anticipate completing recruitment in our Chronocort
®
 European 
Phase 3 study and announcing headline results. Importantly , we 
expect to start Phase 3 registration studies in the US for both 
Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
. We also expect to be able to announce 
progress in expanding Chronocort
®
 into new indications, which 
will drive future growth for this product. Notably, we anticipate 
further strengthening of our patents, which will provide valuable 
in-market protection for our lead- products. Finally, we continue 
to develop our early-stage pipeline, which is addressing further 
unmet needs in the endocrine space, and hope to announce 
further progress during the coming 12 months.
