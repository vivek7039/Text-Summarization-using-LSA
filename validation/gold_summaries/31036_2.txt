Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
At a glance
Spire Healthcare provides diagnostics, in-patient, daycase 
and out-patient care throughout the UK. We also own 
and operate the sports medicine, physiotherapy and 
rehabilitation brand, Perform.
 
What we provide
Providing high-quality patient care is 
our top priority. To improve our patient 
offering, we invest consistently in a 
wide range of services and treatments 
at each stage of the care pathway: from 
initial GP referral, through consultation, 
diagnosis and treatment, to recovery 
and rehabilitation.
A growing market
Growing and ageing population 
Driven by a growing and ageing 
population – with a higher incidence 
of long-term and chronic conditions, 
such as cancer, obesity and diabetes.
NHS funding gap
Funding and capacity constraints are 
forecast to continue throughout this 
Parliament and beyond. The independent 
sector can help to bridge the gap.
