 Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
16 We expected 2017 to be the toughest 
year to date for Lamprell. It was. 
Unfortunately, in addition to the revenue 
pressures anticipated by the broader 
industry, we encountered major 
operational challenges on the East 
Anglia One project which resulted in 
a significant loss for the Group and 
negatively impacted our financial 
statements accordingly . The Group’s 
operational and financial performance in 
2017 fell well short of our expectations 
even though we made good progress 
in delivering our strategic goals.
Clear strategy
It is critical to preserve the long-term 
perspective amid immediate challenges, 
and 2017 has been a year of change and 
strategic repositioning for Lamprell. Our 
immediate priority was the operational 
demands of our ongoing projects. In 
a global energy environment marked 
by complexity and uncertainty, the 
Board focused on developing a clear 
strategy with solid deliverables to 
ensure Lamprell’s future. Despite initial 
indications of a recovery in the oil & gas 
industry, we do not expect the new build 
jackup rig sector to recover in the near to 
mid-term as capital expenditure amongst 
oil producers remains restrained and new 
project awards continue to slip 04. 
We therefore are determined to access 
alternative markets, in particular in the 
renewables sector , and broaden our 
service offering by participating in larger 
and higher value EPC(I) contracts through 
partnership options.   
Another pillar of our strategic vision is 
gaining access to resilient markets and 
in particular Saudi Arabia. In spite of 
being one of the most influential regional 
players in the Middle East with a 40+ year 
track record in fabrication, Lamprell has 
not previously done business with Saudi 
Aramco, one of the most significant global 
oil majors. This finally changed in 2017 
and we are delighted to have entered 
into a joint venture agreement with the 
company along with Bahri and Hyundai 
Heavy Industries to build a new maritime 
facility in eastern Saudi Arabia, which 
will become one of the largest yards in 
the world 12. For a company of our 
size, this is a critical point of entry into a 
dynamic market committed to ongoing 
growth and a major stepping stone 
towards our strategic goals. 
Our investment will enable Lamprell to 
build on its core expertise in jackup 
rigs and will also provide consistent 
contributions to our revenue streams.  
Our commitment to invest in this project 
has also offered an inroad into one of 
the most sought-after and selective 
processes in the industry as Lamprell  
has pre-qualified for a shortlist of 
companies being considered for a 
long-term agreement to deliver EPC(I) 
projects to Saudi Aramco. Our confidence 
in the prospects of this partnership was 
almost unanimously supported by our 
shareholders when they voted for the final 
investment decision in June last year .  
We were pleased to receive full backing 
of our banking syndicate for this venture 
as well.
Ability to deliver
We experienced significant challenges  
on the East Anglia One project 26.  
This was a very disappointing outcome  
for our shareholders which resulted  
in a total USD 98.1 million loss for the 
Group. We have undertaken a root cause 
analysis to determine the factors causing 
the significant, additional costs on the 
project which started with insufficient 
rigour during the bidding phase, 
compounded by inexperienced project 
leadership in this new market. With these 
learnings, we have already implemented 
many performance improvement 
initiatives to return to productivity levels 
close to historic norms and to prevent 
recurrence, 26. The lessons learned 
and experiences from this project, 
although painful, have confirmed our 
commitment and our ability to deliver to 
the industry in general. The fundamentals 
of the renewables market are solid and, 
backed by European policy 05, it is 
anticipated to become a major pillar of 
global energy supply over the coming 
years. Therefore, we now view this as an 
investment in securing Lamprell’s position 
in this emerging industry . 
The prudent approach we have taken 
towards cost management in the past  
two years has allowed us to preserve  
the strength of our balance sheet
 20, which in turn enables us to focus 
on delivery of strategic growth amid 
market and operational challenges. 
We are being selective in our new 
business pursuits, targeting only realistic 
opportunities that fit with our core 
competencies and our diversification 
Lamprell’s operational and financial performance was disappointing  
in 2017. Lamprell is now entering a critical phase where it must  
learn from 2017 and deliver the strategic objectives on the path  
to long-term growth.
A YEAR OF 
CHANGE
TO THE 
BUSINESS  Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
17 goals while generating robust margins. 
This approach has refocused our bid 
pipeline 04, and we have upskilled 
our workforce and invested in additional 
resources to broaden our in-house 
expertise and match our capabilities with 
the strategic goals set for the business. 
Addressing new markets is rarely 
straightforward and often comes at a cost. 
In its 40+ year growth history, the Group 
has faced setbacks, most notably as we 
diversified from rig refurbishment into 
new build jackup fabrication in the late 
1990s. Our efforts and investment proved 
worthwhile then and I am confident they 
will do so again. 
The lessons we learnt in 2017 are not 
only applicable to the renewables sector; 
they have led us to review our overall 
approach to accessing new opportunities. 
The Board is now closely involved in 
senior leadership planning to ensure 
our in-house expertise matches our 
strategic objectives and we are capable 
of delivering not only on quality but also 
on cost. 
Board changes
In September 2017 I replaced John 
Kennedy as Lamprell’s Chairman. John’s 
leadership has taken the Group onto a 
new strategic path as the industry entered 
a significant downturn. I thank John for 
his efforts over the last five years and very 
much look forward to taking the vision 
to the next level. In 2017 we welcomed 
Nick Garrett and James Dewar as new 
Non-Executive Directors; their collective 
experience in delivering strategic 
transformations within major industry 
players will be highly valuable. Following 
these appointments, the Board has made 
a number of changes to the composition 
of its Committees which are detailed on 
page 42 of this report. 
Final dividend
Given the significant challenges the 
Group encountered in 2017 and the 
uncertainty in the industry, the Board does 
not recommend a final dividend for the 
year . We are grateful for the confidence 
and support of our shareholders and our 
lending banks as we work through the 
near-term issues facing the Group and 
look to deliver long-term growth. 
Looking to the future
We experienced significant challenges 
throughout 2017 and these have had 
a profound effect on the way that we 
approach and implement our vision. We 
streamlined the business over the past two 
years and we have adapted and added 
to our resources to support the strategic 
objectives. We are now entering into a 
phase of delivering on our goals. The 
Board is confident that transformational 
growth and diversification is the right 
strategy for Lamprell for future success.
