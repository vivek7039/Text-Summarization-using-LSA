Corporate governance 
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and comply  
with the QCA Corporate Governance Code to the extent appropriate for a company 
 of its size.
The QCA Corporate Governance Code has been devised by 
the Quoted Companies Alliance and sets out for smaller quoted 
companies and, in particular, AIM companies how they can apply 
the principles of good governance in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code to their own circumstances. 
An alternative code was proposed because the QCA considers 
the UK Corporate Governance Code to be inappropriate to many 
AIM companies, having been written principally for larger listed 
companies. The QCA Code states that: “The objective of good 
corporate governance is to deliver growth in long-term shareholder 
value by maintaining a flexible, efficient and effective management 
framework within an entrepreneurial environment.”
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Currently the Board consists of five Directors (including the 
Chairman). The performance of the Directors is evaluated on an 
ongoing basis. The Board meets at least ten times a year and has  
full and timely access to all relevant information to enable it to  
carry out its duties. 
The Board regularly reviews and oversees the Group’s progress 
towards its goals. The Board monitors the implementation of its 
strategy whilst delegating the day-to-day operations to Executive 
Directors and management. 
Processes are in place to ensure the Board has the access it requires 
to advisors and the Company Secretary to keep up to date with 
corporate governance matters and that applicable rules and 
regulations are followed.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. 
The Board considers that all the members of each committee 
have the appropriate experience required of them without having 
conflicts of interest.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises Dean Fielding (Chairman) and 
Harry Hill. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and 
is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the 
Company is properly reported on and monitored, including reviews 
of the annual and interim accounts, results announcements, internal 
control systems and procedures and accounting policies. 
The Audit Committee also has responsibility for recommending 
the appointment of the external auditor. In carrying out this 
responsibility the Audit Committee reviews the cost-effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the current proposed auditors. 
During the period, the Audit Committee reappointed Mazars LLP 
as the auditors for the Group. Mazars LLP have provided non-
audit services to the Group during the period for the review of 
compliance with financing covenants.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Dean Fielding  
and its other members are Kevin Hollinrake and Harry Hill.  
The Remuneration Committee meet at least annually.  
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining, 
within agreed terms of reference, the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of senior executives and specific remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors. It is also responsible for 
making recommendations as to the adoption of share options 
schemes and long-term incentive plans for senior executives and for 
grants under such schemes or plans to individual senior executives. 
Details of the Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in the notes to 
the accounts.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for ensuring there is an adequate system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is 
designed to mitigate risk to an acceptable level rather than eliminate 
internal control risks completely. These internal controls include 
controls over financial, operational and compliance risk factors. 
The Board is satisfied that the current level of internal control meets 
the needs of the Group and reduces its exposure to risk to an 
appropriate level.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Clear financial reporting procedures have been established which 
ensure the Board have access to reliable and timely financial 
reports on a weekly and monthly basis. Financial reporting includes 
monitoring performance against budget and prior year results as 
well as cashflow forecasts.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Employees 
The Group believes in equal opportunities and people’s 
development. The Group appoints based entirely on merit 
regardless of gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, 
religion, nationality, ethnicity or disability. Where employees 
become disabled, the Group looks where possible to adjust  
the environment to accommodate the same. 
Communication 
The Group sees communication as key with its customers and that 
philosophy extends from the way we deal with both employees and 
our franchise network. We hold regular meetings and conferences, 
provide regular updates through our intranet underpinning 
developments and encourage the sharing of information and help. 
Anti-bribery policy 
The Group operates a zero tolerance towards bribery.
Legislative compliance
The Group conforms with all relevant legislation and codes

long-term very seriously.
