Well Partnering WHAT SETS US APART
POSITIONED FOR GROWTH
Chariot represents an 
opportunity to invest in the 
underexplored but highly 
prospective regions of the 
Atlantic margins that sit 
outside of the traditional, 
more densely explored 
parts of the fairway. 
Through implementing 
Chariot’ s de-risking strategy 
and applying the expertise 
of its in-house team it has 
identified giant scale, high 
margin drill ready prospects 
offering transformational 
material upside in the 
success case and downside 
protection through 
partnering and technical 
de-risking.
