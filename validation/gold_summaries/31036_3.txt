Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Chairman’s statement
In a year of considerable change and challenge, 
I am proud to report that Spire Healthcare’s 
8,380 staff, and the leading consultants we  
work with, provided over 775,000 private  
and NHS patients with outstanding clinical 
care and outcomes. Exceptional patient care 
is our business.”
Performance
The Company’s performance over the year 
showed further growth in our key private 
patient income and reasonable progress 
on our three new major capital investment 
projects that became operational during 
the year. Group revenue was £931.7 million, 
£5.3 million ahead of 2016. On an underlying 
basis, the Group delivered consistent gross 
margins of over 48%. Operating profit, 
however, fell significantly to £42.9 million. 
This was the result of both our new 
hospital openings; of exceptional and 
other material items totalling £49.2 million 
in the year arising from the patient 
compensation costs in respect to Ian 
Paterson’s historical practises; the write 
down of our Specialist Cancer Care Centre 
in Essex; and the decision to cease work on 
the development of a central London site. 
Additional information on exceptional 
and other items is shown on pages 124 
and 125. Our cash flow, however, remained 
robust and our total dividend has been 
maintained at 3.8p. 
Revenue grew by 0.6% despite in-patient 
and daycase admissions decreasing 
by 1.8% to 269,300 patients (2016: 
274,100 patients).

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
Revenues from Private Medical Insurance 
(‘PMI’) sources declined slightly in 2017, 
while underlying revenues (see further 
information on page 35) in our Self-pay 
payor group grew strongly, increasing 
by 12.0%. Underlying revenues from 
the NHS also declined by 0.5% due to 
patient choice and eligibility for treatment 
beginning to be actively restricted by 
Clinical Commissioning Group (‘CCG’) 
policies in response to NHS cost pressures 
in the second half of 2017. 
Dividend
The Company continues to be strongly 
cash-generative, which will enable the 
payment, subject to shareholder approval, 
of a final dividend of 2.5 pence per 
ordinary share for the year. Together 
with the interim dividend of 1.3 pence 
per ordinary share, this amounts to a total 
annual dividend of 3.8 pence per ordinary 
share, continuing our stated dividend 
policy which aims to pay at least 20% 
of profit after taxation each year. 
Care quality
The quality of our patient care is of 
paramount importance. It is at the  
heart of what we do.
Three of our hospitals are rated 
‘Outstanding’ by the Care Quality 
Commission (‘CQC’), 20 hospitals and 
two clinics as ‘Good’, and 11 as requiring 
improvement in certain areas. Overall, our 
quality of care is rated at the forefront of 
the independent sector. More detail on 
our clinical performance, quality of care, 
and the unstinting efforts we are making 
to improve further, can be found in our 
Clinical review on pages 20 to 25.
Following the completion of the 
criminal proceedings against Ian 
Paterson (a consultant who previously 
had practising privileges at two Spire 
Healthcare hospitals), we were able to 
agree to settle all current and known 
claims against Spire Healthcare. A charge 
amounting to £28.7 million for the cost 
of such settlement is included in the 
results for the year, in addition to other 
costs associated with the matter. 
We deeply regret the circumstances  
but are pleased that the unfortunate 
victims of Mr Paterson’s activities have 
now received compensation. Your Board 
is determined that the lessons learnt 
from this affair will be applied throughout 
Spire Healthcare. 
Developments during the year
In the first half of 2017, we completed and 
opened two new hospitals in Manchester 
and Nottingham – we continue to develop 
their full potential. In the second half 
of the year, after major investment in 
expanded theatre capacity and additional 
staff at our 2014 acquisition, Spire 
St Anthony’s Hospital started to deliver 
improved performance.
Acquisition approach
During the year we received an approach 
from Mediclinic, our principal shareholder, 
with an offer to purchase the outstanding 
shares in the Company. The Board 
concluded that the offer did not value the 
Company sufficiently and we were unable 
to reach agreement. Mediclinic continues 
to have a seat on the Board and remains 
a valued international collaborator.
Board developments
In October, we were delighted to secure 
the services of Justin Ash as Chief 
Executive Officer (‘CEO’). Justin has 
a wealth of relevant experience. He was 
previously chief executive of Oasis Dental 
Care where he built the UK’s first national 
consumer driven dental brand. Prior to 
that he was Managing Director of Lloyds 
Pharmacy, where he grew the estate from 
1,250 to 1,750 outlets and led a refocus 
of the business towards health services.
In May, Peter Bamford joined the Board 
as the Company’s Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director. Peter 
is chairman of both Superdry Plc and B&M 
European Value Retail SA. He previously 
held a number of senior executive roles at 
Vodafone Group plc and has served on the 
boards of public companies for the last 
21 years. He brings considerable leadership 
experience and maintains a strong 
independent presence on our Board.
At the end of July, we regretfully announced 
that Andrew White, an Executive Director 
and our former Chief Operating Officer, 
had passed away following a period of 
illness. Andrew joined the Company in 
2015, he was a trusted colleague and 
made a significant contribution during 
his time with us. He is greatly missed.
Following Andrew’s death, Simon Gordon 
assumed the role of interim Chief Executive 
Officer in addition to his role as Chief 
Financial Officer. Our thanks go to  
him for his additional contribution  
over this difficult period. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 March 
2018, Simon Gordon, our Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’), resigned from the Board 
and will leave the Group at the end of 
March 2018. Simon has been CFO since 
2012 and, whilst I was undergoing 
treatment for an illness last year, also 
assumed the role of interim CEO. 
Personally, and on behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank him for his services 
to the Group in both roles and to wish 
him every success in the future. 
Strategy
Our new CEO has brought further clarity 
and purpose to our established strategy. 
In his Review on pages 10 to 14, Justin 
gives further details on the Company’s 
renewed and absolute focus on improving 
our offering to patients and enhancing 
clinical outcomes. Before we embark on 
further major expansion we will continue 
to develop and embed the highest levels 
of clinical performance in every one of 
our hospitals across the country.
Our people
Delivering our strategy depends on our 
people, it is they who deliver outstanding 
care, personally, every day to our patients. 
Thanks go to all our staff, every one of 
who is a highly valued member of the 
Spire Healthcare family. It is by working 
together closely and making a positive 
contribution to the business that they 
drive our strong culture. 
Outlook
2017 was a year of considerable change 
and challenge but with some notable 
achievements. During 2018 we will 
concentrate on developing our people, 
on refining our systems and building the 
returns on our recent investments in new 
hospitals and additional capacity. In doing 
so, we will be able to deliver outstanding 
treatment and care to more people and 
continue to build Spire Healthcare’s 
nationwide reputation for quality and 
excellent outcomes.
