aspiration, and one that we can use to inspire our

Our purpose and ambition
Serco delivers services to governments and other institutions 
who serve the public or protect vital national interests.

new and more effective ways to deliver them. We 
deliver innovative solutions to some of the most 
complex challenges facing governments, bringing our 
experience, capability and scale to deliver the service 
standards, cost efficiencies and policy outcomes 
governments want. In this way we make a positive 
difference to the lives of millions of people around

on our deliverables
The method we use to deliver our aspiration – to be the best-managed business in our sector – and to deliver our  
strategy is to concentrate on doing four things really well. These are the things we want Serco to be famous for:
Being profitable  
and sustainable
Winning good 
business
Executing 
brilliantly
Being a place 
people are  
proud to work
We try to make sure that everything we do improves our performance against one or more of these objectives, 
and start from a position where we know we can do much better. We can improve the way we bid and manage 
contracts; develop innovative propositions; measure performance; reduce the cost and improve the quality of our 
administrative systems and processes. None of these comes easily or quickly, and we need to steer a tricky course 
between the urgent need to reduce our costs in line with reduced revenues in the short term and investing in 
systems and processes that will produce sustainable benefits in the long term.
