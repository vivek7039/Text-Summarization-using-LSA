Chairman’s statement
This is my first statement since my 
appointment as Chairman of Tyman in 
May of last year in succession to Jamie Pike. 
Tyman has again demonstrated its resilience 
in producing a solid set of results for 2017 
and a further year of profitable growth, 
assisted by increased contributions from 
the Bilco and Giesse businesses purchased 
in 2016 and by further margin expansion 
in the enlarged SchlegelGiesse business. 
These results were achieved despite the 
Group encountering some challenges during 
the year. Operational issues in Juarez, Mexico 
took longer to resolve than expected, there 
was some short term market share loss in 
AmesburyTruth and subdued market conditions 
continued in the United Kingdom. 
In 2017, alongside its regular agenda items, 
the Board has spent considerable time on 
four key topics: how the Board operates, 
succession planning, Group strategy and 
health and safety.
How the Board operates
The Board conducted an externally facilitated 
evaluation during the year, with a focus on 
how the Board and its associated Committees 
operate, the results of which are summarised 
in the Corporate governance section on 
pages 56 to 60. This exercise has proved useful 
in that it confirmed the open and collegiate 
culture of the Group Board while providing 
specific direction for improvement of the 
Board’s processes in the future.
A solid set of results with good cash generation 
demonstrating the Group’s resilience.
Please join us on 10 May 2018 in 
Wolverhampton to see first hand 
how one of Tyman’s Divisions is 
delivering our commitment to 
operational excellence.”

Board priorities
2017 has seen the Board focus on four 
key areas:
• How the Board operates 
• Succession planning
• Group strategy
• Health and safety

As in previous years the Board continued with 
its established practice of spending time with 
Divisional management and employees away 
from the Group head office. In 2017, Board 
meetings were held in the US and Italy with 
site visits made to the Group’s two facilities 
in Juarez, Mexico. 
The Board also attended the Group 
Management Conference held in Bologna, 
Italy, in October. 
Succession planning
Succession planning is a key Board responsibility 
and the Nominations Committee has spent 
considerable time during the year considering 
succession plans for both the Board and for 
the Divisional Management Teams. Further 
details on succession planning are contained 
in the Nominations Committee report 
on pages 67 to 68. 
A number of changes to the Board composition 
and roles took place during the year. As 
announced at the time of the interim results, 
from August 2017 James Brotherton took on 
responsibility for Group strategy, corporate 
development and M&A in addition to his 
existing duties as Chief Financial Officer. 
Helen Clatworthy joined the Board as an 
Independent Non-executive Director in 
January 2017 and took over from me as 
Chair of the Audit Committee in May. 
Since the year end Tyman has announced 
the appointment of Pamela Bingham as an 
Independent Non-executive Director and the 
retirement of Angelika Westerwelle. I would 
like to welcome Pamela to the Group Board 
and thank Angelika for her service to Tyman.
Jamie Pike stepped down as Non-executive 
Chairman in May 2017 and I succeeded him 
from that date. Jamie joined Tyman in 
November 2009 following a challenging 
period for the Group and led the Board through 
the subsequent seven and half years in which 
Tyman changed considerably. He made a 
significant contribution to the Group’s 
development in that time and, on behalf of 
all shareholders, I would like to thank Jamie 
for his leadership and to wish him well for 
the future.
Group strategy 
To allow scope for discussion and debate, 
the Board held a strategy away day in 
2017 which included presentations to 
the Board from the three Divisional CEOs 
concerning the strategy for their Divisions’ 
respective markets. 
The Group’s strategy remains to be a 
leading international supplier of engineered 
components to the door and window industry. 
This strategic focus, which was adopted 
in 2010, has allowed Tyman to differentiate 
itself in the various national markets in which 
the Group operates. As the Group has grown, 
the strategy has evolved from a pure play on 
residential markets to include commercial 
applications and now light infrastructure.
Our strategy is implemented through a 
combination of our commitment to operational 
excellence, targeted acquisitions and close 
alignment with our customers. 
Tyman remains the only supplier of scale 
that can offer its customers, wherever they 
are located, a one stop solution for all their 
engineered component requirements. Further 
details on the Group’s strategy are set out 
in the business model on pages 10 to 11.
2017 saw further significant investment 
made in the Group’s operating footprint 
with new facilities constructed in Statesville, 
North Carolina, and Wolverhampton, West 
Midlands. These investments provide the 
Divisions with the modern manufacturing, 
sourcing and distribution facilities necessary 
to achieve operational excellence and 
support our future growth. 
The Group made one small acquisition in 
the year, Howe Green, which has performed 
well since completion and has a good pipeline 
of prospects in the UK light infrastructure 
space. The integrations of Bilco and Giesse 
are now largely complete and it is pleasing 
to note the contributions that both 
businesses are making to the Group.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our employees 
remains a key priority for the Board and it 
is disappointing to have to report that the 
number of lost time incidents increased 
year on year and that severity rates 
increased across all three Divisions.
As part of the Group’s commitment to 
operational excellence, the Board remains 
determined that all employees will be provided 
with a high quality, safe and appropriate 
working environment. 2017 saw further 
investments made in new plant and 
machinery and in appropriate guarding, 
as well as additional third party audits of 
operating environments. 
All three Divisions now have their own dedicated 
Health and Safety Officer whose remit 
includes the rolling review of policies and 
procedures, as well as the investigation of 
incidents as and when they occur. 
The Board continues to place a high priority 
on Tyman achieving real and tangible 
improvement to the Group’s health and 
safety record and in 2018 the Chief Executive’s 
remuneration will in part be determined by 
the Group’s progress in this area.
Dividend 
Underlying Earnings Per Share increased to 
26.91 pence in 2017 assisted by full year 
contributions from Giesse and Bilco and 
exchange translation benefits. In light of the 
Group’s performance during the year, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 7 .75 pence 
per share, making a total of 11.25 pence per 
share for the year, which equates to Dividend 
Cover of 2.40x and is an increase of 7 .1 per cent 
over the previous year. 
Outlook and AGM
As an international manufacturer working 
with customers in many different countries, 
the Group has continued to deliver for its 
stakeholders in 2017. The investments Tyman 
has made in each of its Divisions this year 
positions the Group well for further profitable 
growth in the years to come.
The Group’s AGM this year will be held at the 
ERA Division’s new facility in Wolverhampton 
on Thursday 10 May 2018. I do hope that as 
many shareholders as possible are able to 
join us to see first hand how one of Tyman’s 
Divisions is delivering our commitment to 
operational excellence.
