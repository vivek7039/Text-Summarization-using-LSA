Alan Rommel – Chief Executive Oﬃcer
Introduction 
I am delighted by the continuing improvement in the
Group’s performance, as shown by ﬁve consecutive halves
of improving comparative metrics, all achieved through
self-funded growth. I would like to thank all my colleagues
at Parity for their continued support in delivering this
positive run of results.
We have plenty still to do to build on our strategic
improvement of the business and we would like to thank
our shareholders who have been both patient and
supportive during our journey to this point. Our focus in
2018 is on demonstrating that the consulting arm, working
in tandem with the recruitment division, can deliver
sustained growth and proﬁtability improvements, to the
beneﬁt of our shareholders.
We aim to grow Group revenues, with further focus on the
development of the consultancy business driving margins,
and to manage that growth with continued strong cost
management.
Our lead oﬀering in support of our consulting proposition
is Data Management - the provision of data-driven insight,
with which we have already demonstrated success with
BAT, MoD and in the Education and Utilities sectors. We
believe this is an attractive area to focus on due to strong
market growth rates and the impact of an increase in
demand for relatively scarce IT and digital specialist skills
across the broader market. The beneﬁts of having an
aligned recruitment business in Parity Professionals
specialising in the sourcing of these niche skills has been
demonstrated by the signiﬁcant increase in collaboration
and inter-company trading. 
The Sector 
Parity as a Group is addressing the needs of a large, high
demand and growing market. 
In early 2018, Mavenlink published a report in conjunction
with Research Now, detailing the results of a survey of 576
executives (Director and above) from service-centric
companies in North America, Europe and Asia-Paciﬁc. 65%
of these executives stated that they had had to turn down
work in the last 12 months:
•     82% said they did not have enough resources;
•     18% said they did not have the right skill set; and
•     50% said contractors/freelancers/sub-contractors
were very important to delivery, and a further 31%
said they were critical to delivery.
With regards to the market for Consultancy Services’ data
oﬀering more speciﬁcally, research by Gartner in 2017
forecast that the global Business Intelligence (BI) and
Analytics market would grow from $18bn to $23bn by
2020.
Gartner estimated that the global Master Data
Management (MDM) market was worth between $3-5bn
in 2016. Furthermore, the MDM market is expected to
experience signiﬁcant growth with MarketsandMarkets
forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 23.3% to
2020.
In addition, market reports indicate that there continues
to be a shortage of people with the necessary digital skills
to meet the demands of the market. Clients are
increasingly reliant upon agencies and third party
suppliers to provide access to the necessary skills or
outsource the projects in part or in whole. 
We are very well positioned as a Group to exploit this
opportunity. We have a strong reputation with long-
standing relationships in both divisions, established over
45 years of delivering successful projects. Our clients
beneﬁt through our deliberate strategy of aligning our
services to provide ﬂexible access to a substantial resource
pool. Digitalisation of services is a global trend that is
creating new business possibilities and new business
models for our customers. Our services are part of the
platform that enables this disruption, driving their
businesses forwards, with Gold Partnerships with Oracle
and Microsoft positioning us at the forefront of technology
developments. 
Parity’s Competitive Advantage
Parity has a proactive and well-received integrated model
and this underpins our consultancy business with the very
best expertise available in the market, while maximising
our exposure to opportunities. This enables ﬂexibility,
speed to scale up for new opportunities, and cost eﬀective
delivery.
Parity can apply delivery models to suit its clients’ speciﬁc
needs at every stage of their development lifecycle, for
example it can: 
•     provide full delivery of data projects; 
•     manage project teams to deliver outcomes-based
managed services; and
•     supply contract or permanent IT skills to supplement
internal staﬀ.
This distinctive, integrated approach is a key point of
diﬀerentiation that we plan to exploit further.

Strategic Report Governance Accounts, notes and other information
2017 Performance
Our emerging strategy has already driven growth in the
more proﬁtable Consultancy Services where we also
beneﬁt from greater visibility of future revenues. The
Group has continued to make progress in line with
expectations, simplifying the structure and improving
focus on proﬁtable activities which are symbiotic,
beneﬁting both operating divisions. The management
team is pleased to have achieved strategic progress
including:
•     proﬁt growth, supported by signiﬁcant revenue
growth in Consultancy Services with the beneﬁt of
greater collaboration with the Professionals Division;
•     the exit from non-core, loss making Talent
Management Services; 
•     improved new sales KPIs in Parity Professionals
against a headwind of disruption caused by changes
to the application of taxation to Public Sector oﬀ
payroll workers (IR35) and to lesser extent,
uncertainty surrounding the impact of Brexit in the
UK; and
•     strong ﬁnancial controls, which resulted in strong
cash generation and a signiﬁcant further reduction
in net debt.
2018 Outlook
Our recent strong run of securing new clients, major
frameworks and contract extensions, in combination with
additional investment in key sales and marketing functions
in the ﬁrst half, leaves us well positioned to beneﬁt in
future periods. We have continued to trade in line with
expectations in the ﬁrst two months of the current year
and we remain conﬁdent in the improving pipeline of
opportunities for both divisions, which we expect to
beneﬁt the second half and beyond.

I don’t know how to truly
express our gratitude and
appreciation to the Parity team for
the extremely high quality,
eﬃciency and speed of service;
every time it was beyond
exceptional. Many, many thanks!”
