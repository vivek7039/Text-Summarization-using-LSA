Officer’s Review
“Our managers and butchers continue to be 
the ambassadors of putting their customers 
at the heart of our local strategy”
Performance and operational review
Whilst we made considerable progress in the year 
with the store rollout programme by adding a further 
11 new stores to the estate, we have been very 
disappointed by the like-for-like sales performance as 
some of the price and range initiatives didn’t resonate 
with customers as we had expected. 
In preparing the core business to be ready for 
accelerated expansion and creating the store 
rollout blue print, we made a number of changes to 
standardise the new store concept on range, price 
point, how the stores were operated and how the 
stores looked. These principles worked well for our 
new stores, but when retrospectively introduced into 
our established stores, we learned it was too much 
change for our customers and colleagues. This was 
reflected in the shape of our sales performance during 
June and July at the end of H1.
As a result, we prioritised our focus in the second 
half of the year to listening to colleagues and 
customers, and the feedback from them was relatively 
straightforward. Our customers wanted to see some 
of the old fresh meat pack sizes, price points and 
offers that were previously on sale in their specific 
store. This feedback was positioned at the heart of 
our sales recovery programme and helped shape 
the refinements we set about achieving to provide 
our managers with the necessary ‘freedom within a 
framework’ plan to win back their local customers.
T o ensure that all areas of our business were 
completely focused on delivering the sales 
recovery programme effectively, it was important 
to temporarily pause the store rollout programme 
and provide full support to our store colleagues. 
During the implementation of our ‘freedom within 
a framework’ plan, we reviewed our head office 
organisation structure and removed a number of roles. 
The changes were implemented responsibly giving  
us the central support structure for the year ahead.
Having successfully landed our major change agenda, 
we now believe we have the right operational balance 
between the disciplined framework required as a 
platform for rollout with enough freedom for store 
managers to react to local customer requirements. 
This positive progress has also been reflected in the 
shape and momentum build of our sales performance 
in the lead up to and through the key festive trading 
period at the end of H2.
In summary, we have seen a direct correlation 
between the initiatives introduced in the summer 
and the timing of the steady and continuous 
improvement in like-for-like sales. As previously 
communicated, this improvement in both sales 
and customer number momentum has required 
a moderate level of margin investment. With the 
improvement continuing through the festive trading 
period, we were pleased to be cash generative again 
by the end of the year, in line with our expectations.
Group Revenue
For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2017, Group revenue 
increased by 19% from £37.1m to £44.2m. This growth 
was supported by contributions from our 11 new 
stores in the year. LFL sales were -7.3% for the full year, 
with H1 like-for-like sales being -4.4% and H2 like-for-
like sales being -10.1%. These numbers reflect the 
shape of the key challenging period we experienced 
during June and October 2016, and as outlined in  
this review.
Group sales in the first 10 weeks of the new financial 
year increased by +9% and like-for-like sales were 
-4.6% for the same period.
Strategic focus
We have continued to build on our strategic plan of 
‘providing safe, good quality fresh meat for the value 
conscious consumer’ , which has been reinforced 
through the customer proposition in the last 6 
months. The customer numbers and feedback 
confirm that we are back on track and will therefore 
continue with this journey and approach.
 
Fresh meat
Our managers and butchers continue to be the 
ambassadors of putting their customers at the heart of 
our local strategy, and this is reinforced with their local 
level freedom to delight their customers through the 
fresh meat offer. Our stores continue to develop local 
products specific to their community, provide local 
special offers, as demonstrated with our successful 
Christmas Hampers and the planned new BBQ packs 
for the warmer months ahead. We are maintaining 
the number and depth of price-led promotions which 
also rotate at the managers’ discretion. Furthermore, 
we have recently introduced a new store trial of a 
£4.99 value pack under the umbrella of ‘ once it’ s gone, 
it’ s gone’ concept, consisting of great value fresh meat 
packs with value cut-through in POS labelling. The 
customer’ s reaction to this ‘treasure-trove’ concept has 
been extremely positive.
With our production and distribution capability now 
set up to service up to c.100 stores, we continue to 
develop our award-winning quality homemade 
produce and broaden the range of burgers, sausages, 
meatballs, kebabs, grill sticks and mince in time for the 
spring/summer. In addition, with this new capability 
in mind, we are looking to leverage the spare capacity 
through expanding our wholesale operations. T o 
date, we have taken on the supply of a local 3-strong 
chain of local steakhouse restaurants and will consider 
the opportunities of similar scale relationships. This 
allows us to pick up business which better utilises 
the fixed assets we’ve already invested in without 
compromising our ability to serve our stores and 
customers.
Food-to-go
Within the food-to-go category, the same level 
of local customer focus continues to be applied 
by our managers and trained cooks. Our teams 
have reintroduced a number of store specific 
favourite dishes to the ‘Butcher’ s Kitchen’ menu and 
continuously test new dishes/recipes with input from 
their customers. This provides the perfect platform 
to showcase the quality of our fresh meat produce, 
presented to the customers freshly cooked and  
ready-to-go. Furthermore, we have successfully 
introduced the principles of our legendary multibuy 
offers from the fresh meat category to the food-
to-take-home freshly cooked joints category. This 
provides customers with a great choice of meal 
occasion, such as cooked whole chickens, chicken 
portions, pork loins, gammon joints and ham shanks. 
These are all cooked fresh daily in store using our 
in-house rotisserie and rationale ovens, and sold at 
unit prices, mix-and-match multibuys or catchweights, 
depending on customer requirement. Encouragingly, 
these initiatives have already contributed to an 
increase in customer numbers and sales.
In addition to these exciting fresh meat and  
food-to-go opportunities, which continue to 
anchor our value credentials, we have stepped 
up our marketing activity to maintain our current 
momentum in building customer frequency and 
loyalty.
Customer driven marketing incentives
T o build on the existing customer number 
momentum, we are investing in new ways to achieve 
customer acquisitions whilst working hard to maintain 
and lock-in existing customer loyalty. As a wider team, 
we have identified Facebook as the most successful 
route to get access to a new customer base and the 
VIP Club/Newsletter route to incentivise customers  
to keep coming back.
Social media
In addition to the Corporate Facebook Page, we have 
now introduced and trialled store-specific Facebook 
Pages in 11 stores (5 factory shops and 6 high street). 
All pages are administered by the local management, 
meaning the content is much more tailored, timely 
and relevant to the customer (when compared 
to a centrally managed approach). All stores have 
benefitted from their Facebook launch and customer 
numbers have increased, although it is worth noting 
the high level of success seen in the factory shops as 
more and more customers begin to build a visit to the 
destination factory shop into their routine. Crawshaw Group Plc

Crawshaws VIP
As part of the Facebook launch, we have also 
introduced the ‘Crawshaws VIP Club’ into 4 stores 
(2 factory shops and 2 high street). This allows our 
managers to build up awareness on Facebook, then 
incentivise the customers into the store to sign up for 
the VIP Club to then benefit from a host of exclusive 
special offers and flash sales.
Newsletter
Once customers are signed up to the VIP Club, our 
managers then have the capability to communicate 
via email with a regular newsletter containing new 
products to the range, new special offers or even 
an invitation to take part in new schemes, such as 
‘recommend-a-friend’ .
We are very pleased with the results from the 
recent marketing initiatives and this acts as a very 
positive step-change in customer engagement 
and participation. The customer data capture also 
allows our managers to really target their local offers 
relevant to their local community.
People
Great quality meat products alone will not succeed 
in our industry without great people delivering great 
customer service and experience. And whilst it has 
been a challenging year for everyone in the business, 
the speed of our recovery and stability would not 
have been possible without their input, tremendous 
attitude and commitment. I continue to be very 
proud and impressed by their passion to deliver 
amazing value to our customers every day.
FY 2017 new store performance
We opened 11 new stores in the year of which 6 
were high street, 3 were in shopping centres and 2 
were factory shop locations. From a geographical 
perspective, 7 were in our traditional areas in the 
North and North West and 4 were in the Midlands, 
with all 11 stores opening on time and on budget.  
As would be expected as we have opened more 
stores, there is a wider spread of performance  
against our base case targets and expectations.  
We have a number of stores that have opened well 
and are trading in line with our expectations, equally  
we have a number of stores which are not trading 
 as strongly as anticipated, and encouragingly we 
have a number of stores which have traded well  
ahead of expectations from opening day. Based  
on the learnings and performance of our new  
stores, we remain very encouraged by the potential 
and opportunity of our store rollout programme.  
FY 2018 growth plan
As noted in the Interims, of particular interest and 
significance is the performance of our standalone 
fresh meat factory shops. Our 5 fresh meat factory 
shops sell predominantly fresh meat (no hot food-
to-go offer) and have higher sales, lower operating 
costs and lower fit out costs than our units on the 
high street and in shopping centres. They are also 
much simpler to operate and manage. Whilst our 
location and format strategy has always been one 
of operating a diverse portfolio across high streets, 
shopping centres and factory shop locations, having 
tested the predictability of the factory shop concept 
and fully appraised the opportunity, we believe it to 
be very logical and sensible that this should shape 
the rollout programme for 2017.
Sales recovery programme
1. A flexible commercial framework – 
 store managers
• Rebuilding some of the core decision making  
 processes at store level and empowering   
 store staff to respond to changes in local  
 customer needs. 
• Increased the number and depth of value-led  
 promotions (hero lines) for managers to   
 choose the promotions that resonate most  
 with their customers.
• Focus on delivering a great ‘butcher’s’   
 customer service.
• Continue to rebuild more local supplier   
 relationships. 
2. Fresh meat – sales momentum initiatives
• Local management input on price-point   
 requirements.
• Freedom on the range and merchandising  
 to satisfy local customer needs.
• Introduction of more weekly store specific  
 value-led promotions.
• Local management to balance the ‘bigger  
 packs, better value’ with ‘small packs, great  
 value’ specific to customer needs.
3. Food-to-go – sales momentum initiatives
• Flexible principles applied to the Butcher’s  
 Kitchen food-to-go menu.
• Reintroduce the ‘old favourites’ specific  
 to local customer needs.
• Introduction of more value-led promotions  
 (e.g. cooked chickens/portions).
• Price roll-back and flexibility for managers  
 to price menu items locally.
• Local supplier flexibility to maximise choice,  
 quality and value.
Customer driven marketing incentives
We will also maintain a disciplined approach to our 
growth strategy, which means it is imperative that 
the pace and timings of the store openings are 
managed correctly. Accordingly, we have signed the 
lease for our next factory shop which is scheduled to 
open in May, with a sufficient pipeline and capability 
to open a further 4 factory shops during FY 2018.
Outlook for 2018
The UK grocery market will remain competitive 
and, with industry-wide pressures emerging in 
commodities and labour costs, the UK consumer 
outlook will continue to be more challenging than 
we have seen in recent years. Whilst we would 
ordinarily expect these to have a modest impact on 
margin in the short term we believe that, with our 
cost management measures and margin additive 
initiatives, together with the expected cost reduction 
in our business rates, we are well placed to navigate 
through this challenging environment. Indeed, it has 
been very encouraging to see that we have already 
proven we are capable and well placed to meet 
multiple challenges simultaneously, whether they 
are internally or externally driven.
This year has started in line with our expectations 
as we continue to build on the momentum and 
improvements from the last 6 months. The recent 
journey has also provided everyone with significant 
experience and learnings that will be extremely 
important in the months and years ahead. Our  
clear value proposition, underpinned by our  
unique vertically integrated concept, remains  
highly differentiated and competitive which we 
believe will further strengthen our retail offering. 
Furthermore, with the performance of our 
standalone factory shops being a real highlight  
of the year, we are very excited at opening more  
of this format.
