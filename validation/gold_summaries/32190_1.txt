10 Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Overview
I am pleased to report our first full year 
results following our listing on the premium 
segment of the London Stock Exchange in 
May 2016. 
Despite a challenging first half of the year, 
the Group delivered an improved trading 
performance in the second half and Group 
revenue for the year increased by 12.7% to 
£822.0m (FY16: £729.2m).
During the year, we opened two new retail  
sites, Castleford in April 2016 and Oldbury  
in July 2016, increasing our number of sites 
to 11. These sites are trading on plan and 
complement the Group’s existing footprint. 
During Q4, we completed the substantial 
preparation work for our 12th site, in 
Sheffield, which opened in April 2017.
Customer satisfaction remains a key priority 
for the Group and we measure this using 
NPS. I am pleased that this has increased 
during FY17 from 72% to 77%, reflecting the 
continued hard work of our colleagues.
Our Focus on Team
Our passionate focus on developing our 
team is the driving force of our long term 
success with a high proportion of our team 
internally promoted. We are constantly 
developing our talent with several Talent 
Management and Leadership programmes 
running at one time. We listen to our people 
through surveys and forums and we 
communicate openly and honestly with our 
team. Our team is the best source for new 
ideas that lead to new initiatives and fuel 
our future growth.
We are leaders in people development 
and we are convinced this will maintain our 
differentiated style from the rest of the car 
retail industry, and be a major driver of our 
continued success.
Talent Management Programme
Our Talent Management programme is 
available to all of our team who show 
leadership potential and ambition. Now  
in its third year, the programme supports  
our focus on putting the team first by 
developing those high potential employees 
into future Senior Managers. The 
programme is designed to identify and 
develop key talent, who are then able to 
take key roles across the business and 
encourage an ever-rising bar of leadership 
behaviours. Our business relies on having 
the right person in the right role at the  
right time; by building a pool of talented 
employees we are able to offer new 
opportunities and career progression.  
We are also better placed to retain our  
most talented employees and thereby 
reduce staff turnover.
In the three and a half years since the 
programme’s inception, it has seen 38  
of our team attend, with 22 of those  
having been promoted into a new position 
once involved in the programme. We are 
proud of our culture and commitment to 
developing our existing people.
Investing to Support our Growth
To support our strategic vision for growth, 
we are continuing to invest in better use of 
data across the business. We are building 
our capability in stock, marketing and 
customer relationship management, with 
new initiatives underway to prepare for 
the next phase of growth.
We remain objective in our new site 
approach, balancing the growth opportunity 
with the need to ensure that new sites are 
given enough support to build their teams 
and customer offer.
For the year ahead we will continue to 
support the most recent site openings 
in order to build the strong foundation that 
will position us well in the future and at the 
same time ensure that we continue our 
growth from existing sites.
NextGear 
partnership 
for A4C
Our online auction 
platform to dispose of 
non-retail cars is now 
supported by NextGear.
Sunday Times 
Top 100 
Employer 
The business was included 
in the Sunday Times 
100 Best Companies 
for the third year in a row.
FCA 
permissions for 
warranty 
We were fully authorised 
and regulated by the FCA 
for the sale of general 
insurance products from  
1 December 2016.
New lower 
finance rate
Our finance offering to our 
customers was made more 
competitive in the period, 
which has increased 
customer take-up.
Q3 Q4
Motorpoint Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 In June 2017, our Board of Directors 
recommended Motorpoint Group Plc’s first 
full year dividend, of 2.90 pence per share, 
which would take the total dividend for the 
year to 4.23 pence per share. This level  
of proposed dividend underscores our 
confidence in delivering strong, profitable 
sales and cash ﬂow, and generating 
superior financial returns.
Current Trading and Outlook
Our recent openings have built up a 
considerable growth opportunity for the 
year ahead; by building volumes in this third 
of our estate that is under two years old, we 
will achieve a rapid cash return on these 
investments. Supported by an expanded 
and strengthened management team, we 
are well positioned to deliver the Motorpoint 
model across the estate.  
We are excited by the future potential of 
Motorpoint as our team and customers 
benefit from the time and energy invested 
in recent periods. We are never satisfied 
with the status quo and will always 
challenge it to further the success of 
the Company.
We have many new initiatives underway to 
drive increased levels of customer traffic  
to both our physical sites and online, and 
improved systems and processes in place to 
support our teams in delivering outstanding 
customer satisfaction.
Customers
Our strategy of delivering unrivalled Choice, 
Value and Service to all our customers has 
been our vision since we opened 19 years 
ago and continues to be our core focus.  
We find a strong correlation between our 
team engagement levels and a high level  
of customer service delivery. 
Reflecting changes in customers’  
research and buying journeys, we are 
increasingly recognising the value of peer 
recommendations and customer reviews.  
These reviews are an honest and unbiased 
view of our team, our proposition and our 
company values; I am delighted to see 
that our continued focus and passion on 
championing the customer is recognised 
in these ratings that our customers give us.  
On one of the leading review sites, Google, 
for example, we have seen our rating rise 
to 4.6 stars over the year.
Our NPS, for the year increased from 72% 
to 77%, and increased from 59% in FY14, 
something of which we are very proud.  
Our repeat customers continue to grow, 
allowing our marketing costs to remain  
low in established sites.
Financial Strength
Our balance sheet strength, and the 
ﬂexibility of having no fixed term debt, 
give us great confidence.
Our financial returns and enviable cash 
generation allow us to simultaneously invest 
in the growth of the business and return 
cash to shareholders. We take a disciplined 
approach to capital allocation, which drove 
our strong 112% return on capital employed. 
In FY17, we generated £13.6m in cash from 
operations prior to exceptionals, raised our 
stock levels by £23.5m and invested  
a total of £1.1m in new sites.
Economic and political uncertainty remains 
apparent in the near term, which may 
adversely impact customer confidence.  
We remain confident that our focus on 
Choice, Value and Service remains relevant 
in the face of any fall in customer confidence.
Our key strengths that differentiate us from 
the rest of the market give us confidence 
that our value proposition will continue to 
gather pace in our current footprint and in 
our new site pipeline.
