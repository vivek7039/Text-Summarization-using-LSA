Notes
1  Cash tax adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment 
properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (excluding shares held by the 
Safestore Employee Benefit Trust).
2  CER is constant exchange rates (Euro-denominated results for the current period have been retranslated at the exchange rate effective for the comparative period in order to present the 
reported results on a more comparable basis).
3  Like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth, Altrincham, Birmingham (including closure of our existing Birmingham store) and 
Emerainville, as well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has 
been adjusted.
4  Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent 
and depreciation. Underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying EBITDA less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to 
bank loans and cash.
5   Profit before tax decreased by £16.0 million to £78.9 million (FY2016: £94.9 million) principally as a result of exceptional costs totalling £17.7 million (FY2016: exceptional income of 
£4.3 million), which includes exceptional refinancing costs of £16.3 million, and a reduction in the gain on investment properties by £2.5 million to £39.2 million (FY2016: £41.7 million), 
offset by an improvement in underlying EBITDA of £8.7 million.
6 The consideration paid for Alligator on 1 November 2017 was £56.0 million, and is subject to customary working capital adjustment.
7  LTV ratio is loan-to-value ratio, which is defined as gross debt (excluding finance leases, but adjusted for the fair value of the US Dollar cross currency swap) as a proportion of the valuation 
of investment properties and investment properties under construction (excluding finance leases).
8  ICR is interest cover ratio, and is calculated as the ratio of underlying EBITDA after leasehold rent to underlying finance charges.
9  Occupancy excludes offices but includes bulk tenancy. As at 31 October 2017, closing occupancy includes 27,000 sq ft of bulk tenancy (31 October 2016: 37,000 sq ft).
10  MLA is maximum lettable area. At 31 October 2017, Group MLA was 5.71m sq ft (FY2016: 5.59m sq ft).
11  Average storage rate is calculated as the revenue generated from self-storage revenues divided by the average square footage occupied during the period in question.
12  Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association’s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss for the period after tax but excluding corporate 
transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of 
exceptional items, IFRS 2 share-based payment charges, exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost 
is excluded as it is written back to distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). Therefore, neither the Company’s ability to 
distribute nor pay dividends are impacted (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). The financial statements will disclose earnings both on a statutory, EPRA and 
Adjusted Diluted EPRA basis and will provide a full reconciliation of the differences in the financial year in which any LTIP awards may vest.
13  Free cash flow is defined as cash flow before investing and financing activities but after leasehold rent payments.
