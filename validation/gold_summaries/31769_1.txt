 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 08
Chief Executive’s Statement
A refined growth 
strategy
This is my first full year report, having joined the Company in 
January 2017, and I am delighted to update shareholders on 
another year of operational and financial success. 
Introduction
It has been another busy and productive 
year, during which we have expanded 
our product portfolio; launched two 
new brands; and refined our growth 
strategy to optimise our expansion 
opportunities now and for the future.
Focusrite is a business I knew well before 
I joined; with a well-earned reputation 
for high-quality products and a history 
of innovation and disruption, and I was 
honoured and proud to be asked to 
lead the Company into its next phase of 
growth. One of the primary factors that 
led to my decision to join the Company 
was the passion that came through 
from the employees. Many of our people 
are musicians, audio engineers, or DJs 
themselves and they use our products 
in real-world environments every week, 
bringing to work a real drive to push the 
boundaries of modern-day audio production. 
Our employee footprint continues to 
expand in our High Wycombe, London, 
Los Angeles and Hong Kong offices, as 
well as with remote employees all over the 
globe. It is a great pleasure and privilege 
to help guide and lead them and I thank 
them for their hard work and dedication.
Overview
The Group’s products are now sold 
in approximately 160 territories and 
countries all over the world. We utilise 
an effective mix of retailers – online and 
‘bricks and mortar’ locations, distributors 
in areas where localisation is a factor, 
a hybrid approach in the USA utilising 
a distributor with our own demand 
generation team, and direct business 
to consumer with our own e-commerce 
store and in-app software purchases.
We sold approximately 800,000 physical 
products to end-users last year, and our 
music creation apps were downloaded 2.7 
million times with around 700,000 in-app 
customer transactions. Our manufacturing 
partners are located in South China and 
we use third-party logistics support. 
We employ around 190 people in the 
UK, USA, Germany and Hong Kong.
This is a business of considerable 
scale with scope for further growth 
and our market position, products, 
people and customer base are the 
envy of many in the industry.
The market
The global audio production market 
continues to grow and we believe we 
remain well poised to increase our 
market share with existing products 
and also to exploit opportunities to 
expand into adjacent product categories 
that would make commercial sense 
and are a strategic fit for our existing 
business. This can be done organically 
and, when it makes commercial and 
economic sense, by acquisition.
For many personal and professional 
audio recording customers, Focusrite 
technology and solutions are a 
cornerstone of their set-ups and 
creative workflows. We know that puts

us in a unique position to expand our 
offerings and participate in more of the 
economic value chain. Alongside that, 
we recognise the opportunity to continue 
to make audio recording technology 
easier to use and more accessible 
to a larger addressable market.
Operating review
This year has seen further operational 
progress and this has translated 
into financial success with careful 
management of our cost base and a 
focus on cash generation. Revenues grew 
by 21.6% to £66.1 million, delivering 
an operating profit of £9.5 million, 
representing year-on-year growth of 
32.6%. These results were materially 
ahead of forecasts and represent a 
very pleasing outcome for the Group.
This positive performance has been 
driven by a number of factors, including 
a wider market acceptance and growth 
of share in many of our core products; 
along with a suite of new innovative 
offerings, giving us more depth to 
our portfolio and the opportunity to 
sell more to our customer base.
The Group continues to penetrate new 
market segments and price points with 
best-in-class, user-friendly products. 
Customer and sales channel satisfaction 
feedback remains strong on new and 
existing products and continued high 
levels of end-user satisfaction are 
illustrated by our top net promotor 
scores for individual products.
Focusrite
Within Focusrite, our Scarlett, Clarett 
and RedNet ranges all grew, leading 
to total segment revenue growth of 
18.6%. In each category we increased 
market share and experienced 
growth beyond the industry norms.
Sales of our second generation Scarlett 
USB audio interface range, upgraded 
and launched in June last year, were 
particularly strong. The Scarlett 
family has earned the reputation as 
a best-in-class, premium solution at 
affordable pricing. This product line 
remains the number one selling audio 
interface product in the world.
The Clarett range continues to set 
new price/performance standards 
in our mid-range interface offerings 
and, with an advanced set of features 
catered to creative professionals, we 
are very pleased to see that Clarett 
has been warmly received and enjoyed 
numerous accolades from the industry.
Our commercial and pro-audio range, 
led by RedNet, is gaining momentum 
as applications for its use and potential 
customers grow, especially in post-
production, education and broadcast 
markets. This year we have witnessed 
some of the top production facilities in the 
world transition their entire infrastructure 
to RedNet and reap numerous benefits 
in efficiency, costs and productivity.
During the year we also launched the 
Focusrite Pro brand to support our 
growing Red/RedNet business and bring 
key sales talent and focus to this market. 
This additional investment will continue 
next year. We believe that our portfolio of 
professional AOIP solutions are well 
poised to become industry standards in 
post-production, broadcast, installed and 
live sound.
Novation
The Novation segment now consists of 
Novation and Ampify, the Group’s own 
software brand.
Launchpad, Launchkey, and the synthesiser 
product categories all experienced 
accelerated sales growth, with overall 
growth in this business segment of 37.8%.
Wider market acceptance of grid-based 
controllers in the electronic music space, 
coupled with larger penetration from online 
distribution channels such as Amazon, has 
driven demand for Launchpad. This 
product range experienced significant 
worldwide uplift in demand with year-on-
year sales volume growth of 39.0%.
Our Launchkey family of keyboard 
controllers also enjoyed significant uplift 
in worldwide demand, with its intuitive 
feature set and extensive integrated 
control features with top music-making 
software such as Ableton Live. Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 10
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
small when seen as a percentage of total 
Group revenue, but growing significantly 
year-on-year as we continue to increase 
our library of in-app purchases for these 
customers. Our apps consistently rank in 
the top ten for music creation tools on 
Apple’s app store and are currently 
displayed in Apple stores worldwide. We 
recently launched Groovebox – ‘a new 
beats and synth music studio’ for iPad and 
iPhone – and to date it has had over 
200,000 downloads and is growing fast.
Innovation
Innovation is key driver of growth and 
we continue to spend around 6% 
to 7% of revenue on research and 
development so as to provide a constant 
stream of new and relevant products 
for our various customer channels.
Our new flagship synthesiser, Peak, 
has seen widespread adoption within 
the professional music community 
and won numerous accolades from 
the industry as a true next-generation 
synthesiser; building off the legacy 
of the Novation brand and its many 
famous earlier synthesiser products.
During the year we rebranded our apps 
division to Ampify: a brand on which we will 
continue to develop powerful audio 
software tools for new customers and our 
existing customers alike. We are investing 
substantially in Ampify, as we aim to grow 
the Company’s own software capability. 
This investment is starting to be rewarded 
with operational progress and we now have 
three music-making apps with around 
550,000 active users. Revenues are still 
 
“  By improving the 
product and customer 
experience we will seek 
to extend the customer 
life cycle, keeping them 
using our products 
longer throughout their 
music-making lifetime.” Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 11
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
During the year we launched eight 
new hardware and two new software 
products, including: Red 8 Pre, Clarett 
OctoPre, Scarlett OctoPre, Scarlett 
OctoPre Dynamic, iTrack One Pre 
and Circuit Components update.
These new products are across 
different price segments and target 
customer markets, giving us further 
penetration and reach. Feedback from 
the consumer, retailer and distribution 
channels has been positive and 
acceptance so far has been pleasing.
We continue to enhance our offerings 
with improved drivers, new tool sets and 
capabilities that make our solutions easier 
to install and use, netting us industry-
leading Net Promoter Scores and 
overall customer experience statistics.
Additionally, we have focused some 
of our development resources on the 
‘out-of-the-box’ experience for new 
customers, as we believe that ensuring 
customers have a great first experience 
with our products is paramount to our 
overall success and growth strategy.
Geographic overview
I am pleased to report that our success 
this past year was truly global and 
sales in all major regions grew.
The USA finished with a 30.9% rise 
in revenue when compared with last 
year. Europe experienced 11.4% 
growth. Finally, the Rest of the World 
(incorporating Asia, Latin America 
and Canada) finished the year with 
24.9% year-on-year growth.
The USA market, the largest market for 
our portfolio and currently 42% of total 
Group sales, remains a key focus for our 
sales efforts and we continue to expand 
the team in our Los Angeles office.
In Europe, where we saw increased 
competition between the major 
continental resellers, our growth 
was lower than our other regions 
but still ahead of industry 
averages in our segment.
Within the Rest of the World, Asia-Pacific 
sales were strong across most countries, 
especially in China, and our Hong 
Kong office is now fully functional and 
integrated with our Company systems. 
Additionally, we are investing in more 
sales talent to scale for what we believe 
is still a large opportunity in this region.
Finally, Latin America and Canada 
both had healthy growth and we 
will continue to invest in resources 
and tools to grow these regions 
into this next year and beyond.
Distribution and logistics initiatives
Focusrite’s distribution of adjacent 
products, such as KRK monitors and 
sE Electronics microphones, remains a 
small overall proportion of Group revenue. 
It remains important to us as it offers 
add-on products within the music-making 
industry and provides us with invaluable 
market feedback, insight and knowledge.
e-commerce initiatives
The Group’s e-commerce store, which 
launched in March last year, accounted 
for over 1% of the Group’s revenue 
and this continues to improve. With a 
global presence but specific emphasis 
on markets where localised content, 
language support and swift delivery 
to end-users are key to success, we 
believe this segment will grow further.
Summary and outlook
We are focused on three core goals: 
growing our customer base; increasing 
the lifetime value of our customers; 
and expanding into new market 
segments both from a price and product 
perspective. To achieve this we will 
continue to innovate, disrupt, grow our 
audience and ultimately continue in 
our tradition of making the creative 
process of music creation and audio 
recording easier for our customers.
Although competitive pressures remain 
strong, changes in technology and new 
customer requirements can emerge 
quickly, and macroeconomic and political 
factors affect our end customers and 
distributors alike, we remain committed to 
keeping abreast of these risks in order to 
continue to deliver strong growth.
Since the year end, revenue and cash 
have both grown further. We continue to 
see strong market acceptance across our 
expanding portfolio and our new product 
pipeline continues to grow. Our solid 
momentum has continued into the current 
year and we continue to look forward with 
confidence.
