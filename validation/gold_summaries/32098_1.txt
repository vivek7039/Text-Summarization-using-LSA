From within the Micro Focus Product Portfolio we also manage, for the Group 
overall, the corporate support functions of HR, IT, Facilities, Finance, Legal and 
the Project Management Ofﬁce (“PMO”) for acquisitions and integration. In 
addition we manage the delivery of a shared service for other elements of 
support to the SUSE portfolio enabling SUSE to directly control what they 
need to execute with speed and ﬂexibility whilst leveraging the larger Group 
where effective as SUSE builds scale. During FY17 this shared service 
approach was phased out to further enable the SUSE team to execute 
autonomously such that in FY18 only the corporate support functions are 
shared with all other resources dedicated to either SUSE or Micro Focus. 
Wherever practical the corporate support functions staff are dedicated to 
product portfolios, including SUSE, in order to provide the additional beneﬁt 
of specialization whilst leveraging the scale of the shared function. 
Progress in FY17
During 2017 our main priority has been completing the integration of the 
different businesses into a more coherent whole, focused on consistent and 
sustained ﬁnancial performance and the delivery of innovation that matters to 
customers – what we call customer centred innovation. This means helping 
customers solve the real world challenges they face today as they wrestle with 
balancing the ever increasing requirements for I.T. to deliver new capabilities 
and support new business models with the demands of securing and running 
day to day operations. We achieve this through the rigorous application of our 
FOUR-BOX MODEL which has at its core direct engagement with customers 
to enable highly targeted product development and delivery. 
Highlights include:
 – Our focus on delivering customer centred innovation continued to 
gather momentum: 
 – Delivered 185 product releases or signiﬁcant enhancements in FY17 
with each sub-portfolio improving the levels of customer engagement 
and cadence of product delivery; 
 – Integration of Serena and acquisition and integration of GWAVA 
completed on time and now executing as integral parts of the 
Micro Focus Product Portfolio, adding further depth and new 
capabilities within Development & ITOM and C&N respectively; and 
 – Removed dependency on third party intellectual property in key 
strategic elements of our IAS portfolio. 
 – Integration of the business into a coherent whole is now broadly complete 
as evidenced by the progress on removing sub-branding, completely 
redesigning our websites, transitioning to a geographic Go-to-Market 
(“GTM”) model globally and creating an integrated approach to product 
development and management. The remaining focus area is on IT systems 
where our stated goal of driving standardization will take longer to deliver 
than originally anticipated. As a result of the planned merger with HPE 
Software we have decided to implement the new set of systems being built 
for HPE Software for the Group as a whole. This will enable more effective 
integration of the existing Group with HPE Software and the creation of 
a more ﬂexible platform from which to execute our strategy but it remains 
a very signiﬁcant undertaking. 
 – Financial performance in the year was in line with expectations, with 
progress in Maintenance Fee Revenue being somewhat offset by 
performance in Licence Fee Revenue where the loss to a competitor of an 
entire sales team and management structure caused three to ﬁve months 
of disruption which impacted our Host Connectivity business principally.
20 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CEO Review – Micro Focus Product Portfolio  The Micro Focus Portfolio Group in FY17
Product Group
We now execute as one global organization covering the ﬁve sub-portfolios. 
During FY17 we delivered major product releases across each sub-portfolio 
and more than 185 releases in total. We have established standard processes 
for market and opportunity analysis through product development to product 
launch and sales and partner enablement. Best practices in areas such as 
development methodologies, pricing and licence management have been 
identiﬁed and are now adopted across the Group. 
The FOUR-BOX MODEL approach was applied across all products to optimize 
returns and ensure product roadmaps reﬂect the appropriate priorities based 
on the individual products life cycle and portfolio management position. 
This more uniﬁed approach to product development and management has 
presented new opportunities for delivering more value to customers through 
sharing technology and best practice focused on speciﬁc customer use cases 
or challenges. For example, we have delivered advanced security capabilities 
from our IAS portfolio within our leading Host Connectivity solutions to bring 
signiﬁcantly enhanced functionality for customers to secure mainframe 
application access. 
We continue to invest in product development and sharpen our focus in 
product management. We are excited by the signiﬁcant enhancements to 
existing products, the new products released in the past year and the product 
roadmaps for the future. 
Go to Market (“GTM”) – sales, services and marketing 
The transition of the GTM approach from global business units measured on 
annual bookings to a geographic organization focused on quarterly revenue 
is now complete. 
This realignment of structure and approach was executed to enable closer 
engagement with the customer base and drive behaviour change at both the 
management and individual level to underpin the move to a more granular, 
quarterly cadence of sales forecasting and execution. 
In services we have changed the direction and objectives to align fully with our 
strategy of “making, selling and supporting software”. The teams have been 
reorganized with compensation and incentives changed to be targeted on 
delivering successful software implementations rather than more standalone 
services engagements. This change also enables better alignment with our 
channel partners. We have an extensive partner network that is a fundamental 
part of our long-term plans and it is important we ensure consistency of 
direction and focus to ensure objectives are aligned and mutual success is 
achieved in support of our customers. 
Our approach to and our engagement with our channel partners was improved 
during FY17. Channel programmes were completely revamped to focus on 
those partners who were adding most value to our customers through the 
investment in complementary skills and technologies. Underpinning this is a 
completely redesigned Channel Portal to simplify how we collaborate and to 
provide improved visibility and analytics.
Systems and Processes
The decision to switch the focus of our long term strategic approach to 
internal systems to leverage the HPE Software internal systems has had a 
short term impact on our ability to make the fundamental structural improvements 
we believe will underpin our long term strategy. In the interim we switched 
focus to tackling other areas of process or technology inefﬁciencies. Key 
examples include the continued simpliﬁcation of sales compensation plans, 
rationalization of websites, marketing support systems and social media 
platforms, improvements to our core data and voice infrastructure and 
improvements to our business intelligence and data analytics capabilities. 
We believe the changes made enable us to better serve our customers but 
we still have a great deal to do across systems (beyond the main strategic 
project), processes and people to deliver the levels of sales productivity 
desired and possible. 
We aim to increase sales productivity and predictability further by continuing 
to simplify the underlying processes and systems we use to run the business 
and improve customer insight by generating closer interaction between Sales 
and Marketing, Product Management and Product Development. All of which 
is key to effective operation today and faster integration with HPE Software 
in the future. 
Micro Focus Product Portfolio
Details of our ﬁve sub portfolios are provided below.
COBOL Development & Mainframe Solutions (“CDMS”) – 
19.2% of FY17 Group revenues (2016: pro-forma CCY 18.5%)
We have continued to invest in our core COBOL development (“CD”) products 
that primarily target the off-mainframe distributed development market. The 
CD products enable programmers to develop and deploy applications written 
in COBOL across multiple platforms including Windows, UNIX, Linux and the 
cloud. Visual COBOL provides the fastest way for customers to move 
enterprise mainframe application workloads partially or wholly to Java Virtual 
Machine (“JVM”), .NET or cloud environments whilst protecting their existing 
investments and intellectual property.
COBOL applications continue to be at the heart of the world’s business 
transactions and to power the majority of large organizations’ key business 
operations. Maintaining our leadership position in CD is at the core of our value 
proposition. By embedding our products in industry standard development 
environments speciﬁcally Visual Studio and Eclipse, we have addressed the 
perceived skill issues, and expect that COBOL will provide a stable base and 
strong cash ﬂow for the Group over the coming decades.

21 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our Mainframe Solutions (“MS”) product set addresses a customer’s need to 
get the most value out of their mainframe environment. These technologies 
allow customers ﬂexibility in deciding the platform choice for development, 
testing and deployment of their business applications. Various business and 
technical drivers would determine if it is best to do these functions either within 
the mainframe environment or outside of it on distributed Windows, UNIX and 
Linux machines. We offer customers the choice to do either or both, enabling 
the optimum balance of cost, risk and speed of execution across their 
mainframe and distributed computing platforms. Increasingly businesses are 
seeking to re-use existing business logic and data, while also looking to exploit 
new innovations in technology such as mobile and cloud. Our mainframe 
solutions allow customers to accomplish both by enabling the re-deployment 
of enterprise mainframe applications to distributed systems, virtualized mobile 
platforms, and the cloud. We estimate that the mainframe COBOL development 
market opportunity is approximately three times as large as that for off 
mainframe distributed COBOL development. 
Micro Focus will maintain its leadership positions in CDMS through products 
such as Visual COBOL and Enterprise Developer. The continued stable 
revenue performance in this portfolio is showing that our strategy is working.
Host Connectivity – 12.7% of FY17 Group revenues 
(2016: pro-forma CCY 14.1%)
The Host Connectivity product portfolio helps customers improve user 
productivity as they extend host access to new web and mobile use cases 
while ensuring that modern security practices around encryption, authorization, 
and authentication can be enforced. We specialize in environments with 
heterogeneous systems or platforms and this product set has, in one form 
or another, assisted in these tasks for over 30 years. 
The Host Connectivity capabilities are extended by other products that provide 
legacy integration technologies that enable businesses to put their mainframe 
assets to work in new ways by exposing applications and data to modern 
development environments and business analytics systems. There are 
additional Secure Shell (“SSH”) based ﬁle transfer solutions that solve a range 
of tactical and strategic problems for securely transferring ﬁles of any size, 
enabling businesses to work seamlessly with partners and customers.
In Host Connectivity we will seek to build on our existing strengths in terms 
of technology and customer base combined with our innovations in security 
to establish a true leadership position in this area.
Identity Access & Security (“IAS”) – 15.0% of FY17 Group 
revenues (2016: pro-forma CCY 15.4%)
This product set offers a broad set of proven solutions for Identity Governance 
and Administration, Access Management and Authentication, and Security 
Management. Our customers span all sectors with particular strength in 
regulated industries, including Healthcare, Finance, Government, Retail, 
Manufacturing, and Energy. In addition companies in non-regulated industries 
also implement our IAS products as a best practice for protecting intellectual 
property or other sensitive information, and to make their organizations 
more efﬁcient.
Customers use our Identity & Access Management (“IAM”) solutions to apply 
integrated policies across local, mobile, and cloud environments to govern 
access to information, administer and manage the identity and access lifecycle 
of users, and demonstrate compliance with regulations or mandates. We provide 
solutions that address identity lifecycle management, risk-based authentication, 
single sign-on (“SSO”), access governance, and multi-factor authentication.
Our Security Management solutions build upon this identity centric approach by 
integrating identity and other contextual information with security monitoring, 
ensuring organizations have the security intelligence they need, when they 
need it, to detect and respond to abnormal activity that signals a data breach 
or compliance gap. Our Security Management solutions provide privileged user 
management, secure conﬁguration management and visibility and control over 
user activities, security events, and critical systems across an organization to 
enable them to quickly address evolving threats.
Key trends driving growth in this area include the continued expansion and 
diversity of security threats to organizations and the growth of the resulting 
ﬁnancial risk, the increasing demand for organizations to demonstrate that they 
have the processes in place to manage access, and the continued expansion 
of virtualization and cloud deployments increasing the level of complexity of the 
applications and information over which organizations need to manage access 
and monitor activity. Additionally organizations have an opportunity cost, 
effectively to implement stronger authentication methods than traditional 
username/password to help minimize data breaches. 
Our IAS solutions are well suited to address these trends, using unique 
identity-powered technologies to help organizations govern and manage user 
privileges, facilitate and control access to applications and data, and monitor 
user and system activities. Although well positioned from a technology and 
capability perspective in this growth market there are many niche players who 
have point solutions and the trend in the market seems to be for customers 
to look for the potentially quicker ﬁx of a single point solution rather than a 
company-wide integrated solution. Our focus is to build on existing strengths 
but transition the portfolio to enable these strengths to be packaged for easier 
consumption and deployment giving the customer better longer term balance 
between speed of deployment as part of a more integrated solution versus 
disparate point solutions from multiple vendors.
22 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CEO Review – Micro Focus Product Portfolio 
continued Development & IT Operations Management Tools – 20.6% 
of FY17 Group revenues (2016: pro-forma CCY 22.7%)
On 2 May 2016 we added important new capabilities and depth to this product 
portfolio through the acquisition of Serena, a leading provider of Application 
Lifecycle Management products enhancing both our expertise in mainframe 
computing and distributed software change management. Consistent with our 
philosophy of customer centred innovation we have continued to develop the 
full suite of Serena products and started the process of leveraging existing 
Micro Focus capabilities to the beneﬁt of Serena products and customers 
and vice versa.
The Application Delivery and Testing products offer a range of DevOps 
solutions which span an organizations software development lifecycle – from 
deﬁnition (requirements capture) through to delivery (testing and change 
management). Organizations competing in a global marketplace must deliver 
innovative applications that meet customer expectations anytime, anywhere. 
Greater agility is required as software teams rapidly adapt to the volume and 
velocity of evolving business requirements and the demand to work in more 
diverse environments including mobile and cloud. Our Application Delivery and 
Testing solutions improve communication and collaboration between business, 
test, and development teams for continuous delivery of a superior applications 
and user experience across all their device and platform combinations.
Our Data Centre Management solutions integrate service management, 
application management, and systems management to give organizations a 
holistic view of their IT environment and business services, enabling companies 
to manage increased complexity and capacity with the right balance of cost, 
risk and speed of execution. We provide application performance management, 
IT process automation, business service management, and systems 
management solutions. 
Our Workload Migration and Disaster Recovery products help organizations 
complete data centre transformation and migration projects quickly and 
efﬁciently with automatic, unattended high-speed physical-to-virtual, 
virtual-to-virtual, or anywhere-to-cloud workload migrations. Additionally, our 
high-performance disaster recovery solutions offer warm-standby recovery 
speeds similar to mirroring but at the lower cost points more associated with 
tape backup for all server workloads: physical and virtual, Windows and Linux.
Endpoint Management products enable IT staff to handle the complexities of 
securing and managing a large footprint of PC’s, Macs, tablets and smartphones 
to give the proper and secure working environment to each employee. 
Using a uniﬁed management console, these tools enable all devices to be 
patched, compliant, secure and properly equipped. Due to the multifarious 
and complex nature of the user and system endpoints within today’s large 
organizations, this can be a burdensome and costly undertaking, and 
accordingly the toolset is both broad and deep. The capabilities include service 
desk; application virtualization; asset management; conﬁguration management; 
software distribution; full disk encryption; mobile device management; and 
patch management. 
We offer a very broad set of solutions and capabilities for customers. Our focus 
is on delivering the targeted innovation our customers need as they seek to 
solve complex, real world and ever changing challenges in building, operating 
and securing complex IT applications and infrastructure.
Collaboration & Networking – 10.5% of FY17 Group revenues 
(2016: pro-forma CCY 11.3%)
Our collaboration products enable organizations to build and operate work 
environments that are more secure and easier to manage, regardless of how 
or where people work. The products form a complete collaboration solution 
that has long been praised by customers and industry watchers for security 
and reliability. Key capabilities include email, calendaring, instant messaging, 
contact management, task management; team workspaces with document 
management, and workﬂows. 
On 30 September 2016 we completed the acquisition of GWAVA Inc. 
(“GWAVA”), a leading provider of email security and enterprise information 
archiving (“EIA”) solutions based in the US, Canada and Germany. GWAVA has 
a full suite of products, including their award winning EIA product Retain, that 
enable customers to protect, optimize, secure and ensure compliance for email, 
mobile and social data across multiple platforms including Micro Focus 
GroupWise, Microsoft Ofﬁce and Google.
Collaboration brings people, projects, and processes together in one secure 
place to enhance team productivity and this ﬁts closely with additional products 
that offer ﬁle, print, and networking services designed to enable organizations 
to securely print and share ﬁles both inside and outside their organization. The 
products can automate the conﬁguration and management of high availability 
collaboration and networking servers, that are simple to resource manage and 
maintain. Suitable for small workgroups, right through to global enterprise 
deployments, the end-user value proposition includes dynamic ﬁle services 
which automates policies data storage; ﬁle access; secure ﬁle sharing; ﬁle 
reporting; mobile access; and online, ofﬂine and mobile printing. 
Fully distributed networking services such as centralized server management; 
secure ﬁle storage; and storage management, provide full enterprise 
distributed networking environments suitable for small workgroups, right 
through to global enterprise deployments. 
This product set also includes the CORBA based network and data transport 
products which provide unrivalled functionality and performance to companies 
with a requirement for high speed, and secure transfer of data between 
systems on their multi-platform networks. This technology is deployed across 
thousands of customers supporting more than a billion transactions per day. 
We have been delivering value to our customer base with these products for 
decades and are committed to delivering the practical innovation and support 
our customers want and need to continue to leverage these investments. 
Micro Focus will maintain its existing and seek to develop new leadership 
positions through continued investment in customer centred innovation. We will 
maintain our leadership in COBOL Development & Mainframe Solutions through 
products such as Visual COBOL and Enterprise Developer. In Host Connectivity 
we will seek to build on our existing strengths in terms of technology and 
customer base combined with our innovations in security to establish a true 
leadership position. In Development & ITOM and Collaboration & Networking 
the strength of our existing franchises can be built upon through targeted 
innovation and customer engagement. By continuing to sharpen our focus 
in IAS we are well positioned for growth over the longer term.

Revenue for the Micro Focus Product Portfolio declined by 5.7% on a 
pro-forma CCY basis. 
Licence revenue
Licence revenue declined by 7.4% (2016: 4.8%) on a pro-forma CCY basis. 
There was year-on-year Licence revenue growth in CDMS and Collaboration & 
Networking offset by declines in the other sub-portfolios. 
Maintenance revenue
Maintenance revenues declined by 4.5% (2016: 6.1%) on a pro-forma CCY 
basis. This was primarily in Development & ITOM Tools and Collaboration & 
Networking. The fair value deferred revenue haircut reduced maintenance by 
$6.9m (2016: $10.2m). Excluding this, underlying maintenance revenues fell 
by 4.9% (2016: 6.2%). 
Consultancy revenue
Consultancy revenues declined by 12.0% (2016: 15.2%) on a pro-forma CCY 
basis as we completed the implementation of the established Micro Focus policy 
of focusing only on consulting business that supports our licence business.
CDMS revenues were $265.2m; a growth of 2.8% on a pro-forma CCY basis 
compared with the year to 30 April 2016. This portfolio continues to show 
annual revenue growth underpinned by Visual COBOL and Enterprise 
Developer which highlights the continuing value customers derive from our 
CDMS products in support of their mission critical applications. Licence 
revenues grew by 1.7% ($1.8m), Maintenance revenues grew by 3.2% ($4.7m) 
and Consulting revenues grew by 8.0% ($0.7m). 
Host Connectivity revenues declined by 1 1.0% ($21.6m) in the year on a 
pro-forma CCY basis. Licence revenues declined by 22.2% ($19.8m) mostly 
as a result of the loss to a competitor of an entire sales team and management 
structure. Maintenance revenues declined marginally by 0.8% ($0.8m) and 
there was a decline in Consulting revenues of 35.7% ($1.0m).
Identity, Access & Security (“IAS”) revenues declined by 3.4% ($7.3m) 
in the year on a pro-forma CCY basis. Licence revenues declined by 6.0% on 
pro-forma CCY basis due to a lack of large scale projects in customers which 
is an area of real strength for our products and increased competition in this 
market from niche players for the smaller more point solutions. We will continue 
to drive for growth in this area but expect that this will take time to be delivered. 
Maintenance revenues declined by 0.4% ($0.6m). 
Development & IT Operations Management Tools revenues which now 
include Serena were $285.2m; a 9.7% ($30.6m) decline on pro-forma CCY 
basis. $20.0m of the decline was in Maintenance revenues which declined by 
8.5% compared with 1 1.3% in the prior year. Licence revenues declined in the 
period by $9.0m partly due to lower sales of our Serena products which had a 
number of large licence sales in the prior year. Consulting revenues declined 
by 10.3% ($1.6m). 
Collaboration & Networking revenues which now include GWAVA were 
$144.5m a decline of 8.1% ($12.7m) on pro-forma CCY basis. Licence revenue 
grew by 23.2% ($5.5m). Maintenance revenue declined by 13.4% ($17.1m) 
in the period compared with 15.8% in the prior year.

North America started the year promisingly but had a disappointing third 
quarter which resulted in year-on-year revenue decline of 5.7% (2016: 6.4% 
decline) for the full year. The Federal business performed very well and CDMS 
execution improved throughout the year to deliver year-on-year growth within 
which Mainframe Solutions won exciting new customers and projects. Host 
Connectivity was down signiﬁcantly mostly due to disruption and the impact of 
losing an entire sales team and management structure to a competitor causing 
both performance and pipeline development issues. 
International had a challenging year with revenue decline year on year of 
6.1% (2016: 4.6% decline). This region like in North America experienced 
challenges in the Host Connectivity and IAS markets. CDMS was broadly ﬂat. 
France performed well and Germany and Nordics improved signiﬁcantly in 
the second half but this was not enough to make up for weaknesses in the 
other territories. 
Asia Paciﬁc & Japan saw a 4.0% year on year revenue decline (2016: 10.6% 
decline). Licence revenues were marginally ahead of last year and maintenance 
revenues were in line with trend. Strength in Japan and Australia was offset by 
weakness in India & Asia. The Australia business was rebuilt to ensure that the 
correct teams were in place to execute consistently and improve the overall 
capabilities locally and these changes started to deliver improvements from 
very early in FY17. There were some excellent wins in IAS that demonstrate 
what can be delivered when skill and execution levels are maintained.

The directly managed costs are those costs speciﬁcally managed by the CEO 
of the Micro Focus Product Portfolio. In the year ended 30 April 2017 some 
of the management of the Asia Paciﬁc and Japan (“APJ”) sales organization 
moved under the direct management of SUSE. All the Group central support 
costs are managed by the Micro Focus Product Portfolio group and the 
allocation of these costs to SUSE is based on an appropriate methodology. 
In the year ended 30 April 2018, SUSE will directly manage all of their own 
consulting services and maintenance renewals activities.
The adjusted operating proﬁt was $539.4m, delivering a margin of 50.1% 
which compares with the margin in the pro-forma CCY numbers for the year 
ended 30 April 2016 of 47.0%. The increase in margin arises because of the 
continuing actions taken in managing costs.

Outlook
We have achieved a great deal over the last 12 months and enter the new 
ﬁnancial year with stronger foundations than a year ago. We continue to 
focus on improving the way in which we operate to maximize the efﬁciency 
of the organization. 
The Group has undergone huge change in FY16 and FY17 but the one 
constant has been clarity of strategy and the associated focus on aligning 
operational execution to the delivery of that strategy. Looking forward to 
FY18 this focus will continue with our key priorities being: 
 – Delivery of our ﬁnancial plan;
 – Continuing to operationalize the FOUR-BOX MODEL to better align 
resources to optimize the performance of each sub-portfolio; and
 – Planning for and subsequent integration with HPE Software following 
Completion of the transaction.
