CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
Results
Following a strong 2016, its first year as a 
listed company, Time Out Group continued 
to make substantial progress as it evolves 
into a transactional business. Group revenue 
increased by 19% year-on-year, driven by a 
combination of underlying growth (12%) and 
the contribution of the acquisitions of Time 
Out Australia and Time Out Spain. We saw 
revenue growth increasing in the second 
half of the year, demonstrating that the 
business strategy is on track. Both business 
divisions delivered good growth; in Time 
Out Digital, e-commerce revenue increased 
by 57% offsetting the anticipated weaker 
print revenue. Time Out Market performed 
particularly well with revenue growth of 62% 
and 3.6 million visitors in 2017 compared to 
3.1 million in the prior year.
Key Achievements
I am very pleased that Time Out Group 
continued to consistently deliver against its 
core areas. A large, growing global audience 
and that audience’s desire to make the 
most of the city has been key to Time Out’s 
progress and evolving this unique brand as a 
digital, transactional business.
In 2017, Time Out’s average global monthly 
audience reach further grew by 39% year-
on-year to 217 million across all platforms; 
geographic growth was driven by the Group’s 
continued global expansion of owned and 
operated businesses with the acquisition 
of franchises in Australia and Spain, and 
the addition, at no cost, of Hong Kong and 
Singapore.
This increased reach combined with Time Out 
Digital’s ongoing investment – in particular in 
its e-commerce platform – grew transactions 
across more and new verticals. Improvements 
included expanding e-commerce to new 
cities, new affiliate agreements especially for 
travel offerings, content and commerce being 
increasingly connected with more booking 
options. We expanded our digital advertising 
presence through the integration of Time Out 
franchises in Australia, Spain and Asia. Around 
the globe, we see major advertising partners 
increasingly looking for the unique, bespoke 
multi-channel solutions we can offer within the 
positive brand-safe environment Time Out’s 
content provides.
Time Out Market Lisbon continues to be an 
incredible success story. In 2017, it delivered 
an excellent performance with continued 
revenue momentum and record visitor 
numbers, proving the strength of the format. 
We look forward to bringing Time Out Market 
to exciting cities, with near term plans on track 
to open sites in New York, Miami, Boston and 
Chicago.
People
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
on behalf of our Board and our Shareholders 
everyone at Time Out Group, including our 
licensing partners, for the great progress we 
made in 2017. In 2018, we will celebrate this 
iconic brand’s 50th birthday – it was launched 
in London in 1968 to help people explore the 
exciting new urban cultures that started up all 
over the city. Today, this DNA is still completely 
intact thanks to our fantastic team around the 
world that has always been passionate about 
delivering insight and value to our consumers 
and partners. Together with my Board 
colleagues, I am looking forward to driving the 
continued success and growth of Time Out as 
we inspire and enable more and more people 
to make the most of cities around the world.
