 The successful IPO in September 2017 means 
that Destiny Pharma plc is now well placed to 
develop its novel drug pipeline.
Introduction
I am very pleased as Chairman to 
contribute this introduction to Destiny 
Pharma’s first Annual Report as an AIM 
company. The successful listing in 
September 2017 was clearly a major 
achievement and the concurrent 
fundraising of over £15 million means 
that Destiny Pharma is now very well 
placed to continue to develop much 
needed novel, anti-infective drugs such 
as its lead asset XF-73 and also to 
progress the earlier pipeline.
The listing could not have been 
achieved without the hard work and 
support of Destiny Pharma’s past and 
present Board, shareholders, advisers 
and employees. Destiny Pharma was 
one of only two biotech companies to 
list in London in 2017 and it is a great 
credit to the tenacity of the whole 
Destiny Pharma team, and the 
potential value in the novel drug 
development pipeline, that Destiny 
Pharma secured the listing. At the 
same time, Destiny Pharma signed a 
collaboration with China Medical 
Systems (“CMS”) who became a major 
investor and also a key partner in the 
greater China region. On behalf of 
Destiny Pharma, I welcome CMS as an 
investor and partner and also its Board 
representative, Dr Huaizheng Peng, 
who is a strong addition to the Destiny 
Pharma Board.
Destiny Pharma is now well placed to 
continue the clinical development of 
its lead asset into Phase 2 studies and 
will also look at opportunities to 
collaborate and develop its earlier 
assets. There is clearly a global need 
for new anti-infective drugs that are 
effective and reduce the growing 
danger of antimicrobial resistance 
(“AMR”). Destiny Pharma is committed 
to continue working to address this 
significant market need. 
The Board of Destiny Pharma would 
particularly like to thank the new and 
existing investors who supported the 
IPO funding and continue to support 
Destiny Pharma as a newly quoted 
company. I would also like to thank our 
employees for their ongoing efforts 
to ensure that Destiny Pharma delivers 
its IPO strategy. Together with the 
Board, we are all committed to 
building a valuable drug development 
company. We are looking forward to 
2018 and are confident in the outlook 
for Destiny Pharma plc.
