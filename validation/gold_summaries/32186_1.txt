Group Chief Executive’s statement
Overview
Building on our record of sustained progress 
over recent years, Group revenue for the 
year increased by 15.0% to £271.2m 
(2016: £235.9m) and by 10.6% on a 
constant currency basis. Group operating 
profit was £16.8m compared to £16.7m in 
the prior year.
Our performance in the UK in the second 
half of the year was in marked contrast 
to the first half, with like for like revenue 
(excluding revenues from Abode entirely 
and Croydex for quarter one) up 8.8% in the 
second half having been down by 5.0% 
in the first half against the comparative 
period. The first six months were extremely 
challenging, particularly in the retail sector, 
reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the 
implications of the EU referendum. I am 
pleased that our UK businesses recovered 
well in the second half of the year and were 
able to capitalise on the more stable trading 
environment, delivering growth in all of 
our key segments of retail, trade and 
export. UK revenue for the year at £182.3m 
(2016: £163.0m) was 11.8% ahead of the 
prior year and 2.0% higher on a like for like 
basis. The like for like increase mainly 
reflected the success of the recent 
acquisitions, Vado and Croydex, partly 
offset by the more challenging trading 
environment experienced by Triton in the 
first half of the year. UK underlying operating 
profit for the year was £0.2m higher than 
the prior year at £17.4m (2016: £17.2m) with 
an underlying operating margin of 9.5% 
(2016: 10.6%). The modest improvement in 
profitability in the year mainly reflected the 
first‑ time contribution from Abode and a 
full year of trading at Croydex partly offset 
by lower contributions from Johnson Tiles 
and Triton, reflecting lower revenues than 
the previous year. 
Our South African business continued the 
sustained progress of recent years with 
another year of strong growth. The 
combination of market share gain and the 
appreciation of the Rand against Sterling 
during the year resulted in reported revenue 
21.9% ahead of the prior year at £88.9m 
(2016: £72.9m). On a constant currency basis 
revenue was 8.3% higher than last year. 
Underlying operating profit for the year 
increased by 56% to £6.4m (2016: £4.1m), 
including a £0.9m benefit from the stronger 
Rand. This performance reflected the 
business‑ wide progress, particularly 
in operating efficiencies, procurement 
and supply chain management, with 
improvements made by all three businesses. 
The return on sales was 7.2% (2016: 5.6%), 
a considerable improvement on last year. 
In Johnson Tiles SA, the launch of new 
product ranges coupled with further 
manufacturing efficiencies resulted in an 
underlying operating profit ahead of last 
year. In TAL, further sales growth and 
focus on input costs, plant efficiency and 
logistics resulted in increased profitability. 
In Tile Africa, the enhanced store experience 
and success of the in‑ stock and on‑ display 
programme contributed towards a superior 
financial performance.
The Group sources a significant element 
of its components and raw materials from 
China and Europe. Following the UK’s vote 
to leave the European Union there was a 
substantial weakening of Sterling against 
the US Dollar and the Euro. In the year, 
the Group was largely protected from the 
impact of this devaluation of Sterling on 
its cost base through its currency hedging 
strategy. In addition, during the year, the 
Group actioned a series of measures to 
protect the future profitability of the business 
including a combination of effective 
purchasing, working with our suppliers, 
price management and cost reduction 
programmes and we are confident that 
these actions will mitigate the currency 
impact in 2017. 
Group underlying operating profit at £23.8m 
(2016: £21.3m) was 11.7% higher than the 
prior year, with Group underlying operating 
margins broadly consistent with last year 
at 8.8% (2016: 9.0%). Underlying operating 
cash flow improved considerably to £29.8m 
(2016: £20.4m) reflecting the improved 
underlying operating profit and strong 
working capital management. This resulted 
in net debt falling by £9.3m to £23.2m 
(2016: £32.5m), and leverage of 0.8 times 
underlying EBITDA (2016: 1.2 times). The 
Group is in a strong financial position with 
funding through a £100m unsecured debt 
facility (including a £30m accordion) available 
until July 2019, leaving the Group well placed 
to capitalise on opportunities as they arise.
Strategy
In 2013, the Board established three strategic 
targets: to double Group revenue to £420m 
by 2018; to maintain revenue derived outside 
of the UK at approximately 50% of Group 
revenue; and to sustain a pre‑ tax return on 
underlying capital employed of 12% to 15% 
over the economic cycle. We have again 
made good progress in the current year 
against all three objectives.
Group revenue in the year increased by 
15.0% to £271.2m. Our progress in relation 
to achieving the Group revenue target of 
£420m by 2018 has been held back by the 
significant depreciation of the Rand/Sterling 
exchange rate since the objective was 
established in 2013. In constant currency 
terms, Group revenue would have been 
£304.0m. The Board recognises that 
achieving the target of £420m by 2018 
remains challenging and accordingly will 
reassess this timeline later in the current 
financial year in light of our progress. 
We nevertheless remain committed to 
this revenue target. 
Group underlying operating 
profit at £23.8m (2016: £21.3m) 
was 11.7% higher than the prior 
year, with Group underlying 
operating margins broadly 
consistent with last year at 
8.8% (2016: 9.0%).”

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
On a Sterling reported basis, Group revenue 
derived outside of the UK was 42.8% (2016: 
41.6%). Similarly, our progress in relation to 
this strategic target of 50% of Group revenue 
to be derived outside of the UK has also 
been impacted by the significant depreciation 
of the Rand/Sterling exchange rate since 
2013. In constant currency terms, we are 
in line with our target at 49% and remain 
focused on growing our current overseas 
markets and developing new ones to 
support this important strategic intent. 
As part of its growth strategy the Group has 
acquired three material and complementary 
businesses in the last four years. Vado, 
which was acquired in March 2013, has 
been an outstanding success with revenue 
growth of 10.4% per annum and underlying 
operating profits growing 18.0% per annum 
since acquisition. Croydex, acquired in June 
2015, has also delivered strong like for like 
revenue and underlying profit growth since 
its acquisition. Abode, which has only been 
part of the Group for twelve months, has 
grown revenue by 5.0% and recorded profits 
in line with our expectations and, like Croydex 
and Vado, has been seamlessly integrated 
into the Group. 
Along with our existing business portfolio 
all the recently acquired businesses have 
strongly contributed towards the Group 
achieving an underlying return on capital 
employed of 18.4% (2016: 18.3%), which is 
ahead of our strategic target. 
Our track record in acquiring quality 
businesses in our targeted sectors and 
geographies, and our skill in seamlessly 
integrating them into the Group and 
further developing them, together with 
our growing pipeline of opportunities 
gives me confidence that we will continue 
to successfully execute our acquisition 
growth strategy. I am also encouraged by 
the growing number of synergies and organic 
growth opportunities being progressed 
throughout the expanded Group.
Summary and outlook
The Group has continued to make good 
progress towards its strategic targets during 
the year. Whilst the UK market remains 
uncertain as the ramifications resulting from 
the UK’s vote to leave the EU begin to unfold, 
I am confident that our UK business is more 
resilient and better placed to capture further 
growth opportunities as they arise. Our South 
African business has continued to deliver 
sustainable growth, and, notwithstanding the 
recent political unrest, the medium‑ term 
outlook in South Africa remains positive, 
providing opportunities for the Group to 
continue to grow its market share. With our 
leading market positions, portfolio of strong 
brands, continued new product investment, 
strong financial position and self‑ help 
initiatives focused on market share gain and 
operational improvement, the Board remains 
confident that the Group should continue to 
make further progress for the year ending 
31 March 2018.

CASE STUDY – ABODE
Berkeley Homes: 
Vista, Chelsea Bridge
THE CHALLENGE
The challenge from Berkeley Homes to Leicht Kitchens 
was to supply a high quality, WRAS (Water Regulations 
Advisory Scheme) approved, kitchen tap. The brief was 
for a “designer model” of a square, cubic design to 
complement the on-trend, modern handle-less 
kitchen units being installed into this luxurious, top 
end development.
THE SOLUTION
The tap offered was the Abode New Media tap, available 
in four up-to-date colour finishes. This creatively 
designed model has the modern cubic design lines 
asked for, featuring a large square base, a rotating 
planate spout with integrated aerator and easy to use 
minimalist handle, which stands proud either on the 
sink or on the worktop, when installed. The tap finishes 
available were Chrome, Brushed Nickel, Granite Black 
and Gloss White. The specification was to co-ordinate 
with other appliances being fitted within the very 
modern kitchens. As a result, Abode’s AT1180 in the 
Chrome finish was chosen.
THE RESULT
Leicht Kitchens took delivery of 140 New Media taps.
Since gaining this contract, Abode has quoted the 
same tap plus a selection of other products from the 
Abode portfolio to additional regions of Berkeley Homes 
(Eastern Counties and South East London). Additionally, 
the two major kitchen suppliers to these two regions 
have quoted Abode products (taps and sinks) for all 
their London contract business, establishing Abode 
within this important and growing sector.
