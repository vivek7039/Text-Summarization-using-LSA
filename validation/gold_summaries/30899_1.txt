These strong results demonstrate the 
transformation being delivered by the 
Build to Last programme. Today, Balfour 
Beatty is well placed to drive sustainable 
proﬁtable growth, underpinned by a strong 
balance sheet. It has strength and depth 
in leadership, a new, positive culture is 
being embedded and the business is well 
positioned in each of its chosen markets.
The Group reported an underlying proﬁt 
from operations (PFO) of £196 million 
(2016: £69 million) driven by material year-
on-year improvements in all earnings-based 
businesses. Both Support Services and 
US Construction reported PFO margins 
in the range of industry-standard margins. 
UK Construction continues on its positive 
trend, with a proﬁt from operations of 
£16 million (2016: £65 million loss).
The Group is on track to achieve industry-
standard margins in all of its earnings-
based businesses in the second half of 
2018 as it continues to drive three key 
levers for improved ﬁnancial performance: 
ﬁnalising the remaining historical contracts 
through to completion; reducing costs and 
raising productivity across its operations; 
and executing on the improved quality of 
the order book.
Cash remains the Group’s focus and 
ultimately the most important barometer of 
ﬁnancial performance. During the year, the 
Group had average net cash of £42 million 
(2016: £46 million net debt); at year end, 
the Group had net cash of £335 million 
(2016: £173 million). The year end ﬁgure 
includes £103 million received from the 
sale of a 12.5% stake in Connect Plus, 
the company which operates the M25 
London orbital motorway. The Directors’ 
valuation of the Investments portfolio 
has remained unchanged at £1.2 billion 
(2016: £1.2 billion), despite the Connect 
Plus M25 partial disposal, as a result of the 
continuing strong market for secondary 
infrastructure assets and the recent 
favourable changes in US tax regulations. 
The sale of a further 7.5% stake in the 
M25, for £62 million, was agreed on 
29 December 2017, although the cash 
was not received until 2018.
Balfour Beatty’s net cash position and 
the value of the Investments portfolio 
underline the ongoing strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet and place it in a 
strong position to further pay down gross 
borrowings in 2018. 
The order book decreased by 8% to 
£11.4 billion (2016: £12.4 billion), down 
3% at CER compared to prior year, and 
is directly in line with the order book at 
30 June 2017. The reduction is a result 
of the Group’s stated policy of selective 
bidding at appropriate terms for those 
projects best aligned with its capabilities. 
The business increased bid margin 
thresholds and focused on projects where 
Balfour Beatty’s capabilities can deliver 
value, coupled with a lower risk proﬁle, 
so that the Group wins work at appropriate 
terms and conditions.
Additionally, the order book does not yet 
include work won in two-stage design and 
build contracts, such as work awarded 
to Balfour Beatty’s 50:50 joint venture 
(Balfour Beatty VINCI) for two major 
civils packages, Lots N1 and N2, for 
the UK’s new high speed railway (HS2) 
valued at £2.5 billion. This type of work 
is characteristic of the strong pipeline 
of infrastructure projects in the Group’s 
chosen markets and aligns with its 
balanced attitude to risk and reward.
Consistent with the strategy to simplify 
the Group and focus on markets and 
geographies where it has a competitive 
advantage, Balfour Beatty exited the 
Middle East with the sale of its entire 
interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty and 
BK Gulf for £11 million. Both businesses 
were sold without future liabilities to 
the joint venture partner. Additionally, 
Heery International, a full-service US 
engineering and programme management, 
architecture and interior design ﬁrm, was 
sold for US$57 million, eliminating potential 
conﬂicts of interest with Balfour Beatty’s 
US Construction business.
Since the start of 2015, Balfour Beatty 
has also exited Indonesia and Australia. 
In Canada, following the imminent 
completion of the BC Children’s and BC 
Women’s hospitals in Vancouver, it now 
only holds Investments assets. 
With these moves, the Group is now able 
to maximise its strengths in its chosen 
markets in the UK & Ireland, US and 
Far East. 
Balfour Beatty is increasingly building its 
business model on a foundation of deep 
capability underpinned by risk reduction. 
This means focusing on speciﬁc markets 
with inherent growth, where Balfour Beatty 
has the right expertise to command market 
leading margins, while ensuring it deploys 
the governance and transparency to price 
contractual risk appropriately and manage 
project execution closely.
