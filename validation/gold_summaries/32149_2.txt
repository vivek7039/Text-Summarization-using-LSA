(1)  Underlying earnings are presented alongside statutory results as the Directors believe they provide a 
more useful comparison on business trends and performance. Note 6 to the financial statements provides 
more detail on non-underlying items.
(2) Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation (EBITDA) and non-underlying items, adjusted to 
include IFRIC 12 interest receivable and share of joint venture EBITDA better reflects all the earnings 
arising from our ERFs (see reconciliation on page 40).
