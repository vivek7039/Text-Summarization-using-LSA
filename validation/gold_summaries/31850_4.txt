A more diverse  
customer base
GREENVALE AP
Greenvale traded successfully 
through a less stable year 
characterised by lower yielding crops 
and higher raw material prices. 
However new business wins during 
the year and continued investment in 
the new ERP system see the business 
well positioned for future growth. 
Greenvale AP (GVAP) is a unique vertically integrated 
business. This starts with our seed variety and 
development programme and also includes our 
seed potato business and our own growing potato 
operations in Perthshire, the Scottish Borders and 
the Eastern Counties, making us the biggest grower 
of fresh table potatoes in the UK. GVAP procures 
from 200 growers in the UK, most of whom we 
supply seed to, and along with the potatoes from 
our own growing operations provide our pack sites 
with the material to store, manage and pack for our 
key customer base 364 days of the year.
