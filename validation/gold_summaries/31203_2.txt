Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
Face-to-face
By phone
Online
Every adult should have access to credit  
they can afford to repay – we help 
consumers that are either unable  
or unwilling to borrow from mainstream 
financial institutions.
Customer  
touch points
Unlike most of our competitors, 
when lending direct we aim  
to meet all our customers 
face-to-face. The quality of our 
customer relationships and how 
we manage them are key drivers 
of our long-term success.
Online/by phone
Our first point of contact is often by 
phone or online when we confirm the 
customer’s details and start the loan 
application process.
Face-to-face
In branch-based lending and home 
credit, meeting the customer face-to-
face is an important part of our 
lending process.
Branch-based lending
Everyday Loans
The UK’s largest branch-based 
provider of unsecured loans  
to sub-prime borrowers.
Guarantor loans

The clear number two player in  
a fast-growing market.
