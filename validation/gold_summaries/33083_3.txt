Intu Properties plc – Annual Report 2014 
intugroup.co.uk
I
hope that after studying this report 
you will be pleased – as I am – at the 
way the business and the reputation 
of the Group has moved forward 
through 2014, positioning ourselves to 
take full advantage of the recovery in 
the economy .
Overview of 2014 activity
In the course of the year under review , we 
acquired two top UK shopping centres, 
intu Merry Hill and intu Derby . This takes 
our ownership to nine of the top 20 
shopping centres in the UK. Both of these 
centres have enormous potential and we 
are already seeing the benefits of our asset 
management as rental values and market 
values have increased significantly in our 
eight months of ownership.
And in Spain, we announced the acquisition 
of a top shopping centre, Puerto Venecia 
in Zaragoza, which completed in January 
2015. This demonstrates the seriousness 
of our intent to grow our business there. 
The centre will be a model for creating 
high-quality shopping resorts at our 
Spanish development options.
We have completed a two-year 
programme for refinancing the majority 
of the Group’s debt. Throughout this 
period we have increased the tenor and 
reduced the average cost of our debt. 
This strengthening of our financial position 
means that we are well placed to advance 
our development pipeline.
2014 also saw us complete the food court 
redevelopment at intu Lakeside and the 
transformation of the malls at intu Eldon 
Square. In addition, we commenced two 
major catering and leisure projects at intu 
Victoria Centre and intu Potteries and we 
have moved the major extension at intu 
W atford forward to the point where we 
intend to commence the development 
in 2015.
Our branding, now two years old, is gaining 
significant traction, the result of a fruitful 
combination of the customer service in 
our centres and our digital platform. In our 
centres we introduced T ell intu allowing us 
to meet customers’ changing requirements 
faster . Customer satisfaction has improved 
measurably since its introduction. Digitally , 
we now have the majority of our major 
retailers on our website, intu.co.uk, with 
the likes of John Lewis, Next and T opshop 
added this year . As well as half of the UK’s 
population visiting an intu centre at some 
point in the year , we now have nearly two 
million individuals on our online database.
Through all these actions, as well as the 
groundwork in previous years, we have 
delivered a total shareholder return of 
24 per cent in 2014.
May I refer you to the interview with our 
Chief Executive on pages 16 and 17 where 
David Fischel answers a number of key 
questions about the business and to the 
financial review presented by our Chief 
Financial Officer , Matthew Roberts, on 
pages 40 to 46, where you will find a more 
detailed assessment of our achievements, 
our challenges and our strategy .

Dividends
Y our Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 9.1 pence per share, bringing 
the amount paid and payable in respect 
of 2014 to 13.7 pence, unchanged from 
the bonus factor adjusted 2013 dividend. 
A scrip dividend alternative will be offered.
Looking forward
Over the last few years we have positioned 
ourselves for the upturn in the economy . 
I believe we are now beginning to see 
sustained, though small, improvements in 
disposable income, generally responding to 
wage increases running ahead of inflation 
and lower fuel prices. Uncertainties and 
fragility remain, and this is not confined 
just to the economic sphere: some 
measure of caution is still therefore 
desirable. Retailers have also had a good 
end to 2014, which along with improved 
consumer confidence should see them 
growing their businesses.
Through the enhancements we have been 
making to our centres, in terms of the retail 
and leisure mix, our world class customer 
service and our digital platform, we are 
well placed to deliver a favourable trading 
environment for retailers.
We will continue to build our business in 
Spain, driving our developments there 
forward to replicate our successful 
UK model. 
We remain focused on delivering strong 
returns over the medium term through 
rental growth in our existing assets, 
superior returns from our development 
pipeline and the increasing strength of 
our brand.

Corporate responsibility
Our centres make an important 
contribution to their local neighbourhood 
both because of their location and our 
close and necessary engagement with the 
communities around us. Responding to our 
corporate responsibility is an integral part 
of our commercial life through community , 
environmental and stakeholder initiatives.
Our success in this field has been 
validated by the achievement of several 
high-profile awards. We once again 
achieved the Business in the Community 
CommunityMark award, one of only 52 
companies to be accredited. This year 
we were awarded the ‘Best in continuing 
Carbon Reduction’ at the Carbon T rust 
Standard Bearers Awards, for decreasing 
our carbon emissions by 30 per cent in 
three years. Y ou can read more about this 
amazing achievement on page 51.
Throughout the year we have run projects 
encouraging and supporting employee 
mentoring and volunteering. 
Our people
I would like to record my thanks to the 
Board and, with my fellow Directors, our 
thanks to all our staff for their commitment 
and dedication to intu’s values and vision in 
the year .
The creation of intu Retail Services in 
2013 has led to a greater sense of unity 
within the Group and in 2014 we have not 
neglected to ensure that all our staff have 
the right skills and training for their roles. 
Through these endeavours we have seen a 
more motivated and committed workforce, 
with a dramatic reduction in staff who 
leave within their first year of service.
I am glad to report that our approach was 
recognised when we received the Premises 
& Facilities Management Partner in Retail 
Facilities award this year . We are the only 
shopping centre business to be accredited 
by the Institute of Customer Service.
