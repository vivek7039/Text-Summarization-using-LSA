STRATEGIC REPORT
 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
 REVIEW 
 “Our focus on the customer drives 
every decision that we take in the 
business, from the hotels that we 
sell every season and the service 
promises that we make, through to 
the destinations we fly to. But it 
also determines the big decisions 
that we take about the business 
we want to be in the future.”
PETER FANKHAUSER
CEO
2017 has been a good year for Thomas 
Cook. The actions we took on strategy 
in the last 12 months have transformed 
the scale of the opportunity ahead 
for the Group while at the same time 
delivering strong growth in demand, 
as more customers from across our 
markets chose our modern package 
and flight offer for their hard-earned 
weeks in the sun.
The very deliberate decision that we 
made two years ago to put the customer 
back at the heart of our business is now 
bearing fruit. Strong customer demand 
for our improved holiday offering helped 
increase revenues by 9 per cent in the year. 
This combined with an improved performance 
in our German Airline, Condor, to deliver an 
underlying operating profit of £330 million, 
an 8 per cent increase year-on-year. That we 
achieved this growth in a highly competitive 
environment shows how much more resilient 
we are as a business than even a few 
years ago.
Most importantly, we know that customers’ 
experience of their holidays with Thomas 
Cook is getting better all the time. Our Net 
Promoter Score – or NPS – which is the 
primary indicator of customer satisfaction 
and the metric we look at before anything 
else, has increased by nine points over 
the last two years. This reflects continued 
growth in every one of our significant 
markets in 2017.
Our focus on the customer drives every 
decision that we take in the business, from 
the hotels that we sell every season and 
the service promises that we make, through 
to the destinations we fly to. But it also 
determines the big decisions that we take 
about the business we want to be in the 
future. It is perhaps there that we have made 
the most progress in the past 12 months. THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11
STRATEGIC REPORT
TRANSFORMING OUR 
OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH
The strategic alliance that we signed in 
September with Expedia, outsourcing 
our city and domestic hotels business 
and using Expedia technology, will 
transform the way in which we work. 
By attracting one of the best operators 
in the travel industry, we will be able to 
offer a much greater choice to customers, 
at lower cost and complexity to us. This, 
in turn, will allow us to focus on holidays 
to our own-brand and selected partner 
hotels in sun & beach destinations where 
we know we can really set ourselves 
apart from the competition. 
Our partnership with LMEY reinforces 
that strategy, paving the way for the 
creation of a joint hotel investment 
platform which will enable us to super-
charge our portfolio of own-brand 
hotels and resorts. 
This will give customers an even greater 
choice of high-quality hotels to suit 
their needs, hotels that are unique to 
Thomas Cook, and achieve higher levels 
of customer satisfaction and earn better 
margins than the portfolio average. 
Another example of a successful 
partnership is Thomas Cook China, our 
joint venture with Fosun, which is growing 
fast in a rapidly expanding market, 
taking 20,000 bookings in its first year 
of operations. Our focus on developing 
strong partnerships with big technology-
led players in the Chinese market, like 
Alibaba, gives us access to a big customer 
base, while our tailored holiday offering 
means we can differentiate ourselves in 
a competitive environment.
Meanwhile, the launch of Thomas Cook 
Money builds on our long heritage in 
financial services to offer customers across 
our source markets new and simpler ways 
to plan, save, borrow and spend their 
holiday money, all supported by innovative, 
easy-to-use technology.
Each of these developments represent 
an important step forward in delivering 
our strategy for profitable growth. 
Taken together, they transform the 
opportunity ahead for the Group. 
CARE
Of course, the big strategic moves are only 
relevant if we continue to do all we can to 
ensure that every customer has the best 
experience on holiday with Thomas Cook. 
It is here where I believe that we have the 
biggest opportunity to differentiate our 
holidays from the competition – in the care 
and the reassurance that we provide. 
In the last year, we have extended our 
24-Hour Hotel Satisfaction Promise to more 
than 2,000 hotels, giving 80% of customers 
who book a sun & beach holiday with 
Thomas Cook the reassurance that if a hotel 
is not as we described it, we will sort out 
the issue or offer to move the customer 
to another hotel of the same standard 
within 24 hours. This represented a bold 
move when we introduced it for summer 
2016, one which is now paying off with 
customer satisfaction on average 12 points 
higher in those hotels with the 24-Hour 
Hotel Satisfaction Promise than the rest 
of the portfolio.
We continue to innovate to broaden our 
appeal – and increase customers’ ability 
to personalise their holiday – with the 
launch of a ‘Choose Your Room’ option. 
Available in 300 of our core hotels for 
summer 2018, this is another industry first 
for a ‘traditional’ tour operating business 
and shows how we are evolving to capture 
greater opportunities.
Another area where we have made big 
changes is in the way in which we talk 
about risk to customers. We operate in a 
market where disruption, whether from 
natural disaster, political changes or terror 
attacks, can affect many of our customers 
and our operations. We are not a security 
company but we know that what we can 
do is to be as transparent as possible about 
potential risks – whether that’s through 
customer-friendly blogs or clear links to 
the latest government advice – so that 
the customer can make up their own mind 
about whether to travel. I am proud of how 
far we have come. STRATEGIC REPORT
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12
We have also taken a leading role in 
bringing the industry together on the issue 
of health and safety. In September, the Safer 
Tourism Foundation, the independent charity we 
set up with Sharon Wood, the mother of Christi 
and Bobby Shepherd, launched a pledge which 
articulates a new approach to customer health 
and safety within the industry. This has already 
been signed by seven major travel companies 
in a move that we believe will promote greater 
collaboration to achieve practical change for 
the benefit of all customers.
In our UK business, we have faced a specific 
issue this year related to a dramatic surge in 
illness compensation claims, many of which 
we believe to be fraudulent. Our presence in 
destination through our resort teams and our 
rigorous focus on hotel quality means we are 
continually improving standards and can take 
care of those who fall ill, but we must also 
protect our customers from dishonest illness 
claims which threaten the price and availability 
of all-inclusive holidays. We have made good 
progress highlighting these false claims in 
the courts, in the media and to government, 
which we hope will lead to substantive 
changes in legislation, including the way 
the claims industry is regulated, in time for 
summer next year.
We know that our approach to care needs also 
to encompass the wider environment in which 
we operate, at home and abroad. To this end, 
this year we introduced a new animal welfare 
policy, becoming the first major travel company 
to commit to remove from sale any animal 
attraction that is found not to be fully compliant 
with the ABTA Global Welfare Guidance for 
Animals in Tourism. This is a bold step which 
demonstrates our commitment to change.
CONTACT
Our customer focus also extends to 
developing direct contact with customers 
in order to strengthen our relationships 
and provide more personalised services. 
This starts with providing rich, inspirational 
content on our websites and this year we’ve 
added over 110,000 images and 1,200 room 
plans to better engage our customers. 
The investment we’ve made in our websites 
has helped grow our online bookings with 
the strongest growth in the UK, up 27 per 
cent in 2017. Across the Group, we now 
achieve 46 per cent of all sales via the web, 
up three percentage points on last year. 
In this context, we continue to reshape our 
retail store network to ensure we are well-
positioned to meet the changing customer 
needs. In the UK, the Co-operative’s exit from 
our retail joint venture has enabled us to 
take full control of our store portfolio, and 
in Germany, we’ve signed 92 new agency 
agreements to increase the proportion of 
direct sales.
OWN-BRAND HOTELS AND 
RESORTS AND SELECTED 
PARTNER HOTELS
Of course, the other area where we can 
genuinely differentiate ourselves is in the 
holidays we offer and, most importantly, our 
ability to provide customers with holidays 
that are unique to Thomas Cook. To this end, 
we have gradually been streamlining our 
portfolio of hotels to focus the majority of our 
business on 3,000 properties where we know 
we can have a higher degree of influence 
over the quality and service standards.
Our own-brand hotels and resorts are central 
to the success of this strategy. These enable 
us to provide customers with a consistent 
and high-quality holiday, whatever their needs, 
delivering higher satisfaction scores and 
higher margins than the portfolio average. 
With the arrival this year of Ingo Burmester, 
who ran the successful Robinson brand for 
TUI, we are now building a hotel management 
company inside Thomas Cook under his 
leadership, with the aim of growing the size 
of the portfolio and strengthening our brands. 
We made further progress in the year with 
11 new openings in summer 2017, including 
our second Casa Cook in Kos and a new 
Sunwing Ocean Beach Club in Cyprus. 
We also added a seventh brand to the 
portfolio in the form of Aldiana, the premium 
club-based activity format, through an 
acquisition of a 42 per cent stake in the 
business as part of a wider partnership 
agreement with LMEY. At the same time, 
we have continued to rigorously manage 
the portfolio for quality, removing hotels 
where they don’t meet our standards. I feel 
very optimistic about the future growth 
prospects for this part of our business in 
the coming year as we work to identify 
new properties and build up our pipeline.
AIRLINE
Another element of our holiday offering where 
I feel optimistic is our airline. Over the last four 
years, and in a very competitive market, we’ve 
transformed it from four essentially separate 
airlines whose primary task was to transport 
our tour operator customers, to one airline 
group with an increasingly successful seat-
only business, particularly on long-haul routes, 
and its own distribution channels. In doing so, 
we have created Europe’s third-largest airline 
to sun & beach destinations which competes 
wing-to-wing with the low-cost carriers, 
and Europe’s sixth-largest long-haul carrier 
with an expanding range of destinations 
and a compelling customer offer.
We have now formalised the work Management 
has undertaken to create one Group airline, 
by separating its reporting and legal structure. 
This is the logical next step which reflects the 
way we think about the airline business within 
the Group; from our airline being the primary 
transport for the tour operator to becoming 
a leisure airline in its own right, with its own 
commercial relationships, distribution channels 
and growth targets – while sharing the Group’s 
absolute focus on giving our customers the 
best possible experience of Thomas Cook. 
PARTNERSHIPS
We are very clear in our strategy for profitable 
growth that we will focus our attention and 
resources on a number of key areas where 
we can genuinely be different from the 
competition. This approach is complemented 
by a series of partnerships which enable us to 
streamline our operations, while also tapping 
into opportunities for growth. 
The strategic alliance with Expedia agreed at 
the end of this year to outsource our city and 
domestic hotel business, while harnessing their 
technology for our hotel-only offering, is the 
most significant of those partnerships agreed 
during the year. This, combined with the deal 
we agreed in 2016 to outsource the sun & beach 
hotels which sit outside of our core portfolio 
to Webjet, completes our complementary hotel 
strategy and positions us for growth in this area 
of the business at the lowest possible cost.
However, we also made good progress in Thomas 
Cook China, a joint venture with Fosun launched 
September 2016. A full-service travel company, in a 
fast-expanding market, our China business booked 
20,000 customers in its first year. Our ambition 
in 2018 is to grow that number tenfold.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
CONTINUED THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 13
STRATEGIC REPORT
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES
The strategy we are executing sets out a 
clear path to profitable growth. But it also 
results in a business which is much simpler 
with a leaner organisational structure. We’re 
working to remove duplication from across 
the business and to align processes to fit 
the new shape of Thomas Cook. 
In this respect, the new strategic alliance 
with Expedia, and the execution of the 
Webjet agreement, effectively outsourcing 
our complementary business, is a catalyst 
for the next stage in the transformation of 
the business. I believe it will enable us to 
realise significant cost savings and remove 
further layers of complexity in our systems 
and processes. 
CONCLUSION
In summary, Thomas Cook has made 
significant progress in 2017. We operate in an 
industry that is constantly changing, impacted 
by events that are often unpredictable and 
regularly beyond our control. The companies 
that succeed are those that are operationally 
flexible and which can anticipate shifts in 
customer demand.
The fact that we have successfully managed 
through a competitive environment while 
at the same time taking big decisions that 
will strengthen our position for the future is 
testament to the hard work and engagement 
of our 22,000 people around the globe. They are 
the ones that make this company different, 
focusing on every detail to make our customers’ 
experience of our holidays even better. 
Looking across the Group, I see real 
momentum behind our strategy for 
profitable growth. The actions we have 
taken in the last 12 months accelerate the 
transformation of Thomas Cook into a truly 
modern, streamlined travel company with 
the customer at the heart of everything that 
we do – for the benefit of our customers, 
our people and our Shareholders.
