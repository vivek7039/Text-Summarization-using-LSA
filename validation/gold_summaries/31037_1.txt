 Chief Executive’s Review

Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 06
Although Europe is not currently an important market 
for d
2
w, we note that the EU Commission have taken an 
interest in oxo-biodegradable plastic and have asked the 
European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) to consider its 
environmental credentials. The Commission do not as 
yet understand that the purpose of oxo-biodegradable 
technology is not to produce microplastics but to ensure 
that if plastic does fragment in the open environment 
it will convert much more quickly into biodegradable 
materials. We therefore welcome the reference to 
ECHA. Symphony and the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics 
Association will be assisting ECHA with all necessary 
technical information, but we do not expect any 
conclusions for some time. 
The EU has been slow to realise the importance of this 
issue, as countries in the Middle East and other parts 
of the world have already legislated to require the use 
of oxo-biodegradable technology. These countries 
want plastic fragments to be dealt with quickly and 
automatically, and not to be left as a problem for  
future generations. 
In Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Standards, Metrology and 
Quality Organisation (“SASO”) started enforcing 
legislation requiring the use of oxo-biodegradable 
plastic for a range of locally manufactured and imported 
plastic products including carrier bags, packaging  
films and agricultural films. Symphony was the first 
company to be awarded the SASO Quality Mark for 
its d
2
w oxo-biodegradable additives and to achieve 
authorised-supplier status for the Saudi Arabian market.
This year saw the completion of two R&D projects for 
d
2
p; being anti-microbial household gloves and plastic 
water pipes. The anti-microbial gloves were launched 
into Wilko in the UK, and into several Italian retail outlets. 
An initial order was also received from the Middle East. 
As previously reported, we have many customer-led  
d
2
p development projects, with applications including 
anti-microbials, insecticide, flame retardant, odour  
and moisture adsorbers, rodent repellents and  
corrosion inhibitors.
Trading results
Group revenues increased by 21.6% to £8.27 million 
from £6.80 million in 2016. Gross profit margins slightly 
decreased to 48.5% from 50.1% in 2016. As a result, the 
contribution from gross profit increased by 17.8% to 
£4.01 million from £3.41 million in 2016. The majority of 
our revenues derive from d
2
w and are earned mainly 
outside of the EU and the United States.
Costs increased by 6.9% to £3.30 million (2016: 
£3.10 million) due mainly to increased investment in 
R&D, lobbying and marketing, with associated travel 
expenditure into our key operating markets. The  
Group expensed R&D costs of £625,000 in 2017  
(2016: £514,000).
EBITDA before R&D is a key metric for the Board, and it 
increased by 57.9% to £1.20 million (2016: £0.76 million), 
showing the underlying profitability of the business 
as it has moved from a net debt position to a net cash 
position, and its new technologies continue to  
be commercialised.
EXPANDING 
OUR PRODUCT 
OFFERING
I am pleased to report that the 
year under review saw a continued 
improvement in the Group’s 
financial performance. Our strategy 
throughout the year was to engage 
with governments, NGOs and media 
globally, explaining to them the 
benefits of using our growing range 
of technologies, and in particular, d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable plastic, which 
can help to resolve the problem of 
persistent plastic pollution. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  |  www.symphonyenvironmental.com 07
During the second half of the year the Company 
completed a capital reduction, which eliminated £3.61 
million of share premium by transferring this to the 
credit of retained earnings. Together with the results for 
the year, the Group’s retained earnings were £67,000 
(2016: deficit £3.97 million) with Company retained 
earnings of £1.13 million (2016: deficit £2.71 million).
The Board has considered the possible effects of Brexit 
on the business and due to its global operations, is 
comfortable that this should not significantly affect  
the Group’s future prospects. 
Outlook
We expect to see an improving business environment 
where more countries legislate in favour of our type of 
technology, and with better enforcement in countries 
where legislation has already been passed.
The desire to find a solution to the plastics problem, and 
in particular microplastics, has reached tipping point. Our 
technology is proven, viable and does not significantly 
increase cost or disrupt the supply chain. This should 
make our entry into new markets and with new 
customers much easier than for disruptive technologies. 
Our strategy for 2018 is to drive sales through an 
increased level of communications on a global scale, 
increasing our social media presence, together with 
media campaigns, lobbying and direct selling. We will 
announce these to the market at the relevant times.
We will continue with our R&D programme and maintain 
progress in commercialising our technologies including, 
at the earliest opportunity, our d
2
p projects, some of 
which require regulatory clearances, and some require 
the completion of customer-led product trials.
I would also like to thank all the staff at Symphony and 
our extended family of distributors for their hard and 
effective work and their continued commitment to the 
Symphony vision of being world leaders in “making 
plastic smarter” technologies and products.

Chief Executive Officer 
EBITDA before R&D is calculated as follows:
Due to the operational gearing of the Group, operating 
profit increased by 229.7% to £0.48 million from £0.15 
million in 2016. This resulted in a 249.6% increase in profit 
before tax of £0.43 million (2016: profit £0.12 million). 
The Group therefore reports a profit after tax for 2017 
of £0.43 million (2016: profit £0.17 million) with basic 
earnings per share of 0.28 pence (2016: 0.11 pence). 
The Group’s primary selling-currency is the US 
Dollar and therefore a strong dollar against sterling 
is beneficial for the Group. The Group self-hedges by 
purchasing goods in US Dollars, and utilises forward 
rate agreements to minimise exchange risk. As at 31 
December 2017, the Group had a net balance of US 
Dollar assets totalling $1.08 million (2016: $0.91 million). 
Balance sheet and cash flow
The Group had net cash in the bank of £0.63 million 
at the year-end (2016: net debt of £0.37 million) and 
had generated cash of £1.03 million from operations 
(2016: cash used £0.34 million). This was achieved by 
improving profits as detailed above, together with 
improved payment terms in one of its main markets. 
There was a minimal £2,000 hire purchase debt as at 
the year-end compared to £0.81 million of interest-
bearing debt at the end of 2016. The Group also has, 
if required, a £1.5 million trade finance facility and a 
further £0.50 million working capital facility with HSBC 
Bank. The Board do not envisage any working capital 
constraints as sales increase. 
Revenue increased  
by 21.6% to £8.27 million

In January of 2017 Symphony 
entered the household glove market 
with the launch of the UK’s first d
2
p 
antimicrobial household gloves. This 
innovative product, sold under the 
Protector Health and Hygiene brand, 
had been in development for two 
years prior to the launch in Wilko 
Stores nationwide.
Public awareness and concern about 
harmful bacteria and resistance 
to antibiotics, has generated an 
increase in antimicrobial household 
products, with further sales of 
antimicrobial household gloves 
made with d
2
p technology in Italy, 
Israel and the Middle East. There 
are also more products for 2018, 
including toothbrushes, water 
bottles, cling film and food bags.
Staying with d
2
p – Dadex Eternit 
Ltd in Pakistan, who are one of the 
world leading producers of plastic 
pipes, signed an exclusive five-year 
agreement with Business Dynamics, 
Symphony’s distributor in Pakistan, 
to produce a range of plastic 
pipes made with d
2
p antimicrobial 
technology - ensuring that the pipes 
will be free from the accumulation of 
harmful bacteria and fungi. 
The d
2
p suite of additives increased 
this year, and now includes a 
corrosion inhibitor and a range of 
products specifically designed for 
food packaging which includes an 
oxygen absorber, ethylene adsorber 
and a release agent to prevent food 
sticking to the inside of the plastic. 
In April 2017, the Saudi government 
announced changes to legislation, 
which require manufacturers and 
importers to prove that their plastic 
products are oxo-biodegradable. 
They must use masterbatches which 
have been approved by SASO 
(Saudi Standards, Metrology and 
Quality Organisation). 
Symphony Environmental Ltd were 
the first to be granted a licence by 
SASO under the new regulations 
and we are now working with 
many companies in Saudi Arabia 
and abroad to make sure that their 
products comply with the new rules, 
which cover an extensive list of 
short-life plastic products.
Around the world, the number of 
products benefitting from d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable technology has 
also recently expanded to include 
plastic coffee capsules. These 
capsules were beginning to get a 
bad reputation by accumulating in 
the open environment, so much so 
that the German city of Hamburg 
banned their use completely in 
2016. However – a company in Brazil 
has developed coffee capsules 
made with d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
plastic technology, giving their 
customers great coffee without the 
environmental problem.
Finally, the d
2
w logo pops up in all 
sorts of places as more and more 
companies and organisations are 
realising the benefit of making their 
plastic smarter. An eagle eyed visitor 
on a tour of the Barcelona Football 
stadium was pleasantly surprised to 
find d
2
w on the red tape, used by 
the famous football club to seal off 
areas around the football ground. 
It’s great to know that d
2
w is useful 
even for red-tape.
Riyadh
Saudi government announced changes to legislation, requiring 
manufacturers and importers to prove that their products are 
made with oxo-biodegradable plastic.
