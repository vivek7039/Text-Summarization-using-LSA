  “BAE Systems delivered a 
good performance in 2017 , 
consistent with our 
expectations for the year.”
Charles Woodburn Chief Executive
Introduction
BAE Systems delivered a good performance 
in 2017, consistent with our expectations for 
the year. We are taking the actions necessary 
to address costs and to meet our customers’ 
affordability challenges. Despite economic 
and political uncertainties, governments in 
our major markets continue to prioritise 
defence and security, with strong demand 
for our capabilities. We are investing in our 
business, our people, and in the technology 
and skills we need to drive the business 
forward. With an improving outlook for 
defence budgets in a number of our markets 
and a solid foundation for medium-term 
growth, we are well placed to generate 
good returns for shareholders.
Since taking on the role of Chief Executive, 
I have reiterated that we are a strong company, 
with a number of key advantages, pursuing 
the right strategy.
We have a broad geographic footprint and 
diversified market positions. Importantly, 
our track record of successful partnerships in 
international markets to develop local industry, 
employment and skills is now becoming a key 
requirement to do business in those markets.
We have world-class technologies in the fields 
of electronic warfare, autonomous systems, 
advanced manufacturing, robotics and data 
analytics, and we continue to invest in 
research and development, often alongside 
our customers, to identify and develop 
emerging technologies. The speed of change 
in technology means that we must continually 
build on our technological advantage, and 
attract and retain the right talent in order 
to stay competitive. 
It is important to recognise that in a tough, 
competitive market, we need to become a 
stronger, smarter and sharper organisation 
to win new business and grow, which means 
increasing our focus and efforts in three 
priority areas:
Operational excellence
We have a number of major programmes 
under way on which we are ramping up 
production, so it is vital that we maintain 
our focus on operational excellence by 
delivering for our customers. There is simply 
no better way to highlight our skills and 
capabilities and, therefore, win new business.

Chief Executive’s 
review Our US electronics business delivered good 
operational performance across our core 
franchise positions in the high-technology 
areas of electronic warfare, precision-guided 
munitions, Intelligence, Surveillance and 
Reconnaissance, and electro-optics. 
BAE Systems has sustained its leadership 
position in the US electronic warfare market 
and production is ramping up to execute orders 
across a number of programmes, some of 
which are classified. As the electronic warfare 
system supplier on the F-35 Lightning II 
combat aircraft programme, we are increasing 
production and are well positioned to meet 
further increases in output rates over the 
coming years to meet the requirements 
of both US and international customers. 
On F-15, upgrade programmes are contracted 
and progressing for the US Air Force and 
international customers.
The Group’s US-based combat vehicles 
business is underpinned by programmes for 
the manufacture of Armored Multi-Purpose 
Vehicles and M109A7 self-propelled 
howitzers, and Bradley upgrades which all 
progressed in the year. In the amphibious 
vehicle market, 16 prototypes have been 
delivered to the US Marine Corps under the 
Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 programme. 
We are one of two competitors for this 
programme, with final down-selection 
expected in 2018.
BAE Systems is a leading supplier of ship 
repair services to the US Navy and continues 
to adjust its workforce and facilities to meet 
evolving demand. Additional dry dock capacity 
at our San Diego shipyard became operational 
in February 2017 and accepted its first ship 
during the year. 
Whilst market conditions remain highly 
competitive and continue to evolve, our 
US-based Intelligence & Security business 
is focused on delivering on its contracts 
and maintaining a high level of bid activity.
UK
Defence and security remains a priority for 
the UK government. We expect this to be 
reaffirmed in the National Security Capability 
Review, and in the Modernising Defence 
Programme, which was announced in 
January 2018 by the Defence Secretary. 
Transition arrangements after March 2019 
will be important to enable companies to 
prepare for potential changes in the regulatory 
environment. As there is relatively limited 
UK-EU trading and movement of EU nationals 
into and out of BAE Systems’ UK businesses, 
the resulting Brexit impact on the business is 
likely to be limited, depending on the terms 
of any transition and final agreements for 
the UK’s future relationship with the 
European Union.
We will support the government in achieving 
its aim to ensure that the UK maintains its key 
role in European security and defence 
post-Brexit, and to strengthen bilateral 
relationships with key partners in Europe. This 
will be important for ongoing collaboration in 
the development of defence capabilities.
In December, BAE Systems and the 
Government of Qatar entered into a contract, 
valued at approximately £5bn, for the supply 
of 24 Typhoon aircraft. Alongside supplying 
the aircraft, the agreement provides for the 
supply of ground support to the Qatar 
Armed Forces and delivery of technical and 
pilot training in Qatar. The contract is subject 
to financing conditions and receipt by the 
Group of first payment which are expected 
to be fulfilled no later than mid-2018.
Discussions with current and prospective 
operators of the Typhoon aircraft continue 
to support the Group’s expectations for 
additional Typhoon contract awards. However, 
there can be no certainty as to the timing of 
these orders. 
As a result of reducing production activity 
on Typhoon and Hawk, and also taking into 
account the changes to support requirements 
as the Royal Air Force transitions from Tornado 
to F-35 Lightning II, the business announced 
in October a total proposed headcount 
reduction of up to 1,400 roles over the 
next three years.
Competitiveness
Good progress has been made in making 
the organisation more efficient over the 
last few years, and there are further 
opportunities with procurement and 
enhanced collaboration at the forefront.
Technological innovation
We have a long heritage of developing 
and integrating cutting-edge technologies 
to create complex systems that give our 
customers a capability advantage. The 
accelerating pace of technological change 
is a disruptive force and a key driver of 
competitive advantage and, increasingly, 
a determinant for our customers in 
awarding new business. 
Driving performance in these three areas 
will be key for the development of the 
business as we execute on our strategy 
in 2018 and beyond. 
2017 performance
US
After seven months under a Continuing 
Resolution that maintained funding at the 
prior year’s level, the fiscal year 2017 defence 
budget ultimately rose by approximately 
4%. Similarly, fiscal year 2018 has begun 
under multiple Continuing Resolutions. 
On 9 February 2018, Congress passed, and 
the President signed, a budget agreement 
that supports the medium-term planning 
assumptions for our US businesses. This 
budget agreement increases the budget 
caps for two years, and extends the current 
Continuing Resolution to 23 March 2018 
to allow lawmakers to pass a fiscal year 
2018 omnibus appropriations bill.
We see continued support for increased 
defence spending in the President’s 
recently-released fiscal year 2019 budget 
request. This request maintains positive 
momentum in funding for military readiness 
and modernisation, and provides greater 
near-term certainty. Our US-based portfolio 
remains well aligned with customer 
priorities and growth areas, such as the 
ramp-up of production on a number of 
our long-term programmes.

iMOTR™, a new 
product designed 
to improve radar 
accuracy
In August, our Intelligence & Security 
business launched a new product, iMOTR
™
. 
This innovative, mobile, multiple-object 
tracking radar uses commercial off-the-shelf 
solutions to provide military test and 
evaluation ranges with a higher degree of 
accuracy in tracking the time, space and 
position information for several objects in 
flight compared with current radars. 
The iMOTR
™
 solution, developed over 
two years with Group-funded research 
and development expenditure, features 
enhanced capabilities that offer more precise 
flight path tracking for objects travelling 
close to the ground and allow tracking 
information to be shared in real time with 
other radars or data collection sensors. 
These added capabilities will allow our 
customers to assess larger, more complex 
scenarios that are critical to developing the 
next generation of solutions to address 
national security threats.

The Typhoon aircraft’s progression towards 
the Royal Air Force Centurion standard will 
enable transition of capability from Tornado 
to Typhoon as the UK Tornado fleet is 
scheduled to come out of service at the 
end of the decade.
UK-based production of rear fuselage 
assemblies for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft 
increased to 82 in the year, with most of the 
advanced manufacturing investment in place 
to achieve the planned increase in production 
volumes. In readiness for the arrival of the 
UK’s first F-35 Lightning II aircraft in 2018, 
good progress has been made on the support 
facilities for the stand-up of the operational 
service at RAF Marham in Norfolk.
In the maritime domain, there remains 
pressure on the Navy’s near-term budgets.
On the aircraft carrier programme, HMS Queen 
Elizabeth successfully concluded initial sea 
trials and entered HM Naval Base, Portsmouth, 
for the first time in August, with operational 
handover to the Royal Navy in December.
Following contract award for the first batch 
of three Type 26 frigates, worth £3.7bn, 
production for the first ship, Glasgow, 
commenced in July. The National Shipbuilding 
Strategy announced in September committed 
to all eight Type 26 frigates to be built in our 
Scottish manufacturing facilities. In October, 
we announced a teaming agreement with 
Cammell Laird for their bid for the UK Ministry 
of Defence’s proposed Type 31e general 
purpose frigate programme.
Submarine activity is increasing with the 
Astute and Dreadnought class submarines 
now both in production and major 
redevelopment of the Barrow site to deliver 
the Dreadnought programme under way.

The Saudi Arabian In-Kingdom Industrial 
Participation programme continues to make 
good progress and we have commenced 
discussions with the new Saudi Arabian 
Military Industries (SAMI) organisation to 
explore how we can collaborate to deliver 
further In-Kingdom Industrial Participation. 
All of these activities are aligned with our 
long-term industrialisation strategy, as well 
as the Saudi Arabian government’s National 
Transformation Plan and Vision 2030.
On the Salam Typhoon programme, all 
contracted 72 aircraft have now been delivered 
and the Typhoon support contracts are 
operating well, exceeding the baseline flying 
programme contracted with the customer. 
Discussions with the Saudi Arabian customer 
through 2017 resulted in contractual 
agreements under the Saudi British Defence 
Co-operation Programme being formalised. 
These provide support services to the Royal 
Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi Naval Forces 
for a further five years to 31 December 2021. 
In Australia, the business is underpinned by 
long-term support contracts, whilst activity 
progresses on two major bid opportunities.
Firstly, as one of two tenderers for the 
Land 400 Phase 2 Combat Reconnaissance 
Vehicle programme, we have completed 
the Risk Mitigation Activity contract and 
submitted our final proposal, with final 
preferred tender selection anticipated in 
the first half of 2018.
Secondly, our initial tender response for 
the Commonwealth’s nine-ship SEA 5000 
Future Frigate programme was submitted 
in August and we anticipate a preferred 
tender selection in 2018.
The MBDA joint venture has continued 
to win orders in both domestic and export 
markets. The increase in business volumes 
has resulted in the requirement to expand 
production capacities in the UK and France. 
Our strategy in action
Advanced 
manufacturing 
facilities for 
F-35 Lightning II
In 2017, we demonstrated our military aircraft 
manufacturing expertise as we achieved a 
significant milestone on the F-35 Lightning II 
programme. With the delivery of the 318th 
rear section of the aircraft during the year, 
10% of the projected global customer aircraft 
requirement has now been produced. The 
achievement of this milestone has only been 
possible through investments made in our 
advanced manufacturing facilities and our 
close working relationship with the supply 
chain. Our focus in these areas will enable 
us to meet the ramp-up in production on 
the programme in the coming years.
As a key partner on F-35 Lightning II, 
a premier defence programme, we are 
responsible for approximately 15% of the 
work on each aircraft, excluding propulsion, 
and we play a major role in the programme 
across multiple markets, including the US, 
UK and Australia.

Annual Report 2017
Chief Executive’s review 
continued Cyber security
Applied Intelligence achieved sales growth 
from the continued delivery of national 
security solutions for the UK and international 
governments. In addition, we have deployed 
anti-fraud, regulatory compliance, and cyber 
security products and services across a large 
range of commercial customers.
In 2017, Applied Intelligence reported an 
underlying loss of £61m, including a £24m 
restructuring charge. The first half loss of 
£27m was followed by a reduced second 
half loss, before the restructuring charge, 
of £10m as cost reduction actions started 
to deliver bottom-line benefit. A goodwill 
impairment of £384m was taken in 2017 
reflecting the future level and timing of 
expected returns from the business.
Effective 1 January 2018, the business 
changed its operating model to deliver a 
more targeted portfolio of products and 
services focused on customers within three 
core business units: Government; Financial 
Services; and Technology & Commercial. 
The restructuring will enable a greater 
focus on customer needs and higher levels 
of operational efficiency, in the commercial 
business, that will accelerate improvements 
in competitiveness and profitability.
Balance sheet and capital allocation
The Group’s balance sheet is managed 
conservatively, in line with its policy, to retain 
its investment grade credit rating and to 
ensure operating flexibility. Consistent with 
this approach, the Group expects to continue 
to meet its pension obligations, invest in 
research and technology and other organic 
investment opportunities, and plans to 
pay dividends in line with its policy of 
long-term sustainable cover of around 
two times underlying earnings and to make 
accelerated returns of capital to shareholders 
when the balance sheet allows. Investment 
in value-enhancing acquisitions will be 
considered where market conditions are 
right and where they deliver on the 
Group’s strategy.
Pension schemes
The 2017 UK triennial pension funding 
valuations concluded in November, with the 
aggregate funding deficit as at 31 March 2017 
across the UK schemes at £2.1bn. The deficit 
recovery plan on the Group’s largest pension 
scheme, the BAE Systems Pension Scheme, 
continues to March 2026, with the other 
schemes now with reduced repayment 
periods or fully funded.
The UK funding deficit at 31 March 2017 is 
some £3bn lower than the accounting deficit, 
using like-for-like mortality assumptions and 
asset values at 31 December 2017, largely due 
to lower liabilities as a result of the discount 
rate assumption based on the expected returns 
on the investments held by the schemes.
Research and technology
BAE Systems has developed some of the 
world’s most innovative technologies and 
invests in research and development to 
generate future products and capabilities. 
We embrace disruptive technology, drive 
innovation and invest appropriately both 
on a self-funded basis and in conjunction 
with our customers, universities, and small 
and medium-sized enterprises. Company-
funded research and development contributes, 
along with customer funding, in driving 
focused investment in areas such as defence 
and commercial electronics, military aircraft, 
precision weapons and cyber security.
Responsible business
We continue to build a culture where our 
people are empowered to make the right 
decisions and know where to go to seek 
help or guidance. During 2017, we rolled 
out further ethics training across the Group 
to support employees and, in January 2018, 
launched our revised Code of Conduct.
The safety of our employees, and anybody 
who works on, or visits, our sites, remains 
a key priority. Our safety culture and our 
employees demand high standards for all 
aspects of health and safety. In 2017, there 
was a 3% reduction in the Recordable Accident 
Rate and a 28% reduction in the total number 
of major injuries recorded as we continued to 
focus on reducing risk and embedding safety 
culture to drive improvement.
Recruiting and retaining talented people 
is a key priority. We want every employee 
to reach their full potential within a diverse 
and inclusive work environment. We have 
programmes in place across the business to 
support strategic workforce planning, career 
development and retention, as well as to 
improve diversity and inclusion.
Organisational changes
In October, we announced a restructure of 
our operations outside of the US-managed 
business in support of our three priorities 
of delivering operational excellence, honing 
our competitive edge and accelerating our 
technology innovation. The new operating 
model, effective 1 January 2018, will simplify 
our management structure to create 
strengthened Air and Maritime reporting 
segments, whilst changes to our UK-based 
Applied Intelligence cyber security business 
are focused on meeting customer needs and 
accelerating improvements in competitiveness 
and profitability.
Our 2017 results are re-presented on page 
56 to reflect the organisational changes and 
our segmental guidance for 2018 is presented 
on page 57 on a consistent basis. On pages 
58 and 59, we summarise the short- to 
medium-term prospects for our five principal 
reporting segments from 1 January 2018.
Summary
Our business benefits from a large order 
backlog, strong franchises and established 
positions on long-term programmes in the 
US, UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Our 
strategy is clear and well defined, with 
governments in our major markets continuing 
to prioritise defence and security, with strong 
demand for our capabilities. Through 
execution of a consistent strategy, we are well 
placed to maximise opportunities, deal with 
the challenges and continue to generate good 
shareholder returns.
