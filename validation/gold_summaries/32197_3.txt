 Liontrust Asset Management Plc (the “Company” or “Liontrust”, or together with its subsidiary entities, the 
“Group”, as the context requires) is a specialist fund management company that takes pride in having a 
distinct culture and approach to running money:
The company was founded in 1994 and was 
listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.
We are an independent business with no 
corporate parent, our head office is on the Strand 
in London and we have branch offices in 
Edinburgh and Luxembourg.
We believe in the benefits of active fund 
management over the long term and all our fund 
managers are truly active.
We focus only on those areas of investment in 
which we have particular expertise. We have 
seven fund management teams: five that invest in 
UK, European, Asian and Global equities, one 
team that manages Multi-Asset portfolios and a 
Sustainable Investment team.
Our fund managers are independent thinkers and 
have the courage of their convictions in making 
investment decisions.
Our fund managers have the freedom to manage 
their portfolios according to their own investment 
processes and market views without being 
distracted by other day-to-day aspects of running a 
fund management company.
Each fund management team applies distinct and 
rigorous investment processes to the management 
of funds and portfolios that ensure the way we 
manage money is predictable and repeatable.
Staying true to their documented investment 
processes helps to create an in-built risk control for 
our fund managers, especially in more challenging 
environments, by preventing them from buying 
stocks for the wrong reasons.
We aim to treat investors, clients, members, 
employees, suppliers and other stakeholders fairly 
and with respect. We are committed to the Principles 
of Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) and they are central 
to how we conduct business across all our functions.

LIONTRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017   3
Introduction 
In my Chairman’s Statement for last year’s Annual report, I wrote that “we also 
face challenges from outside our industry, including yet another year of political 
uncertainty”. It is now clear this was a great understatement and there can be 
few 12-month periods that have produced such a series of political shocks 
culminating in last week General Election. 
Stock markets, however, have brushed off the vote for Brexit and Donald 
Trump becoming US President in January to such an extent that the FTSE 
100 has reached an all-time high in 2017 and we have been experiencing 
the second longest bull market in history. I doubt many people would have 
said this time last year that markets would be where they are today if they had 
known in advance the result of the UK Referendum and the US Presidential 
election even if sterling has depreciated as most commentators expected 
following the Brexit vote.
Now we are faced with a hung Parliament at Westminster with all the political 
uncertainty that this brings, along with the possibility of another General 
Election later this year. Once again, at the time of writing, there has been a 
benign reaction from the stock market in contrast to performance of Sterling.
The last year has been an important reminder of the difficulty of predicting and 
timing market movements and the benefits and value of financial advice and 
long-term investment as opposed to knee-jerk reactions. Economies, markets 
and investors will always be confronted by challenges and potential threats as 
well as opportunities. Therefore, the key for investors is to stay focused on 
what will enable them to achieve their long-term goals rather than obsess over 
intra-day movements in equity markets.
At Liontrust, we have brought together a talented group of fund management 
teams who believe that rigorous investment processes are key to long-
term performance and risk control. They do not get distracted by short-
term events and noise but stay true to their own documented investment 
processes. The success of this disciplined approach is shown by our 
teams’ long-term performance records, which also demonstrate the value 
that active management can deliver for investors. The addition of our new 
European Income and Sustainable Investment teams over the last year have 
strengthened further our fund management capability.
Like investors, asset management businesses are continually confronted by 
potential challenges and threats along with plenty of opportunities. It is easy to 
list the challenges that the industry is or could be facing, whether it is political 
uncertainty, current valuations in equity markets, the growth in flows into 
passive investments or technological disrupters.
None of these are reasons why we cannot continue to grow Liontrust, 
however, as we have done so successfully over the past few years through 
generating net sales and acquisitions. We have shown that sectors do not 
need to be in favour with investors for us to enjoy net positive sales into 
our funds.
This growth has been achieved through strong leadership and management, 
delivering value to investors over the long term and continuing to develop 
our sales and marketing capability. We focus on our strengths in running 
the business and are disciplined in enacting our strategy to grow our AuM, 
earnings and profitability as our Results for the 2016-17 financial year 
demonstrate.
The general election campaign in the UK has highlighted very clearly yet again 
the importance of every individual taking on responsibility for ensuring they 
have sufficient funds for their retirement and to achieve their other financial 
goals. Financial advice and fund management will become increasingly, not 
less, important in the future to help people achieve this.
I would like to thank our shareholders, investors and staff for all their support 
and loyalty to Liontrust. Due to the leadership of the business and the hard 
work of everyone at the Company, we are in a great position to continue to 
overcome any challenges and benefit from the tailwinds behind the industry.
Results
Adjusted profit before tax was £17.235 million (2016: £14.623 million). 
Adjusted profit before tax is disclosed in order to give shareholders an 
indication of the profitability of the Group excluding non-cash (depreciation, 
intangible asset amortisation and share incentivisation related) expenses 
and non-recurring (professional fees relating to acquisition, cost reduction, 
restructuring, share incentivisation and severance compensation related) 
expenses (“Adjustments”), see note 5 below for a reconciliation of adjusted 
profit (or loss) before tax. 
Profit before tax is £9.103 million (2016: £9.404 million).
Dividend
The success in fund performance and distribution has resulted in an increase 
in revenues excluding performance fees of 26% and an 18% increase in 
our adjusted profit before tax to £17.2 million. This has enabled the Board 
to declare a Second Interim dividend of 11.0 pence per share (2016: 9.0 
pence) which will be payable on 19 July 2017 to shareholders who are on the 
register as at 23 June 2017, the shares going ex-dividend on 22 June 2017. 
The total dividend for the financial year ending 31 March 2017 is 15.0 pence 
per share (2016: 12.0 pence per share), an increase of 25% compared with 
last year.
