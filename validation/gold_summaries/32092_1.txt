 6 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
When Conviviality floated on AIM in July 2013 the 
business was an alcohol, impulse and tobacco wholesaler 
serving the UK’s largest Franchise off-licence and 
convenience brand, Bargain Booze, with 616 stores and 
a turnover of £372m. During the past four years we have 
systematically pursued the strategy of taking the core 
competence of the business, the wholesaling of alcohol, 
and extending Conviviality’s reach to more consumers 
across the UK drinks market whenever and wherever 
they wish to enjoy our products. We have fundamentally 
restructured and reconfigured the Group, building 
on our unique strength, expertise and reach in the UK 
drinks market. We now have the infrastructure and 
capability within the Group to drive further potential in 
both the On Trade and the Off Trade markets, working 
with our existing suppliers providing customers with 
more opportunities to drive profitable growth. 
Conviviality is unique in our sector. We provide our customers 
with access to over 14,000 alcohol SKUs, and 6,400 impulse, 
food and tobacco SKUs. We serve c.25,000 outlets in the 
On Trade, over 700 retail stores trading under the retail 
propositions of Bargain Booze, Select Convenience and Wine 
Rack, over 400 independent specialists and we are supplier 
to the larger multiples. A key part of our strategy is to deliver 
a logistics capability that anticipates the future needs of our 
customers and creates significant differentiation in the market, 
thereby adding significant value to the organisation. As the 
retail environment becomes more complex, we can leverage 
Conviviality’s expertise in the alcohol and impulse markets to 
provide our valued customers with the solutions they need 
from distribution, to buying, ranging and merchandising and 
marketing.
As a result of this scale and reach we have unparalleled market 
access, insight and capabilities to support our suppliers in 
the development of their brands and to help our customers 
differentiate from their competition by tailoring their offering 
to meet their target consumer needs by location, venue and 
format. Conviviality is independent of any major drinks brands 
and therefore is able to supply an unrestricted selection of 
products and provide expertise in key categories to customers 
who value breadth of range whilst offering a compelling route 
to market for suppliers to access both the On Trade and Off 
Trade retailers. 
It is this scale and reach that has created even stronger ties with 
our supplier partners. Increasingly our suppliers are engaging 
with the full capability of Conviviality from building their brands 
with our brand agency Catalyst PLB, accessing consumers with 
Elastic and Peppermint in events and experiential marketing, to 
more effective targeting in the On Trade utilising our data and 
insight, through to Off Trade execution in our Franchise retail 
business. A recent example was the exclusive On Trade launch 
of Bud Light for AB InBev across the Conviviality Group.

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
This past year has been a transformational 
year for the service we offer. We will 
continue to grow by keeping our people, 
our customers, Franchisees and suppliers at 
the heart of everything we do.
The successful integration of the three 
businesses, working as a cohesive unit and the 
management team’s performance continues 
to deliver consistent results. The new internal 
structure grouped individual brands and 
businesses together under three distinct 
Business Units: Conviviality Direct (wholesaling/
distributor to On Trade) led by Mark Aylwin; 
Conviviality Retail (for Off Trade consumer 
businesses Bargain Booze, Select Convenience 
and Wine Rack) led by David Robinson; 
and Conviviality Trading (an innovative and 
dynamic approach to sourcing, ranging, 
brand building, merchandising, activation and 
events) led by James Lousada. Each of the 
business unit Managing Directors ensures their 
operation has the best people in the right place 
to deliver excellent service to customers, and 
drive collaborations and savings across the 
Group. The business units are supported by the 
expertise of the Group functions of Logistics, 
Finance, Legal, IT and Human Resources.
This past year has, therefore, been a 
transformational year for the service we offer, 
creating a range of benefits for customers. It is 
the nature of the On Trade and Off Trade market 
that our customers are constantly looking for 
the same thing as their own consumers: great 
value, new and innovative products, breadth 
of choice and excellent service. Critically, we 
continue to strive to ensure that our customers 
see our people regularly whether they are a one 
site restauranteur, hotelier or a large national 
account or a Franchisee, so that our customers 
may enjoy the relationships and service support 
they value from us. All of our businesses were 
initiated and built on personal relationships. 
These relationships remain at the heart of how 
we will continue to do business. Bibendum’s first 
ever On Trade customer was Michelin-starred 
Odette’s in Primrose Hill and it continues to be 
a valued customer over 30 years on. Matthew 
Clark has been a partner to JD Wetherspoon’s 
for over 20 years and a distributor of Martell for 
198 years. In our Franchise business we have 133 
Franchisees who have worked with the group 
for over 10 years. Our On Trade, Off Trade and 
franchised customers still expect – and still get 
– an outstanding portfolio of products, that 
they can tailor to their own customers’ tastes 
and needs, as well as the support they value to 
help them develop their own business moving 
forward.
For each of them, business and growth 
opportunities can come from a number 
of sources. It can be from our expanding 
catalogue of products or markets; for example 
Matthew Clark’s extended spirits range giving 
customers access to niche and small parcel 
spirits, or Bibendum’s limited release wine 
collection offering something rare or interesting 
from suppliers they already value, and equally 
Franchisees benefit from new and exclusive 
launches from the Group as well as access to 
the extensive range of spirits now available to 
them. It can also be in how we serve them – 
and where their own vision sees potential. Our 
experts within Catalyst PLB help introduce 
customers to the newest and most exciting 
products in craft and premium spirits, beers 
and ciders, almost challenging end consumers 
to experiment; colleagues at Elastic (who 
reinvigorate brands) and in our events business, 
Peppermint, have unparalleled expertise in 
bringing new and old products to life. We – and 
our suppliers - have seen excellent sales growth 
in a range of products that has been supported 
by our teams and their combined expertise 
from across Conviviality.
We will continue to grow by keeping our people, 
our customers, Franchisees, and suppliers 
at the heart of everything we do. Everyone 
who works for Conviviality from Glasgow to 
Southampton, and Bristol to Crewe, from shop 
to depot to office, knows it is critical that we 
keep finding new ways to improve our customer 
service and deliver excellence. As we focus our 
investment in the services customers value, so 
we will see our online services grow, in the past 
year the number of customers using our digital 
platform has increased by 20% year on year  8 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
to 4,645, ensuring more accuracy in customer 
ordering, better ordering history to assist with 
forecasting and in turn greater efficiency for 
both our customers and Conviviality. 48% of 
customers using our digital platform do so 
daily, indicating increasing engagement with 
the brand and assortment.
Our commitment to customers can be seen in 
the accolades they have awarded us. In 2016 
Bibendum won the “Compass Supplier Award 
for Implementation” for the successful execution 
of a wine culture across the Compass Group 
and is currently listed as Mitchells & Butlers 
#1 wine supplier; and in 2017 Matthew Clark 
was Drinks Supplier of the Year in Restaurant 
Magazine Reader’s Choice Awards for the 
third year running. More recently Conviviality 
Retail has been awarded Grocer Gold – Drinks 
Retailer of the Year for the second consecutive 
year. Conviviality Trading was recognised by 
Stonegate for Innovation of the Year with the 
launch of Gancia Leggero, a skinny Prosecco.
Results
An important aspect of our business model is 
its flexibility, protecting our earnings through 
periods of significant change in our organisation 
and a competitive external environment. We 
have continued to deliver against our objectives 
set out at flotation in July 2013 and are pleased 
to report profits ahead of expectations, during 
a year where we have significantly transformed 
our business. For the 52 weeks to 30 April 2017 
revenue was up 85%
1
 to £1,560m, reflecting the 
benefit of the Bibendum PLB Group acquisition 
on 20 May 2016, as such, Adjusted EBITDA* 
was up 102% to £60.9m and Adjusted profit 
before tax
5
 up 111% to £45.8m, demonstrating 
the significant strength of the combined group. 
Adjusted fully diluted EPS* was up 48% to 
21.0 pence. The recent acquisitions resulted in 
an increase of net debt, however, at year end 
this was £95.7m, which is below consensus 
expectations. The full year dividend is up 
33% to 12.6 pence in line with our progressive 
dividend policy and reflecting a strong return 
to our shareholders.
Outlook 
The Company’s focus for the near-term is on 
continuing to deliver against our stated strategy 
and meet the expectations of our stakeholders, 
customers, suppliers and our people. The 
greatest asset from all of our acquisitions has 
been our people and we continue to work 
hard to ensure that their skills and talent are 
utilised to the benefit of our customers and 
suppliers. Our presence in the market through 
our different specialist businesses, provides us 
with unique insight into both our market and 
consumers from the widest of perspectives. We 
are already successfully leveraging this insight 
to ensure that our customers have the right 
product range and support to help them grow. 
Furthermore, we are continuing to look at new 
ways of maintaining our unique position and 
broadening the ways in which our customers, 
our supplier partners and the Group can 
benefit. We are excited by the future potential 
for growth across the Group as we continue to 
explore these opportunities.

Bargain Booze, Select Convenience and Wine Rack); and

Conviviality Direct
The UK’s largest independent 
wholesaler to the On Trade, serving 
c.25,000 outlets from national prestige 
hotel chains to independent food led 
pubs and restaurants trading through 
two businesses, namely Matthew Clark 
and Bibendum. Since the acquisition, 
of Bibendum, Conviviality Direct 
revenues have increased 6.4% to 
£1,040m (corresponding prior period 
£978m)
6
. To date average sales per 
outlet have increased 4.8% to £43,700 
and we welcomed 235 new customers 
in the year. The number of Bibendum 
Wine customers buying all categories 
has increased from 5% to 12%, a strong 
indication that our customers value the 
increased choice and service offering 
of our model. As an example, during 
the past year, spirits have grown in 
the Bibendum regional business by 
43.7%, and National business by 21% as 
customers appreciate the wider choice 
now on offer through Conviviality 
Direct. 
Conviviality Direct affords a range of 
over 14,000 alcohol lines to over 11,000 
customers, offering a one-stop solution 
to hotels, restaurants, bars and venues 
for their alcohol needs delivering 
consistent service nationwide next 
day. Conviviality Direct has a national 
sales force through the Bibendum and 
Matthew Clark brands of over 300 
employees based across Scotland, 
England and Wales and London and 
the South East ensuring excellent 
service to its Independent Free Trade 
customers and National Account 
customers. The sales team have up 
to date information on industry sales 
trends, new product information and 
pricing and are able to recommend the 
right mix of products to customers to 
help them optimise their offer to their 
consumers. Conviviality’s nationwide 
distribution network of 16 depots 
means customers benefit from a 
nationwide next day delivery service 
and timed delivery slots.
A key part of the Conviviality Direct 
strategy is to focus on growth in 
key cities, specifically focused on 
existing customers identifying with 
the Bibendum and Matthew Clark 
propositions and their ability to utilise 
the brands to meet all of their drinks 
purchasing needs. The Caring Group 
of restaurants (the Ivy collection, Le 
Caprice for example), Prezzo and 
Searcys have all chosen to work with 
Conviviality Direct to enable them to 
access the extensive range, service and 
solutions the Group offers. At the same 
time as attracting new customers, our 
existing customers have continued 
to value a long standing relationship 
with us. Stonegate has worked with 
us for 9 years and we continue to 
enjoy supporting their business, and 
JD Wetherspoons have worked with 
Matthew Clark from having 8 pubs 
in their portfolio to over 900 pubs to 
date. 
We continue to work closely with our 
customers to understand their current 
and future needs, ensuring that we 
are at the fore front of customer 
service. Furthermore 770 customers 
have recognised the opportunity to 
improve order accuracy and efficiency 
by moving onto our digital platform. 
4,645 customers now engage with the 
digital platform and order value per 
customer is 13% higher than customers 
who place orders via the contact 
centre.

Conviviality Retail
The UK’s largest franchised off-licence 
and convenience chain with 352 
Franchisees and more than 700 retail 
stores trading primarily under the fascia 
of Bargain Booze, Select Convenience 
and Wine Rack. In line with our 
programme to focus on the underlying 
quality of retail stores, we continue 
to see low levels of store closures to 
63 in total which include the closure 
of small CTN (confectionary, tobacco, 
newsagent) stores which no longer 
serve the Off licence or Convenience 
proposition. Whilst net store numbers 
are in line with the prior year the quality 
of the outlets opening is significantly 
improved, with retail sales per new 
outlet opening up 29.8% versus last 
year. Sales of multisite Franchisees 
outperform the total estate by 2.1% like 
for like*. We saw 39 Franchisees join 
the Group, a strong indication of the 
benefits of our model to independent 
business people. Our core model is 
predicated by Franchisee loyalty and 
commitment to upholding the values 
of our brands. This, combined with 
the high standards that we set, are 
helping to deliver our differentiated 
“local customer experience”. We have 
some of the highest levels of loyalty in 
the sector with the percentage of sales 
of goods by our Franchisees that are 
purchased from the Group at 91%. It is 
also pleasing that Wine Rack continues 
to perform well and during 2016 we 
opened one new Wine Rack in Epsom. 
Like for like performance in Wine Rack 
is 1.4% reflecting the importance of a 
specialist Wine and Spirits proposition 
on the high street.
Conviviality Retail continues to 
grow a national store estate with a 
differentiated consumer proposition 
that responds to consumer needs 
and market trends. The strategy aims 
to consolidate Conviviality Retail’s 
position as the UK’s leading drinks-
led convenience retailer. The business 
has three fundamental sources of 
advantage:
Drinks Heritage and Expertise:
Approximately 50% of sales are from 
beer, wine and spirits categories, 
producing a category mix that is unique 
in the sector. Conviviality’s unrivalled 
category expertise in the drinks sector 
allows Franchisees to benefit from a 
differentiated proposition and from 
the footfall and margin benefits of a 
compelling range and assortment. It 
is this drinks heritage and expertise 
that underpins and differentiates our 
three key retail brands. In particular 
the business will continue to develop 
the Select Convenience proposition to 
ensure that it is at the heart of “local 
convenience” in the communities in 
which it trades. Further development 
of the Vape proposition is being 
rolled out across the estate, and is 
now in 249 stores. Vape products are 
margin-enhancing and protect against 
the decline in tobacco sales. We are 
already seeing average sales of £220 
per store per week and margin benefit 
to Franchisees of approximately 
£5,000 per store per year.
Sourcing and Distribution Scale:
As part of the Conviviality Group, the 
business has significantly benefited 
from its scale advantages in buying 
and distribution, whilst remaining a 
largely standalone business operating 
out of its own offices with a dedicated 
and experienced management team. 
Distribution is managed in-house 
by the Conviviality Group logistics 
operation, primarily on dedicated 
branded vehicles, with stores typically 
choosing to receive two, or sometimes 
three, deliveries per week. Service 
levels are very high compared to our 
competitors in the sector with over 99% 
of deliveries received on time and with 
complete orders. The transformation 
of the Conviviality logistics network 
will allow Conviviality Retail to benefit 
from the Group’s scale through lower 
delivery costs. Conviviality Retail can 
leverage its scale position to source 
advantageously and provide consistent 
value to Franchisees. Offering good 
value to consumers through reliable 
low-pricing and compelling promotions 
is core to the Bargain Booze model. 
Locally Embedded Franchise Model:
Conviviality Retail allows independent 
retailers to deliver superior returns via 
Strategy
Strengthen the relationship with 
Franchisees and	 attract 	new	
Franchisees to the group
Strengthen the Bargain Booze, 
Select Convenience and Wine 
Rack brands
Deliver new core systems, 
improved capabilities and a 
efficient model that supports 
our growth ambition
Build the growth management 
engine that 	 allows	 us 	 to

Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements
a simple turn-key solution that leverages strong 
business fundamentals and a scalable back 
office: the Franchisee proposition is the core of 
Conviviality Retail’s success. Franchisees access 
a distinct drinks-led consumer offer supported 
by dedicated support managers, regular, and 
deep engagement at senior level and a reward 
package that is unique in the sector, including 
accessing the Franchisee Incentive Plan under 
which shares in Conviviality Plc are awarded 
based on compliance and performance. 285 
Franchisees own or hold options over 3m 
shares in Conviviality Plc. The Company’s 
352 Franchisees are local people, employing 
local people, and are passionate about their 
customers and the communities in which they 
trade. Our Franchisees make a real difference 
in their local communities through a relentless 
focus on meeting consumer needs and 
providing a unique customer experience. 
To reinforce the three fundamental sources 
of advantage, Conviviality Retail has made 
an investment in upgrading its retail systems. 
The new core operating system (ERP) will 
be introduced during the Autumn of 2017 
and the rollout of new EPOS to all stores is 
already in progress. The new solutions will 
enable business efficiencies, future-proof the 
Franchisee proposition, and accelerate the 
strategic direction to invest in a growing mix of 
multisite Franchisees. 14 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Conviviality Trading 
A full service drinks brand and 
wine agency business with national 
sales and activation capability from 
traditional On and Off Trade retail, to 
festivals and events. New products and 
brands can be developed, both with 
our partner suppliers, and also directly 
by our own teams as we see trends 
and opportunities emerge across the 
market. Within Conviviality Trading, 
Catalyst PLB brings together PLB, Instil 
and Catalyst Brands: three specialist 
brand agency businesses, each with 
significant expertise in their respective 
categories. The brand agency business 
enhances the marketing capability and 
sales reach of the business and gives 
partner suppliers and brand owners 
unparalleled market coverage.
In addition, Conviviality Trading is 
also responsible for the development 
and growth of new business areas 
including Peppermint, a specialist 
in outdoor events and festivals, and 
Elastic, a brand activation agency that 
provides support and insight to many 
of Conviviality’s branded supply base.
Within Catalyst PLB the team represent 
over 25 brands across drinks categories 
in the UK drinks market. This area of 
the business not only represents large 
suppliers and brands as a drinks agency 
but is also a consolidator of wine 
suppliers, managing the supply of wine 
to the Off Trade including high street 
retailers, specialists and supermarkets. 
Conviviality Trading has skills and 
capabilities in consumer insight, 
sourcing, ranging and supply that can 
add significant value to its customers 
by offering a “one-stop shop” reducing 
the complexity of the wine category in 
large multiple national chains.
We have already seen new strategic 
relationships established. In April 2016 
the Catalyst business started working 
with global spirits business Beam 
Suntory. The team won the distribution 
rights for Larios Gin and Sauza Tequila. 
Larios is the leading gin in Spain and 
Catalyst were tasked with launching 
the brand in the UK. In the first year 
working together the Catalyst team 
built distribution for Larios in over 
1,700 accounts and grew the volume 
significantly. In January 2017 two of 
the largest Chilean wine producers 
transferred their Off Trade business to 
Conviviality: Santa Rita, with brands 
including Santa Rita, Vina Carmen and 
Sur Andino; and Luis Felipe Edwards, a 
privately owned wine group founded in 
1976 by Luis Felipe Edwards Senior, with 
brands including Luis Felipe Edwards, 
Dona Bernada, Marea and Cien.
Conviviality also has the ability to 
develop its own brands opening 
up opportunities where gaps in the 
market exist to create and build brands 
that directly meet our customers’ and 
their consumers’ needs. In 2017 we 
launched two new brands: Rolling Calf 
spiced spirit, capitalising on the trend 
for dark spirits and cocktails, already 
distributed to customers in the On 
T rade and due to launch in the Off T rade 
during Winter 2017; and Whipstitch 
cider which has been launched 
specifically for festival customers 
and received positive response from 
customers when trialled at the Isle of 
Wight Festival in June 2017.
Building our partners’ brands across 
the UK market means accessing the 
consumer wherever they are buying 
and consuming products whether 
that be in pubs, bars and restaurants; 
in supermarkets; convenience stores; 
online; and also in the emerging “third 
space”. This includes non-traditional 
areas like outdoor events, pop ups 
and festivals. Through Peppermint, 
a specialist in outdoor events and 
festivals, we deliver this promise. This 
year Peppermint will be operating 
at over 35 events. Sales increased by 
46% over the corresponding prior 
period. For events owners, Peppermint  Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017       15

Whipstitch Festival Cider and Rolling Calf 
Spiced Spirit: two of Conviviality’s latest 
brand innovations 
provides a complete service solution 
including full bar and food service 
management as well as ATM operation 
and Click and Collect.
Furthermore, Elastic, our brand 
activation agency which provides 
activation and brand building expertise 
to many of Conviviality’s branded 
supply base, saw sales grow strongly. 
Elastic has completed work for eight 
new branded suppliers in addition to 
the continued strong partnerships 
with businesses such as ABInBev and 
Heineken, cementing our positioning 
as one of the UK’s leading experiential 
drinks agencies. 16 Conviviality Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
A Group Wide approach to efficiencies 
With the greater scale of the Group there is the potential 
to realise lower costs through buying, distribution and 
improved organisational efficiency. The Integration plan 
set out at the acquisition of Matthew Clark and Bibendum 
PLB Group is ahead of plan with good progress being 
demonstrated against the stated synergy benefits in 
FY18 Buying (£8m), Bibendum PLB (£4m) and Logistics 
(between £1m and £1.5m). The key benefit areas of the 
integration are detailed as follows:
Buying
The Beer, Lager, Spirits and Soft Drinks buying teams 
across Conviviality Direct and Conviviality Retail work 
collaboratively to ensure that the opportunities for 
both the business and the suppliers are maximised. This 
approach has been key particularly for new product 
launches such as Bud Light. This approach by the Buying 
teams has also resulted in the stated buying synergies 
set out at the acquisition of Matthew Clark being 
achieved for this financial year, which is a demonstration 
of the quality of the buying team and the support of the 
enlarged group by our supply base. 
Group Wine Buying
A Group Wine Buying team was established shortly after 
the purchase of Bibendum PLB Group. The team is led 
by Andrew Shaw, Group Wine Buying Director, and is 
responsible for the selection and purchasing of the full 
assortment of wines, sparking wines and Champagne. 
Our Wine buying teams have long standing relationships 
with our producers and with our customers, giving 
them the unique ability to marry customers’ needs 
with producers’ wines. Across the Group we have 430 
suppliers, 310 of which are exclusive to Conviviality. These 
exclusives cover over 3,000 of the 4,902 SKUs available 
for our customers. Already we have seen Conviviality 
Retail Franchisees benefit from the ability to sell over 
54,000 bottles of wines that are exclusive to Conviviality. 
In addition, with the increased scale and buying volumes 
of the Group there is significant opportunity to address 
costs within the supply chain to release synergy benefits.
As a result we expect to generate additional buying 
benefits of £2 million during FY19.

IT, Systems and Organisation
During the year we have undertaken a programme 
to align the ERP systems across the Group. We are 
implementing the same ERP system as is used in Matthew 
Clark and applying it to both the Bibendum business 
and the Conviviality Retail business. Once the system 
implementations are complete at the end of Autumn 
2017, we will have the opportunity to realise back office 
synergies, drive further improvements for customers 
and improve the ways of working across the Group. The 
enlarged Group employs 2,640 people across 16 depots 
and 4 support offices and regional sales teams, as such 
there is significant talent in the organisation. By bringing 
the respective teams in the businesses closer together 
we are seeing clear opportunities to drive greater 
efficiencies, develop talent across the business and drive 
operational savings. During 2016 10% of our people took 
the opportunity to develop their careers further across 
the Group. We expect additional organisational synergy 
benefits of £1.0m to be realised in FY19.
Trading for the 9 weeks ended 2 July 2017
The Company and its businesses are trading in line with 
expectations. Conviviality Direct continues to trade 
strongly with sales 9% above last year. It is particularly 
pleasing to see the continued improvement and 
confidence of Conviviality Retail with LFL* sales 0.5% with 
Wine Rack up 4.0%. Finally Conviviality Trading is 7.6% 
above last year demonstrating its customers recognising 
the expertise and support of the agency business, and 
additionally with the Events business increasing the 
number of events this year versus last year by 27% to 140.

Group Logistics
The logistics operation is a key strength and differentiator 
for Conviviality . Conviviality serves our customers through 
our network of 11 depots, 5 stockless outbases and 3 
depots operated by our logistics partners. During May 
2016 we transferred the leadership of these depots from 
regional management to the Group Logistics function, 
thereby enabling consistent standards and best practice 
to be applied across the Group. Since the transition 
Telematics has been introduced to all vehicles delivering 
a 3.9% MPG saving, and Paragon route planning software 
is in the process of being rolled out across all depots. 
There are over 1,000 of our people working in our depots 
and delivering to our customers, under the leadership 
of Nigel Basey, Group Logistics Director. We have 
strengthened the capability of the team through training 
and development, and delivered changes to support the 
efficient growth of the Conviviality business. 
During the year, we closed both Y ork and Shefford depots 
and opened new depots in Wetherby and Bedford, 
providing greater capacity to serve our customers and a 
better working environment for our people. We took the 
decision to close the Dundee depot to enable customers 
to order from the full assortment available at Glasgow 
delivered to customers via a stockless outbase. During 
this period, the logistics team supported the service to 
over 100 festivals and the growth of the Conviviality 
Direct and Conviviality Retail businesses. Looking 
ahead, the team are confirming the plans for the Group 
logistics strategy whereby we continue to focus on 
delighting customers and growing the business and, in 
doing so, achieve a greater level of efficiency. Through 
the continued efficiency actions being undertaken we 
expect to deliver £1.2m of distribution synergies in FY18, 
rising to £1.5m in FY19.
