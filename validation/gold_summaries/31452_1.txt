 Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review
Spirent has adapted to the changes 
in the test and measurement 
industry and is aligned with the new 
opportunities that have been created.
Overview – realising our potential
In 2017, we have established a firm basis 
to realise Spirent’s potential. 
We focused on our core expertise to 
enable our customers to develop high-
performance, high-security systems in a 
shorter time. We have taken our expertise 
in service assurance to deploy innovative 
new systems, winning new business with 
well-established and new customers. 
In doing so, we gained market share 
with the early adopters in the industry, 
which should serve Spirent well in 2018 
and the long-term.
An essential part of realising our potential 
has been to focus on our core strategies 
and take these into the growth opportunities 
offered by the global trend to move rapidly 
from development into operations. A natural 
consequence is a reduction in expenditure 
as we cease or scale back activities outside 
this focus area. This, in turn, has helped to 
increase profitability of Spirent’s operations 
and to increase cash generation.

14 Strategy – enabling the data revolution
Spirent enables its customers to deliver 
data connectivity which is faster, has 
greater capacity and has resilient security. 
This is essential to the development 
and deployment of new technologies 
worldwide: from smart industrial processes, 
smart home management, autonomous 
vehicles, smart enterprise business 
processes to smart city construction. 
Add in the digitisation of healthcare, 
and it is clear that ultra-reliable, fail safe 
connectivity at hyper-scale is necessary 
to deliver this vision. Spirent has an 
important role in enabling its customers to 
deliver these new smart technologies in 
an economic, secure and timely manner.
Spirent’s core expertise in data 
technologies – founded on high-speed 
Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular wireless, satellite 
constellations – combined with automated 
service assurance and analytics, offers a 
differentiated and powerful set of solutions 
to our customers. Vital to our customers’ 
success is our ability to deliver our 
expertise in test, measurement, validation, 
assurance and security in automated, 
scalable systems that are easy to use. This 
will enable our customers to realise their 
vision of supplying data connectivity with 
lower cost, higher reliability and security. 
The dominant market trends are 
underpinned by relentless traffic growth. 
The business imperative is to enable the 
industry to reduce operating cost and 
capital expenditure. Operators cannot afford 
to match traffic growth with higher and 
higher levels of investment in new data 
transport equipment. They also have to 
reduce their cost of operations by 
implementing new network architecture 
and operating practices. These imperatives 
drive the move to software defined 
networks, network virtualisation and 
automation. This is why Spirent’s strategic 
focus is to offer enabling technologies, 
systems and active service assurance so 
that our customers, existing and new, can 
meet the challenges in building out virtual 
networks. Within this broad landscape there 
are market disrupters: virtualisation, the 
Internet of Things (IoT), 5G wireless and 
cyber security.
Network virtualisation is the only way to 
support the exponential growth in data 
consumption. Virtualisation allows radical 
reduction in the capital cost of networks; 
it also allows rapid deployment for new 
services. Spirent provides active test 
systems to assure performance before 
deployment, and during operation to allow 
real-time response to changing conditions 
in the network. The existing hybrid 
networks, with their inherent complexity, 
will exist for decades to come. 
Connected things range from personal 
devices, such as a smart stylus, through 
large autonomous vehicles and 
industrial infrastructure.
With regard to hyper-connectivity, there are 
multifarious challenges for developer and 
network operators. Spirent offers solutions 
to avoid network bottlenecks, degradation 
in performance and security breaches.
The continuous evolution in wireless 
technologies is now moving to the 
development and deployment of 5G. 
5G will allow new applications to access 
extreme bandwidth and will offer ultra-low 
latency. This will support new applications 
such as virtual and augmented reality. 
New test and assurance capabilities will 
be required to support 5G both for 
networks and for devices.
Cyber security is at the forefront of 
concerns around any data application and 
network. High profile security incidents 
make headlines across all aspects of life, 
from individuals to business to government. 
The overall prevalence and sophistication 
of cyber threats continue to rise. There is a 
necessary increase in spending on cyber 
security to detect and protect against 
threats. Spirent offers highly reliable and 
up to date test and verification solutions 
to give greater assurance that protections 
are working.
Spirent’s strategic direction is to take our 
deep expertise in test and assurance in 
data networking to provide leading-edge 
solutions and services that enable the 
realisation of smart connectivity at an 
economic cost, achieved through 
automation and lower cost operation. 
We will consolidate on our leadership 
positions in high-speed Ethernet and in 
satellite navigation. We will deliver 
solutions to meet the challenges of 
virtualisation and cyber security. We will 
deploy systems in production networks for 
active test and management to lower the 
cost of operations. We will develop new 
solutions for the growth in 5G wireless 
technology and to meet the requirements 
for autonomous vehicles.

16 Q&A with Eric Hutchinson,  
Chief Executive Officer,  
on Spirent’s values in action
What do you envision the future 
to be for data technologies and 
Spirent’s role in this area?
The future will see the provision and 
delivery of products, services and 
environmental management by 
automated, robotic, intelligent systems. 
This is where smart technologies 
are leading the world. This digital 
revolution is underpinned by data 
technologies in the broadest sense. 
Spirent’s role will be to facilitate 
and enable the development of the 
digital technologies, infrastructure, 
operations and the security necessary 
for their implementation and operation.
What are the exciting areas to 
address in 2018 that give you 
confidence in the outlook for Spirent?
The near-term will be the provision 
of autonomous service assurance for 
operations. This is critical to realising 
the benefits of the innovations that 
allow network virtualisation. Without 
these, the world will not feel the 
economic benefits from the digital 
revolution. There will be significant 
investment in digital technologies; 
some of this will involve demand for 
our core technologies, some will 
demand new solutions, such as 5G 
wireless, all will offer an exciting role 
for Spirent.
2017 operating performance
Spirent’s adjusted operating profit¹ 
increased by 27 per cent through focus 
and judicious cost management. Group 
revenue was broadly flat, down by 
$3.1 million to $454.8 million due to the 
cyclical downturn in Ethernet and wireless 
technologies. Strong revenue growth was 
achieved in Lifecycle Service Assurance, 
up 10 per cent to $109.2 million. Networks 
& Security revenue decreased by 
$1.2 million to $261.0 million, reflecting the 
shift from 40G and 100G to 400G, which 
saw a delay in the investments by major 
customers during the year. Connected 
Devices revenue decreased as expected, 
by $11.9 million to $84.6 million. This was 
due to two factors: the continued decrease 
in device carrier acceptance testing with 
an new impact of $4.9 million, and our 
discontinuance of the Device Intelligence 
and Developer Tools product lines, a 
reduction of $7.0 million, with a further 
impact in comparative numbers for 2018 
of $5.9 million. Adjusting for the latter 
total underlying Group revenue was 
slightly up by $3.9 million.
