 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2
Chairman’s Statement
Sir Michael Heller
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2017 
was £5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the previous year, an increase of 3%. At the 
half-year stage, we reported that sales activity 
had improved modestly compared to the 
previous year and that continued into the 
second half in spite of a challenging market.
Adjusted operating profit was £540,000, 
compared with £430,000 last year, an 
increase of 26%. This profit measure, 
which excludes non-cash IFRS items and 
exceptional non-trading costs, is reconciled 
to statutory operating profit in note 4 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
As management exercised tight control 
to maintain overheads at similar levels to 
the previous year, the increase in sales had 
a significant impact on operating profit.
Statutory pre-tax profit for the year also 
increased to £417,000 compared with 
£244,000 the prior year, an increase of 
71%. Last year’s result included one-off 
property costs of £104,000 relating to a 
property that we have now sold. Adjusting 
for that item would result in an increase 
in statutory pre-tax profit of 20%. 
Contracted recurring revenues, which 
comprise annual software licence fees and 
periodic hosting charges, remained strong 
at 80% of total revenues (2016: 82%). 
Revenues delivered through our hosting 
centre continued to increase and in the year 
under review represented 61% of total 
revenues (2016: 59%).
R&D cash expenditure for the year was 
£901,000 (2016: £982,000) and was 
principally focussed on continued 
enhancements to our key products, 
Quantum VS and Vecta.
As previously reported, we sold our remaining 
surplus freehold property for £1.2 million in 
December 2016. The property’s carrying value 
had previously been adjusted to reflect the 
expected net sale proceeds which, after 
disposal costs, amounted to £1.17 million. 
The process that we started some years ago, 
to dispose of six freehold properties which 
had become surplus to operating requirements, 
has generated more than £7 million of cash 
which has supported distributions to 
shareholders in excess of £11 million 
over the same period.
At the year end our cash balances were 
£6.4 million compared with £5.4 million last 
year. The increase reflects the proceeds 
from the sale of property referred to above. 
Operating cash flows were £580,000 
(2016: £818,000) and dividends paid 
amounted to £635,000 (2016: £631,000).
Net assets at 30 September 2017 were 
£6.4 million compared to £3.2 million at 
30 September 2016. This significant increase 
is principally due to the elimination of the 
deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme 
under IAS 19. Net of deferred tax, the position 
on the scheme has improved by £3.4 million 
during the year due largely to improved 
surrender terms for the scheme’s principal 
asset. This matter is explained further in 
the Chief Executive’s Statement.
The Directors are proposing to pay a final 
dividend of 3.0p per share (2016: 3.0p) 
giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p, 
the same as last year. Total cash dividends 
paid to shareholders will therefore amount 
to £635,000. If approved by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 6 April 2018 
to those shareholders on the register at 
9 March 2018. The shares will be ex-dividend 
on 8 March 2018. 
We announced last year that we are carrying 
out a strategic review of the business. As 
previously reported, uncertainty over the 
pension scheme valuation since March 2017 
has impacted on the strategic review process 
and caused it to take longer than originally 
expected. However, the process is continuing 
now that the actuarial valuation of the scheme 
has been completed. Should the strategic 
review process not result in an acceptable 
offer being made for the Company, the 
Board confirms that it intends to consider 
returning an amount of cash to shareholders 
subject to any constraints on distributable 
reserves and the rules of the Takeover Code. 
However, it should be noted that the 
improvement in the Group’s net asset 
position referred to above positively 
impacts our distributable reserves. The 
Company will update shareholders further 
when it is in a position to do so.
I would like to thank all our members 
of staff and my colleagues on the Board 
for their contribution during the year.
With a strong, cash-generative business 
model and a debt-free balance sheet I remain 
confident that the business is well positioned 
for the future.
