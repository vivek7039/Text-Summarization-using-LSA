UK & Europe
Introduction
Arena UK & Europe moved into its new six-acre 
state-of-the-art site in April 2017, with 3,700sqm of 
warehouse space and modern offices over two storeys, 
providing a centralised operations base servicing 
structures, seating, interior design, carpentry and 
ice rinks. Having such an impressive base for our 
operations has delivered greater efficiencies, better 
serving the Group’s operations and providing new 
employment and career progression for our people. 
The move into the new St Ives hub was backed up with 
the creation of a new sales and project management 
office in Membury and a huge centralised furniture 
warehouse supporting our UK events and the Group’s 
London tableware operation, Well Dressed Tables. 
The floatation and subsequent investment into 
infrastructure has underpinned our acquisition of GLD 
Productions, adding experienced staff, new product 
ranges and new clients to our furniture hire division. 
The sheer scale of our inventory of events equipment 
is staggering, and was boosted by the purchase of the 
seating and mass participation divisions of Wernick 
Events, including more than 30,000 temporary seats, 
back in the spring.
Outlook for 2018
2018 looks set to be an even bigger year. We have 
renewed many of our long-term contracts and have 
a number of fantastic new projects providing a whole 
set of exciting challenges for our delivery teams. It’s 
a Ryder Cup year, and we will once again be heavily 
involved delivering event infrastructure in Paris. Our 
special projects team is also focussed on Tokyo for 
Rugby World Cup and Olympic related opportunities.  
I am pleased to be able to confirm over £3 million 
of capital investment to ensure that our products 
continually exceed expectations on quality. As always, 
we ensure that health and safety is at the centre of 
everything we do.

Nitto ATP World Tour Finals 
We worked on the ATP World Tour Finals for the 
eighth year, continuing our tradition of improving our 
offering to the tournament, now sponsored by Nitto 
each year. Our bespoke I-Novation building was the

finished I-Novation structure contained the sponsors’ 
area, players’ lounge, players’ restaurant and tennis 
family area overlooking the main practice court. We 
also supplied extensive media facilities, lighting, floor 
covering, air conditioning, temporary ceilings, walls,

Americas
Introduction
This was a year in which the Americas division posted 
several solid results. Our overall financial performance 
was on target, a result that was made possible by the

launched Well Dressed Tables in the Milwaukee and 
Illinois markets during the last quarter of the year.
Outlook for 2018
Overall, the division has also set some aggressive 
growth targets over the next five years, which will lead 
to some dramatic expansion as we look to continue 
to provide the highest quality work to our clients both 
new and longstanding.

Dubai World Trade Centre 
In February 2017, Arena was awarded the design and 
build contract to extend the centre’s exhibition halls, 
becoming the sole contractor for the entire project. 
Beginning in May and completing in September, 
Harlequin Arena’s team were rightly proud of the 
finished work, which stands as a strong example of 
how the company can transform existing spaces.
CJ Cup 
The CJ Cup is the first PGA Tour-sanctioned regular 
season tournament to be held in South Korea and 
as such is creating huge interest not just in Korea 
but internationally. Asia Tents Arena was contracted 
to provide extensive temporary event infrastructure 
at The Club @ Nine Bridges on Jeju Island for the 
tournament, which took place from October 16th-22nd, 
2017. We provided multiple single and double-deck
