 Group Chief Executive’s Review
Vitec operates in the fast-growing, global “image 
capture and sharing” market. Technology and 
social media continue to drive fundamental 
changes to this market. Vitec’s unique heritage, 
the credibility of our premium products, and our 
manufacturing and distribution strengths, provide 
us with exciting opportunities to capitalise on those 
changes. These, coupled with the experience and 
knowledge of our people, enable us to develop 
ground-breaking new products. 
2017 was a transformational year for Vitec as  
we significantly reshaped our portfolio through 
disposals and acquisitions. The Group sold two 
non-core businesses and invested in new markets, 
geographies and technologies. We announced  
that from 1 January 2018 we would move from 
two to three Divisions to reflect a changing 
customer base, to enable us to adapt quickly  
to market and technological changes, and to give 
greater focus to the fast-growing Independent 
Content Creator market. 
Our new three Divisions – Imaging Solutions, 
Production Solutions and Creative Solutions –  
are highly customer-focused and operate in a 
decentralised, entrepreneurial structure, yet share 
capabilities across the Group. 
Although we continued to experience challenging 
market conditions in the more mature US 
broadcast market, this was offset by growth  
in sales of higher technology products  
and acquisitions. 
Vitec has a clear growth strategy which is focused 
on organic sales growth, operational efficiencies 
and corporate development. 2017 saw significant 
progress executing our strategy which is based 
around five priorities.  
1. Corporate development
We supplement our organic growth opportunities 
with carefully targeted acquisitions. Our acquisition 
strategy focuses on finding innovative businesses 
operating within our core, or closely adjacent, 
markets which possess the right product 
development, growth characteristics and  
financial prospects. 
During the year, we streamlined our portfolio by 
disposing of the non-core businesses – Haigh-Farr 
and Bexel, our US Services business, for net 
consideration of £33.2 million. In September 2017, 
we acquired the JOBY and Lowepro brands for our 
Imaging Solutions Division, for cash consideration 
of £8.4 million excluding integration costs and 
investment in working capital. JOBY is best known 
for its patented GorillaPod tripod and Lowepro is the 
leading camera bag brand. This acquisition is an 
excellent strategic fit with Vitec’s existing core 
activities and integration is going well. 
In September 2017, we also announced the 
acquisition of RTMotion for our Creative Solutions 
Division, for up to £3.1 million in net cash. RTMotion 
is a high technology business which gives the Group 
additional high quality camera accessories for the 
expanding Independent Content Creator market. 
This business has been successfully integrated into 
Creative Solutions and its products are being sold 
under the Teradek brand name as Teradek RT.    
2. Improve the core 
We continue to maximise and improve our 
business to better deliver underlying growth, and  
in 2017 Vitec delivered operational efficiencies 
through improvements to purchasing, inventory 
management and manufacturing. We achieved 
further lean manufacturing savings in our Italian 
and Costa Rican facilities, and are currently 
moving our manufacturing operations from 
Shelton, US to Costa Rica. In H1 2018, the 
Production Solutions Division will relocate its  
Bury St. Edmunds, UK facility to a purpose-built 
manufacturing site nearby that will deliver further 
operational improvements. We also expect to 
identify additional operational synergies across  
the Group in the medium-term. 
We continue to demonstrate innovation throughout 
our businesses. In 2017 we launched a range  
of new products, including the revolutionary 
Flowtech carbon-fibre tripod, Internet Protocol 
prompters from Autoscript, Litepanels Gemini  
LED lights and compact tripods from Manfrotto.  
We also celebrated the 100-year anniversary of 
our Gitzo brand. 
In 2018 we will maintain our market leadership  
by focusing on maximising sales of these and 
other new products, and continuing to innovate 
with new products and new technologies.  
In addition, our Production Solutions Division  
is currently supporting the 2018 Winter  
Olympics in South Korea.  
3. New markets and technologies
We have maintained investment in new technology 
and markets to underpin future growth. For 
example, in 2017 we further expanded our product 
offering in Apple stores with our newly acquired 
JOBY brand, and the RTMotion acquisition has 
performed in line with expectations.
We innovate quickly and we released a range  
of high quality products, including SmallHD Ultra 
Bright Monitors, a Wooden Camera Universal 
Follow Focus, a new Teradek Cube HEVC encoder, 
and Teradek Serv Pro, a dedicated iOS monitoring 
solution. We also launched a number of cross-
2017 was a transformational year 
for the Group
Vitec’s transformed 
portfolio of businesses 
and new operating 
structure have 
repositioned the  
Group to deliver  
future progress.

The V itec Group plc           Group products, developing synergies between 
Vitec brands. Examples include a SmallHD monitor 
with a built-in Teradek Bolt wireless receiver,  
a SmallHD Focus monitor with an Anton/Bauer 
battery, and a Manfrotto/Wooden Camera Directors 
Cage for DSLR and mirrorless cameras. We remain 
focused on further cross-selling of brands across 
the Group, especially to our Independent Content 
Creator customers. We also continue to identify 
acquisition opportunities to address new areas  
of the content production value chain.  
4. Get closer to our customers
We continue to drive initiatives to get closer to our 
customers by owning more of our distribution and 
optimising our e-commerce activities. Our end 
markets are changing with more independent 
content creators looking to purchase equipment 
online and we are investing in and optimising our 
e-commerce capabilities through working with our 
major customers like Amazon and other specialised 
e-tailers, and by further developing our own online 
platforms. Our Creative Solutions Division has 
invested in a number of “Customer Experience 
Centres”, tying our many Creative Solutions brands 
together to offer bundled products as well as 
educational workshops.  
5. Expand in APAC
Finally, we continue to expand geographically, 
especially in APAC, leveraging our current 
capabilities and footprint. Our Imaging Solutions 
Division has an efficient and widespread distribution 
network throughout the region and deals directly 
with the leading retailers and e-tailers. The 
acquisition of the JOBY and Lowepro brands has 
brought in specialist teams in Hong Kong and China. 
APAC is the fastest growing region for Vitec, and we 
see further growth opportunities in this area.  
We will utilise our current networks to distribute 
other Vitec brands with a specific focus on growing 
our Creative Solutions Division, initially in China.  
2017 Performance Overview
Vitec is pleased to report a record performance, 
with strong growth in revenue and adjusted profit 
before tax*. It has been a transformational year for 
the Group, which saw the acquisition of the JOBY 
and Lowepro brands. 
We launched a record number of market-leading 
new products and made significant progress 
refocusing our portfolio with the disposal of  
two non-core businesses. 
Our Imaging Solutions Division had a strong  
year and continues to outperform the market.  
The integration of the JOBY and Lowepro brands  
is going well. 
The Production Solutions Division benefitted  
from sales of new products, including the 
revolutionary Flowtech tripod, although the  
US studio market continued to experience 
challenging market conditions. 
Our Creative Solutions Division further expanded  
its higher technology products with the acquisition 
of RTMotion. SmallHD, in particular, grew strongly.  
Product Development
We recognise that the markets in which we 
operate are quick to change and evolve, so we 
innovate quickly and invest in new products and 
solutions to add to our already well respected 
range. We are very pleased with the new products 
we launched this year and continue to build on 
those with synergistic efficiencies where possible 
to create world-class solutions for our customers. 
Examples of our new products can be seen in the 
Operational Review which starts on page 18. 
Approval of Strategic Report
We have provided information in this report on our 
strategy, business model, and objectives. You will 
find the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 41 and its 
content has been approved by the Board.
Outlook
We have outlined a number of initiatives for 
medium-term organic growth, particularly in  
the Independent Content Creator market and in 
APAC, and will continue to identify operational 
improvements and businesses to acquire in core 
and adjacent markets. Strong cash generation  
and a robust balance sheet will support these 
growth plans. 
Vitec has a strong position in exciting and fast 
changing markets. With our transformed portfolio 
of businesses, new structure and growth 
initiatives, the Board remains confident that,  
at current exchange rates, the Group is well 
positioned to deliver further progress in 2018.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 For a business like Vitec, intelligent and sustained 
investment in new markets, technologies, products 
and people enables us to retain our market-leading 
positions and create shareholder value in the future.
The “image capture and sharing” market is rapidly 
changing and we continue to identify and make 
appropriate, value-adding acquisitions to 
supplement our organic activities and enable  
us to benefit from those changes.
Our unique heritage, experienced people and the 
credibility of our established, premium brands allow 
us to find attractive, high quality businesses in our 
core or adjacent markets, technologies and 
geographies to achieve our growth objectives. 
We completed two acquisitions in 2017 and the 
pipeline of potential acquisitions continued to  
build during the year.

Group Chief Executive’s Review
Sustained investment 
in new markets and 
technologies
“I’ve been in the imaging industry for over 10 years working 
with the JOBY and Lowepro brands globally. We were 
acquired by the Vitec Group in September 2017. It’s been 
such a positive experience to join a diverse team of talented 
professionals who are dedicated to the same core values 
within the industry we love.” 
Tim Grimmer, Senior Brand Director, JOBY and Lowepro 
The V itec Group plc          
08 RTMotion
The acquisition of RTMotion is in line with 
Vitec’s strategy of offering innovative and 
highly technical solutions to the Group’s 
established independent content creator 
customer base, and will facilitate Vitec’s 
growth in the higher technology area of 
camera accessories.
Based in the UK, RTMotion designs and manufactures lens control 
systems for video cameras used to make feature films and television 
series, for example, “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Planet Earth II”.
RTMotion has been successfully integrated into our Creative Solutions 
Division. There are significant growth opportunities to sell RTMotion’s 
products through our global sales and distributor network, and the 
business will benefit from Vitec’s marketing, manufacturing and supply 
chain capabilities. 
“We have admired Vitec’s vision 
and breadth of expertise for some 
time, and are extremely excited to 
be joining the Group alongside 
industry leaders such as Teradek 
and SmallHD. This acquisition will 
give us world-leading support in 
marketing, reseller channels and 
strategic management.” 
Kris Bird, Co-founder of RTMotion
As part of Vitec’s strategy to improve our core business and get closer 
to our customers, we acquired the JOBY and Lowepro brands. JOBY 
introduced the patented GorillaPod tripod which has transformed the 
camera accessories market and has a strong presence in Apple 
stores. Lowepro has been a market leader in bags designed to protect 
electronic and camera devices since 1967.
JOBY and Lowepro products are designed by dedicated marketing 
resources located in California, US, and engineered by expert 
innovation teams based in the Far East. All products are manufactured 
by third parties with proprietary tools and sold globally through the 
Vitec Imaging Distribution network.
This acquisition strengthens and complements Vitec’s existing product 
portfolio. It gives us:
•  A leading global position in the new and fast growing iphoneography, 
mobile journalism and vlogging markets, as well as the camera bags 
market, bringing in an expanded product development team and 
technical capabilities with access to new intellectual property;
•  Increased retail presence, particularly in the US, making Vitec 
Imaging Distribution a leading distributor of premium imaging 
accessories in the largest global economies;
•  The opportunity to get closer to customers by consolidating Vitec’s 
strategic relationships with Apple and online retailers such as 
Amazon and T-Mall, the leading consumer electronics retailers,  
B&H and specialist retailers; and
•  A platform to expand further in APAC and strengthen the Group’s 
presence in China and Hong Kong through the JOBY and Lowepro 
teams who are based there. 
Vitec is integrating JOBY and Lowepro into its Imaging Solutions 
Division’s existing organisational structure, under the leadership  
of Marco Pezzana, Divisional Chief Executive, Vitec Imaging Solutions.  
In addition to enabling greater penetration of 
adjacent market segments, stronger retail 
presence and improved innovation capabilities, 
the integration of JOBY and Lowepro into 
Vitec’s Imaging Solutions Division is expected 
to deliver substantial operational synergies  
in procurement, logistics and distribution 
across all divisional brands. 
JOBY and Lowepro
Acquiring the JOBY and Lowepro brands 
demonstrates Vitec’s commitment to 
expanding our portfolio of premium branded 
products for the imaging and Independent 
Content Creator markets. These leading 
brands give us greater access to new 
markets and expand our retail presence, 
especially in the US, by adding high quality, 
complementary products.

Investing in 
manufacturing  
excellence 
Focussed on safety,  
quality, efficiency, cost 
and on-time delivery, 
manufacturing excellence 
is one of Vitec’s core 
competitive strengths. 
Our strategy is to continuously 
improve and optimise our 
manufacturing and assembly 
operations globally to maximise 
quality, service and efficiency, 
while reducing costs. We operate 
manufacturing facilities in the UK, 
Italy and Costa Rica, and assembly 
operations in a number of locations 
in the US. In 2017, we invested 
significantly in our facilities. 
We operate competitive, flexible 
manufacturing operations which 
deliver premium products and 
reliability to our markets. Vitec’s 
facilities follow lean principles and, 
where appropriate, are automated. 
Our supply chain is efficient and 
our people are highly trained, multi-
skilled, and focused on continuous 
improvement. Our “improve the core” 
strategic priority is focused on driving 
further efficiency and investing 
appropriately to support our wider 
growth plans and deliver increasing 
returns to our shareholders.
The provision of a healthy, safe and 
productive work environment for  
all of our employees is a high priority  
for Vitec across all sites. We continue 
to implement initiatives aimed at 
sustainability and protecting the 
environment across all of our locations. 
Feltre, Italy
Vitec Centre of Excellence for high 
volume heads and tripods
Vitec manufactures 80% of the supports for 
its Imaging Solutions Division in our Italian 
facility, across our Manfrotto, Gitzo and 
Avenger brands. The 320,000 ft
2
 site was 
established in 1986 and employs around  
400 people. Vitec is the largest manufacturer 
of branded supports in the world, with over 
three million units produced annually.  
As a result of our investment in people, lean 
processes and automation, our premium 
supports are produced more efficiently in  
Italy than elsewhere. “Made in Italy” is  
a distinct competitive advantage in this 
market and in October 2017 we moved  
the manufacturing of our Manfrotto Befree 
Advanced tripod from China to Italy. Our  
new automatic aluminium tube cutting and 
punching machine is capable of producing 
one tube every four seconds, is seamlessly 
linked to the new assembly lines and gives a 
high throughput of consistently high quality 
products. This tube machine received its 
Industry 4.0 certification at the end of 2017. 
Bury St. Edmunds, UK
Vitec Centre of Excellence for 
robotics and Flowtech
Vitec’s Production Solutions Division will 
relocate its Bury St. Edmunds operation into  
a new, purpose-built site nearby in H1 2018. 
Replacing the 50-year old existing factory, 
the new facility will specialise in advanced 
technology in areas such as robotics, 
automation and broadcast studio equipment 
for our Vinten and Sachtler brands. It will 
include a fully automated, highly efficient  
and proprietary process for the development 
of carbon fibre for the Flowtech tripod, which 
maintains our product differentiation and 
competitive edge. Vitec has invested 
significantly in the new, 66,000 ft
2
 site  
which will house around 180 people across 
manufacturing, engineering, operations and 
other functions, and produces approximately 
20,000 units annually. Our focus on 
continuous improvement has led to 
productivity, work flow and space utilisation 
improvements and resulted in the new site 
having a smaller footprint. 
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, UK
Vitec Centre of Excellence for 
Imaging Solutions lighting controls
Vitec acquired the Lastolite lights business in 
2011 for its Imaging Solutions Division and 
has transformed this factory into its specialist 
centre for the production of lighting controls, 
reflectors, backgrounds, umbrellas, soft boxes 
and flash accessories. With around 60 people 
the 43,000 ft
2
 factory produces 360,000 high 
quality, durable units annually. This business 
has remained highly competitive against 
mainly Far Eastern competitors due to its 
continuous improvement methodology and 
the experienced gained from its sister facility 
in Italy.
Cartago, Costa Rica
Vitec Centre of Excellence for  
low volume heads, tripods  
and batteries
Vitec selected Costa Rica for one of its main 
manufacturing and engineering facilities 
because of its educated workforce, its 
proximity to our largest market (North 
America), its low cost base, and its stable 
government. Our Costa Rica facility 
manufactures heads, tripods and camera 
accessories for the Vinten, Sachtler, OConnor 
and Anton/Bauer brands in our Production 
Solutions Division. The site was established in 
1985 and has approximately 180 employees 
producing over 50,000 products annually,  
in a 65,000 ft
2
 facility. The Costa Rica facility 
has invested heavily in introducing lean 
principals to make it one of the most efficient 
manufacturing facilities in Central America.
We are in the process of consolidating our 
manufacturing operations from Shelton,  
US to Costa Rica.
