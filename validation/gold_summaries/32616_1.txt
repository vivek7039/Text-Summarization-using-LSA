Chief Executive Officer’s review
Focusing and simplifying 
around our best growth 
opportunities
The impact of the actions taken to confront 
the challenges we have faced leave the  
Group with a clean balance sheet and  
a leaner operating structure on which we 
intend to build and grow. The Group’s 
profitability run-rate has been materially 
improved and we are now well-placed  
to take advantage of existing and future 
opportunities within our core businesses. 
The Specials division (‘Specials’) remains 
profitable and cash generative, providing a 
strong platform for our development programme 
that is predominantly focused on unlicensed-to-
licensed (‘UL2L ’) products. The trading 
performance of the Niche Pharmaceuticals 
division (‘Niche’) has been transformed by the 
successful launch of a number of products 
during the year and post year-end, including  
our largest product to date Glycopyrronium 
Bromide Oral Solution 1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’), and 
the elimination of on-going losses, unnecessary 
costs and marginal activities. In addition, the 
drive to grow our network of commercial 
partnerships is showing clear signs of progress. 
Our focus on the two core pillars of Specials  
and Niche will continue to drive 
performance improvement.
The long-term fit of the Medication Adherence 
(‘MA’) division within the Group, particularly 
given its low gross margin contribution,  
is under review.
A focused and simplified strategy
Following the conclusion of a strategic review 
performed during the year, we have refocused 
and simplified the business to:
• Closely align our business model to the UK 
prescribing hierarchy by moving products 
from an unlicensed-to-licensed status.
• Maintain market-leading position in the 
specials market whilst we progress the 
development and licensing of products  
in our pipeline where we have a 
competitive advantage.
• Invest in our UL2L development 
programme to license key unlicensed 
specials so that we can protect and grow 
our market share and secure economies 
of scale.
• Broaden our network of commercial 
partnerships to secure multiple routes  
to market for our product portfolio.
UL2L prioritisation
Prioritising our UL2L product developments 
delivered through Niche, emphasising those 
products where we can be first to market,  
is a key part of our strategy. This type of 
development plays to our strengths, with  
less time and investment needed to penetrate 
the market and achieve scale.
Having simplified the product portfolio to 
prioritise development of the Group’s top 
specials licensing opportunities, it currently 
comprises 57 products. 19 of these products 
have been launched or out-licensed in the UK, 
with 12 having been commercialised 
post-simplification. The overall performance  
of these products since simplification has 
been very good, with the benefits of portfolio 
rationalisation evident. A further 3 products 
have been licensed in the UK and are in the 
process of being commercialised. There are 
an additional 35 products in various phases  
of development, of which 25 are UL2L 
developments. All developments are currently 
progressing to timetable. Going forward we 
I am pleased to report that  
the Group has made excellent 
progress in implementing its 
more focused and simplified 
strategy and that our 
performance in the second  
half of the year was very 
encouraging. 11
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report 
will provide updates with respect to our 
licensed product portfolio as part of our 
interim and final results communications.
In order to release investment capacity  
to support UL2L prioritisation we have 
cancelled all development programmes where 
we cannot identify a commercial partnership 
and do not believe we can commercialise the 
opportunity ourselves. As a consequence, 
£7.2m of balance sheet investment in these 
products has been impaired, which is a key 
constituent of the reported statutory 
operating loss.
Broadening our commercial partnerships
Our non-UL2L portfolio is comprised of niche 
generic products where, although we will not 
have first-mover advantage and significant 
sales and marketing capability will likely be 
required to market them, we believe there 
remains a market opportunity.
Past experience tells us that taking share  
from incumbent competitors can be very 
challenging without an existing sales and 
marketing capability, and that converting 
these non-UL2L opportunities takes time  
and significant investment unless there is  
an established market presence.
We have therefore taken steps to commercialise 
selected non-UL2L products in our portfolio 
by partnering with other businesses that have 
more experience of taking generic products  
to market, which will help us to commercialise 
these developments to their fullest potential 
and accelerate our access to revenues through 
revenue-sharing agreements. We are progressing 
partnerships to support this strategy.
International opportunities
Our product pipeline holds significant value 
potential. In the UK market, the Group is 
well-established due to its existing infrastructure 
and commercial relationships built through our 
market-leading Specials division. We also 
have extensive experience and understanding 
of the UK’s development and regulatory 
approval process as governed by the MHRA 
through the activities of our Niche division. Our 
strategic position in the UK is therefore strong.
We are currently seeking to realise the 
potential of our product portfolio beyond  
the UK and extend our reach into other 
geographies by broadening our network  
of international commercial partnerships. 
These partnerships will seek to emphasise 
both export and localised manufacture 
together with distribution opportunities to 
secure market access without the need  
to establish our own local presence.
Consolidating our position  
in the specials market
Our Specials division continues to perform 
robustly and reliably, and is cash generative. 
This resilient performance is particularly 
encouraging given the increasing competitiveness 
and regulatory pressure within the specials 
market. We have cemented our market-
leading position by agreeing new long-term 
exclusive supply contracts with three of the 
largest UK wholesale and pharmacy chains, 
being AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited, Bestway 
Panacea Healthcare Limited, trading as 
Well Pharmacy, and Phoenix Healthcare 
Distribution Limited. Quantum Pharmaceutical 
Limited, a business within the Specials 
division, is the UK market leader in the supply 
of unlicensed medicines and around 89% of 
its volumes are under exclusive contracts.
Our attention is now turning to driving 
operational efficiencies and improvements in 
the Specials division to underpin profitability 
and provide us with the commercial agility 
necessary to react to market dynamics.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
NuPharm closure
Following a period of sustained trading losses, 
the Board took the decision in October 2016 
to commence consultation on the closure of 
NuPharm. Trading ceased at NuPharm in 
January 2017 in line with our stated intention 
and it was placed into administration on 
26 April 2017 following an orderly 
closure process.
The total loss incurred on the closure of 
NuPharm is £13.7m, which reflects trading 
losses and closure costs of £1.7m, and 
£12.0m of written down balance sheet 
investment. This loss is shown as a 
discontinued operation in the consolidated 
income statement as NuPharm’s activities as 
a contract manufacturer are considered to be 
a separate major line of business. The cash 
impact of NuPharm’s trading losses and 
closure costs during the year was £2.4m.
Divisional review
Niche Pharmaceuticals division (‘Niche’)
The financial year ended 31 January 2017  
has been a pivotal year for the Niche division 
following the launch of a number of new 
products, the most significant of which has 
been Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral Solution 
1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’), and substantial operational 
changes to focus and simplify the business  
in line with our strategy.
Revenue grew 35% during the year to  
£5.8m (2016: £4.3m), driven primarily by the 
contribution from Glyco following its launch  
in August 2016. Adjusted EBITDA contracted 
by 33% to £1.4m (2016: £2.1m) with Glyco’s 
trading contribution offset by a reduction  
in out-licensing income of £0.5m and an 
increased operating cost base that has now 
been addressed.
The adjusted EBITDA monthly run-rate  
of Colonis Pharma Limited (‘Colonis’), the 
commercialisation arm of the Niche division,  
has been transformed during the second half  
of the year. During the first half of the year 
Colonis had invested ahead of meaningful sales 
activity to support the launch of a number of 
products in the portfolio where we needed 
engagement with healthcare professionals.
Following the decision to prioritise UL2L 
developments a number of underperforming 
product lines were discontinued, including the 
Mucodis range and Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU. 
This decision has allowed the division to focus 
investment on what it believes are the right 
products and stop on-going investment in the 
discontinued products, yielding significant 
savings. Colonis therefore exited the year with 
a positive monthly adjusted EBITDA run-rate, 
underpinned by strong contributions from 
Glyco alongside a number of other launched 
products, and a lower cost base.
In addition to Glyco, we launched several 
other products during the second half of  
the year and just after the year-end, which  
are delivering in line with management 
expectations. These include:
• Aviticol
™
 and Colecalciferol capsules 
(licensed for the treatment and prevention 
of vitamin D deficiency) in an 800 IU 
strength in July 2016 and 1,000 IU strength 
in August 2016;
• Metformin Oral Solution (licensed for  
the treatment of type 2 diabetes) in 
500mg/5ml, 850mg/5ml and 1,000mg/5ml 
strengths in December 2016; 
• Folic Acid Oral Solution 1mg/1ml (licensed 
for the treatment of folate deficiency) and 
Acetylcysteine Sachets 200mg (licensed  
as a mucolytic) during February and  
March post year-end; and
• Levothyroxine Oral Solution (indicated  
for hyperthyroidism) in 25mcg/5ml, 
50mcg/5ml and 100mcg/5ml strengths 
launched in April 2017.
Lamda Laboratories SA (‘Lamda’), the product 
development and licensing arm of the Niche 
division, delivered another good performance. 
The development pipeline is now fully integrated 
at Lamda, absorbing around 60% of Lamda’s 
total development capacity this year. The 
business has also continued to generate strong 
development, supply and royalty revenue from  
a range of third-party projects.
Specials division (‘Specials’)
The Specials division delivered another solid 
performance during the year, generating 89%  
of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA before Group 
costs. The division provides a strong platform  
for our product development and licensing 
activities, as well as valuable insights into trends 
within the specials market that we use to inform 
our new product development decisions.
Revenue increased by 7% to £57.6m  
(2016: £53.6m) and adjusted EBITDA 
contracted by 6% to £10.1m (2016: £10.7m). 
Sales order volumes in Quantum 
Pharmaceutical Limited (‘QPL ’) increased by 
6%, supported by volumes gained as a result 
of the acquisition of 281 Sainsbury’s stores  
by Lloyds Pharmacy in September. This was 
partly offset by the impact of our licensing of 
Glyco in August 2016, which cannibalised 
some existing specials sales.
The drive to secure efficiency savings across 
the NHS continues to create pricing pressures 
and changes to prescribing trends in favour  
of more cost-effective medicines. We are 
seeing this most notably through a gradual 
shift towards prescription of tariff medicines  
in place of clinically equivalent but sometimes 
more expensive non-tariff alternatives. This has 
been a feature of the industry for a number  
of years and we are continuing to manage  
this dynamic through a variety of initiatives, 
including margin improvement through the 
manufacture of more products in-house as 
opposed to external sourcing.
QPL was also successful in retaining all  
major key accounts during the year, including 
securing a five-year exclusive supply relationship 
with our largest customer, AAH Pharmaceuticals 
Limited, which supplies over 1,800 Lloyds 
Pharmacy stores and 8,000 independents  13
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report 
across the UK. Post the year-end we entered 
into long-term exclusive supply agreements 
with Bestway Panacea Healthcare Limited, 
trading as Well Pharmacy, and Phoenix 
Healthcare Distribution Limited, who supply 
Rowlands pharmacies, for two and three 
years respectively. Securing these agreements 
mean we supply three out of the four largest 
national pharmacy chains in the UK on an 
exclusive basis, satisfying all of their 
unlicensed medicine and special obtain 
demand. Around 89% of our specials and 
special obtains sales volumes in QPL are 
sourced from customers with whom we have 
an exclusive supply relationship, providing  
us with good visibility over our future 
revenue potential.
UL Medicines Limited, which primarily serves 
the hospitals sector, exited the year strongly 
following a softer first half. The business 
continues to consolidate its position as one of 
the leading suppliers of unlicensed imported 
medicines to the NHS. Following the result of 
the EU referendum in June 2016, the business 
has faced challenges relating to the impact  
of Sterling weakness on the cost of imported 
lines, however underlying hospital volumes are 
growing and the business has benefited from 
temporary supply opportunities following 
shortages of licensed products. 
Medication Adherence division (‘MA’)
The MA division comprises Total Medication 
Management Services Limited (trading as 
‘Biodose Services’), a homecare dispensary 
and delivery business, and Protomed Limited, 
which provides medication management 
services through Biodose, its innovative 
multi-dose tray system. Divisional revenue 
increased by 125% to £25.4m (2016: £11.3m), 
driven by Biodose Services, which secured a 
number of new homecare contracts and saw 
continued growth in the Stork Fertility Service 
(‘Stork’). The division delivered an adjusted 
EBITDA loss in the year of £0.2m (2016: £0.4m 
profit) overall, however the division was generating 
monthly profits as it exited the year.
The significant revenue base in the MA 
division is due to Biodose Services and the 
inherent characteristics of its homecare 
business model. The business model requires 
high-value medicines to be dispensed and 
delivered to patients at home, which results  
in high levels of revenue and costs and a low 
gross margin profile.
Trading in Protomed has been steady as  
the number of patients benefiting from the 
multi-dose tray system has remained similar to 
last year. The business has historically sought 
to commercialise Biodose Connect
™
, which  
is an extension of the multi-dose tray system. 
It allows carers and clinicians to remotely 
monitor a patient’s adherence to their 
medication regime. It has become clear that 
Biodose Connect
™
 will require substantial 
further investment to establish it in the 
domiciliary care market, which is no longer  
a core area of focus for the Group.
Following our decision to focus our efforts  
on our core Specials and Niche businesses, 
we have commenced a strategic review of the 
MA division to conclude on its long-term fit 
within the Group.
Summary and outlook
I am very pleased with the progress we  
have made to date. We have driven a step 
change in the profitability of the Niche 
Pharmaceuticals division in the second half  
by focusing on launching and commercialising 
products where we have a competitive 
advantage. In addition, the Group has 
cemented its position as the UK’s market-
leading specials business by renewing 
exclusive contracts with three of the four main 
wholesale and pharmacy chains in the UK. 
Operating costs across the Group have been 
reduced and our net debt position at the 
year-end was lower than expected at £13.0m. 
We exited the financial year with a much 
improved profitability run-rate that is 
supportive of market expectations for the 
current financial year and we are well-placed 
to deliver future growth by focusing on our 
core Niche and Specials businesses.
