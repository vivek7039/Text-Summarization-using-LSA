 Strategic Report
A Note  
from Our CEO
Fellow shareholders,
In 2017, IDH again delivered superior operational and 
financial performance despite ongoing macroeconomic 
challenges in Egypt, our largest market. We have also ex-
panded our geographic reach with an investment in Nigeria 
in early 2018, adding a fourth country to our platform.
We close the year as a leading consumer healthcare com-
pany in the Middle East and Africa. Our proven business 
model allowed us to deliver revenue growth of 29% in 
2017, reflecting our ability to deliver high-quality medical 
diagnostic services to more than six million patients as 
measured by 26 million tests. We now look to sustain that 
performance thanks to our presence in Egypt and Nigeria 
— two of Africa’s largest and most populous countries — 
as well as our operations in Jordan and Sudan.
Strong operational and Financial performance
Our revenues were very strong throughout the 2017 year, 
increasing 29% year-on-year to EGP 1,514 million. Whilst 
patient and test volumes gained 9% and 7%, respectively, 
the power of the Group’s brands and the favourable impact 
of our tactical marketing campaigns can be seen most 
clearly in the recovery in volumes that is under way in our 
higher-margin walk-in patient category. Walk-in patient 
revenues grew 29% period-on-period as patient volumes 
rose 2% compared with a year-earlier decrease of 4%;  and 
test volumes rose 7% versus a 2% year-ago decline. 
Understanding that protracted high inflation in Egypt has 
had the most significant impact on our patients who pay 
for their own healthcare, we have developed our market-
ing programs to target them with a strong health aware-
ness message in combination with a compelling value 
component. This includes offering bundled diagnostic test 
packages for lifestyle-related diseases and chronic health 
conditions; an in-house point redemption system; and bank 
partnerships for more affordable payment plans. Moreover, 
in recognition of the pressures being felt by all our patients, 
We enter 2018 in a strong financial 
position with an under-leveraged 
and highly cash-generative balance 
sheet that provides us with 
strategic flexibility
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 12 our price increases have been significantly below the high 
rates of inflation caused by the November 2016 devaluation 
of the Egyptian pound. The brand equity we have built over 
many years has translated into strong loyalty among the 
millions of patients who came to know and trust us long 
before facing the current inflationary pressures.
We continued to expand our geographic footprint in 2017, 
bringing our total network of laboratories to 383 with 
8% annual unit growth. We opened 23 new branches in 
Egypt, four in Jordan and two in Sudan. It is noteworthy 
that our subsidiaries in both Jordan and Sudan continued 
their steady growth last year, together contributing 17% 
of consolidated sales and 9% of consolidated EBITDA last 
year. In Sudan, the recent lifting of longstanding US sanc-
tions marked an important milestone, signalling an end to 
the country’s economic isolation and paving the way for a 
brighter economic future.    
IDH delivered EBITDA growth of 18% year-on-year to EGP 
602 million — despite shouldering additional corporate 
expense burdens that accompanied the implementation 
of Egypt’s much-needed macroeconomic reforms. Beyond 
the lingering inflationary impact of the devaluation of the 
Egyptian pound, the higher costs of rent, transportation 
and utilities were all pressure points, as was the value-
added tax imposed in July 2016 and increased to 14% from 
13% in July 2017. The effect of higher interest rates has 
been double-edged, as higher interest income on the large 
cash balances we carry on our balance sheet was partially 
offset by rising interest expenses on our medium-term 
debt. Our bottom line did benefit from a substantially 
lower foreign exchange loss this year than last, helping net 
profit to rise 44% period-on-period to EGP 384 million.
As IDH maintains international-quality accreditations 
to ensure best-in-class service, we are honoured to have 
been awarded the certification for our Cairo Mega Lab 
from the College of American Pathologists (CAP), widely 
considered the leader in laboratory quality assurance 
globally. The international accreditation of our Mega 
Lab constructs a competitive barrier to entry to our 
markets and, as importantly, imparts an assurance of 
quality and safety that engenders strong loyalty among 
our valued corporate as well as individual customers. 
IDH operates the only laboratory in Egypt with the dis-
tinguished CAP accreditation. 
In sum, our Company stayed the course last year, relying 
on the fundamental strength of our brands and sharply 
focused on deploying our asset-light model. We have suc-
cessfully managed to contain our costs whilst at the same 
time upholding our high-quality standards Company-wide 
and maintaining our high patient and physician satisfac-
tion levels. By doing so, we were able to both protect our 
margins and increase our market share in 2017. 
In marked contrast to many consumer names in Egypt, 
IDH has been able to successfully drive volumes and pass 
on selected price increases post-devaluation. Beyond the 
insulation provided by the inherently defensive nature 
of the healthcare industry, I believe it is also very much 
a testament of our trusted brands. We enter 2018 in a 
strong financial position with an under-leveraged and 
highly cash-generative balance sheet that provides us 
with strategic flexibility. 
Macroeconomic progress in our Largest Market
There is welcome evidence that Egypt, representing 83% 
of our 2017 revenues, is turning the economic corner. Last 
year, demonstrable progress was seen regarding the imple-
mentation of reforms to stabilise the country’s finances as 
well as promote growth and employment. 
With the floatation of the Egyptian pound in November 
2016, the foreign exchange market has normalised and 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  13 Strategic Report 
the parallel market has been eliminated. After losing more 
than 50% of its value in 2016, the Egyptian pound closed 
the 2017 year at 17.67 per US$ 1.00, down only slightly from 
18.00 at 2016 year end. Among other reforms, the govern-
ment also began a gradual reduction of energy subsidies 
with some of the resources reallocated to strengthening 
the social safety net. 
As a consequence of the sharp devaluation of the cur-
rency as well as the new energy policy, however, inflation 
has remained high. In December 2017, headline inflation 
stood at 21.9% after peaking at 33% in July. To address this 
extreme inflationary pressure, the Central Bank of Egypt 
(CBE) has adopted tight monetary policy, with aggressive 
interest rate hikes in May and July of 2017. The Govern-
ment of Egypt expects headline inflation to fall to 10-13% 
by the end of 2018, whilst the consensus forecast among 
analysts appears to be 13-14% at mid-year.  
Expanding 0ur Geographic Footprint in Africa 
I am also pleased to report that in early 2018 we added 
Nigeria to our geographic footprint as a “one-stop shop” 
diagnostics services provider. We have accomplished 
this by forming a joint venture with Man Capital LLC, the 
London-based investment arm of the Mansour Group, 
called Dynasty Holding Group. Dynasty is 51% owned 
and controlled by IDH, and together with Man Capital we 
are very pleased to have partnered with the International 
Finance Corporation to invest in Eagle Eye Echo-Scan 
Limited. Echo-Scan is a leading medical diagnostics 
business in Nigeria with all of the licenses it requires to 
operate and expand on a national scale in Africa’s most 
populous country. 
The strategic rationale for making Nigeria the fourth 
country on our regional platform is compelling. Nigeria’s 
diagnostic services market is very large, highly fragmented 
and underpenetrated, offering significant opportunities 
for growth and economies of scale. As importantly, it 
shares many similarities with Egypt’s market in the 1980s 
and 1990s in terms of structure, pace of development, and 
the emerging disease profile of patients. 
Dynasty and the IFC have committed to invest significant 
capital in Echo-Scan over the next four years. Dynasty 
has acquired a majority stake in Echo-Scan and assumed 
management control of the company, whilst both Dynasty 
and the IFC will invest US$ 25 million to expand Echo-
Scan’s diagnostics network, service offerings, and quality 
standards. I am especially pleased that we will be joining 
forces with Man Capital, an organisation that matches 
our more than four decades of operating experience in the 
industry with similarly long experience working on the 
ground in West Africa.
We will continue to look beyond Egypt to accelerate our 
long-term growth through strategic acquisitions. Consist-
ent with our aim to make modern medical diagnostics 
more accessible to the most resource-poor populations, 
we are eager to begin our work in Nigeria. Diagnostic test-
ing is becoming even more essential to quality healthcare, 
and we want to play a central role in improving health 
outcomes in all of our emerging markets. In particular, 
I believe we have a unique long-term opportunity to 
replicate our historical growth in Egypt by applying our 
extensive knowledge and experience to unlock the same 
potential in Nigeria. 
proposed Dividend and Dividend policy
IDH is pleased to propose paying a final dividend of US$ 
0.16 (sixteen US$ cents) per share, or US$ 24 million in 
aggregate, to shareholders in respect of the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. This represents an increase of 
14% compared to a final dividend of US$ 0.14 (fourteen 
US$ cents), or US$ 21 million in aggregate the previous 
financial year. 
In view of the strong cash-generative nature of our busi-
ness and its asset-light strategy, our dividend policy is to 
return to shareholders the maximum amount of excess 
cash after taking careful account of the cash needed to 
support operations, capital expenditure plans, organic 
expansion opportunities, and potential acquisitions. 
2018 outlook
The fundamentals of our inherently counter-cyclical 
healthcare industry remain sound. We are well posi-
tioned with our strong brands and geographic position-
ing to capitalise on the structural drivers that support 
future growth in medical diagnostic services including 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 14 large, rapidly-growing populations; a high prevalence 
of lifestyle-related medical conditions; and a growing 
health consciousness in our emerging markets.  
We are looking forward to moving to our new corporate 
headquarters in 2018, which is located in Smart Village, a 
corporate office park in the city of Sixth of October, slightly 
west of Cairo. Our new headquarters will consolidate all of 
the offices we have been occupying in the city core into 
one building with sufficient space for the entire organisa-
tion, making day-to-day interaction much more efficient.    
We are keen to begin the process of integrating our new 
Nigerian operations, having determined our first priori-
ties. We will implement the policies and procedures that 
underpin the strong IDH corporate organisation starting 
with the establishment of an IT infrastructure that fully 
connects and controls all Echo-Scan branches, as well as 
a Human Resource structure that taps into the Group’s 
highly-qualified and experienced staff to apply the Group’s 
standards of efficiency to the Nigerian operations.  
We look to the coming year with optimism that in our 
largest market of Egypt, the economy will continue to 
gather strength characterised by an easing in inflation 
and some appreciation in the currency. The fundamental 
strength of our brands and our solid relationships with 
our suppliers make it possible for us to successfully 
execute our scalable asset-light business model — even 
under difficult operating conditions such as those we 
faced in 2016 and 2017. Accordingly, we guide our val-
ued shareholders to once again expect annual revenue 
growth of 20% and an EBITDA margin of c. 40%. 
I would like to thank our Board, management team and 
employees for their dedication and commitment, and our 
shareholders for their continued support. I am honoured 
to have you with us on this journey as a rapidly-growing 
consumer healthcare company across the Middle East 
and Africa.
