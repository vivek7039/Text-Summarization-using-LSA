STRATEGIC REPORT

Chief Executive’s report
I am delighted to report that during 2017 Stride Gaming 
continued to make excellent progress against its growth 
strategy. The Group has continued to drive strong organic 
growth and to scale the business through the successful 
integration of the transformational acquisitions that were 
made at the end of our previous financial year. Stride Gaming 
is now the third largest operator in the UK online bingo-led 
market* and we remain confident that this scale, supported 
by our proprietary technology and back office expertise, 
positions the business well to take advantage of further 
growth opportunities. 
Clear growth strategy 
Stride Gaming has a clear growth strategy to develop as 
a leading online gaming operator, thereby creating value for 
shareholders. We aim to achieve this based on three primary 
pillars of growth: 
1. Focus on the core by continuing to grow market share 
in both the UK bingo and casino markets.
2. Diversify the product offering by innovating the product 
and entering new online gaming verticals.
3. Appraise and enter attractive new markets outside of 
the UK.
We plan to execute this growth strategy by continuing to 
develop our proprietary gaming platform, investing in our 
skilled and dynamic team and focusing on operating only 
in regulated or legal markets. 
Stride’s technology edge
Stride Gaming’s proprietary online gaming technology 
underpins the Group’s clear growth strategy across products 
and markets. 
During the year, we have continued to invest in and develop 
our technology edge by creating more innovative and engaging 
gaming content, including on mobile; further integrating and 
enhancing our business intelligence capabilities; ensuring full 
compliance with regulatory developments; and increasing 
the platform’s robustness through improved cyber security 
and disaster recovery solutions.
1. Focus on the core
The key driver of the Group’s success in 2017 has been 
the excellent performance in the core Real Money Gaming 
vertical, which accounted for 91% of Group revenue. In line 
with the Group’s strategic focus, Real Money Gaming NGR 
generated from Stride’s proprietary platform increased by 
39% to £48.6 million, accounting for 54% of Group revenue 
(2016: pro-forma of 31% to £34.9 million accounting for 45% 
and reported: 73%). Real Money Gaming NGR from third-party 
non-proprietary platforms also increased by 16% to £33.1 million, 
accounting for 36% of Group revenue (2016: pro-forma 
£28.6 million, accounting for 37%).
 • Continued strong organic growth 
 • Excellent performance with NGR from 
Real Money Gaming increasing by 39%
 • Significant progress made with the 
integrations of 8Ball, Netboost and Tarco
 • 29% growth in yield per player reported 
at £147
 • Enter 2018 in a strengthened position 
to continue upward trajectory

The Group made significant progress in the integration of 8Ball 
Games Limited (“8Ball”), Netboost Media (“Netboost”) and the 
Tarco Assets (“Tarco”), which were acquired on 31 August 
2016 for a total consideration of up to £70.2 million. By 
applying the Group’s core capabilities, and as a result of the 
Group’s increased scale, we have already been able to grow 
revenues, strengthen gross profit margins and significantly 
increase Adjusted EBITDA of the acquired businesses. The 
Tarco Assets and Netboost Media current year Adjusted 
EBITDA is up 62% from the prior year unaudited pro-forma 
Adjusted EBITDA, whereas 8Ball’s current year Adjusted EBITDA 
has increased by 101%. The Group will continue to appraise 
acquisition opportunities in the fragmented UK bingo-led 
market to supplement and support our organic growth. 
Yield per player, one of the Group’s KPIs, increased 29% 
to £147 (2016: pro-forma £114). This strong growth has been 
driven by the Group’s sophisticated business intelligence 
capabilities and analytics know-how which underpin our 
customer relationship management, cross-sell and marketing 
initiatives. Even though Real Money Gaming funded players 
were down 10% to 146,000 (2016: pro-forma 162,000), this was 
as a result of our strategy to focus on lifetime value of players 
over volume of players, and the reduction of free bonuses across 
the Group. Together these support the Group’s objectives of 
acquiring customers effectively and increasing their lifetime 
value through higher engagement and monetisation. 
Targeted and returns driven marketing strategies are of 
utmost importance to us and we continually look at innovative 
ways to engage both new and existing customers. We look 
to optimise our marketing spend across a number of online 
and offline channels including natural search (SEO), digital 
and social media, affiliate marketing, email, SMS direct 
mails and cross-sell within our portfolio. 
Continuously enhancing our mobile offering is key to providing 
our customer base with the most convenient, easy and accessible 
online gaming experience. Mobile and touch revenue, another 
KPI of the Group, increased to represent 66% of gross Real 
Money Gaming revenue (2016: pro-forma 56%). 
Regulation, responsibility and compliance remain a major 
focus in the Group’s core UK market. As a result of our agility 
and technology, we are confident that Stride is in a robust position 
and see a number of pending and potential changes to regulation 
as an opportunity to further increase market share.
2. Diversify the product offering 
The second key pillar of the Group’s strategy is to grow 
the business by developing and diversifying Stride Gaming’s 
product offering into new, related product verticals, such as 
lottery-style games, Rummy and scratch cards. During the 
year we have developed and launched 17 new proprietary slots 
and instant win games; launched 29 new bingo and casino sites 
– with a focus on slot games – to capture the growth 
opportunities available in that fast-growing market; and 
entered the B2B vertical with the launch of Stride Together. 
Through Stride Together the Group intends to license its 
proprietary platform to gaming operators, media partners and 
retailers both in the UK and globally. This will enable partners 
to create an online presence for their customers and to enter the 
omnichannel gaming space, whilst offering Stride opportunities 
to penetrate new product verticals and geographic markets. 
We were very happy to coincide the launch of this B2B division 
with the announcement of our first Stride Together joint venture 
alongside a leading gaming operator in the UK, Aspers Group 
Limited (“Aspers”). Aspers Casino Online launched in October 
this year, which successfully provides a seamless integration 
between the online and offline gaming experience. We are 
delighted with the launch of our new B2B vertical and are 
now working hard to secure further partnerships with gaming 
operators, media partners and retailers in the UK and globally.
The Group has continued to work hard on improving the 
performance in Social Gaming, which accounts for 9% of total 
Group revenues, where NGR for the year was down 37% to 
£8.1 million, in light of the changing trends and dynamics in 
social gaming markets. The two principal markets in which we 
operate, Australia and North America, are reaching maturity, 
resulting in higher acquisition costs and lower lifetime values 
of players (“LTV”). Given the changing market dynamics, the 
Company made the decision to reduce marketing spend in this 
vertical and to implement significant changes in order to mitigate 
the expected reduction in revenues. Throughout the year we 
implemented a number of changes to the pricing models and 
added further personalisation to our content. At year end, we 
are encouraged by the results of the improvement plan so far 
and the Board will continue to closely monitor developments 
in this sector of the business.
We are confident of 
delivering further 
success in the year 
ahead and continued 
progress against our 
growth strategy. Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017

3. Enter attractive new markets 
The third key pillar of the Group’s growth strategy is to expand 
into attractive new markets outside of the UK, leveraging the 
strength of our proprietary platform and back office expertise. 
The Group owns an Italian remote gaming licence and is in the 
process of obtaining Spanish and Danish gaming licences. 
In line with our strategy, we are also delighted to announce 
today that we have made a strategic controlling investment of 
$3.75 million in Passion Gaming, a Rummy-focused online skill 
gaming company based in India, which gives us entry into the 
country’s rapidly growing skills gaming market. Our investment 
will be used to fund working capital, with the Group also sharing 
its marketing expertise and technological know-how to 
accelerate growth. 
Investment in our first-class team 
The Group’s progress during the year would not have been 
possible without the commitment of our skilled and dynamic 
team. I would like to thank each and every one of my colleagues 
for their hard work during the year. 
We continue to invest in our team and working environment 
to ensure that we remain a highly attractive place for 
industry-leading talent. We have invested in internal and 
external training, competitive employee benefits and new 
ways to communicate internally and increase efficiencies. 
To support Stride’s long-term growth plans, the Group’s 
headcount increased by 16% to 370 during the period. 
Outlook 
We are very pleased with the performance of the Group 
in 2017, having demonstrated key progress and development 
across our strategic pillars. Once again, we have demonstrated 
our ability to grow both organically and through acquisitions.
Real Money Gaming revenue is currently showing double-digit 
year-on-year growth in the first two months of the current 
financial year, in line with market expectations. This is being 
driven by strong deposit growth, with a stable yield per player. 
We enter 2018 in a strengthened position to continue on our 
upward trajectory.
