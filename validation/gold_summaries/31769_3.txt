 Focusrite Plc Annual Report 2017 04
Chairman’s Statement
Another 
successful year
I am very pleased to report that FY17 has proved to be another 
successful year, exceeding our expectations for revenue, at 
£66.1 million (+21.6%), profit and cash flow.
The Company’s products have continued 
to grow market share in our established 
and growth markets. Revenue and profits 
have been boosted by the strengthening 
of the Euro and US Dollar but, even on 
a constant currency basis, the Company 
has enjoyed excellent growth.
This is our first set of results with 
Tim Carroll as Chief Executive Officer, 
having joined the Company in January 
2017. He has successfully established 
himself with the management team 
and the Company more broadly and 
is building on Focusrite’s strong 
foundations. Tim enjoyed almost 20 years 
with Avid Technology Inc, a respected 
business in our marketplace, in global 
sales roles and latterly heading the 
audio division, as a result of which he 
has an unmatched experience of the 
markets that Focusrite seeks to serve, 
from the professional to amateur.
FY17 has seen continued development 
of our sales channels. I am particularly 
pleased with the progress of our 
e-commerce platform, only in its second 
year and which is now offering the 
Company’s products globally. Sales in 
the Far East, notably China, continue to 
grow faster than most other regions of 
the world. In response to this demand, 
the Company has established a Hong 
Kong office to manage our third-party 
distributors and marketing in the Asia-
Pacific region and to provide customer 
support to Asian customers. This office 
continues to grow and, importantly, 
enables us to provide support to 
customers who use our products all over 
the world, 24/7. Looking forward, new 
distribution initiatives in Japan promise 
to underpin growth prospects in this 
important but challenging market.
Last year, I reported on the launch of the 
second generation of Focusrite’s Scarlett 
range of audio interfaces. Scarlett is the 
market-leading range globally and our 
results very much reflect the outstanding 
success and growth of this range, 
that provides musicians and the wider 
recording community with outstanding 
performance and reliability. Focusrite 
Clarett is a premium range of interfaces 
for those whose recordings are more 
likely to have commercial potential.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Our Novation brand of musical 
instruments comprising synthesisers, 
keyboard controllers and the Launchpad 
grid controller family enjoyed a 37.8% 
uplift in demand compared with a flat 
2016. A new flagship synthesiser, 
Peak, was launched to much acclaim.
Focusrite continues to build demand for 
products designed for a professional 
audience and business enterprises, 
namely the RedNet and Red ranges. 
A Focusrite Pro team has been formed to 
develop the professional and commercial 
sales channels, as well as bringing 
better focus to product development and 
marketing to these specialist vertical 
markets that include broadcast, post-
production, education and entertainment 
facilities. This market segment is seen as 
an exciting growth opportunity where our 
investment in this segment over recent 
years is expected to pay off handsomely.
I am delighted Focusrite Plc has delivered 
another strong year of growth. Our 
foundations as a company that has a 
history at the leading edge of music 
technology innovation, with an 
established, global customer base for its 
market-leading brands and a strong 
culture, make us well placed for further 
growth. The Company has no debt, 
continues to be highly cash-generative 
and continues to consider acquisition 
opportunities that would complement the 
existing business.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank our employees, manufacturing 
partners, distribution partners 
and professional advisers for their 
contributions to our success.
