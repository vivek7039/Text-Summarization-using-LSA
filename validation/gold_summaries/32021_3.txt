 7 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 6 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
I am delighted to report a strong set of 
results for the 52 weeks ended 24 June 
2017, a year of significant investment in 
new pubs.
The performance has been good in all 
operating divisions in the Company and 
excellent progress has been made 
against our strategic objectives. 
I have been particularly impressed by the 
pace of change in the business in recent 
years as the team modernise the pubs 
and brands portfolio and innovate to 
address the continuous challenge to 
enhance the customer experience. 
Our growth primarily comes from 
reinvesting year after year in our core 
business and from driving ever greater 
efficiency and excellence in execution. 
This year has been notable for a strong 
underlying performance, some excellent 
work to enhance our own brand 
portfolio, important steps to modernise 
the brewing operation and a period of 
significant investment with the 
acquisition of 14 new pubs.
The core strengths of Shepherd Neame  
lie in a strong sense of family, a distinct 
individual character, and a passion for 
quality, for high standards and for  
making continuous improvements  
within a consistent strategic framework.  
These characteristics deliver a strong and 
sustainable business for the long-term 
benefit of shareholders. Equally important 
is our ability to take advantage of good 
opportunities when they arise and to be 
responsive to changes in the market. 
Financial results
Turnover for the period increased by 
+11.7% to £156.2m (2016: £139.9m) driven 
by the acquisitions and strong managed 
house like-for-like growth of +8.1%. 
Underlying operating profit grew by 
+7.2% to £15.3m (2016: £14.2m). 
Underlying profit before tax
1
 grew by 
+8.0% to £11.2m (2016: £10.3m) and 
underlying basic earnings per share are 
up +8.0% to 59.1p (2016: 54.7p). 
Statutory profit before tax is down 
-18.0% to £11.8m (2016: £14.4m), 
predominantly because we achieved  
an unusually high profit on disposal of 
property in the prior year. Basic earnings 
per ordinary share are down to 69.1p 
(2016: 84.0p).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 22.73p (2016: 22.05p) making the  
total dividend for the year 28.35p 
(2016: 27.50p), an increase of +3.1%.  
This represents underlying dividend 
cover of 2.1 times (2016: 2.0 times).  
We will continue to target our dividend 
cover at or above this level in the future. 
The final dividend will be paid on 
13 October 2017 to shareholders on  
the register at the close of business  
on 29 September 2017.
This level of dividend cover is consistent 
with the policy stated at the time of our 
share capital reorganisation in 2014. 
Since then the total annual dividend  
paid to shareholders has increased  
from £3.2m to £4.2m.
Capital and investment
Capital expenditure was £38.0m.  
Within this sum, £24.8m was invested  
in the acquisition of UES, eight pubs  
from Ei Group plc and five pubs in the 
acquisition of VGR in November 2016. 
We realised proceeds from property 
sales of £5.9m (2016: £11.9m). 
Net debt has consequently increased 
from £60.1m at June 2016 to £78.1m  
at June 2017. 
Board of Directors
Following the review of our strategy  
for brewing and brands as set out in  
the Chief Executive’s Report, and as  
part of the transition from brewing Asahi 
Super Dry, the role of Brewing and 
Brands Director is no longer required. 
Graeme Craig is consequently stepping 
down from his role as a Director in 
September 2017 and will be leaving  
the business. Graeme has made a 
considerable contribution to the business 
since joining in 2006. He has greatly 
developed and enhanced the brand 
portfolio, and consolidated the sales, 
marketing and production activities into 
a single brewing and brands division.  
I would like to thank him for what he has 
done and wish him well for the future. 
We are streamlining our management 
roles in this area. We have recently 
appointed Andy Pinnock as Head  
of Sales and Giles Hilton as Head of 
Customer Relations. We are currently 
recruiting a Head of Marketing, Brands 
1   Profit before any profit or loss on the disposal of properties, investment property fair value movements and exceptional items.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“   
A strong set of results  
and a year of significant 
investment.

and Communications and a Head of 
Production, as Richard Frost retires in 
2018. These senior positions will report  
to the Chief Executive.
Government and regulation
The Company makes a substantial 
contribution to the local and national 
economy. In 2017 we have paid £28.7m  
in excise duty alone. It is disappointing, 
therefore, after three years of successive 
excise cuts, that the Chancellor chose  
to increase duty on beer by 3p per pint  
in the last budget. 
This coincides with substantial increases 
in business rates and in the national living 
wage and with the introduction of the 
apprenticeship levy. These inflationary 
pressures come at a time of rising 
inflation in food and imported products, 
and provide cost challenges to all 
businesses in the sector at a time of  
great political uncertainty. 
In July 2016 the Small Business 
Enterprise and Employment Bill which 
introduced the Statutory Code of 
Practice and Market Rent Option (MRO) 
became law. This affects only those large 
companies which have more than 500 
pubs. We believe that effective operation 
of the voluntary code will make extension  
of the statutory code unlikely.
Advisors
Since the year end the Company 
appointed Peel Hunt LLP as its corporate 
broker in place of Panmure Gordon & Co 
with effect from 1 August 2017.
Summary
This has been an excellent year for the 
Company. The Board is focussed on 
investing for the long-term benefit of 
shareholders in line with our aims to be a 
Great British Brewer and to run the best 
pubs. The investment in our brands and 
pubs continues to transform the profile 
and quality of assets in the Company. 
The managed estate has now become our 
largest business division by turnover and 
has been our principal engine for growth. 
Our tenanted business is high quality and 
robust after many years of investing to 
drive up standards. It generates substantial 
and sustainable free cash flow and 
continues to attract exceptional operators.
In the brewing and brands business we 
have an extended period of transition 
ahead of us as the arrangements with 
Asahi come to an end. However, the 
underlying trends in this division are 
encouraging and our emerging, 
innovative and broad brand portfolio 
gives good reason for optimism. 
These three business divisions generate 
strong cash flow and all contribute to  
the growing reputation the Company  
has for offering a great experience to our 
customers. The new brand identity has 
strengthened our profile further. 
Whilst the performance has been good, 
the short-term horizon is clouded by the 
inflationary pressures on the business, 
and the medium-term horizon by the 
uncertainty over the UK's exit from the 
European Union. Shepherd Neame is, as 
has been demonstrated over the years, a 
resilient and flexible business capable of 
rapidly adjusting to and succeeding in an 
ever changing world.
We remain confident to continue to 
invest for the long-term benefit of 
shareholders.
