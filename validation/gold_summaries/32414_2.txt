Distribution network and market
The market for Accoya and Tricoya has been estimated as in excess of 2.6 million cubic meters 
annually. Last year we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya and Medite sold 5,806 cubic meters of 
Tricoya panels, representing year growth for the year of 18% and 31% respectively.
61 Accoya distributor, supply and agency agreements in place covering most of Europe, Australia, 
Canada, Chile, China, India, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, South Africa, parts of the 
Middle-East and South-East Asia and the USA.
Accoya solid wood and Tricoya wood elements, 
which is the feedstock for Tricoya panels, are 
manufactured through the Company’s proprietary 
acetylation wood modification process. These solid 
wood and wood element products exhibit superior 
dimensional stability, durability and other important 
benefits compared with alternative natural, treated 
and modified woods as well as more resource 
intensive man-made materials and panels. 
The Company’s technologies and brands are 
internationally protected by strict confidentiality, 
granted patents, patent applications and trademarks 
as well as being supported by strong sustainability 
certifications. Many have been technically validated 
at full commercial production level and long term 
use, and others are in pilot-scale or are subject to 
independent validation by experts. Our products have 
been certified for use by various building regulations 
around the world.

Our Products
Accoya is the world-leading high 
performance sustainable wood.  
It is stable, durable, resists rot, 
is harder and stronger. It is 
guaranteed for 50 years for use 
above ground and 25 years in 
ground or freshwater; in summary 
its performance is remarkable. 
Accoya has properties that match 
or exceed those of the best tropical 
hardwoods, yet is manufactured from 
sustainable FSC
®
 certified wood. It is the 
only Cradle to Cradle (‘C2C’) certified 
structural building material which has 
achieved the Gold Level Certification 
and Platinum level for Material Health. 
C2C is a design philosophy developed 
by William McDonough and Michael 
Braungart, inspired by the circular 
economy concept.
C2C certification now also results in 
additional credits for leading green 
building certification systems such 
as LEED and BREEAM with Accoya 
specified in many LEED and BREEAM 
projects around the world.
In 2015 Google adopted C2C Material 
Health as one of the certification 
schemes for Portico, Google’s 
healthy building material assessment 
software. Accoya has been certified 
at the highest, Platinum level for C2C 
Material Health and it is now one of 
the most highly rated products in 
Google’s Portico.
Accoya is the material of choice for 
a wide range of demanding outdoor 
applications, from windows and doors, 
decking to cladding, bridges to exterior 
structures and applications that are 
presently only feasible with non–
sustainable or man-made materials.

Tricoya wood elements are used 
in the manufacturing of Tricoya 
panel products. Tricoya is opening 
new markets where wood based 
panels would never have been 
considered before.
Tricoya panels demonstrate 
significantly enhanced durability and 
exceptional dimensional stability which 
allow Tricoya panels to be used in a 
wide variety of applications such as 
window components and door skins, 
façade cladding, wet interiors and 
much much more.
The raw wood material that is used 
for Tricoya production is sourced from 
FSC® certified forests. Production 
will be extremely resource-efficient 
using chips from locally grown pine, 
including the parts of trees which are 
not used to make any other wood-
based product and would otherwise 
be sent to waste streams.
Tricoya is also guaranteed for 50 years 
above ground and 25 years in ground 
or freshwater; its performance and 
properties are outstanding.
