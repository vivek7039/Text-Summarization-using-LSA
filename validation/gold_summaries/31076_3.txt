 04 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholder,
During 2017 conditions for the oil and gas 
industry worldwide and for Russia generally 
have been more stable than in the recent 
past. This stability has enabled Volga Gas to 
undertake important steps to enhance its 
operations materially, the most important 
of which was switching the gas sweetening 
process utilised at the Dobrinskoye gas 
processing plant, the Group’s principal 
production facility, to a Redox-based system. 
This has reduced the chemical costs of the 
operation and has eliminated the need to 
dispose of bulky spent processing chemicals. 
During the implementation of this process, 
and whilst the operational team optimises 
the management of the new process, the 
plant throughput has had to be reduced. 
However, with the improved oil and gas 
market conditions, this has not had as 
material an impact on the Group’s revenues 
in 2017 as may otherwise have occurred.
The change to a Redox gas sweetening 
process was achieved with only modest 
capital expenditure as minimal modifications 
to the existing plant were required. 
During 2017 , the main focus of the capital 
investment was in two projects that are 
expected to provide incremental revenues 
material impact in reducing the operating 
profits of the Group to US$0.1 million 
(2016: US$2.51 million), due to an increase 
in the depletion charge to US$8.6 million 
(2016: US$5.0 million). Further details of 
the impact of the reduction of the reserves 
are set out in the operating and financial 
reviews between pages 6 and 11.
In spite of the reduction in reserves, the 
Group still holds significant, fully developed 
reserves in its three principal fields. These 
reserves form the basis of sustainable 
production with growth potential in the near 
term. These assets provide a platform for 
the Group to grow in the future, through 
successful exploration and by selective  
value-accretive acquisitions. The Board 
believes that Volga Gas has a stable 
foundation and the financial and 
operational capability to develop and 
extend these assets to provide long-
term value for our shareholders.
The Board remains committed to a policy 
of enhanced dividend distribution and 
is planning to modify its dividend policy 
towards higher rates of distribution, having 
in mind the requirements of the business and 
the need to maintain its financial strength. 
Within these constraints, the Board would 
consider distributing up to 75% of its free 
cash flow as dividends. For the time being 
however, the Board considers it prudent 
to defer a decision on the dividend level 
until the incremental cash flow from the 
investments undertaken in 2017 begins to be 
realised. A further decision will be taken by 
the interim results stage in September 2018.
While the immediate outlook for the oil 
industry remains broadly positive, the 
finances of the Group will continue to be 
conservatively managed. Capital investment 
commitments will continue to be at a 
modest rate and focused on enhancing 
the profits from the gas and condensate 
production and on optimising the production 
from the reserves of the Company.

and cash flow to the Group: the construction 
of a plant at the gas processing facility to 
capture for sale the liquid petroleum gases 
(“LPG”) – propane and butane – that are 
currently vented and flared; and the drilling 
of a new horizontal oil well to access the 
hitherto undeveloped reserves in the Uzen 
oil field located in the Group’s Karpenskiy 
licence area. The LPG project is expected to 
commence producing and selling product 
from April 2018. When it is fully operational, 
the LPG plant could add up to 400 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day of incremental 
sales volumes. These projects are discussed 
in greater detail by the Chief Executive 
Officer in the Operational Review.
Given the constraints to gas and condensate 
production experienced in 2017 , the Board 
is pleased to report that revenues have been 
broadly maintained at US$37.1 million (2016: 
US$39.4 million), EBITDA at US$8.8 million 
(2016: US$9.6 million) and operating cash 
flow before working capital movements at 
US$9.0 million (2016: US$10.4 million). This 
has enabled the Group to undertake an 
increased capital expenditure programme 
during 2017 and, in spite of some overruns 
in the costs of the Uzen horizontal well, to 
end the year with healthy cash balances 
and remain in a positive net cash position 
after taking into account borrowings. This 
is in addition to paying US$5.0 million in 
dividends to shareholders in 2017 (2016: nil).
Unfortunately, Volga Gas has recently 
experienced higher formation water content 
at certain production wells at Vostochny 
Makarovskoye (“VM”) and so the Board 
thought it appropriate to commission an 
updated independent reserves report and 
prudent to adopt its findings in full. This 
report, dated 12 April 2018, has resulted in 
a 27% reduction in the proved reserves and 
a 28% reduction in the proved and probable 
reserves of oil, gas and condensate and 
we are actively looking into technical and 
operational solutions to mitigate the impact 
of the reserves reduction. The reserves 
reduction is caused by a recalculation of 
recovery rates from the VM and Dobrinskoye 
gas fields, rather than any changes to the 
geological model or estimates of original 
hydrocarbons in place. This has had a
