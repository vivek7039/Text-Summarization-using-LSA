Chairman’s statement
In 2006, when I became Chairman of 
Ebiquity (then Thomson Intermedia), 
the Company operated from four 
offices – three in London and one in 
New York. At that time, three-quarters 
of our revenue came from clients 
headquartered in the UK. I stand 
down from the Board this year with 
a business that spans the globe, with 
20 offices in 14 countries, and proud 
to count over 80 of the world’s 100 
largest advertisers among its clients.
The marketing industry has been 
through a period of substantial change 
during this time, bringing with it 
extraordinary complexity. In 2006, 
Facebook celebrated its second 
birthday and Twitter was born. 
Meanwhile, eight-year-old Google was 
already valued at $50 billion. Now it’s 
over 17 times that figure, and these 
three companies alone generated over 
$130 billion of advertising revenue in 
2017. Add to this the ever-evolving 
capabilities of technology and the 
creation of a totally pervasive online 
ecosystem, and the balance of 
relationships and the level of 
complexity within marketing today 
has fundamentally changed.
“ I have greatly enjoyed being part 
of Ebiquity’s evolution over the past 
12 years and believe that, with 
Rob Woodward’s arrival, we have the 
right leadership at the Board’s helm 
to support the executive team, led 
by Michael Karg, in seizing Ebiquity’s 
unique market opportunities.”

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 In 2006, Ebiquity was already focusing 
on transparency and accountability. 
One key issue then was the need to 
verify whether adverts that had been 
paid for had actually appeared in 
newspapers. We were able, in part, 
to apply technology to the old-style 
vouching process. From 2007 through 
2015, the underlying platform for the 
business we have today was 
assembled – mainly through 
acquisition – and we established our 
market-leading position in media 
benchmarking internationally. We 
acquired additional skills to address 
some of the emerging opportunities, 
and our Marketing Performance 
Optimisation segment was created. 
Since 2016, there has been substantial 
progress in defining our strategic 
direction and delivering a simplified 
and streamlined service offering as 
One Ebiquity around the world. This 
initiative is designed to ensure that our 
clients recognise us as one business 
with uniform capability and to 
reposition our service offering around 
our clients’ needs. There have also been 
some important new hires of senior 
executives, individuals with both 
operational and industry-based skills 
who will help us capitalise on our 
position in the marketplace.
Transparency and accountability 
remain the most significant challenges 
for the marketing industry. The 
revelations and recommendations that 
came out of the 2016 ANA report were 
pivotal in creating advertisers’ 
prevailing and enduring mindset. 
For Ebiquity, it not only put us at the 
heart of the debate. It also increased 
awareness of the need for an 
independent party with the right skills 
to help advertisers create clarity 
around the results that their 
investments in media deliver, and the 
returns they generate.
The Chief Executive Officer’s report 
sets out last year’s financial 
performance in detail, as well as our 
developments and achievements 
throughout the year. It explains how 
we will be running our business going 
forward, by our Media, Analytics, and 
Tech practices. This aligns our business 
with the challenges that our clients 
face, and it follows the planned 
divestment of the Advertising 
Intelligence business. 
On behalf of the Board, I must thank 
everyone who works at Ebiquity for the 
great commitment they show in 
deploying their skills for the benefit 
of our clients.
I would also like to thank my Board 
colleagues, and welcome Rob 
Woodward, my successor, to Ebiquity. 
Rob has a set of skills and experience 
ideally suited to our business as well as 
to today’s opportunities and 
challenges.
Ebiquity is now well-positioned at the 
heart of the marketing industry. 
We have a significant opportunity to 
deploy our experience, skills, and talent 
for our clients’ benefit from our 
uniquely independent position.
