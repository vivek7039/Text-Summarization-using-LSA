DELIVERING

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report I am pleased to report another strong set 
of results for the year ended 31 December 
2017 . We have maintained our focus on 
delivering sustainable growth in recurring 
profits and cash flows over the long term, 
and on delivering a Home for Success for 
all the students who live with us. We do this 
by providing great service and operating 
brilliant buildings, designed specifically for 
students. Our investment discipline ensures 
we maintain a robust capital structure and 
deliver high-quality earnings.
Performance in 2017 resulted in 
another year of growth in EPRA earnings, 
like-for-like rents and development profits. 
EPRA earnings increased by 12% to £70.5 
million and now represents one-third of total 
shareholder returns. The focus on delivery 
of the ongoing earnings performance of 
the business is increasingly underpinned 
by University backed contracts giving us 
the confidence to increase our dividend 
pay-out from 75% to 85% of EPRA EPS 
in 2018.
We will continue to focus on growing 
earnings, both in absolute terms and as a 
proportion of our total return. This is driven 
by our ability to maintain full occupancy, 
to continue growing rental levels on an 
annual basis, the consistent focus on cost 
efficiencies and from the completion of 
our high-quality development pipeline.
Our PRISM operating platform, 
which became fully operational in 
2016, coupled with our experienced 
management and leadership teams, give 
us a unique capability to drive value from 
our portfolio through scale efficiencies and 
revenue management, supporting our 
ongoing income focus. 
We have actively prioritised improving 
the quality of our portfolio by using 
our customer insight and extensive 
local knowledge to align with the top 
performing Universities. We completed 
two important strategic initiatives during 
the year with the acquisition of a 3,067-
bed, on-campus portfolio at Aston 
University and the sale of 4,800 beds 
that did not meet the long-term strategic 
goals of our portfolio. These initiatives are 
supported by our ongoing development 
activity and further University partnership 
opportunities to ensure that we are 
increasingly focused on the best 
Universities in the UK.
Delivering for students
Our business is focused on delivering 
a Home for Success: an affordable, 
consistent and high quality living 
environment that helps students make 
the most of their time at University. Going 
to University should be more than simply 
a stepping stone to employment and 
we strongly believe that where a student 
lives has a material impact on their social 
and academic development. We strive to 
ensure that every aspect of our student 
proposition is therefore designed to 
provide a safe and secure environment 
where they can integrate and develop, 
academically and socially.
Our student proposition is delivered by 
1,400 highly experienced employees, 
whose understanding of students is a 
cornerstone of our success. As part of our 
strategy, we continue to invest in recruiting, 
retaining and developing the very best 
people. This commitment is reflected in 
the results of our employee effectiveness 
surveys and the prestigious Investors in 
People Gold Standard accreditation and 
we are pleased to have achieved the 
Living Wage Employer accreditation. 
We also recognise that going to University 
is a significant investment for young people 
and offer a variety of accommodation 
at different price points, with the majority 
of our rooms concentrated at a mid-
range price point for purpose-built 
student accommodation.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
This commitment to the customer is 
reflected in average occupancy of 
98% and rental growth of 3.5% over 
the last five years. Growing numbers 
of second and third year students, who 
have traditionally preferred to live in private 
rented accommodation, are choosing to 
return to us and now account for over 
two-thirds of our direct-let bookings. 
Customer service satisfaction levels, a key 
performance indicator for us, remain at 
consistently high levels and place us on 
a par with some of the best service 
companies across Europe.
Partner of choice for Universities
Our focus on customer service is closely 
aligned with the priorities of our University 
partners, for whom student experience is 
now a key performance metric under the 
Government’s new Teaching Excellence 
Framework. With students spending more 
time in their accommodation than on 
campus, we can increasingly demonstrate 
to Universities how Home for Success 
supports their strategic ambitions. 
This, combined with a long standing 
commitment to building relationships with 
key University decision–makers, is reflected 
in the latest results of our independently 
assessed University trust survey and means 
that 60% of our accommodation is now 
let to Universities through nominations 
agreements. With an average remaining 
life of six years, these agreements provide 
income and rental growth certainty on 
over half of our revenue.
The delivery of great customer service 
to students and Universities has translated 
into a strong financial performance in 2017 , 
delivering occupancy of 99% and rental 
growth of 3.4% (2016: 98%, 3.8%). With our 
new operating system, PRISM, we have also 
delivered further improvements to our NOI 
margin and overhead efficiency measure.
Our people, University relationships, 
the quality of our portfolio and PRISM, 
our operating platform, set us apart from 
the other operators in the sector. Going 
forward, I am confident they will support 
the future growth and financial 
performance of the business.
Operating quality buildings
The quality, location and scale of our 
portfolio is a key component of our 
business model and long-term strategy. 
We aim to operate buildings in and 
around high quality Universities, where 
student demand is highest. We believe 
that our focus on these institutions is the 
best strategy for driving continued high 
levels of occupancy and rental growth. 
We are therefore focusing our portfolio 
activity on further improving alignment 
to high and mid ranked Universities and, 
in the process, underpinning rental 
growth over the medium and long 
term. We currently have 85% of our beds 
occupied by students attending such 
Universities, which will increase to 90% on 
completion of our existing development 
pipeline, planned acquisitions 
and disposals.
During 2017 , we opened 2,150 new beds, 
added 3,067 beds to our portfolio through 
the Aston Student Village acquisition and 
sold 4,800 beds. Taking into account these 
activities, together with valuation 
movements, the value of our investment 
portfolio (including our share of USAF and 
LSAV) is £2.4 billion as at 31 December 2017 .
The purpose-built student accommodation 
sector continues to attract a significant 
level of institutional capital. Over £4 billion 
of assets were traded in the year, driving 
yield compression across the sector. 
The yield movement on our portfolio, 
on a like-for-like basis, was 15 basis points 
and the portfolio is valued at an average 
portfolio yield of 5.2% (2016: £2.1 billion 
and 5.45% yield).

Strategic report Development pipeline
We also made excellent progress 
with our development pipeline during 
the year. We completed five new 
buildings over the summer and secured 
an additional two new development 
schemes, which increases our secured 
development pipeline for delivery over 
the next three years to 7 ,550 beds. The 
construction of all our 2018 openings is 
progressing in line with plans. Planning 
consents and build contracts are in 
place for all of our 2019 deliveries and 
we are finalising our plans for schemes 
delivering in 2020.
During 2017 , USAF completed its two 
forward-fund schemes in Oxford and 
Edinburgh and acquired three further 
forward-fund schemes in Durham and 
Birmingham, adding 1,000 beds to the 
portfolio on completion in 2018 and 2019.
The anticipated yield on cost of our 
secured development pipeline is 8.1% 
and prospective returns on new schemes 
outside London remain attractive at 
around 8.0%. The secured development 
pipeline is highly accretive and remains 
a significant component of our future 
earnings growth and could contribute 
10–12 pence per share to EPRA earnings 
once built out.
University partnerships
Following the success of the Aston University 
transaction, Unite has secured two further 
University partnership schemes. Firstly, 
during the year, we acquired the former 
Cowley Barracks in Oxford. Working with 
Oxford Brookes University, we have secured 
planning permission to build 887 beds and 
agreed terms for a 25-year nominations 
agreement with the University, taking our 
partnership with them to over 1,365 beds. 
The agreement provides the University with 
much-needed accommodation and Unite 
with income and rental growth certainty 
over the long term.
Secondly, following the year 
end, Unite recently secured a new 
development site in London. Working 
with planning support from King’s 
College, London we will submit a planning 
application to build around 1,000 beds of 
cluster-flat accommodation in the second 
half of the year. We expect to enter into a 
long-term nominations agreement over 
this property, providing much needed 
capacity in a location where there is a 
severe shortage of high quality affordable 
student accommodation. This is our first 
land acquisition in London since 2013, 
facilitated by the correction in land values 
seen in certain zone 1 locations and our 
ability to unlock value through our 
relationships with Universities.
The initial development returns on these 
University-backed schemes are 6–7%, 
around 100 basis points lower than a 
scheme where Unite takes full letting and 
rental growth risk. However, total returns are 
expected to be 9–10% and given the 
University relationships and the security of 
income the agreements provide, these 
opportunities are strategically important 
and remain value enhancing.
We continue to see attractive 
development and partnership 
opportunities in strong University markets 
and we plan to invest selectively in target 
markets to enhance portfolio quality and 
deliver target returns.
Q&A with the Chief Executive
Richard Smith addresses some topical  
questions from our shareholders
Q What is the impact of the new 
Teaching Excellence Framework on 
your strategy?
A The TEF results reinforce our strategy 
of partnering with mid- to high-ranking 
Universities. Currently 85% of our beds are 
aligned to these types of institutions, and 
with new developments such as Cowley 
in Oxford and Middlesex Street in London, 
we are expecting this to grow to 90% 
on completion of our existing 
development pipeline. 
Student satisfaction and retention 
are key measures of TEF, and we 
believe our strategy can help our 
University partners excel in these areas, 
continuing to make us an attractive 
accommodation partner. 
Q You bought and sold more properties 
than in previous years in 2017. Why? 
A The quality of our portfolio is a key 
differentiator between Unite and our 
competitors. We continually review it to 
ensure we have the best properties, in the 
right locations, and are aligned with mid- 
to high-ranking Universities, supporting the 
quality earnings profile of the business. 
This strategy drives both our acquisitions, 
and our disposal activity. By disposing of 
properties which no longer fit our quality 
criteria, we can continue to invest in 
new, exciting opportunities such as our 
acquisition of Aston Student Village.

Acquisitions and disposals
We also continue to target acquisitions 
of completed assets and portfolios that 
enhance the quality of our portfolio and 
the earnings profile of the business. These 
acquisitions are generally targeted through 
our co-investment vehicles due to their 
lower cost of capital, allowing us to 
generate enhanced returns through our 
asset management and acquisition fees. 
During 2017 , USAF acquired one 437-bed 
completed asset in Sheffield for £36 million. 
Since the year end, USAF has acquired 
a 331-bed investment asset in Edinburgh 
for £24 million.
Disposals remain an important part 
of our strategy and we will continue 
to recycle assets out of our portfolio to 
ensure that we can continue increasing 
our exposure to the UK’s best Universities, 
while generating capital to invest in 
further development activity and exciting 
opportunities such as the Aston Student 
Village acquisition. During 2017 , we sold 
£181 million of assets at a £5 million 
premium to book valuations (Unite share). 
We intend to sell £75–125 million (Unite 
share) of assets during 2018 to take 
advantage of the ongoing strength in 
the investment market and to ensure 
that we maintain a strong and flexible 
balance sheet as we progress our 
development pipeline. 
High-quality earnings and a strong 
capital structure
We have achieved 99% occupancy 
across our portfolio and rental growth of 
3.4%. With 60% of this income underpinned 
by University nominations agreements, we 
have a high level of visibility in the ongoing 
occupancy and rental growth outlook of 
the portfolio. In addition to revenue growth, 
a focus on efficiency has resulted in further 
improvements in our NOI margin, which is up 
to 7 4.1% (2016: 73.1%), and in our overhead 
efficiency which shows that our overheads, 
net of management fees, represents 40 
basis points of gross asset value (2016: 40 
basis points). Having put in place a £5 million 
efficiency programme in 2017 (Unite share: 
£3.8 million), we remain confident about 
achieving further efficiency gains and 
delivering our targets of 75% and 25–30 basis 
points by the end of 2018 and will continue 
to review how to deliver further efficiencies 
in 2019 and beyond.
Unite’s share of net debt grew by £27 million 
to £803 million in 2017 . The majority of our 
property and development expenditure 
(Unite share £185 million) was funded by our 
disposal programme with the remainder 
from retained earnings. We reduced LTV to 
31% (2017: 34%) as a result of disposals, the 
conversion of the convertible bond and 
asset value appreciation. This is at the lower 
end of our target range, and we expect to 
increase back to around the mid-30% level 
as we build out the development pipeline. 
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 6.5 (2016: 6.9), 
again within our target level of 6.0–7 .0, 
which we intend to maintain.
The Group also secured an investment 
grade credit rating and arranged a new 
£500 million, five-year unsecured debt 
facility, providing additional financing 
headroom, greater flexibility and a 
reduced cost of funding. 
Market and strategy
The outlook for the student 
accommodation sector remains 
positive, with structural factors continuing 
to drive a demand-supply imbalance in 
the cities where we operate. The UK 
Higher Education sector is recognised 
globally for the strength of its Universities 
and the contribution it makes to research, 
innovation, talent development and the 
UK economy more broadly. The UK is 
the second most popular destination for 
international students and has 12 out of 
the world’s top 100 Universities and 59 of 
Europe’s top 200 Universities. In February 
2018, the Government announced a 
Funding Review. The details of the review 
are yet to be made clear but we do not 
believe that it will not have a detrimental 
impact on the UK’s globally-renowned 
Higher Education sector.
Total student numbers again reached 
record levels at over 1.8 million. The 
number of applicants and the number 
of students accepted into courses in 2017 
was at 700,000 and 534,000 respectively 
(2016: 725,000 and 540,000). Despite a fall 
in applications of 3%, Universities were able 
to recruit from the excess of applications, 
resulting in intake falling by less than 
0.5% with applicants still outstripping 
acceptances by 166,000. The small 
reduction in applications was driven 
principally by changes to funding for 
some medical related courses and 
a small reduction in EU students. 
18
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Strategic report Going forward, the gap between 
the number of applicants and University 
places could be impacted by some 
external factors, including the impact 
of the UK leaving the EU. Since 2015, a 
demographic trend has seen a reduction 
in the number of 18–21 year olds, and this 
trend affects the next three years. However, 
participation rates continue to increase 
with applicants still outstripping the places 
offered by Universities. We expect high and 
mid-ranked Universities, where our business 
is focused, to continue attracting more 
students than those at the lower end of the 
league tables and therefore we believe our 
portfolio remains well placed to withstand 
any potential reductions in applications. 
The student accommodation sector 
has attracted significant levels of capital 
investment over the last four years with 
over £16 billion of investment activity. This 
increased investment activity has seen the 
new supply of accommodation increase 
and the total number of purpose-built 
beds (including University-owned beds) 
grow to 580,000 beds representing around 
one-third of the UK’s student population. 
At this level, there remains a shortage of 
purpose-build accommodation compared 
to the numbers of first years, international 
and increasingly second and third-year 
students. The outlook suggests that the 
rate of new supply will continue at a similar 
rate of around 25,000 beds in 2018, before 
starting to reduce in 2019. Moreover, a large 
proportion of the new supply is focused 
on the premium end of the market and 
we believe the competitive threat that it 
poses to our more mainstream 
proposition is limited.
We believe our exposure to changes in 
student numbers and increases in supply is 
mitigated by our alignment and relationship 
with high-quality Universities, underpinned 
by nominations agreements, and remain 
confident that well-located, mid-range, 
direct-let student accommodation will 
continue to support high levels of 
occupancy and rental growth.
Outlook
Building on our consistent 
performance record and supportive 
market fundamentals the Group remains 
well placed to deliver sustainable earnings 
growth in the years ahead. UK Universities 
continue to demonstrate their ability to 
adapt and respond to a changing 
landscape and retain their globally 
recognised status. The demand for high 
quality Higher Education among both 
UK and international students continues 
to grow. Our development pipeline and 
operational expertise provides good 
visibility of future rental growth and 
increasing recurring earnings. We are 
confident that our strategy of aligning 
our operations with the best performing 
Universities in the UK, combined with our 
highly scalable operating platform, 
strong brand and reputation makes us 
well-positioned to extend our market 
leading position.
