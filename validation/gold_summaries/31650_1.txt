 Chief Executive’s business review
 WELL PLACED  
TO DELIVER 
CONTINUED 
OUTPERFORMANCE 
This	year	has	been	a	period	of 	
strong	operational	achievement	for 	
Mitchells	&	Butlers	with	a	sustained 	
return	to	like-for-like	sales	growth. 	
Phil Urban 
Chief Executive
14 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 It is now two years since I became CEO of 
Mitchells & Butlers, and I feel that we have 
covered a lot of ground. When new to the role, 
we were feeling the pain from all the new supply 
that had opened on our doorsteps over the 
previous 18 months. 
Our	sales	were	declining,	we	were	tracking	c.3%	behind	our	competitors 	
as	measured	by	the	Peach	Tracker,	and	with	unprecedented	cost 	
headwinds	on	the	horizon,	we	knew	we	had	to	do	something	different. 	
We	laid	out	our	three	strategic	priorities	that	we	felt	we	needed	to 	
address,	that	we	continue	to	work	towards	today,	namely	rebalancing 	
our	portfolio;	driving	a	commercial	edge	to	the	way	we	do	business; 	
and	also	instilling	an	innovation	ethos	across	all	that	we	do. 	
In	February	2016,	we	launched	a	programme	of	work	designed	to	meet 	
these	priorities,	which	I	believe	is	now	bearing	real	fruit.	Unashamedly, 	
our	first	objective	was	to	restore	the	business	to	sales	growth,	as	without 	
that,	it	was	difficult	to	see	how	we	could	move	forward. 	
It	is	this	programme	of	work	that	has	driven	the	sales	recovery,	with	the 	
capital	investment	programme,	our	sales	training	and	ethos,	and	our 	
investment	in	and	adoption	of	reputation.com	as	our	tool	to	listen	to	our 	
guests,	coupled	with	better	informed	pricing	decisions,	being	the 	
driving	forces.
We	cannot	and	will	not	let	up	on	the	drive	to	grow	sales.	However,	we 	
think	we	have	identified	the	right	levers	that	will	continue	to	strengthen 	
our	position.	Despite	this	progress,	we	still	saw	our	profit	decline	last	year 	
and	so	attention	more	latterly	has	been	focused	on	the	opportunities	we 	
have	to	drive	efficiency.	To	that	end,	we	have	numerous	initiatives	that 	
we	have	been	working	on,	that	we	believe	will	start	to	change	the 	
gearing	of	our	business.
The	strategic	report	that	follows	updates	you	on	our	progress	against 	
the	three	strategic	priorities	in	the	year;	outlines	our	current	view	of	the 	
market	in	which	we	operate;	details	our	financial	performance	in	the 	
period;	and	updates	you	on	our	priorities	for	2018. 	
Overall,	I	believe	that	the	progress	we	have	made	in	the	year,	and	the 	
initiatives	we	have	in	place	going	forward,	leave	us	well-placed	to	deliver 	
continued	 market	 outperformance	 as	 well	 as	 long	 term	 shareholder	 value.
Over the last year we have made further progress against 
our three strategic priorities which were introduced to 
address a period of like-for-like sales
a
 declines and market 
under-performance: 
•	 To build a more balanced business
•	 To instil a more commercial culture
•	 To drive an innovation agenda 
Our	initiatives	in	these	areas	have	been	successful	in	restoring	sales 	
growth	and	mitigating	£26m	of	the	inflationary	cost	headwinds	which 	
we	faced	in	the	past	year.	With	inflationary	costs	continuing	into	the	next 	
financial	year,	our	focus	on	efficiency	remains	at	the	forefront.	To	this	end, 	
we	are	embarking	on	the	second	phase	of	initiatives	and	will	provide	a 	
further	update	on	these	in	May. 	
We	achieved	like-for-like	sales
a
	growth	of	1.8%	in	the	financial	year 	
having	continued	to	build	steadily	on	the	sales	improvement	which 	
began	in	the	second	half	of	FY	2016.	The	improvement	is	partly	driven 	
by	capital,	however	the	uninvested	estate	improved	like-for-like	sales
a
	
trajectory	by	0.6ppts	over	the	course	of	the	year.	This	momentum	has 	
seen	us	consistently	outperforming	the	market.	Although	the	final 	
quarter	was	impacted	by	disappointing	weather,	trading	since	the	year 	
end	has	resulted	in	strengthened	like-for-like	sales
a
	growth	of	2.3%	and 	
we	will	look	to	carry	this	momentum	forward.
As	a	result	of	the	inflationary	cost	pressures,	adjusted	operating	profit
a
	
was	down	3. 1%,	on	a	52	week	basis,	despite	the	positive	sales	trajectory. 	
Our priorities
Building a more balanced business
Our	estate	comprises	over	1,750	pubs	and	restaurants,	of	which	more 	
than	80%	are	freehold	or	long-leasehold.	Our	focus	in	this	area	is	to 	
optimise	the	balance	of	brands	across	the	estate	in	order	to	create 	
long-term	value. 	
We	are	committed	to	improving	the	quality	of	the	estate	by	exposing 	
it	to	more	premium	market	spaces	and	by	improving	overall	amenity. 	
We	conducted	a	full	estate	review	last	year	giving	us	a	plan	for	each	of 	
our	sites.	One	outcome	of	this	review	was	the	disposal	of	79	sites,	which 	
completed	earlier	in	the	year.	A	second	was	the	identification	of	a	section 	
of	the	estate	which	we	believe	may	not	be	positioned	to	generate	value. 	
These	are	predominantly	short	leasehold	sites	in	retail	and	leisure 	
locations,	currently	trading	below	expectations.	Having	reviewed	in	detail 	
the	future	trading	potential	and	brand	or	offer	conversion	options	for	these 	
sites	this	year,	we	have	concluded	that	several	are	unlikely	to	generate	a 	
positive	return	over	the	remaining	life	of	their	lease.	We	have	reflected 	
this	judgement	in	an	increased	onerous	lease	provision	this	year.

One	way	in	which	we	have	increased	the	premium	aspect	of	the 	
business	is	through	growth	of	Miller	&	Carter,	our	successful	steakhouse 	
format	which	is	generating	strong	like-for-like	sales.	Over	the	past	year 	
we	have	increased	the	number	of	sites	from	52	to	84,	with	26	of	the 	
additional	sites	facilitated	through	conversions	of	existing	sites,	and	we 	
anticipate	reaching	100	sites	at	the	beginning	of	the	next	calendar	year. 	
Conversions	are	delivering	average	EBITDA	returns	of	more	than	40%, 	
and	we	continue	to	explore	various	new	types	of	locations	for	the	brand. 	
We	also	continue	to	work	on	enhancing	the	amenity	of	other	formats 	
through	our	remodel	programme.	For	example,	we	have	continued 	
to	progress	our	evolution	of	Harvester	through	remodels	offering	a 	
fresh	and	contemporary	design,	bringing	rotisserie	chicken	to	the	fore, 	
as	well	as	a	retargeted	offer	which	is	delivering	sales	uplifts	of	10% 	
following	investment.
During	the	year	we	have	also	focused	investment	on	our 	
accommodation	offer.	We	operate	over	900	rooms	across	52	locations 	
and	believe	we	can	generate	a	strong	return	by	upgrading	the	rooms 	
to	be	more	closely	aligned	with	the	feel	of	the	brand	they	are	attached 	
to,	which	in	most	cases	means	premiumisation	of	the	accommodation. 	
We	have	completed	15	remodels	this	financial	year	with	sales	uplifts	of 	
over	20.0%	following	investment.	We	intend	to	continue	our	investment 	
in	accommodation	next	financial	year	and,	in	addition,	will	complete	the 	
build	of	a	purpose-built	lodge. 	
In	total	we	have	completed	252	remodels	and	conversions	in	FY	2017 	
(FY	2016	252),	which	means	we	are	on	track	to	maintain	the	reduction 	
in	our	redevelopment	cycle	from	11	to	12	years	previously	to	six	to	seven 	
years	now. 	
Instilling a more commercial culture
Instilling	a	commercial	culture	is	critical	to	achieving	profitable	sales 	
growth	and	we	are	pleased	with	the	progress	made	in	this	area	over	the 	
year.	The	four	new	operating	divisions,	each	containing	similar	customer 	
types	and	brands,	introduced	last	year	have	improved	our	guest	focus 	
and	we	have	made	significant	progress	across	a	number	of	initiatives 	
as	evidenced	by	our	like-for-like	sales	improvement. 	
The	growth	of	social	media	has	made	online	reputation	more	important 	
than	ever	and	we	have	made	significant	progress	in	this	area	over	the 	
course	of	the	year.	Using	reputation.com,	an	online	feedback 	
consolidation	tool,	managers	are	now	responding	to	83%	of	the	growing 	
number	of	online	comments,	up	from	59%	a	year	ago.	As	managers	have 	
increased	their	level	of	engagement	with	their	guests	we	have	also	seen 	
average	feedback	scores	increase	over	the	course	of	the	year	with	total 	
net	promoter	score	having	increased	to	7 .8	ppts	to	59%. 	
In	these	times	of	unprecedented	cost	headwinds,	it	is	important	that	we 	
rigorously	identify	and	secure	efficiency	and	cost	saving	opportunities 	
across	the	business.	Our	progress	in	this	area	is	well	advanced	with	cost

 REVENUE BY REGION  
 (FY 2017)
16 | Mitchells & Butlers plc | Annual report and accounts 2017 The	demand	for	food	delivery	within	the	industry	has	remained	in 	
growth	and	we	have	been	positioning	ourselves	in	order	to	benefit 	
from	customers’	changing	habits	which	we	believe	provide	an 	
opportunity	to	capture	incremental	sales.	Over	the	course	of	the	year 	
we	have	increased	the	number	of	sites	offering	Deliveroo	from	25	to	61. 	
We	have	also	carried	out	a	successful	trial	with	JustEat,	allowing	us	to 	
offer	Harvester	and	Toby	Carvery	delivery	as	well	as	click	and	collect. 	
People
As	ever,	people	are	central	to	our	Company’s	success.	We	operate	in	the 	
hospitality	industry	where	the	guest	experience	is	critical	and	cannot	be 	
delivered	without	the	dedication	of	our	46,000	employees.	In	the	face 	
of	numerous	changes	within	the	business,	we	are	pleased	that	our 	
engagement	scores	have	improved	by	2.0	points	and	our	retail	team 	
turnover	has	reduced	by	4. 1	percentage	points.	When	considered	in 	
the	context	of	the	average	cost	of	replacing	each	team	member,	including 	
the	cost	of	recruitment,	management	time	and	training,	this	represents 	
a	significant	cost	saving.
Our	apprentice	scheme	is	vitally	important	to	us.	We	believe	these 	
young	people	are	the	lifeblood	of	the	industry	and	we	are	delighted 	
to	have	added	a	further	1,300	people	to	our	programme	during	the 	
financial	 year.
A	further	advancement	in	this	area	is	the	launch	of	our	new	online 	
training	platform	containing	a	complete	library	of	training	materials	and 	
with	the	ability	to	plan	and	track	development.	This	resource	allows 	
employees	access	to	materials	which	will	help	them	to	further	their 	
career	as	and	when	they	want	to,	and	also	allows	them	to	learn	remotely 	
using	their	own	device.	The	platform	also	encourages	employees	to 	
connect	and	share	their	learning	experiences	to	encourage	others. 	
Current trading and outlook
In	the	first	seven	weeks	of	the	new	financial	year	like-for-like	sales
a
	 have	
grown	by	2.3%. 	
We	are	pleased	with	the	progress	made	in	the	last	year	having	returned 	
the	Company	to	sales	growth,	consistently	outperforming	the	market. 	
However,	the	market	in	which	we	operate	presents	us	with	an 	
unprecedented	level	of	challenge	and	uncertainty.	Through	this	period 	
we	shall	remain	focused	on	delivering	our	strategy	and	give	priority	to 	
maintaining	both	the	competitiveness	of	our	estate	and	a	strong	balance 	
sheet,	both	of	which	we	believe	will	leave	us	well	positioned	in	the 	
long	term.

a.		 The	Directors	use	a	number	of	alternative	performance	measures	(APMs)	that	are 	
considered	critical	to	aid	understanding	of	the	Group’s	performance.	Key	measures 	
are	explained	on	pages	140	to	142	of	this	report.
savings	of	£26m	delivered	in	FY	2017	and	further	initiatives	identified 	
for	delivery	in	the	current	financial	year.	For	example,	we	have	improved 	
two	key	operational	systems	during	the	year. 	
The	first	is	a	time	and	attendance	labour	system	which	requires	team 	
members	to	clock	in	and	out,	ensuring	that	staff	are	paid	accurately	for 	
the	time	worked,	whilst	also	increasing	deployment	efficiency	through 	
enhanced	planning	tools.	In	addition,	managers	are	able	to	access	the 	
system	from	any	device	and	the	next	stage	of	roll	out	will	include	the 	
capability	for	team	members	to	swap	shifts	and	for	us	to	share	resource 	
across	local	sites. 	
The	second	system	which	we	have	updated	during	the	year	is	our 	
stock	control	system.	This	upgraded	technology	halves	the	time	taken 	
to	do	stock	counts	and	improves	stock	control	ability,	reducing	both 	
the	instances	of	an	item	being	out	of	stock	and	wastage.	The	next	stage 	
of	this	development	is	an	auto	ordering	system	which	is	now	in	trial. 	
In	addition	to	this	activity,	we	continue	to	leverage	our	scale	through 	
our	central	procurement	processes,	meaning	that	we	are	able	to	mitigate 	
a	large	portion	of	the	input	cost	inflation	currently	impacting	the	market. 	
Alongside	our	procurement	efforts,	pricing	and	margin	management 	
remain	critical	activities	within	the	business.	We	are	currently	trialling 	
the	use	of	a	dynamic	pricing	model	in	order	to	challenge	and	to	fine 	
tune	our	pricing	strategy. 	
Our	focus	on	maximising	bookings	continues	and	we	have	now	set	up 	
a	central	bookings	team	to	take	calls	which	are	missed	at	site,	with	the 	
conversion	rate	to	a	booking	of	these	intercepted	calls	at	47%. 	
Food	safety	and	health	and	safety	will	always	remain	a	top	priority	for 	
the	business;	we	are	pleased	therefore	that	our	safety	record	improved 	
during	the	year.	At	the	end	of	the	year	97 .5%	of	our	sites	were	rated 	
good	or	very	good	for	food	hygiene,	a	higher	proportion	than	any 	
other	national	pub	company. 	
Driving an innovation agenda
Technology	continues	to	evolve	at	a	rapid	pace	and	we	have	made	good 	
progress	against	our	digital	strategy	which	positions	us	well	to	benefit 	
from	these	changes.	Technology	now	impacts	each	aspect	of	the	guest 	
journey,	from	learning	about	our	offers	to	experiences	in	site	with	us	and 	
our	ability	to	encourage	guests	to	return.	One	significant	area	of	progress 	
during	the	year	has	been	the	development	of	our	mobile	order	at	table 	
facility,	allowing	guests	to	order	food	and	drinks	from	their	own	devices. 	
This	technology	is	currently	in	trial	in	O’Neill’s	with	a	view	to	roll	out 	
across	the	brand	and	to	identify	opportunities	in	other	brands	for 	
development	and	roll	out.	The	order	at	table	facility	will	be	combined 	
with	our	existing	mobile	payment	platform	within	our	brand	apps, 	
facilitating	a	digital	experience	throughout	the	guest	journey.
