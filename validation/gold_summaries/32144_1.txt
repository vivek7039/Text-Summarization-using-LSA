2 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report
Results
Caledonia’s net asset value per share total return 
(‘NAVTR’) was 18.0% for the year ended 31 March 2017 , 
following 2.6% for the previous year. All four of the 
investment pools produced double digit returns. 
Investment income for the year was £47.3m, a fall 
of £3.4m compared with the unusually high level of 
the previous year. Additionally, following a number 
of portfolio realisations, in particular the successful sale 
of Park Holidays, the board is proposing a special dividend 
of 100p per share to be paid alongside an increased final 
dividend for the year. The latter would mark the 50th 
year of consecutive increases of our annual dividend. 
We are both proud of this achievement and determined 
to extend the record for many years to come.
Background to the year 
The year under review was dominated by two important 
events. First, the vote by the United Kingdom to leave 
the European Union and second, the presidential 
election in the United States of America. These events 
were key drivers of both stock market and currency 
movements across the world. Caledonia’s strategy of 
owning a balanced investment portfolio of both UK 
and overseas based companies and funds proved to be 
a sound hedge against what turned out to be a period 
of considerable volatility. Macro-economic factors, 
particularly the devaluation of sterling against most 
other currencies, produced a tail-wind for our portfolio, 
with currency gains contributing 6% of the 18% total 
return for the year. Private equity markets have also 
been buoyant, as demand for high quality businesses 
from funds with huge available resources have driven 
prices to levels not seen since before the financial 
crisis. We took advantage of this by selling several of 
our holdings, most notably Park Holidays, which netted 
£197m for Caledonia and gave us an overall return of 
three times the capital invested in 2013.
Caledonia’s strategy and business model
We aim to grow our shareholders’ capital over the long 
term and to provide an increasing annual dividend, both 
in real terms. We are attracted to the higher returns 
provided by equity investments and particularly in the 
unlisted or private equity markets. However, we are 
aware of the portfolio limitations and risks presented 
by only investing in private equity markets. We therefore 
currently have half our net assets in listed companies, 
focusing on long term international compounding equities 
and income stocks, together with quoted market funds, 
which give us the balanced exposure that we seek in 
terms of geography, sectors and liquidity.

One of the consequences of investing in larger private 
equity investments is that, when sold, large capital sums 
are returned on an irregular basis as demonstrated by 
the £207m of cash on our balance sheet at the year end. 
Caledonia’s objective is to ensure that its annual 
dividend payment is set at a level that is covered 
by income. However we recognise that shareholders 
are rewarded with a relatively low annual yield, which 
we address through the occasional payment of special 
dividends when appropriate. This year’s proposed 
special dividend will have the effect of increasing the 
yield averaged over the past five years from 2.9% to 
3.6%, and to 3.2% averaged from 1987, a period that 
included several business cycles and special dividends 
paid to shareholders, as illustrated in the following chart.

Geographic exposure
Caledonia takes a global approach to investment, 
actively seeking exposure to markets that grow faster 
and are less mature than the UK. We access these 
in two ways. First by investing in companies that 
themselves operate across the globe and second 
by selecting funds that specialise in the regions and 
sectors to which we wish to be exposed. In particular, 
we gain access to the US and Asian private equity 
markets via specialist funds operating there. These 
offer attractive returns, even after paying fees to the 
managers, and provide good diversification to the UK 
based majority owned businesses within our portfolio.

Risk
Our approach to risk stems from an understanding that 
shareholders’ capital is a precious commodity which 
we are not required to grow at an unsustainable rate. 
Instead, we aim to produce steady rates of capital 
return over the long term, underpinned by increasing 
annual receipts of dividend. We therefore invest in 
companies that have strong competitive positions 
in their markets and can generate consistently high 
margins, which in turn drive strong returns on capital 
over long time periods. This capital is recycled into 
their businesses further driving growth. Valuations will 
fluctuate over time, but by being invested in companies 
that compound their earnings in this way and which are 
not at risk through excessive gearing, we are confident 
that our returns over the long term will be at least as 
good as the market, but with less risk. 
We carefully review the composition of our portfolio 
to ensure that we are not overexposed to individual 
sectors, geographies or currencies. We also consider 
valuations, gearing and volatility as well as the continuing 
health of the underlying businesses and their sectors 
in assessing their place in the portfolio. We tend not to 
be a frequent buyer or seller of shares and the turnover 
of shares within our portfolio is very low compared 
with market funds.
Investment performance
The construction of the portfolio as described means 
that we do not seek to correlate our performance with 
the market. The board believes that it is better to 
compare returns with inflation to measure our short  
term performance. Over short periods we use a target 
range of RPI+3% to RPI+6%, but over ten years it is 
appropriate to benchmark our performance against 
the FTSE All-Share.
The table below shows a summary of performance 
against RPI for periods up to ten years and against the 
FTSE All-Share for ten years:

FTSE All-Share Total Return 5.7 
Performance vs FTSE 0.4
Currency
The contribution of foreign currency gains to our overall 
return for the year was 6.0%, accounting for one-third 
of our overall return. We have intentionally positioned 
the portfolio to gain a balanced exposure to different 
currencies and geographies. In general, we do not think 
that it is wise to speculate as to the future movement 
of currencies, nor do we intend to reposition the portfolio 
to ‘lock in’ currency gains made this year. We will continue 
to maintain a balanced exposure to the world’s leading 
economic zones (US, Asia and Europe) and their 
currencies over the long term.
Income and expenses 
Investment income for the year was £47.3m, a fall 
of some 7% compared with the previous year. The 
reduction for the year is principally accounted for by 
the unusually high level of dividends received from the 
Unquoted pool portfolio last year. Underlying investment 
income remains in line with our expectations and we are 
confident our more recent acquisitions will compensate 
for the loss of income from the sale of Park Holidays.
Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.07%, 
compared with 1.01% in 2016, reflecting slightly higher 
staff costs. This includes the costs of a direct unquoted 
market investment team.

Balance sheet and cash
At the year end, our balance sheet was ungeared with a 
net cash position of £207m, compared with an opening 
balance of £23m. We are in the process of renewing our 
banking facilities to ensure that they remain appropriate 
for a company with net assets of £1.9bn. Whilst we have 
used these facilities sparingly in the past, it is important 
that we have the flexibility to cover larger transactions in 
the unquoted arena, the timing of which can be difficult 
to anticipate. They also provide an excellent way to take 
advantage of market downturns and ensure we have 
capital available for private equity fund drawdowns.
Review of portfolio
The investment pools returned 20.7% for the year 
under review. It was a year of net divestment, with 
£418m of sales excluding movements within the 
Income pool. Alongside the £197m received from the 
sale of Park Holidays, we received significant proceeds 
from the sales of Bowers & Wilkins, Close Brothers and 
Capital Today China, the Chinese private equity fund 
that backed JD.com from a start-up. Excluding 
movements within the Income pool, we invested 
£230m over the past year, including £74m in the 
Liberation Group, the Channel Islands and UK based 
pub and brewing company. In addition, over £100m 
was invested in our private equity and quoted market 
funds in Asia and the US.

As can be seen from the table above, all the investment

pool, pre-forex returns for the year exceeded target 
returns. Despite the immature private equity portfolio 
and its exposure of over 90% to the US dollar, the Funds 
pool still managed a creditable pre-forex 10% return.

The Funds pool was a net investor for the year. Both 
the Quoted and Unquoted pools were net divestors, 
which at the year end drove our cash deposits to 11% 
of NAV. As a consequence, both pools are at the lower 
end or below their strategic allocation ranges. The 
Income pool is also below its target, though we do 
not feel under pressure to rectify this with markets 
at current high valuations. We will deploy capital 
into businesses which fit our strategy when they are 
available at acceptable valuation levels. The Funds pool 
strategy includes a programme of commitments to 
invest in private equity funds. These are drawn down 
when the funds find suitable investments, though are 
reasonably predictable over the long run on a portfolio 
basis. This programme is still relatively immature, such 
that we predict that we will be net investors for a 
further three to four years before returns of capital 
start to match new drawdowns.

5 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Overview of pool performance
Quoted (£468m, 25% of net assets)
We invest in high quality companies that have 
compounding business models and barriers to entry, 
and which make good use of capital. Experience shows 
that a concentrated and risk managed portfolio 
containing this type of company will deliver better risk 
adjusted returns than the market over the longer term.
The Quoted pool produced a return of 20.6% for the 
year. Strong investment gains were made by nearly all 
of the 18 core holdings that make up the portfolio. UK 
engineers Spirax Sarco and Hill & Smith were 
beneficiaries of the fall in sterling but also produced 
excellent underlying results, which were reflected in 
strong share price performance over the year. Hill & 
Smith has finally gained the recognition of the market 
for its consistent growth in earnings and high margins. 
The US holdings, such as Microsoft, Philip Morris, Becton 
Dickinson and Flowserve, were notable performers, as 
was Jardine Matheson, which operates predominantly 
in Southeast Asia. 
We sold our holdings in Close Brothers and 
LondonMetric Property, amongst others. Close 
Brothers remains a high quality and well run bank but 
we believe that the valuation and point in the cycle 
gave reasons for concern. We first invested in Close 
Brothers in 1987 and it became an outstanding creator 
of value for Caledonia’s shareholders, producing an IRR 
over 30 years of 16.4%. Bristow Group, the US 
helicopter operator, had another year of poor 
investment returns. The oil and gas industry is currently 
in a cyclical downturn and, despite the company’s 
search and rescue contracts, helicopter usage remains 
low. Two new holdings were instigated this year, but 
valuations remain high so other targeted companies in 
which we would like to invest continue to trade outside 
our price ranges.
Income (£216m, 11% of net assets)
A portfolio of global equities that produces a reliable 
and increasing income stream.
The Income pool produced a creditable return of 17.0% 
for the year, including a 4.8% dividend yield. Despite 
the increase in capital value which has led to a fall in 
the market yield, we have increased the running yield 
on the portfolio to 4.8% from 4.2% in the previous 
year. The portfolio consists of 22 companies and has 
produced an annualised return of 7.9% over the past 
two years and 9.6% since inception in 2011. The Brexit 
vote impacted a number of the portfolio companies 
that have businesses which operate solely in the UK, 
such as Royal Mail and Greene King. These are well 
balanced however by US and European holdings.
Unquoted (£568m, 30% of net assets)
We invest in unlisted businesses which require capital 
and an investor with a balance sheet who is able to 
provide a long term perspective. We invest in both 
majority and minority positions.
The Unquoted pool 
performance of 20.8% 
for the year comprised 
a capital return of 17.7% and an income return of 3.1%. 
The undoubted highlight was the sale of our 81.5% 
stake in Park Holidays to Intermediate Capital Group. 
We received cash proceeds of £197m which, when 
added to dividends received, represented 2.9x our 
original investment and an IRR of 44%. This company 
was a good fit with our investment criteria, was run by 
a very capable team of experienced managers and was 
one that, in normal circumstances, we might have held 
for considerably longer. However, we judged that the 
strong profits growth during the period of our 
ownership combined with high valuations for quality 
companies were compelling reasons to sell. We also 
sold our holding in Bowers & Wilkins and a number 
of smaller legacy assets during the year. Total sale 
proceeds and income received was £262m for the year.

C h a i rm a n ’ s 	 a n d 	 C h i e f 	 Ex ecu ti v e ’ s 	 r e p o rt 	 co n tinu ed
We made one new 
investment – Liberation 
Group in July 2016. We 
invested an initial £71m 
for a 97.9% equity stake 
(management own the 
remainder), valuing the company at £118m in total. 
Liberation Group is a pub, restaurant and drinks 
business with its roots in the Channel Islands. In 2015, 
it purchased the Butcombe brewery together with a 
number of pubs in South West England. It had 100 pubs 
in total on acquisition and the strategy is to expand the 
number of pubs on the mainland from the Bath/Bristol 
area to the south west along the axis of the A303. 
We were attracted to the combination of a solid asset 
backed business in which we can continue to invest 
capital at a good rate of return in the future. It is managed 
by an experienced team from the industry and they 
have hit the ground running, buying nine pubs since 
our acquisition.
The existing Unquoted 
pool portfolio has traded 
broadly in line with 
budget during the year. 
Of particular note is the performance of Seven 
Investment Management, which has increased assets 
under management and profits ahead of budget, and 
Gala Bingo, which has traded in line with our 
expectations at the time of the acquisition 18 months 
ago. Cobepa produced a strong investment return for 
the year and, being euro denominated, we also saw a 
currency uplift. It is currently Caledonia’s largest 
holding, albeit diversified through a portfolio of 14 
businesses. Choice Care, the care 
homes operator, has almost 
completed a carefully managed 
expansion plan, adding about a 
third to its capacity. We are very 
aware of the danger of 
expanding too quickly and overstretching the capability 
to deliver top quality care, which remains, above all 
else, the number one priority. The pricing environment 
remains tough, with local authorities under great 
pressure to cut spending however, despite this, new 
bed spaces are being filled at acceptable margins. 
Sterling Industries is starting to see some recovery in 
its core markets of iron and steel and oil and gas, but 
had a difficult year with profits down sharply.
We reviewed well 
over 200 investment 
opportunities during the 
year, making two offers 
with one new investment 
and two follow-on investments. There is a significant 
amount of capital in the market chasing a small supply of 
high quality deals, which has inevitably led to increased 
valuations. We believe in buying the right business for the 
right price and try to use the competitive advantage over 
private equity funds brought by investing our own 
balance sheet (and thereby not being constrained by 
the period of time over which we can own a business), 
which management teams often find appealing.
Funds (£404m, 21% of net assets)
We invest in both private equity and quoted market 
funds, with an emphasis on providing exposure to areas 
of the world where we are less willing to invest directly.
The Funds pool produced an excellent return for the 
year of 23.1%. Quoted market funds, focused on Asia 
and the US, represented 42% of pool assets at the year 
end. We deployed capital into Asia when sentiment was 
very much against the region two years ago and the 31% 
return this year has vindicated this decision. It remains 
one of the few areas of the world that is not fully valued. 
The money is looked after by five different managers 
across the two regions in a mixture of strategies.
The private equity portfolio continues to grow with 
£79m invested this year into a portfolio now valued at 
£235m. We received £53m of distributions from private 
equity funds following portfolio sales, although half of 
this came from further sales of JD.com by Capital Today 
China. We have total outstanding commitments of 
£293m, about 80% of which we expect to be drawn 
down over the next seven or eight years depending on 
the nature of the cycle. The programme is anchored by 
several fund of funds relationships, especially in Asia, 
which has a nascent private equity market. We believe 
this to be a sensible risk mitigant, as well as a good way 
to stay fully informed of, and close to, the market.

7 Annual report 2017 Caledonia Investments plc  
Dividend 
The board is recommending to shareholders a final 
dividend of 39.9p per share, giving a total for the year 
of 54.8p per share, an increase of 4.2% over 2016. 
This will be the 50th year of unbroken annual increases. 
The dividend is a vital component of our return to 
shareholders and, as explained earlier, the strategy 
of the company is focused on its maintenance and 
gradual increase. The proposed final dividend will 
amount to £29.1m.
The board is also proposing to pay a special dividend 
of 100p per share alongside the final dividend, at an 
amount of £54.9m. As explained earlier, the board 
considers it appropriate to augment the long term yield 
offered to investors through the payment of occasional 
special dividends when the company’s long term 
business model delivers cash in excess of its strategic 
investment plans.
Discount
Over the year, the share price rose by 20% and the 
discount of the share price to NAV per share ranged 
between 13% and 26%. We review the valuations of our 
unquoted holdings in September and March each year 
and announce the NAV per share figures shortly after 
the relevant month end, which means that our discount 
can fluctuate in the few days in between until the share 
price adjusts to the updated NAV per share figures.
We did not buy back any shares during the year, but will 
again seek the necessary permissions from shareholders 
at the AGM to do so should they offer particular value.
Board
Rod Kent, who has been a member of the board since 
2011 and Chairman since 2012, has decided to step 
down at the AGM. The company, shareholders and past 
management of Caledonia owe him an unrepayable 
debt of gratitude for his outstanding contribution over 
many, many years. 
Rod first came into contact with Caledonia in the early 
1980s when British & Commonwealth (‘B&C’) was its 
largest investment. He advised the company on its exit 
from B&C in 1987 and ensured that the proceeds from 
the sale were received in a form that was as good as 
cash. This proved prescient when B&C sadly went into 
administration in 1990 following the disastrous 
purchase of Atlantic Computers.
Caledonia had become a significant investor in Close 
Brothers, where Rod was managing director, in 1987 
and increased its stake further over the next few years. 
Close Brothers became the cornerstone of Caledonia’s 
investment success over the next 25 years and, combined 
with his continuing advice, the company has continued 
to thrive. He joined the board of Caledonia in 2011 and 
succeeded James Loudon as Chairman in 2012. We 
wish Rod the very best for a long, happy and peaceful 
retirement. David Stewart will succeed Rod as Chairman 
at the AGM in July.
Outlook
The valuations of equities, bonds, property and non-
conventional assets have been driven to high levels by 
unusually low interest rates. Markets look to be 
reaching the final leg of a sustained bull run with 
valuations now looking stretched. The Federal Reserve 
has increased US interest rates twice recently, taking 
the first tentative steps towards normalising monetary 
policy in the world’s largest economy. There are signs 
that the Bank of England is thinking along similar lines 
albeit with the additional complication of Brexit to 
negotiate. If monetary stimulus is removed and the 
cost of capital increases, there will be an equal and 
opposite effect on valuations. Despite this threat and 
events such as the Brexit vote in the UK, markets have 
held firm probably in part due to the promises 
Mr Trump made in his campaign to become President 
of the US. Caledonia’s modus operandi is not to attempt 
to time market falls, but it guides our thinking in 
ensuring that our risk profile is appropriate for this 
stage in the cycle. 
We continue to be invested in companies that will 
generate reliable cash flows in all market circumstances. 
Our long term outlook also makes us wary of excessive 
debt, which can be the downfall of a good business in 
a downturn of the economic cycle. We currently have 
a cushion of cash on the balance sheet which confirms 
our conservative stance, but is also there to take 
advantage of opportunities that we identify. We 
remain confident that we will be able to meet our 
shareholders’ requirements for capital growth and 
income in the future, without needing to expose their 
capital to undue risk.
