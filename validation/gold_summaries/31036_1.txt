Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Justin Ash, Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A
We need to be the best in everything we  
do – caring for our patients, working with  
our consultants, recruiting and retaining  
our staff, achieving the best outcomes,  
and delivering value.
I am determined that Spire Healthcare  
will be famous for delivering the very best  
in quality and clinical care. Quality will define  
and differentiate us.”
What have been your initial  
impressions since joining Spire Healthcare? 
I have found that Spire provides 
outstanding care to thousands of patients 
across Britain every day. 
My many visits to our hospitals and our 
CQC ratings show that Spire Healthcare 
staff are devoted to caring for our patients, 
well qualified and dedicated. Their work 
is underpinned by good governance 
practices. I’ve seen this in every hospital 
I’ve visited and the many staff I’ve met, 
as well as the patients I’ve spoken with.
Spire Healthcare clinical standards are 
good, with lots of examples of outstanding 
best practice and interesting improvement 
projects. There are, nonetheless, variations 
in quality. Three of our hospitals – Spire 
Cheshire, The Montefiore and Sussex 
hospitals – are rated ‘Outstanding’ by the 
CQC, and we have excellent equivalent 
results in Spire Cardiff and Edinburgh 
hospitals. Twenty more are rated 
‘Good’, while some were rated ‘Requires 
Improvement’ on their first CQC inspection. 
Overall, this puts Spire Healthcare on a par 
with private sector healthcare standards.  11

Similarly, Spire Healthcare runs effective 
operations, good local marketing 
campaigns and has seen success in 
growing its private patient base. The estate 
is well invested and often innovative, 
for example, developing a da Vinci robot 
in Spire Southampton Hospital and knee 
robots in Spire Edinburgh and Bushey 
hospitals. It has strong central teams, 
and good local hospital leadership under 
its hospital directors. As with clinical 
standards, there is also lots of opportunity 
to be more consistent as a unified group.
My overall impression is of a good, well-run 
healthcare provider, with lots of exciting 
opportunity to improve operational 
performance, patient recruitment and 
deliver more consistently outstanding 
quality for the benefit of our patients.
What was performance like in 2017?
I joined in late October 2017, after  
a period of some volatility in operating 
performance.
Where our work matters most, with 
patients, Spire Healthcare cared for 
269,300 in-patient and daycase patients 
during the year. Clinical quality remained 
high, with good outcomes and only one 
incident of MRSA or MSSA, and c.difficile 
infection rates reducing further to 0.13 
per 10,000 bed days. You can read details 
on this in our Group Medical Director’s 
review on pages 20 to 25. 
Headline financial performance figures 
can be found in the Chairman’s statement, 
and the CFO reviews them in detail on 
pages 32 to 43. The results were mixed 
overall. Spire Healthcare experienced a 
reduction in NHS-funded care, especially 
contracts with NHS Trusts, and NHS-
funded care actually declined in the 
second half of the year. This was driven 
by cost saving measures by the NHS. 
Income from Private Medical Insurance 
(‘PMI’) funded care declined slightly, 
while treatment and care for patients 
who chose to Self-pay increased strongly 
by 12.0%, an encouraging trend, which 
we expect to continue.
A major variance to expectations was 
the slower-than-planned build-up of 
the three new sites: Spire Manchester, 
Spire Nottingham and Spire St Anthony’s 
hospitals. These are all outstanding 
facilities that I’m delighted to have in the 
Group. Improving their performance will 
be a key feature of our forward strategy. 
How do you see trends in Spire 
Healthcare’s markets?
The trends in our three main payor 
groups are connected to a certain degree. 
PMI is currently about half of our business, 
but it remains largely a benefit provided 
by companies for their employees. 
As such, overall growth in PMI is linked 
closely to the health of the economy 
and has remained flat. Forward growth 
in this sector, in the short term, will 
come from growing market share.
The independent sector provides valuable 
capacity for the NHS as it seeks to deliver 
care in the face of well publicised cost, 
capacity and staffing pressures. Our 
NHS business is important to us and 
we will continue to build close working 
partnerships with our local commissioners 
and GPs. Major contracts with NHS trusts 
are unlikely to grow in the future, while 
e-Referral is still not fully adopted. 
This provides choice for NHS patients, 
underpinned in the NHS constitution, 
and Spire Healthcare’s wide participation 
in this is an asset. Overall, we seek to hold 
share in the NHS market.
Our major growth opportunity lies in 
those patients who elect to Self-pay. 
Their reasons for choosing to pay for 
private treatment vary. They may wish 
to be seen faster as waiting times on the 
NHS continue to rise, or seek treatments 
that are unavailable within the NHS. They 
may feel that they can self-insure more 
competitively and flexibly than through 
PMI products. They may just value the 
convenience of having their treatment 
when and where they want, in hotel-level 
surroundings, with well-invested facilities. 
Whatever their motivation, the macro 
market drivers suggest that Self-pay 
will be our key growth sector. We intend 
to grow our market share aggressively  
in this area.
I want every member of  
the Spire Healthcare family 
to judge themselves on  
the quality of the care they 
deliver to our patients.”  12 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
What are your immediate priorities?
Consistently high-quality and outstanding 
clinical care are fundamental to 
our business. 
I think patients see us as good, but  
maybe not the best everywhere – and  
in truth, while some of our hospitals are 
outstanding, others are less consistent. 
Raising standards to the highest levels  
and ensuring consistency of approach  
and delivery across the Company, in every 
hospital, is our first and last priority. 
We want all our hospitals to be ‘Good’ 
or ‘Outstanding’. All of the time. I intend 
Spire Healthcare to be famous for both 
its quality of care and its ability to 
evidence that quality.
We also need to optimise operational 
performance, particularly in our recent 
major investments. I have conducted a 
review of lessons learnt about the cultural 
and operational changes required in 
developing and moving into new facilities, 
and drawn on my extensive experience of 
buying and opening new healthcare sites. 
All three new hospitals are top of my list 
to steer to robust financial performance, 
as well as being great centres of patient 
care. I was delighted that Spire St Anthony’s 
Hospital was recently re-rated ‘Good’ by 
the CQC and see much evidence that all 
three sites will deliver strong returns. I am 
pleased to say that Spire Manchester and 
St Anthony’s hospitals are making good 
progress. Both should be profitable in 
2018. Spire Nottingham Hospital will take 
further work to achieve its full potential.
We will also rapidly be enhancing 
Spire Healthcare’s marketing capability, 
especially digitally, to make our Self-pay 
offering transparent and easy to access, 
as well as improving our call services. 
This will support our Self-pay 
growth ambitions.
With more central support, an increased 
focus on leadership, training and human 
resources, enhanced leadership, and a  
lot of hard work, I am confident Spire 
Healthcare will deliver excellent outcomes 
in the months ahead.
We will continue to invest in our current 
estate, with a view to continuing to be the 
lead investor in the sector. At the same 
time, in the short to medium term we will 
be focused on increasing the return on 
capital and cash returns of historical and 
new investments, and cautious about 
further new hospital developments until 
the case for them is proven by results.
How do you see Spire Healthcare’s  
services developing?
In a number of ways – all aimed at 
increasing patient, staff and partner 
satisfaction. 
Clinically, we will focus on specific 
elements of our care, including our 
patients’ understanding of their mobility 
after a procedure, and their comfort with 
what drugs to take and how to recover 
effectively on their return home. We want 
to empower our patients to a speedy 
recovery and active life.
We will continue to develop service 
lines in demand in the private sector, in 
particular Spire Healthcare has a growing 
paediatric and cardiology capability. 
Operationally, we will have one best way 
of working in increasing areas, aligning 
all our hospitals around simple, national 
systems and operating approach – one 
‘Spire Way’ of working – while leaving 
room for local best practice and strong 
leadership by our hospitals’ senior 
management teams.
We need to improve engagement with 
our partners, which slipped last year. 
Based on targeted understanding of 
consultants and the development of 
their private practices, we will provide 
the support and services that they need. 
We wish consultants to grow their 
practice with us, and to feel that Spire 
Healthcare is the very best place to bring 
patients, as well as further developing 
a mutual respect for the importance of 
governance on the granting and overseeing 
of practising privileges. Spire Healthcare 
works hard to ensure that GPs recommend 
patients to us based on sound knowledge 
of our capabilities and this will continue.
I am also excited by the early success of 
Spire GP . People with busy lives are turning 
to this service for flexible and bespoke care, 
and we will soon roll this out to all our sites.
In the last three months, 
the executive committee 
and I have developed our 
strategic framework to 
support a renewed focus 
on growing our business. 
We have put in place five 
clear strategic priorities to 
help us achieve the growth 
we believe we can deliver. 
This aims to drive improving 
returns on capital.”

How important is the culture of  Spire 
Healthcare on the success of the business?
Since joining Spire Healthcare I have spent 
a lot of time in our hospitals meeting 
many colleagues, and it was clear right 
from my first visits that we have a strong, 
positive culture across the business. 
Our colleagues are passionate about 
the work they do and the care they 
provide to our patients. They are 
fundamental to the success of the 
business so it is hugely important 
to me that they are highly engaged. 
The innovative ideas, feedback and 
suggestions that I have heard first hand 
from colleagues are invaluable so we have 
introduced mechanisms to further 
encourage this, along with promoting 
collaborative working across our hospitals 
and support functions. I believe our values 
help demonstrate and represent how we 
work together so we will further increase 
awareness of these and what they mean 
to our colleagues in their day-to-day roles. 
Recognising the contribution of our 
colleagues is a key element of our culture 
and I am confident that our new 
recognition scheme will reinforce the 
importance we place on this. 
How do you see Spire Healthcare’s 
strategy developing? 
The summary of our ambitions is that 
we aim to be the most recognised and 
respected healthcare provider brand 
in the UK. I call that being the ‘go to’ 
brand in UK independent healthcare.
We will become famous for our clinical 
quality and customer care.
This will underpin growth in all three 
payor sectors. We will work with the 
NHS to see us as their preferred local 
option for high-quality treatments, and 
with PMI providers to feel comfortable 
signposting Spire Healthcare as the 
benchmark provider in all our services. 
A high-quality brand will underpin our 
communication with people who are 
increasingly looking for a Self-pay route to 
fast, effective and personalised treatment.
Accelerating growth and developing the 
market-leading national brand that makes 
Spire Healthcare the first choice of all 
patients – but particularly those self-
paying – will depend on outstanding 
performance, transparency in pricing 
and clinical excellence. 
We will seek continuous improvement 
and consistency in our relationship with 
consultants, in the capability of our teams 
and in operational excellence at all levels. 
All this aims to support a steadily improving 
return on the recent substantial capital 
investment in Spire Healthcare.
Simply put, we will aim to run outstanding 
hospitals, totally focused on delivering 
outstanding quality of care, consistently 
in all our sites. That’s how Spire Healthcare 
will grow to be the UK market leader.

In practical terms, some of the enablers 
involved include increasing investment 
in digital tools, communication, customer 
feedback and service development, 
and hospital infrastructure.
What do you see as key in helping 
your team to deliver?
Sometimes, in healthcare, people get 
very excited about technology, which 
does indeed play a vital role in Spire 
Healthcare’s well invested proposition. 
I get most excited about our people. 
Everything we do depends on them, they 
deliver our promise to patients every day. 
Healthcare is hard work, requiring 
passion and commitment, be that in 
Spire Healthcare or any other provider. 
I am committed to increasing the training 
and recognition needed to support and 
engage that commitment, and we have a 
number of initiatives underway to do this. 
It is also well recognised that in some 
areas there are shortages of qualified  
staff. This makes it even more important 
to attract, train, retain and develop our 
staff in a much more considered and 
consistent manner.
Success is also linked directly to leadership, 
particularly at the key hospital director and 
matron levels. Here we are launching an 
externally validated programme to identify, 
evaluate, train, motivate and develop 
consistently great leaders, to complement 
our many internal conferences and 
specialist skills events. I have enjoyed 
joining the first cohorts on our new 
hospital director programme.
Spire Healthcare will continue to foster 
a well-structured environment and culture 
that encourages feedback and values ideas, 
learning and constant improvement. 
Should it be needed, Spire Healthcare 
also runs a highly robust and confidential 
whistleblowing procedure to ensure 
everyone feels free to hold us to account 
for the highest standards of conduct 
and care.

human resources in the Our people section
