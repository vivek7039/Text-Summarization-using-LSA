 Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 4
Chairman’s Statement
Overview of the year
I am delighted to report that FY17 was another successful 
year for the Group. Our revenue grew to £135.1 million, 
increasing 14% compared to FY16 and in line with market 
expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA increased to 16.1 million, up 7%, and 
adjusted profit before tax increased £4.8 million to £13.0 
million, up 58%. Profit after tax has risen to £7.4 million,  
up 29%.
With Grocery inflation rising during the year, consumer 
footfall in the Discount Sector showed no signs of 
slowing down as shoppers continued to look for ways of 
offsetting rising household prices and switching to lower 
cost alternatives. As a result of new contract wins starting 
in late 2016, our value market share in the Discount 
Sector grew to over 50%, firmly endorsing Accrol as the 
soft tissue supplier of choice for the sector.
The year was not without its challenges. In anticipation 
of Sterling weakness and volatility following the UK’s 
decision to leave the European Union, we moved to 
protect ourselves from adverse exchange rate 
fluctuations by significantly hedging our exposure to help 
mitigate raw material cost price increases. However, we 
have continued to look ahead, positioning ourselves for 
growth, investing in both our facilities and our team to 
help us capitalise on the market opportunity.   
During the year, we opened our new production facility 
at Leyland, Lancashire, which gives us the opportunity to 
install a total of 6 tissue converting lines and the potential 
to generate revenues in excess of £100 million from the 
site, and £250 million in aggregate. We currently have 2 
lines installed and recently announced the addition of a 
3rd line which will be installed towards the end of 2018 as 
we seek to extend our reach into the Major Multiples. 
We also embarked on an ambitious plan to reorganise 
our warehousing and logistics operations, creating a 
centralised finished goods hub next to the M58 in 
Skelmersdale, Lancashire. This will enable us to better 
service our customers and prepare for future growth.
Accrol’s founders, the Hussain family, have now fully 
exited the business in line with the strategy we set out at 
IPO, and we have made a number of new senior 
management hires across the business. I would like to 
thank the Hussain family for a smooth and successful 
transition to new management.
Strategy and outlook
The continued oversupply of Parent Reels shows no sign 
of abating and as of January 2017, a further 111 tissue 
mills were on order or in their final stages, keeping 
pricing competitive and supporting our strategy to 
procure Parent Reels versus own manufacture. We will 
continue to source reels from around the globe, taking 
advantage of new technology and spare capacity. 
The majority of Private Label retail shelf prices for soft 
tissue are still at pre-EU referendum levels. There are 
positive signs that this is changing, albeit slower than we 
expected, and we expect the industry as a whole to pass 
on the effects of the weaker pound as currency 
contracts unwind.

Key to our expansion will be to strengthen 
our relationships in the growing Discount 
Sector, the continued consumer shift 
towards Private Label tissue products and 
winning new business in the Premium Retail 
Sector. Our recent investment in new 
production capacity, logistics and 
warehousing facilities will allow us to build 
on our strong market position.
Dividend policy
The Board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy. The interim

together with the interim dividend represents
