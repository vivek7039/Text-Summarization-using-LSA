 MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016/17 I 3 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report another year of considerable progress for the Group. 
Total like-for-like* sales including VAT reﬂected a 5.3% increase on the prior year. Proﬁt before taxation 
was up 20.3% to £7.1m, compared with £5.9m in the previous year. EBITDA** continued on a positive trend 
to £13.6m, compared with £12.5m in the previous year. Similarly, our cash position continues to be very 
strong, despite the ongoing reﬁt programme. 
The retail environment became one of the most highly competitive we have seen for some considerable 
time, with heavy and intense discounting. We remained focused on our multi-branded and segmented 
pricing architecture and traded our way through what was an unforgiving market, which saw a number of 
new branded entrants to the Menswear market and the exit or reduction in market share for a couple of 
long established brands, reinforcing the need for us to keep close to consumer trends and to modernise 
our offer accordingly.
The core Moss Bros master brand is now well established and we saw reasonable growth in each of our 
supporting sub-brands of Moss London, Moss 1851, and Moss Esq, with Moss London expanding our reach 
to a younger customer, capitalising on the growing trend of occasions like School Proms. 
Actions to develop our product offer have included the growth of ‘Tailor Me’, which is achieving signiﬁcant 
traction as a more accessible form of bespoking, enabling a signiﬁcant proportion of our suit range to be 
personalised. This unique proposition is now available across our entire estate and we have grown sales 
throughout the last 12 months, undoubtedly adding to our growth in market share.
We have almost completed our store reﬁt programme this year, completing 11 reﬁts, which means almost 
all of our store estate has now been modernised over the last four years. This increased investment 
has impacted cash in the short term as planned but the proven payback means we are achieving the 
returns predicted and we turn our attention now to maintaining and reﬁning our estate to reﬂect the more 
premium positioning of our brands amongst our target customers. 
We opened a further 7 stores in Westﬁeld Stratford City, the Merry Hill shopping centre, Worcester, Belfast, 
Harrogate, Newbury and on Teesside. We also relocated our Hatﬁeld store and closed 4 stores, giving us 
an overall store count of 127 stores, compared with 124 last year.
We continued the development of the organisation and talent by the recruitment of a new Group Finance 
Director Tony Bennett, who joined us in August 2016. We have also recruited a new Buying Director, 
Nick Reed, who joins us from Charles Tyrwhitt, the multi-channel Menswear retailer, which he joined in 
2000. He has a strong product, brand and commercial background in online, multi-site and international 
consumer businesses, with highly relevant experience in Menswear. He will join us in April 2017. 
We have a strong and stable team of Non-Executive Directors and continue to review our succession plans 
with rigour to be sure we manage the succession of the Board and its various Committees in a seamless 
way, ensuring we retain the highest levels of governance. 
The team continues to apply strong cash and working capital controls and the business continues to 
be debt free, with a healthy cash balance, supporting the Board’s progressive dividend and investment 
policies.
*  Like-for-like (including VAT) represents ﬁnancial information for e-commerce and stores open during both the current and prior ﬁnancial periods and 
compares 52 weeks against 52 weeks, except for stores reﬁtted in the period, where the period closed for reﬁt is excluded from both the current and 
prior ﬁnancial periods. Like–for-like Hire and Tailor Me sales are calculated on cash receipts in the period, before adjustment for the movement in 
the level of deposits held.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
The Board is proposing the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 3.98 pence per share to be paid on 23 June 2017 
to all shareholders on the register on 2 June 2017 (ex dividend date 1 June 2017). The recommended 
total dividend for the year will be 5.89 pence per share, an increase of 6.1% on the previous year. It is our 
intention to continue this progressive dividend policy balanced against the wider investment needs of the 
business. 
In the coming year, we will leverage our roll out of ‘Tailor Me’, accelerate the reinvention of our Hire 
offer and leverage and continue to build the infrastructure to modernise our multi-channel offer, whilst 
investing more in our colleague and service propositions. This will be done in the context of signiﬁcant 
external cost pressures from the increases in the National Living Wage, the Apprenticeship Levy, the 
revaluation of business rates and increased purchasing costs due to the combined effects of a devalued 
pound. We expect the trading environment for the business in 2017 to remain challenging.
Although we recognise external macro challenges, we are well placed to leverage our specialist 
credentials and to enhance our position as ‘the ﬁrst choice for men’s tailoring’.
Finally, I would like to recognise the fact that we differentiate ourselves through the highest levels of 
customer service, which is the result of substantial training and hard work of all of our people. I would like 
to thank them all for their continued dedication and contribution to another successful year for the Group.
