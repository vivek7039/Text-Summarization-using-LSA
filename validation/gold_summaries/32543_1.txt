 “We continue to make strong progress 
against our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
Challenging market conditions have impacted 
upon trading performance during the year, 
particularly in our Torque Transmission and 
Chain Americas businesses. We have not 
allowed these challenges to delay or obstruct 
our strategic progress and continue to take 
the actions required to position the Group 
well for when markets recover. ”

STEP 2020 strategy overview
A major milestone in our STEP 2020 programme will be the delivery of sustainable mid-teens margins. We remain confident that the 
business can meet this objective and, whilst the challenging market environment has, as reported, slowed the rate of EPS progression over 
the last two years, we are pleased with the overall progress with, and benefits of, STEP 2020 which is alleviating the impact of reduced 
levels of demand. We are putting in place a number of additional self-help initiatives to mitigate the ongoing challenging environment and to 
maintain progress.

Mid teens % 
margins
The market for industrial chain remains highly 
fragmented across geographies and sector 
niches.  As we have demonstrated from the 
successful acquisition of the Gronau based Tooth 
Chain business, selected acquisitions have the 
potential to deliver incremental shareholder 
value. This value derives from:

 consolidating volume into facilities with 
 efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient 
 manufacturing capability; or

  accessing incremental growth   
 opportunities in new product sectors or  
 new geographies, building on the    
 strength in depth of Renold’s existing
 product range and geographic reach.
Renold has the underlying characteristics 
to make the Group a natural consolidator 
in the industrial chain market. As the 
Number 2 by sales we have the reputation, 
scale and product range to operate as a 
strong foundation for integration.
Enhanced customer service
We believe Renold’s reputation for quality and 
performance is unsurpassed in the market.  
However, historically our performance in customer 
service has not lived up to the same standards.  To 
address this, we have implemented strategies to 
introduce 24, 48 and 72 hour response times on a 
range of standard and conﬁgured chains and 
extended this concept to standard gear and 
coupling products.  We intend to continue to 
improve and evolve our offering to enhance the 
levels of service to our customers, whether in 
standard products or in highly-engineered bespoke 
solutions.
Product capability
We will leverage our existing superior products in 
Chain and Torque Transmission. We will also 
reinvigorate the development and speed to market 
of a new range of products in both divisions. We 
will leverage our product reputation to add value 
to our customers as we solve their complex power 
transmission problems.
Renold has strong market shares in certain 
geographic markets and product categories.  
However, the fragmented nature of the power 
transmission market and the extremely diverse 
end-user markets creates signiﬁcant opportunities 
for organic growth. Whilst market conditions have 
proved challenging in recent years, the activities to 
deliver future organic growth have continued.
Improved sales and marketing
We will continue to invest in the Group’s commercial 
teams, building upon the commercial coverage 
across Europe, the Americas and in Asia. We will 
increasingly target speciﬁc end-user markets where 
growth opportunities in our existing product ranges 
can help to mitigate the cyclicality experienced in 
our core industrial goods markets. Through greater 
levels of direct interaction with our end customers, 
our targeted marketing and communication 
activities, we will help to reinforce our reputation for 
quality engineering solutions and high performance 
products. These actions will position Renold to 
secure a greater share of the markets in which we 
operate and to access related markets where we 
don’t currently operate.
Right size cost base
Many of our manufacturing processes include 
manual elements that inevitably reduce any volume 
beneﬁts due to disproportionate increases in costs. 
We aim to deliver ﬂexible capacity with low 
marginal costs.
Fix product margins
We aim to achieve appropriate value for the highly 
technical products we offer to the market.
Optimise business processes
We aim to deliver support function business 
processes with the same degree of ﬂexibility that 
we are targeting in our operations. By implementing 
simple repeatable and standardised business 
processes we will lower our breakeven point.
Make the right hires to drive growth
We will invest in our people to enable them 
to match the performance of our enhanced 
manufacturing and business processes. In 
some cases this will involve new talent and 
ideas being brought into the business.
Restructuring is the area of greatest progress to 
date since the commencement of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan in 2013.  Whilst many projects have 
been successfully implemented, numerous 
opportunities remain to improve efﬁciency and 
enhance ﬂexibility.
Right size capacity
Historically the business suffered from excess and 
inﬂexible capacity. We aim to signiﬁcantly improve 
in this area by eliminating excess capacity and 
enhancing the ﬂexibility of existing capacity through 
increased automation. This will lead to a direct 
improvement in variable and net margins.

Acquisitions in Phase III. These phases are steps in a programme to deliver a 
common set of Strategic Objectives. 
In order to deliver these Strategic Objectives, each business unit has developed an action plan. The individual actions make up the many 
steps and are grouped into what we call our ‘Staircases’. Together these staircases are the building blocks that combine to deliver our 
Strategic Objectives. 
The table below identifies the key linkages between the Staircases, the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan and the Strategic Objectives.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Our Strategic Objectives and Progress
Staircase Overview Progress in 2016/17
Activities for 2017/18  
and beyond
We operate a varied and wide ranging 
set of business processes which differ 
in almost all locations. All of them inter-
link in different ways with multiple 
different users and computer systems.
Our aim is to implement one global 
standard operating model. This 
will unify our people, processes 
and systems. Each of our business 
processes is being designed to be 
simple and effective while being robust 
and as automated as possible. That 
will free up management time to focus 
on value added activities. It will also 
reduce the cost and simplify support 
for our information systems.
Our intention is to create one global, 
integrated ERP system, which 
incorporates efficient and standardised 
business processes.
We continued on our journey towards 
this objective during 2016/17. Three 
operating units are now live on the new 
ERP system, including the acquired 
Tooth Chain business. This completed 
the integration into the Renold Group 
and removed reliance on vendor 
systems and support. 
The implementation of the ERP system 
is a multi-year project which will 
continue into FY17/18 and beyond. This 
programme incorporates elements 
that go beyond the base ERP system 
and includes production planning 
and scheduling, engineering and CRM 
systems.
Our manufacturing facilities have been 
underinvested over many years. This 
has led to inefficient manufacturing 
processes, long lead times, excess 
waste and increased waiting time as 
products pass between multiple work 
centres.
Our aim is to modernise our 
manufacturing capability to match 
our leading edge engineering and 
production know-how. Better equipped 
facilities will shorten lead-times to 
enhance customer service, reduce 
stock holdings to improve the balance 
sheet, and contribute strongly towards 
our objective of improving operating 
margins.
During the year, we completed the 
transfer of our European Distribution 
Centre from France to Uslar in 
Germany. This transfer permitted the 
co-location of the logistics centres for 
European manufactured product with 
that imported from our non-European 
operations. It also increases capacity 
at our manufacturing facility in Einbeck 
through the availability of additional 
space for manufacturing.
Our manufacturing facility in Malaysia 
was relocated during the year to larger 
premises, increasing capacity.
Following an employee consultation 
process, we have consolidated our UK 
Couplings manufacturing facilities into 
the existing facility in Cardiff.
During the first quarter of 2017/18, 
we have relocated our Torque 
Transmission sales and warehousing 
functions in China, in addition to 
closing the manufacturing facilities. 
The manufacturing activities will 
now be undertaken in our Torque 
Transmission facilities in Cardiff, 
Milnrow and South Africa.
We have commenced a major project 
to relocate our Chain manufacturing 
operations in China to a new facility 
being built near Changzhou in 
Jiangsu province. The new facility 
will be a purpose built 21,000m
2
 
factory, enhancing our manufacturing 
capability in China and providing a 
strong platform for organic growth in 
the growing domestic Chinese market.
Our staircases provide the groupings for the strategic activities being 
undertaken within our business units. Despite the challenging market conditions 
experienced in a number of our business units in 2016/17 , these challenges have 
not been allowed to divert our focus from continuing to deliver the strategic 
actions required to improve the underlying performance of the Group. Outlined 
below is a summary of the key areas of progress delivered during 2016/17 and 
the further actions planned for 2017 /18 and beyond.

Staircase Overview Progress in 2016/17
Activities for 2017/18  
and beyond
Our commercial business processes are 
focused on improving customer service 
and enhancing our service offering. 
Like many of our diverse business 
processes, there is much scope for us 
to standardise and simplify.
We are working hard to improve 
our customer service. We know we 
have a long way to go as this is an 
area that has been weak in the past. 
Through improved management of our 
commercial teams and resources and 
by reconnecting with customers in their 
own local markets, we aim to make our 
reputation for service as strong as that 
for our superior products.
We continued to focus on customer 
service improvements throughout the 
year. In 2015/16, we introduced 24, 48 
and 72 hour response times on a range 
of standard and configured chains. 
During 2016/17, this was extended 
across a standard range of gear and 
couplings products. We continue to 
review the breadth of these ranges to 
find the appropriate levels of inventory 
holdings to provide great customer 
service whilst not losing sight of our 
capital efficiency objectives.
Customer service levels have 
improved, particularly on standard 
products. We have further work to do 
in this area, particularly in specialist 
products where we need to ensure 
the levels of customer service match 
up to the sector leading quality of 
our products. With this in mind, we 
are implementing tailored customer 
service initiatives across the Group. 
Put simply, we want to make the best 
use of the spaces we occupy. Where 
we have too much space, we will aim to 
reduce it. Where we overpay for space, 
we will renegotiate lower rents or 
move to better priced premises. Where 
we have surplus assets or facilities, 
we will aim to realise value and avoid 
unnecessary costs.
We will, over time, de-risk the Group’s 
balance sheet exposure to legacy 
defined benefit pension schemes. At 
the same time, we will maximise the 
latent value in the Group’s recognised 
and unrecognised tax assets.
During the year, we have made good 
progress in de-risking exposure to 
surplus property or crystallising cash 
from underutilised assets. This included 
the sub-lease of our closed Bredbury 
site in the UK and the sale of freehold 
properties in Mulgrave, Australia and 
Seclin, France. We continue to trade 
from the property in Mulgrave under 
a three year lease, giving us time 
to manage the orderly transfer to a 
smaller, more suitable facility.  
In the early part of 2017/18, we have 
closed our Torque Transmission 
manufacturing facility in China, 
allowing the move to a smaller office/
warehousing facility more suitable to 
the business' needs. 
In addition, following the consolidation 
of our Halifax Torque Transmission 
facility into Cardiff, we have released a 
property for sale. The sale completed 
in May 2017 generating disposal 
proceeds of £0.5m.
Our diversity of markets is a major 
opportunity for the Group. By bringing 
greater focus to our sales activities, 
we can deliver steady and sustainable 
growth and eliminate much of our 
historical cyclicality.
Our markets typically grow in 
line with GDP. Because we are 
under-represented in a number of 
geographies, markets and industry 
sectors, we are aiming to deliver annual 
growth of GDP plus in the period 
to 2020. At the same time, we will 
leverage superior product capability 
to enhance our operating margins and 
retain value for our shareholders.
Growth is a core element of Phase II of 
our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. Whilst 
end markets proved to be challenging 
during the year, we continue to lay 
the foundations to ensure that we are 
well positioned when end markets 
recover. During the year, this included 
strengthening our commercial teams 
and building sustainable customer 
relationships from the new sales 
locations opened in the prior year. 
Marketing spend increased by over 
50% as we re-established product 
support, particularly for our distributor 
customers.  
Certain end-user markets are showing 
early signs of recovery. Whilst it 
is too early for us to consider this 
as sustainable, it does reinforce 
our ambition to establish a strong 
commercial capability ready to 
maximise opportunity as markets 
demonstrate sustainable recovery.

Operating Performance
Underlying revenue declined only slightly 
in the year as increases in the full-year 
revenue from the acquired Tooth Chain 
business helped to offset a small reduction 
in other underlying Chain revenues and 
a larger reduction in underlying Torque 
Transmission revenues. These revenue 
reductions largely reflect challenging 
market conditions experienced by our 
customers reducing overall demand for 
Renold’s products. The North American and 
South-East Asian markets were particularly 
difficult, across both Chain and Torque 
Transmission divisions. In contrast to this, 
the European Chain operations delivered 
organic growth to supplement the growth 
from the acquired Tooth Chain business.
On a reported basis, adjusted operating 
profit increased to £14.5m (2016: £14.2m). 
However, this benefits from the foreign 
exchange movements in the year. 
Underlying adjusted operating profit 
reduced by £2.3m, of which £2.1m occurred 
in the first half of the year. 
Excluding the impact of the acquisition, 
the underlying revenue decline of £6.7m 
resulted in a £3.3m reduction in underlying 
adjusted operating profit as the revenue 
reduction experienced was not matched by 
a corresponding reduction in non-variable 
overhead costs. This was particularly 
marked in Torque Transmission, but also in 
the North American and South-East Asian 
Chain operations.
Order intake improved through the year, 
with total orders 1.9% ahead of revenue for 
the year as a whole. In the later part of the 
year, there were very early indications of 
improving conditions in certain end-user 
markets. This helped contribute towards the 
improving underlying book to bill ratio for 
the second half of the year of 103% and an 
underlying 9.0% year on year increase in the 
closing order book at 31 March 2017. 
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan   
Update on progress
During the year, we have made progress  
on all three phases of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan.
Phase I – restructuring
Very significant progress has been made 
during the year to relocate and reposition 
manufacturing and distribution facilities 
across the Group.
In the Chain division, the European 
Distribution Centre (EDC) was relocated 
during the year and the Malaysian 
manufacturing facility moved to new larger 
premises in Kuala Lumpur. Relocating the 
EDC from France to Germany, close to 
our main European Chain manufacturing 
site, reduces the costs of handling finished 
products and improves speed of response 
and customer service. It also created the 
opportunity to sell our premises in Seclin, 
France. In Malaysia, the decision to move 
was taken to increase the capacity of the 
site. Market conditions have been weak 
during the year, and this permitted the site 
to relocate with minimum disruption. As 
markets recover, the site now has a greater 
potential for future growth.

RoS% 8.5% 8.6% 7.9% Our mid-teens operating margin target is predicated on GDP+ levels of 
organic growth. Margins and profitability have reduced slightly in the 
financial year. Underlying revenue declines in the non-European Chain 
businesses and the Torque Transmission division have been offset by 
the acquired Tooth Chain business being included for the full year. 
At a margin level, the declining underlying revenue results in reduced 
variable margin. However, the full year impact of acquired margin 
includes the full year overheads and generates income at a net margin. 
The combined effect of these factors is a reduction in RoS% whilst 
revenue is largely unchanged.

Enhancing customer 
service
Customer service improvements remain key to supporting future 
organic growth. Many of the development programmes that are 
underway support this objective, including the implementation 
of consistent business processes (supported by the ERP roll-out), 
investment in new manufacturing equipment and extending the 
product range covered by our 24, 48 and 72 hour response time 
objectives.
Optimising business

£79.7k £74.0k £84.0k The process of standardising core business processes continued in the 
year. Our new ERP system went live at our Halifax and Gronau sites. 
This was a key enabling factor in the consolidation of the UK Couplings 
sites at Cardiff and Halifax and the removal of reliance on vendor 
support at the acquired Gronau site. 
We have continued to standardise our engineering systems, including 
PLM, CAD and CAM packages.

£13.5m £12.3m £12.5m On an underlying basis, our overheads and monthly sales breakeven 
point have increased in the year. However, the impact of the volatility 
in foreign exchange rates in the year had a significant impact. Adjusting 
for these factors to aid true like-for-like comparability, both overheads 
and monthly sales breakeven point were largely unchanged in the year. 
Ongoing efficiency improvements have continued through the year, 
reducing overheads. These reductions have been offset by increased 
revenue investment in the commercial teams and product marketing as 
we put in place the foundations to deliver on the organic growth phase 
of the Strategic Plan.

Developing our 
people
We continue to make strong progress, building the programme which 
supports the development of our people.
A talent review process has been defined and selectively deployed in 
the year. A second year intake of six new graduates were welcomed 
on to the Future Leaders Graduate Programme, and we continue to 
develop our apprenticeship programmes.

Cash cost of

£5.3m £5.3m £6.0m Cash costs of servicing legacy pension schemes increased in 2016/17 
as the year includes one-off contributions of £0.5m to the UK scheme 
which relate to the medically insured buy-ins completed in the prior 
year. A further £0.2m of increase arises from movements in foreign 
exchange rates, affecting the Sterling cost of overseas schemes.
Net debt and leverage reduced significantly in the year as cash 
was crystallised from the disposal of property assets in France and 
Australia.

During the year, we took advantage of 
the opportunity to sell the premises at 
the Mulgrave site in Melbourne, Australia. 
The site is too large for our ongoing 
requirements and the leaseback period 
of three years provides sufficient time to 
find alternative premises and to relocate 
in a controlled manner. Net proceeds of 
the sale were £9.3m and have reduced net 
debt at the end of the year to £17.4m (2016: 
£23.5m).
In Torque Transmission, the UK Couplings 
manufacturing facilities were consolidated 
to a single facility in Cardiff. Following 
a period of investment in the Cardiff 
infrastructure and the commissioning of 
new equipment, all manufacturing was 
moved from the Halifax site during March 
2017. This creates a single, focused UK 
Couplings manufacturing facility where the 
volume of production justifies investment 
in efficient manufacturing equipment that 
would otherwise be underutilised. We 
also commenced the process of closing 
our Chinese Couplings manufacturing 
facility in the year; final closure completed 
in May 2017. The closure removes a small 
underinvested manufacturing facility from 
the Group, but without loss of revenue as 
the products can now be manufactured in 
Cardiff and South Africa. This reduces cost 
and avoids future capital investment.
These changes, which generally completed in 
the latter part of the financial year, build the 
platform for more efficient manufacturing 
and distribution in the future.
Overlaying these infrastructure changes 
is the programme to optimise business 
processes. The most significant element 
is the implementation of the Group's 
ERP system across all sites. This has 
been successfully implemented at our 
Cardiff, Halifax and Gronau sites, and was 
instrumental in permitting the consolidation 
of the UK Couplings operations and the 
removal of reliance on vendor support in 
the acquired Tooth Chain business. The 
process of roll-out continues and FY18 will 
see the roll-out progress to further business 
units, including the first of the major Chain 
manufacturing sites.
Phase II – organic growth
Market conditions have limited the 
amount of organic growth delivered in 
the period. However, we continue to take 
action to establish an effective commercial 
team, introduce product development 
programmes and support our existing 
brands and customers through focused 
marketing. This has included extensive 
training of our teams, distributors and 
agents along with building sustainable 
customer relationships though the new 
Spain, Thailand and Indonesia offices 
opened during 2016. We have seen early 
signs of progress in Europe and are 
replicating these processes and procedures 
across North America, China and South-
East Asia. As markets recover, we expect to 
see the benefit of these actions.
During the year, we also commenced 
a programme to relocate our Chain 
manufacturing facility in China. This is 
a significant factory move which will 
take around 18 months to two years 
to complete as we are constructing a 
purpose built facility. This will be the final 
step in delivering the Strategic Objective 
of operating all major manufacturing 
facilities from owned premises, reducing 
the risk of uncontrolled relocations in the 
future and providing the basis for long-
term investment in core manufacturing 
locations. When complete, this facility will 
increase capacity and permit greater levels 
of manufacturing efficiency. This is critical 
in targeting growth in the developing 
domestic Chinese market, where product 
quality is becoming a more important 
factor in purchasing decisions, along 
with supporting growth in the sale of our 
Chinese-manufactured chain through 
overseas markets using the Group’s 
extensive geographic reach. The overall 
programme cost is expected to be £16.0m 
over eight years, with £6.0m of construction 
costs deferred for five to eight years, and 
will be funded from existing Group facilities.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW

Phase III – acquisitions
The programme to integrate the acquired 
Tooth Chain business into the wider Renold 
Group completed in the year. Following 
the successful roll-out of the Group’s 
ERP system, we were able to remove all 
dependence from the vendor for back 
office and systems support. Tooth Chain 
is now a core part of the Group’s product 
offering and the greater strength in depth 
of Renold’s commercial teams across the 
world provide the potential for further 
future growth in this product category. 
Performance in the period has exceeded 
original expectations, resulting in the 
payment of the first element of the deferred 
consideration in April 2017.
This acquisition was the first step in what 
we believe will be a programme of value 
adding acquisitions in the future, targeting 
opportunities that generate new product 
or new geographical opportunities, or 
opportunities to improve manufacturing 
effectiveness, e.g. through consolidation. 
Delivering our Strategic Objectives
We continue to make good progress 
in improving our health and safety 
performance. Fewer accidents and a greater 
focus on identifying and reducing risk in 
order to avoid accidents is indicative of the 
progress being made and the behavioural 
change that we are seeking across the 
Group’s global operations.
Our objective of delivering growth in 
operating profit margins has been impacted 
by short-term trading conditions in the year. 
However, a number of other KPI measures 
provide evidence that continued progress 
on restructuring will deliver improvement 
in operating profit margins when market 
conditions improve. Average employee 
numbers during the year have reduced 
by 2.2%, improving sales per employee 
to £84.0k (2016: £74.0k; 2016 underlying: 
£82.7k). This reduction derives from the 
restructuring activities delivered, combining 
with a general focus on business efficiency. 
The underlying breakeven revenue 
(adjusted for acquisitions) has remained 
relatively unchanged in the year at £12.5m 
per month. This reflects an underlying 
decrease following the restructuring 
elements of the Strategic Plan, but offset by 
additional overheads for marketing, product 
management and commercial support 
which have been added to support the 
organic growth activities.
Developing our people remains a core part 
of improving the future prospects of the 
Group and we have made progress across 
all levels of the businesses. A number of 
new senior managers have been recruited 
in the year adding to the wider leadership 
team, including a Managing Director for 
the consolidated UK Couplings business, 
a General Manager for the Chain Europe 
manufacturing facility in Einbeck, Germany 
and a Regional MD for our South-East Asian 
businesses with the objective of increasing 
our presence in these growing markets. 
We also continued with our Future Leaders 
programme, welcoming six new graduates. 
Macroeconomic landscape and Brexit
There are a number of well-publicised 
macroeconomic risks on the horizon. We 
continue to deliver our strategy, cognisant 
of the risks, but similarly very aware that 
the impact of these risks is uncertain and 
should not delay our progress.
The vote for Brexit had a significant impact 
on the value of Sterling and the foreign 
exchange movements have impacted 
our reported trading position. However, 
this is largely a presentational issue as 
our results are reported in Sterling. Our 
revenue in the UK is limited, representing 
8% of the Group’s revenue, whilst we retain 
manufacturing facilities that supply product 
to our other global operations. These 
products have become more competitive in 
overseas markets as a result of the currency 
movements.
There are certain product categories which 
we import to the UK, particularly chain 
manufactured in our European facilities. 
Whilst this has become more expensive as a 
result of the foreign exchange movements, 
the majority of competitor products are 
sourced from Europe and the Far-East and 
are exposed to similar inflationary pressure. 
Overall, we do not believe that Brexit 
significantly impacts on our competitive 
positioning. The major risk factor to the 
Group from Brexit, other Eurozone and US 
macroeconomic risks is the impact on the 
timing of recovery of industrial production 
in general. We will continue to monitor this 
and take action as required.
Outlook
We have delivered a robust performance 
in challenging markets. The impact of 
the market headwinds on revenue and 
operating profit would have been far 
greater had it not been for the actions 
delivered to increase operating efficiencies 
as part of our STEP 2020 strategy.
Markets stabilised during the year and 
there was a return to revenue growth in 
the second half of the year along with an 
increase in order intake.
Although there are some early indications 
of improvement, macro-economic 
uncertainty remains and, in turbulent times, 
our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan remains 
relevant and critical to the long term 
delivery of value to all of our stakeholders. 
Actions already delivered as part of the plan 
will combine with on-going programmes 
to further improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of our operations. The 
Group is positioned for organic growth 
and we continue to believe that mid-teens 
operating margins, and sustainable gains 
in adjusted earnings per share, can be 
delivered when volumes improve through 
organic growth and acquisitions.
