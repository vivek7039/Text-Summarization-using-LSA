05 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Overview
I am pleased to report the significant 
progress the Group has made during 
the financial year to 31 March 2017 . 
I arrived at the end of October 2016 with 
the Company having made multiple 
acquisitions in prior years and the start 
of the financial year saw Castleton 
improve the terms of its existing 
exclusive reseller agreement with 365 
Agile Group plc (“ Agile”) granting us 
an exclusive licence for Agile’s suite 
of mobile working software solutions 
in relation to the social housing sector. 
Each of the acquisitions has brought best 
in class software solutions and managed 
services capability, so the foundations for 
a successful and scalable business were 
already in place.
The focus during the year has also 
been on integrating the businesses 
acquired, and since my arrival in October 
2016, I have made further changes to 
the structure and organisation which 
strengthened our platform and which will 
allow the Group to grow and maximise 
the opportunities available in our 
chosen market.  
Our Market and What We Do
The markets in which we operate are 
focused around public sector and 
not-for-profit social housing but also 
include the contractors who provide 
repairs services to the social housing 
providers. Castleton has six offices in the 
UK and a growing operation in Australia, 
demonstrating our ability to grow and 
scale our business in a new geography.
The Group remains aligned along 
two divisions; Software Solutions 
and Managed Services, with each 
focusing on their separate yet 
complementary offerings.  
Our Software Solutions division provides 
all key business processes to social 
landlords covering everything from 
tenant engagement, rent collection, 
financial planning and control, document 
managing and repairs management. 
All key processes are available to be 
utilised on a mobile platform via apps 
or digital engagement. The range of 
solutions provides customers with 
significant improvements in service, 
performance and insight.
Our Managed Services division offers a 
wide range of IT Infrastructure solutions 
which support an organisation’s 
business objectives, including helping 
to drive efficiencies, manage legacy 
architectures or providing customers and 
staff with the latest social, mobile and 
cloud technologies.
Trading Results
Revenue for the year showed an 
increase of 13% to £20.3 million 
(2016: £18 million) with in excess of 60% 
of revenue being recurring in nature 
(2016: 58%). Adjusted EBITDA * showed 
a stronger performance, improving by 
22% to £4.4 million (2016: £3.6 million), 
reflecting the Company’s operational 
gearing and ability to scale profitably. 
The underlying metrics of the business 
were particularly encouraging.  The 
Managed Services division’s trading 
EBITDA ** grew 32% year on year as 
we look to transition to more profitable 
deals.  The Software Solutions division’s 
trading EBITDA ** grew 15%.
Operating cash conversion was 
outstanding at 105% of adjusted EBITDA * 
pre exceptional costs and 86% of 
adjusted EBITDA * post exceptional costs, 
enabling a reduction in net debt*** and, 
pleasingly, earnings per share at a basic 
level were 0.59p, following a loss in the 
previous year of 1.56p per share.
Operational Review
Much of the focus this year has been 
on completing the integration of the 
companies acquired since June 2014, 
which I am pleased to say is largely 
done, and building a platform and 
infrastructure to enable continued 
profitable growth and take full advantage 
of the market opportunity. We have 
made improvements to the quality of the 
business processes, people, structure 
and control. The organic growth of 
the business is building on the back of 
the acquisitive growth. Our contracted 
backlog of revenue has grown by over 
40%, which gives us good forward 
visibility of revenue.   
The increase in revenues was driven 
by the addition of new customers 
and through cross-selling of products 
and services into the Group’s existing 
base. Castleton now supports over 
750 customers and during the year 
the number of those who have two or 
more of our products increased to 35%. 
Not only does this show traction in our 
intention to cross-sell and our customers’ 
confidence in our product suite, but also 
means that 65% of our customer base 
still uses just one product, providing 
a very strong opportunity for further 
organic growth.
*Earnings for the year from continuing operations before net 
finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional costs 
and share based payment charges.
** Trading EBITDA before Group costs (i.e. the cost of the plc 
Board and its advisors)
*** Net cash less borrowings, deferred consideration, contingent 
consideration and convertible loan notes.    06 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017
Chief Executive’s 
Review continued
Castleton is well positioned 
to provide an eco-system 
of integrated modular 
solutions supported by 
scalable infrastructure 
platforms, helping 
organisations to operate 
more effectively and 
achieve their goals,  
whilst bringing visible 
recurring annuity revenues 
to the Group. 
As referred to above, the start of the year, 
in April 2016, saw Castleton improve the 
terms of its existing exclusive reseller 
agreement with Agile by entering into a 
new perpetual licence agreement with 
the company whereby we were granted 
an exclusive licence for their suite of 
mobile working software solutions in 
relation to the social housing sector. 
New contracts signed during the year 
include a landmark agreement with 
Wentworth Community Housing in 
Australia, signed in November 2016, for 
the provision of Kypera’s housing system 
and three other products including 
Agile’s mobile working solutions. 
This followed on from the installation of a 
local management team and is evidence 
of the opportunity available in the 
Australian market and the relevance of 
Castleton’s product suite in that country.
In January this year, two new contracts 
were announced, namely a ten-
year agreement with Clúid Housing 
Association (“Clúid”) in Ireland and a 
five-year contract with Arcon Housing 
Association (“ Arcon”) in Manchester. 
Both agreements were for multiple 
products and / or services, with Clúid 
being the first customer to take the 
complete suite of software products, 
validating the Group’s intention of 
becoming a “one stop shop” serving the 
social housing sector and showing the 
Group’s ability to cross-sell and upsell 
the product suite. Our success in winning 
these new contracts demonstrates the 
unique proposition that Castleton can 
bring to the market and we continue 
to seek to expand on this success by 
increasing the number of customers who 
take multiple products, which is a major 
focus going forwards.  Strategic Report

At the end of the year, the Company had 
further success in signing two multi-
year agreements, extending both the 
contract base and the level of recurring 
revenue. The first is a seven year 
contract with North Hertfordshire Homes 
and the second a three year contract 
with a community regeneration and 
housebuilding company.
Post year end, a new operational 
structure has been put in place with 
clearly aligned objectives and sales 
teams have been tasked with defined 
territories and targets. The initial 
feedback has been positive, both 
internally and from customers.
Outlook
Castleton is well positioned to provide 
an eco-system of integrated modular 
solutions supported by scalable 
infrastructure platforms, helping 
organisations to operate more effectively 
and achieve their goals, whilst bringing 
visible recurring annuity revenues to 
the Group.  The Group brings together 
trusted brands with a pedigree of 
delivering solutions that meet customer 
needs whilst offering a refreshing 
change of culture and approach, 
focusing on customer collaboration using 
modern technology. We see the public 
and not-for-profit sectors as attractive 
markets due to their niche requirements 
and we believe a significant opportunity 
exists to capitalise on the ability to 
address historic under-investment in IT 
infrastructure in those sectors.
I am confident  that the business is 
now in a position to maximise the 
opportunities that we see in our chosen 
markets by offering our customers an 
integrated suite of products, either on an 
installed or cloud delivery basis, in turn 
allowing them to increase efficiencies 
and lower their costs of operating. 
Post year-end we have had a number of 
successes selling our software products 
on a cloud basis. Combined with the 
general long term nature of the contracts 
entered into, selling our products on 
a hosted basis gives greater recurring 
revenue and greater visibility of earnings 
and cash flow as we move forward.  
The new financial year has started 
well and in line with expectations. 
The Company has good visibility of 
revenues, a strong and improving 
product suite combined with a defined 
roadmap for further development, 
and an improved structure to 
enable us to execute our strategy. 
The existing customer base provides a 
significant opportunity for cross-selling 
opportunities, adding further organic 
growth along with new customers. 
The Board continues to view the future 
with confidence.
