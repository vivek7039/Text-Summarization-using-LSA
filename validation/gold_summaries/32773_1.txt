Strategic Report
Throughout the year we have continued 
with our asset management programme and 
have now assembled a core portfolio of high 
quality regional offices in prime locations 
which are primarily well let to high quality 
tenants on medium or long-term leases. As a 
result, and because of the resilient demand 
for the type of space we offer, we believe our 
portfolio will prove less susceptible to any 
downward valuation shifts arising from any 
prolonged political and economic uncertainty.
Following the refinancing of our debt facility 
with RBS, we are currently also reviewing our 
hedging strategy, including the possibility of 
entering into longer-term fixed rate funding. Our 
interest cover is sufficient to cover any potential 
or anticipated increased interest charges, but 
we are aware that inflationary pressures are 
growing as a result of the weaker pound. 
It is therefore likely that income will continue 
to feature as a prerequisite to attract 
investors but, through continued strong stock 
selection, appropriate portfolio recycling 
and strong asset management, we aim to 
provide a better total return over time, than 
a purely income driven stock, as evidenced by 
the 19.9% growth in EPRA NAV in the year 
under review compared to a 3.9% total return 
for the MSCI All Property index in 2016. 
Most encouragingly, almost all of the increase 
in NAV within the portfolio is attributable 
to our asset management. By successfully 
undertaking lease renegotiations, new lettings 
and lease renewals we have maximised income 
and have generated earnings per share of 35p.
In Birmingham, we only recently in July launched 
36 Great Charles Street into the letting market 
and it has been very well received, The façade 
has just been cleaned while the reception area 
has been enlarged, decorated and furnished 
to form a distinctive area for the tenants 
to meet and greet visitors as well as hold 
informal meetings, directly off street level.
Chief Executive’s Statement
Resilience Through 
the Cycle
Also in Birmingham, Somerset House, Temple 
Street will be available in the autumn. The 
specification we are implementing enhances 
and complements the building’s many art deco 
features including the restored parquet flooring 
that will help to differentiate our offering from 
many others in the vicinity. Prime rents in the 
city have now reached £35 psf, so our two 
buildings at £18 and £20 psf respectively 
should prove highly attractive to those tenants 
seeking well located high quality office space.
Although the letting market for requirements 
over 10,000 sq ft has been noticeably slower 
in the first half of the 2017 calendar year, 
we are in negotiations to let a substantial 
part of our 40,000 sq ft office building, K2 
at Kents Hill Park, Milton Keynes to a major 
occupier and have multiple interest in the 
remainder, following our decision to further 
subdivide the building into smaller suites. From 
the outset we built maximum flexibility into 
the layout of the property and by a simple 
repositioning of services, subdivision is possible 
with minimum loss of net internal area and 
at a modest additional construction cost.
All of our buildings that are either in the 
course of refurbishment or completed and 
available to let are capable of being occupied 
by tenants seeking less than 5,000 sq ft, which 
is the most active sector of the market.
Our optimism in the economy in the lead-
up to leaving the EU is being tested by the 
hung parliament and increasing political 
uncertainty following the general election. 
We are mindful that the heightened sense of 
nervousness may have an adverse effect upon 
some areas of the property market. However, 
with a strong cash flow and cash at bank 
we believe that our business is well placed 
to capitalise upon a regional office market 
that has, to-date, remained fairly robust due 
to sustained demand for offices in the sub 
5,000 sq ft range and the continuing loss of 
much of the lower quality office stock due to 
obsolescence and residential conversion.
In the short term, Circle Property Plc will 
concentrate on letting the space within the 
development portfolio which once fully let, 
on the basis of current rental levels, has the 
capability to treble the net operating profits, 
enhancing the future earnings per share and 
supporting our progressive dividend policy. We 
hope this will help drive demand for our shares, 
facilitating an expansion of our investor base 
and so creates greater liquidity in our stock.
