STRATEGIC REPORT
8 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Dear shareholders
I have been fortunate to visit Argentina 
regularly since 2001, and I have been 
involved with British-Argentine commerce 
and business for the past several years. 
Argentina is an extraordinary country with 
a proud commercial heritage that is 
blessed with a wealth of natural resources 
and a skilled and well-educated workforce. 
Following more than a decade of 
domestic policy that stifled investment, 
the current Macri administration came 
into power in 2015. The new administration 
is progressing a business friendly growth 
agenda that has reconnected Argentina 
to the international community. 
Since being elected, the administration 
has delivered significant advances 
with regard to foreign policy, economic 
normalisation and social reform. Argentina 
is on a fast-track process to join the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) and has been 
designated as the G20 chair for 2018. 
The Argentine Peso has been fully 
deregulated with exchange controls 
removed and has been freely floating 
since December 2015. Revised monetary 
policy has been introduced by the central 
bank aimed at bringing inflation under 
control and protecting the value of the 
Peso over the medium to long term. The 
government has introduced important 
labour, tax and capital markets reforms 
which are helping to attract investment, 
both domestically and from abroad, and 
reactivate the economy. The fiscal deficit 
is being tackled and unemployment is 
gradually reducing. In 2017, the Argentine 
Merval Index was the best-performing 
stock market index globally.
The recent currency volatility and 
devaluation driven by domestic 
inflation concerns highlights the 
challenges Argentina faces. However, 
the administration’s reaction to this 
recent volatility and the IMF’s positive 
response is encouraging.
The new policy agenda is attracting 
substantial amounts of foreign capital 
investment. The oil industry is at the 
forefront of this trend, with its ability 
to rapidly improve the country’s balance 
of trade. International oil companies 
investing in Argentina, and specifically 
in the Vaca Muerta shale, include 
ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Total, Equinor 
(previously Statoil), Chevron, Sinopec, 
Petronas and Schlumberger. 
These factors provided the backdrop 
for the transformative corporate 
combination of Andes Energia and 
Trefoil Holdings B.V. that was successfully 
completed in August 2017. Phoenix Global 
Resources is our new identity and marks 
a new beginning, with new management 
and a new strategy. Our business has 
effectively quadrupled in terms of scale. 
We have greatly enhanced our operating 
capability, strengthened our financial 
position and our access to capital. We 
have created a very different and investible 
platform of substantial conventional 
resources and reserves underpinning 
a much larger unconventional opportunity 
in the Vaca Muerta shale. The Vaca 
Muerta is the only commercially producing 
shale formation outside of North America 
and it is currently producing at a rate of 
more than 90,000 boepd. 
Importantly, during 2017, we have 
upgraded and revamped our corporate 
governance, both at board level and 
within the operating business. We 
welcomed many new faces to the board 
and now have a strong, experienced 
board. During the year, I was appointed 
chairman, Anuj Sharma was appointed 
CEO and Philip Wolfe was appointed 
CFO. We welcomed John Bentley and 
Garrett Soden as independent non-
executive directors, and also Guillaume 
Vermersch as non-executive director. 
Importantly, following the appointment 
of John and Garrett to the board, the 
number of independent non-executive 
directors has increased to four. 
The second half of the year was one of 
transformation and consolidation with 
focus on driving forward the operational 
and corporate integration of the two 
businesses before year-end. Having 
recently announced our accelerated 
business plan and recapitalised our 
business with the support of the Mercuria 
Group, Phoenix is now reset to capitalise 
on the significant unconventional oil and 
gas growth opportunities in Argentina, 
including in the world class Vaca Muerta 
shale formation.
I am very pleased to be the new chairman 
of Phoenix and am excited as we look 
forward to growing our business and 
realising its significant potential over the 
next 12 months and beyond.
