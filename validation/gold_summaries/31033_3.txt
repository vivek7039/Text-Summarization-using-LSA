Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
2017 Overview
After a very challenging few years, I believe 
that Rolls-Royce is building real and 
sustainable momentum. Progress will not  
be smooth, given the nature of the industry 
and the number of new products we are in 
the process of introducing into the market, 
and I do not want to underestimate the  
risks. But, the medium-term prospects  
look increasingly bright and the long-term 
opportunities for us remain significant.  
Our near to medium-term priorities are:  
to improve operational performance, with 
the focus on product reliability for our 
customers and on cost competitiveness;  
and cash flow generation for our long-term 
prosperity. Growth opportunities for us in 
our core industries are excellent. We have  
to build customer satisfaction and cash flow 
and, as a consequence, strengthen investor 
confidence, to enable us to capitalise on 
these. That is what we are determined to do. 
Warren East, our Chief Executive, gives  
in his report a full explanation of major 
milestones and achievements in 2017. I would 
like to highlight a few key developments. 
There has been great progress in building 
the executive leadership team. We have 
refreshed our strategy and long-term vision. 
We have refined our capital allocation 
process. We have delivered financial  
results ahead of budget and expectations 
and we have ramped up production in our 
Civil Aerospace business. We have initiated  
a simplification of the Group into three 
businesses and are embarking upon a 
fundamental restructuring. This will make  
for a simplified and more focused business. 
At the same time, we have had to deal with 
some significant operational challenges, 
most notably with some in-service fleet 
issues on two of our Civil Aerospace large 
engine programmes. We are acutely aware 
of the challenge this has created for some  
of our customers. Our absolute priority  
is to overcome these. Customer trust and 
confidence – the bedrock of any business 
– is, and must be, our number one goal. 
We are continually looking to inject pace 
and simplicity into our business operations, 
even as we expand production to meet the 
growth in demand for our products. We are 
well advanced in the complex process of 
overhauling our management information 
systems. Our intent is to provide the data  
we need, not only to manage the business 
effectively, but to provide greater clarity  
on outcomes and progress – progress in  
real economic, not just accounting, terms. 
We are a long-term business with long 
investment cycles. We have continued

Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
STRATEGIC REPORT
our commitment to, and investment in, next 
generation technologies and facilities that 
will be crucial to competitiveness and value 
creation. We have met our key technology 
milestones. I would draw attention to the fact 
that we have sustained investment in capital 
expenditure and R&D notwithstanding 
short-term financial pressures. 
We are putting increased emphasis on 
strategic partnerships and collaborations. 
These collaborations range across 
electronics, composite materials, gearbox 
technology, digital technologies and 
services. We are determined to be at the 
forefront of the ‘next technology revolution’ 
built around artificial intelligence, data 
analytics, machine learning and digital.  
This will be crucial to our future 
competitiveness as well as to our ability  
to attract and retain exceptional talent. 
I would also like to draw attention to the 
progress we have made on the management 
of environmental impacts and the increased 
emphasis we are giving to safety. These are 
foundational goals and responsibilities that  
I, and the Board, monitor carefully. 
Governance and culture
In January 2017, the Group entered into  
deferred prosecution agreements with  
the UK Serious Fraud Office and other 
authorities. This has been a sobering 
experience for all concerned. The Board 
and executive team remain totally 
committed to always acting with integrity 
and to ensuring that the appropriate values 
and behaviours are embedded throughout 
the Group. This is an ongoing and relentless 
task and it is an absolute priority for the 
Board and management.
Culture, as always, is key. There is much  
to cherish and to protect in the Rolls-Royce 
culture. But we also have to develop and 
adapt. We need to be more transparent  
and open, and to engage more externally. 
Performance management, cost 
competitiveness and operational delivery 
against commitments are as fundamental  
to our longer-term aspirations and goals  
as are product innovation and technology. 
As a Board, we are determined to role  
model these cultural ambitions. We have,  
for example, introduced a Meet the Board 
initiative where employees have the 
opportunity to meet with and question the 
Board at an ‘employee AGM’ style event.  
In addition – as part of our focus on a  
more open, inclusive culture – I asked  
Irene Dorner, one of our Non-Executive 
Directors, to take on an employee champion 
role on the Board. 
An additional cultural priority is to build  
a more diverse organisation. This is a 
daunting challenge for us, and indeed  
for the whole sector. Progress to date has 
been disappointing. We have to do more 
and this remains high on my agenda and  
on my list of frustrations. Rolls-Royce has  
an extraordinary brand and we are 
exceptionally well-placed to defy the 
traditional engineering industry norms. I am 
hugely encouraged by the great work that 
so many colleagues from Rolls-Royce across 
the world do to inspire the next generation 
in science, technology, engineering and 
maths (STEM) careers. I continue to be 
inspired by the work done by our support 
networks and employee resource groups  
to stimulate and reinforce diversity. I am also 
very pleased that the proportion of women 
we recruit as apprentices and graduates 
increased again in 2017. But there still 
remains much to be done to improve 
diversity and inclusion and to accelerate,  
in particular, the advancement of talented 
women and high potential younger 
executives into senior management roles. 
This is a huge talent opportunity for us.
As part of this focus on diversity in 2017,  
I introduced a new Board apprentice 
programme designed to give prospective 
leaders within the business insights and 
experience into the working of the Board. 
Investor trust and confidence
I am acutely aware that in recent years our 
credibility with investors has been damaged. 
We are determined to restore it and we  
know that it is results, not words, that will  
be the catalyst. This is a long-term business 
that needs shareholders with a long-term 
perspective. That perspective must be  
based on a long-term confidence in the 
growth prospects of the industry, in the  
value creation potential of the Company  
and in the strength of the management team. 
Risk assessment is an important part of  
the Board’s work. This has been important 
input into our viability statement, which we 
see as a lot more than a short-term liquidity 
assessment. There are significant risks –  
most notably product reliability failure,  
a disorderly Brexit or an external global 
shock that would disrupt travel. We have 
contingency plans to address these risks.  
We understand the importance of dividends 
to many of our shareholders, and also the 
importance of rebuilding a strong balance 
sheet and credit rating. I do not believe that, 
in the long term, these are incompatible  
with our growth aspirations. We will  
talk more during 2018 about our capital 
allocation plans and priorities. For the short 
term, our focus is on generating cash to 
meet the investment needs of the business 
and to strengthen our balance sheet and  
credit rating. 
Delivering on our financial commitments  
is fundamental to investor confidence and 
trust. In addition, we are striving to reinforce 
this with more open engagement with 
investors. In addition to our regular 
interactions with investors, we have held  
a series of governance events, including  
a seminar in the spring of 2017. We plan  
to continue this level of engagement. 
Improved transparency of financial results 
plays an important role in investor 
confidence. We are working hard to make 
our accounts and, more importantly, our 
business economics, more intelligible and 
accessible. The implications of IFRS 15 and 
IFRS 16 may complicate matters in the short 
term and we will work to clarify the impact  
of these new accounting regulations. The 
accounting regulation changes will, I believe, 
be beneficial. It is in everyone’s interest to 
better align the recognition of profit and 
cash. Profitability, and return on capital in 
particular, are crucial strategic measures but 
for the short term, cash flow is our dominant 
financial metric. 
Conclusion
I hope the preceding words have been 
helpful in clarifying where we stand.  
We are, I believe, building real momentum. 
Our short-term focus over the next two to 
three years is on meeting customer 
commitments and requirements whilst 
generating substantial increases in cash flow. 
Longer term, our goal is to build and grow 
our business so that, in time, we are a 
world-leading industrial technology 
company focused on pioneering the power 
that matters. This is not an industry sector 
short of growth options. Our long-term  
aim is to capitalise on them, effectively  
and responsibly. 
I would like to conclude this statement  
with a big thanks to all my colleagues in 
Rolls-Royce. It has been another demanding 
year, but one marked by real progress.  
The drive, dedication and ingenuity of  
our people (and, indeed, of our former 
employees) across the globe is extraordinary 
and, I believe, the Company’s single biggest 
asset. I continue to be inspired by the 
dedication and sheer decency of our  
people and their passion for Rolls-Royce.
