Strategic report In 2017 , the business continued the 
positive performance of recent years. 
Building on the strength of our brand 
and our reputation with customers 
and Universities, we entered our first 
on-campus University partnership with 
Aston University and secured two further 
development-led University partnerships 
with Oxford Brookes University and in 
London with planning support from 
King’s College, London. 
Financial performance has again 
been strong, with a total accounting 
return of 14% and growth in EPRA earnings, 
up 12% to £70.5 million. Profit before tax 
was £229.4 million, which includes property 
revaluations and disposal profits of £169.2 
million (2016: £201.4 million and £136.3 
million respectively). As a result of this 
performance, we are declaring a final 
dividend of 15.4p to deliver a total dividend 
of 22.7p for the full year, an increase of 26% 
year on year.
Unite Students is a service brand and the 
strong performance we have delivered 
for our customers, University partners and 
shareholders is only possible because of 
the talent and hard work of our teams 
across the business. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank them for 
another excellent year.
I would also like to take this opportunity to 
pay tribute to one of our Directors, Manjit 
Wolstenholme, who sadly passed away 
last November. Manjit was a friend and 
colleague and her judgement, insight 
and humanity will be greatly missed.
The recent success of the business is 
founded on a consistent strategy and we 
will continue to focus on delivering its main 
elements: providing a great service for our 
students and University partners; delivering 
quality buildings designed around student 
needs; and generating high-quality 
earnings and maintaining a strong 
capital structure.
The outlook for our market remains 
positive, with ongoing structural growth 
being generated by the strength of the 
world-renowned UK Higher Education 
sector, increasing participation rates, the 
internationalisation of Higher Education 
and the shortage of housing in the UK. 
Whilst the ongoing Brexit negotiations 
and political landscape in the UK present 
a backdrop of some uncertainty, these 
sector fundamentals, together with 
our high-quality portfolio, University 
relationships and market-leading 
operating platform, position us to 
continue performing well in the 
years to come.
Given our confidence in the sector and 
the sustainability of our business model, 
the Board has agreed to increase our 
dividend pay-out ratio to 85 per cent 
of EPRA earnings in 2018 onwards.
