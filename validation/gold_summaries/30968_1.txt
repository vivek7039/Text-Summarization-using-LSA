 Chief Executive Officer’s Report
In 2017, 4D has made significant 
progress towards its goal of 
delivering Live Biotherapeutics 
as safe and effective therapies
4D’s approach
If we step back and look at what 4D is 
trying to do (namely to bring to market 
not only new drugs but a new therapeutic 
modality), it is not an easy task. The FDA 
approved only 22 new drugs in 2016 and 
only eight of those were first in class. 
Nevertheless, we believe 4D is well 
positioned to achieve its goals.
With any new drug, whether or not first in 
class, or new modality there is risk. Any 
new drug or modality brings concern over 
safety, and it is rightly the top priority for the 
industry and regulators. More than 50% of 
traditional drug programme failures can be 
attributed to safety. 
Notwithstanding this, given the pull for new 
or better medicines, industry and investors 
are prepared to accept such risks and, as we 
have recently seen with the interest in CAR-T 
therapies, successfully bringing a new 
therapeutic class to market can deliver 
significant value to investors.
It is widely believed that Live Biotherapeutics 
and the microbiome will go some way to 
address such risks, by bringing a different 
approach to treatment regimes and to 
disease, and doing so safely. This puts a 
high expectation on Live Biotherapeutics 
and the field of microbiome research, 
and to date the field has fallen short 
of this expectation.
Building upon our work and investment 
in research, clinical progression and 
manufacturing capability, we believe 4D is 
well positioned to change this. During 2017 
we have laid the groundwork to take our 
products into patients across a host of 
disease areas with the aim to provide 
robust clinical data to demonstrate the 
potential of Live Biotherapeutics.
Current clinical programmes
We have worked with regulators and clinicians, 
both in Europe and the United States, to 
develop Blautix, our clinical programme in 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (“IBS”). Building 
on the patient data from the phase I trials, 
which both reinforced the safety of our 
Live Biotherapeutics and highlighted promising 
efficacy signals, we believe Blautix to address 
a key underlying cause of the disease and 
not just the symptoms, as is the case with 
current available treatments.
Consequently, we are looking to address 
the IBS subtypes (IBS-C (constipation) and 
IBS-D (diarrhoea)) in our upcoming phase II 
trial. Targeting commencement of dosing in 
the second half of 2018, the trial will be 
conducted in both Europe and the United 
States. The trial will look to dose up to 500 
patients, to give sufficient power to indicate 
efficacy, as well as providing further insights 
into a disease which is estimated to affect 
over 10% of the global population, but, 
irrespective of its prevalence, is not yet 
well understood.
We have completed dosing in the phase I 
study of Thetanix, our clinical programme 
in Paediatric Crohn’s Disease, and we will 
report the outcome of this study in the 
coming months. Moving to the next stage 
of the development of Thetanix, we have 
decided to initially focus our efforts on the 
adult population. The rationale for this is 
that, whilst the need for a safe and 
effective paediatric solution remains high, 
it is a reflection of the severe nature of the 
disease that our recruitment for the phase 
Ib trial was slow, with a number of eligible 
patients screened experiencing flare before 
they could enter the trial. 
We will explore opportunities to remain 
active with this group of patients and 
continue to involve those patients and 
clinicians we have been working with.
The Thetanix phase II study will recruit adult 
Crohn’s Disease patients and we anticipate 
making regulatory submissions for this 
study in the second half of 2018.
Oncology and other pending 
clinical programmes
An area of increasing interest in the 
microbiome field, and one 4D has long 
focussed on, is oncology.
In late 2015 our proprietary MicroRx 
discovery platform identified a bacterium, 
MRx0518, that had shown efficacy in 
pre-clinical cancer models. Through 2017, 
we have concentrated on two areas of 
MRx0518 development, firstly unpicking 
the mode of action and secondly preparing 
for clinical studies.
We believe understanding mechanism 
is critical to the development of Live 
Biotherapeutics as a therapeutic class; 
we do not believe the field can continue to 
take an “ecobiotic” approach to therapeutics, 
simply relying on a correlation of the presence/
absence of bacteria. We aim to understand 
how the bacteria influence disease by using 
MicroRx to pick out strains that have a 
functional effect on pathways that are known 
(by clinicians, regulators and industry alike) 
to be associated with disease. As recently 
announced, 4D has highlighted key aspects 
of the mode of action of MRx0518, identifying 
a specific component of the bacteria that 
stimulates pathways known to be associated 
with the body’s response to cancer; these 
findings are to be investigated further in 
upcoming clinical trials.

S Chief Executive Officer’s Report continued
on both microbiome and metabolite profiles, 
and the commonalities of the microbiome 
across all IBS subtypes. This observational 
study was completed in August and we 
are now well advanced in preparation for a 
larger, multi-centre trial, to further validate 
this work, at sites in the UK, Ireland and 
the US.
In tandem with research, we have focussed 
on developing our intellectual property estate, 
the largest in the microbiome sector, to 
help secure and consolidate our leading 
position in the field, having at year end 
207 granted patents and 320 patent 
applications, from 32 patent families. 
To enable this focus, we have had to 
postpone our desire to publish our work, 
but now, having gained a market-leading 
intellectual property position, over the 
coming year we will be actively seeking to 
publish our research in leading publications 
and at conferences.
Financial summary
In the year to December 2017, our cash 
and cash equivalents and short-term 
deposits reduced from £68.8 million to 
£50.0 million, with a loss before tax of 
£24.0 million (compared with £11.7 million 
in the year to December 2016), though this 
included £3.5 million of non-recurring costs 
arising from the revaluation of the contingent 
consideration on Cork after it achieved the 
first milestone. Our claim for research and 
development tax credit was £3.5 million 
(compared with £1.8 million in the year 
to December 2016).
Our cash burn for the year was in line with 
expectation, reflecting among other things 
the increased costs of taking our existing 
clinical programmes forward, and preparing 
our next wave of programmes for upcoming 
phase I and II trials.
In a similar way to the development of our 
cancer programmes, we are continuing 
to advance our programme in asthma. 
Targeting regulatory submission for the 
study in Q3 2018, 4D will investigate the 
use of MRx0004 in a phase I/II study in 
asthma patients with poorly controlled 
symptoms. The trial will primarily investigate 
the safety of MRx0004 and will additionally 
have a suite of secondary endpoints to give 
an indication of efficacy.
Development
Key to the success of our programmes is 
the ability to deliver therapies to patients. 
During 2017 4D further upgraded its 
development and manufacturing facility in 
León in Spain, and it is now a standalone 
fully operational GMP-certified facility for 
the production of Live Biotherapeutics.
The team at León has now provided 
multiple batches of clinical material across 
a number of programmes and, with 4D’s 
development team, is working on the 
development and scale-up of the next 
strains coming through the R&D platform.
Research and intellectual property 
Coming full circle back to research, and 
from where 4D started, our scientific teams 
continue to lead in the understanding of 
mechanisms of action of our existing 
programmes, to discover new potential 
disease areas of interest, and to support 
our clinical efforts.
2017 was particularly significant in the 
development of our understanding of how 
the microbiome and metabolite profiles of 
patients can be used in both the diagnosis 
of disease and the identification of patients 
likely to respond to our Live Biotherapeutics. 
In March 2017, we reported interim clinical 
data demonstrating our ability to differentiate 
IBS patients from healthy individuals based 
Oncology and other pending 
clinical programmes continued
Our approach to the clinical development 
of MRx0518 encompasses parallel studies 
to evaluate safety, efficacy and anti-tumour 
immunity in the monotherapy and 
combination settings.
Our first trial in oncology is a monotherapy 
study investigating the effect of MRx0518 
on patients with solid tumours in the 
neoadjuvant setting. We are treating patients 
between diagnosis, where a biopsy is taken, 
and resection, with a follow-up post-surgery.
In addition to the safety data this trial will 
generate for MRx0518, the study will provide 
4D the opportunity to investigate the impact 
on MRx0518 on a “clean” immune system. 
Patients enrolled in the study will have early 
stage disease and thus their immune system 
will not have been previously exposed to 
cycles of other cancer therapies. The early 
stage of intervention in this trial further 
demonstrates the lower risk our Live 
Biotherapeutics represent in terms of safety, 
but also provides potential insights into how 
MRx0518 may influence treatment regimes 
post-surgery.
Working with leading institutions as 
partners, such as Imperial College as well 
as the MD Anderson Cancer Center in 
Houston, one of the world’s most respected 
institutions focussed on cancer patient care 
and research, our work in oncology has led to 
the development of strategies to understand 
the potential of Live Biotherapeutics, whether 
as a single agent, adjuvant or in combination.
Furthermore, our involvement with these 
groups and in this space has led us to look 
at the potential of addressing other diseases 
associated with the side effects of cancer 
treatment with our Live Biotherapeutics, 
further demonstrating the impact we 
believe Live Biotherapeutics can have 
in the oncology space.

STRATEGIC REPORT Outlook 
Throughout 2017, 4D made significant 
progress towards its goal of producing 
Live Biotherapeutics as safe and effective 
therapies. Over the next twelve to 24 months, 
the Group will, through its clinical programmes, 
seek to lead the way in generating robust 
clinical data to support the use of this new 
class of drugs across multiple indications.
