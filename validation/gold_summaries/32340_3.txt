 Chairman’s statement 
National Grid is responding positively to wide-reaching 
developments in our operating environment and taking 
steps to build a stronger foundation for the future. 
Over the past year, we have seen significant 
developments both in our external environment 
and within the Company. 
In the summer of 2016, the UK voted to leave 
the European Union (EU), leading to a change 
in government leadership. More recently, a 
General Election was announced for 8 June 
2017 . We have also seen a new administration 
in the US following the Presidential election. 
We await developments in its policy positions.
Amid these developments, public trust in  
big business and political institutions remains 
low. The cost of energy and the impact of 
investment in new technology on bills remains  
a matter of concern for politicians, regulators 
and consumers. The energy industry needs  
to work hard to demonstrate affordability and 
build trust with consumers and communities 
who feel disconnected from the opportunities 
that technological and market changes 
can bring.
In early 2017 , the UK Government presented 
proposals for a UK industrial strategy, including 
recommendations for developing energy 
infrastructure, skills and investment in 
technology and innovation.
The commitment of governments across the 
world to support the agreement on climate 
change made at the Paris Conference of the 
Parties sent a strong signal that we have to 
tackle the threat of rising temperatures. You 
can read more about these changes and our 
responses on page 9. 
In light of these changing external 
circumstances, together with the ongoing 
evolution of the energy industry and growth in 
distributed generation, Chief Executive John 
Pettigrew, together with the Executive team,

has led a review of our business. This has 
resulted in a clear articulation of our purpose 
and the evolution of our vision, values and the 
strategic priorities that guide our business.  
You can read more about these on page 8.
I am pleased that John has delivered a very 
strong performance in his first year as Chief 
Executive. Together with his team, he has made 
significant progress on our commitments and 
towards evolving the direction for National Grid. 
Nicola Shaw joined the Board on 1 July 2016  
as Executive Director, UK, and I am pleased  
that she has also made a very good start.
Gas Distribution
This year we concluded the sale of a majority 
interest in our UK Gas Distribution business to a 
consortium of investors. This has created value 
for our shareholders through a significant gain 
on the disposal.
We announced a one-off return of £4 billion 
of net proceeds to shareholders through a 
combination of a special dividend and share 
buy-backs. I am also pleased that we voluntarily 
set aside £150 million of the sale proceeds  
that will be used to benefit consumers. 
On 19 April 2017 , following Board approval, 
we announced the special dividend of 84.375 
pence per share ($5.4224 per American 
Depositary Shares) which will be paid to 
ordinary shareholders on 2 June 2017 . To 
ensure, as far as possible, that the share 
price is not affected by the special dividend, 
shareholder approval is sought for a share 
consolidation on an 11 for 12 basis, which 
means that for every 12 shares you had, you 
will have 11 if approved. This and other related 
resolutions will also be considered at a General 
Meeting on 19 May 2017 . Notice of this meeting 
was sent to all shareholders.
 “We have a  
role to play  
in helping 
communities 
have fair and 
equal access to 
opportunities  
to be successful.”
4 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 Strategic Report Chairman’s statement
Results
As a consequence of the sale of a 61% interest 
in the UK Gas Distribution business, this year’s 
accounts are more complex than in previous 
years. In particular, we report our earnings  
for the Group excluding UK Gas Distribution 
(the ‘continuing Group’) separately from the 
results of that business, which we report  
within ‘discontinued operations’. You can find  
out more about the main aspects of this  
on pages 112–115. 
Standing back from the detail of these 
accounts, I would like to highlight two aspects. 
Firstly, the strength of the balance sheet and 
our key credit metric of retained cash flow 
divided by adjusted net debt. Secondly, the 
cash flows in the business, which have enabled 
us to grow the full-year dividend in line with  
our policy, and continue to grow the capital 
investment in the business to help meet our 
growth aims.
Dividend policy
Our dividend policy aims to grow the ordinary 
dividend per share at least in line with the 
rate of UK RPI growth each year for the 
forseeable future. Accordingly, the Board has 
recommended an increase in the final dividend 
to 29.10 pence per ordinary share ($1.8924 per 
American Depositary Share)*. If approved, this 
will bring the full-year dividend to 44.27 pence 
per share ($2.8351 per American Depositary 
Share), an increase of 2.1% over the 43.34 
pence per ordinary share in respect of the 
financial year ended 31 March 2016.
Responsible business
It is a fundamental fact of our business that  
the work we do carries risks for our employees, 
customers and the general public. Operating  
a safe working environment is the primary 
responsibility of the Board and our Executive 
leadership team. It is a responsibility we  
take very seriously, and when we fall short  
of expected levels of safety, we make sure 
lessons are learnt and shared, as well as 
making sure we take any necessary remedial 
actions as soon as is practicable. 
We also have a responsibility to contribute 
towards the economic, social and 
environmental well-being of the communities 
where we operate. In early 2016, the UN 
presented their 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals. At National Grid we are focusing on five 
of these goals where we can help to make a 
difference. These include affordable and clean 
energy, as well as climate action. 
For example, we have made significant 
progress in our search for low-carbon 
alternatives to SF
6
, an electrical insulator that 
has a global warming impact 23,900 times  
that of CO
2
. We are trialling an alternative 
(Green Gas for Grid, or g
3
) that delivers the 
same technical benefits at less than 2% of  
the global warming impact of SF
6
. I am pleased 
to say g
3
 has now been certified for use on part 
of our network and the equipment insulated 
with this gas is now energised.
National Grid recognises the wider role we  
can play in helping communities have fair  
and equal access to opportunities to be 
successful. We work with community groups, 
charities and educational institutions to help 
address some of the challenges felt by the 
most disadvantaged in our society who can 
struggle to access decent and sustainable 
education and employment. 
For example, working with Teach First in  
the UK, our employees coach new teachers  
as they start their careers in some of the  
most challenging schools in the country.  
We share Teach First’s aim to end educational 
inequality, which is one of the main barriers  
to social mobility. 
In the US, we are supporting United Way of 
Rhode Island’s Housing for All Fund. The fund 
helps people who are making tough choices 
around which basic needs they can afford. 
Through this support, we are playing our part  
in building a stronger community by helping 
people access more affordable housing. It 
helps to retain and attract people to the area, 
supporting the wider economic recovery of  
the region.
How we manage our operational sites can have 
a major impact on the environmental well-being 
of communities. For example, I was pleased  
to see a project in the UK where our newest 
graduate recruits worked with site managers 
and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust to enhance the 
environment at our site in Kirkstall, Leeds. 
The land around our site has been subject to 
anti-social behaviour and fly-tipping. Our project 
will see graduate volunteers addressing these 
issues, building a sensory garden and improving 
the woodland and ponds so that the local 
community can access and use the site safely.
Corporate governance
After nearly six years’ tenure as a Non-
executive Director, Ruth Kelly has decided  
that due to personal circumstances and  
time commitments she will not be seeking 
re-election by shareholders at the next Annual 
General Meeting. Ruth has made a significant 
contribution throughout her time with the 
Company and we are sorry to see her go. 
I was pleased to welcome Pierre Dufour to  
our Board in February 2017 . Pierre’s wealth  
of experience will bring great value to our  
Board and to the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees. Additionally,  
his strong track record in safety and industrial 
risk management, and the supervision of 
complex multinational engineering projects, 
makes him ideally placed to strengthen the 
expertise on our Safety, Environment and 
Health Committee.
The topic of corporate governance has  
been the subject of considerable political  
and media attention in the UK during 2016/17 . 
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is now 
undertaking a fundamental review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and we shall be 
an active participant in its consultation process. 
Your Board continues to be very mindful of the 
need to create value for our shareholders within 
a framework of high standards of corporate 
governance, recognition of our responsibilities to 
the wider group of the Company’s stakeholders 
and setting the right tone from the top. 
Looking ahead
We will work closely with our customers  
and stakeholders to understand the impact  
of the UK exit from the EU as Brexit 
negotiations develop. 
We believe it is in the interests of consumers  
to make sure the UK has continued barrier-free 
access to neighbouring energy markets and  
to the benefits realised through harmonised 
trading arrangements with the EU. 
Our US business will continue to work with all 
levels of government to find efficient energy 
solutions for the communities we work in, and 
to solve issues facing the energy sector. We 
remain committed to ensuring a sustainable 
and clean energy future for all our customers.
The increasing threat from cyber attacks  
mean we must remain vigilant to the very real 
risks posed to our critical national infrastructure. 
We continue to focus on the strategies needed 
to protect our business, our customers and the 
communities that rely on our services. 
I would like to extend my deepest appreciation 
to all our employees and the management 
team for their hard work, dedication and 
commitment to your Company’s success.
