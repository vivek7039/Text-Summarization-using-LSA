Group Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review
Our performance has continued 
to prove the strength of the Saga 
business model, which builds  
multi-decade relationships with 
our target demographic through 
a range of excellent products 
and services.
I am very pleased that we have again 
delivered consistent profit growth in line 
with our stated targets. We have 
achieved this alongside some important 
strategic developments, particularly the 
work we have done to enhance our 
understanding of our customers and to 
develop our vision for building future 
value by improving our customers’ 
experience. 
Same clear strategy
We have continued to deliver on the  
clear strategy for sustainable earnings 
growth that we laid out in early 2015. 
This strategy has remained consistent 
and is focused on:
1. Becoming increasingly customer-
centric.
2. Growing profits in our insurance  
and travel businesses.
3. Investing for future growth.
4. Maintaining our efficient  
operating model.
5. Developing our people.
Customer work
Our growing understanding of our 
customers has provided us with a unique 
opportunity to use our rich proprietary 
data to interact with them more efficiently 
to better understand what they want, 
and to deliver it right across the 
business. We are also able to identify 
customers who are more likely to have 
an affinity with the brand over time, and 
to use our marketing resources more 
effectively by targeting and rewarding 
those customers who are, or have  
the propensity to be higher-affinity 
customers (‘HAC’).

6 Through this work, we have identified 
a core group of c.500k HACs that form 
around 20% of our customer base, 
and have contributed around 80% of 
customer value over the last three  
years. This group has the following  
key characteristics, all of which deliver 
greater lifetime value to Saga. They:
• buy premium versions of what we sell;
• have higher retention levels; and
• have a higher propensity to buy 
multiple products across the Group, 
holding an average of 2.1 core 
products each. 
We now fully understand the journeys  
by which these customers have 
developed a high affinity for Saga and 
the reasons why certain customers have 
not. This means that we are now in a 
position to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of our direct marketing 
model to better identify and target 
existing or potential HACs.
Historically, we have managed a highly 
effective product marketing approach, 
evidenced by industry leading customer 
acquisition costs in insurance. This 
marketing was based on average 
returns. By looking at it from the 
viewpoint of customer affinity, rather than 
by value of product, we can significantly 
refine this model to increase efficiency.  
Just as importantly, we have been able 
to identify customers who have an 
affinity with the brand but who currently 
have neither the long tenure nor multiple 
product holdings. By considering their 
purchasing propensities, we can ensure 
that we approach and market to them  
in a way that optimises the likelihood of 
them developing an affinity with Saga. 
So, 
what’s 
next?
Strategic priorities for the coming year 
In order to continue to deliver the  
consistent financial performance that  
we have demonstrated as a public  
company, and ensure future long-term  
value for shareholders, our strategic  
priorities for the coming year are:
1
  Becoming increasingly  
customer-centric

Group Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review continued
We have made a key improvement to  
our systems capability which will enable 
us to do this. In our core insurance  
and travel businesses, we have two 
excellent acquisition machines, whose 
demographic focus means we are 
constantly ‘touching’ current and new, 
potentially high-affinity, customers.  
The improved capability enables us to 
monitor in real time what customers are 
doing and, just as importantly, what they 
have done while journeying through any 
of our systems, both online and through 
our call centres. It will also enable us to 
automatically offer the customer the right 
product based on their history and their 
propensity to buy.
Membership
Saga’s brand is synonymous with life 
after 50 in the UK. Thanks to the 
consistent delivery of tailored products, 
underpinned by exceptional service over 
many decades, customers often refer  
to being ‘Saga members’ without ever 
having run an official membership scheme. 
Utilising the customer work we will create  
a membership scheme that rewards and 
incentivises our customers to both stay 
with Saga and deepen their relationship 
with us. The scheme, which will launch 
in the second half of the year, is open to 
all existing Saga customers and will be 
named “Saga Possibilities”. Its mission 
statement is to: “Help you, our members, 
get more out of Saga and do more of the 
things that matter most to you”.
Saga Possibilities will be structured 
around four key components:
• Experiences: provide members with a 
constant stream of inspiring products 
and experiences they can try.
• Expertise: the go-to place for the over 
50s for subject matter and expertise, 
providing information, inspiration and 
insight on topics that matter most.
• Everyday: to make the little things  
in life more enjoyable, easier and 
better value.
• Enhanced Saga products: every 
product and service that Saga sells 
will have extra enhancements for  
our members.
We believe that the combination of  
our increasing customer insight, data 
capability and membership will be 
extremely powerful, helping us to focus 
our efforts on rewarding, retaining and 
growing our target customer base and 
deepening our relationship with them. 
Our goal is therefore to grow the number 
of products held by HACs by 20% over 
the next 5 years.
Conclusion – the Saga  
investment case
With a clear strategy in place to continue 
to drive profit growth through the core 
businesses and enhance the value of our 
most loyal customers, we have made a 
positive start to the current year, and  
I would like to touch again on the key 
takeaways that make Saga a strong 
investment case:
How we are different:
• Our focus on an older and growing 
demographic
• Our strong customer relationships  
and brand loyalty leads to better 
customer acquisition and retention
• Multiple businesses with tailored, 
differentiated offerings means the 
business is less exposed and 
carries less risk
The model works
• We have consistently delivered steady 
earnings growth over time
• We have demonstrated another year of 
strong earnings growth and cashflow 
Confidence in future delivery
Our existing strategy is robust. The 
in-depth work we have undertaken to 
better understand our customers has 
provided the logical next step in the 
evolution of our model. We are now in  
a position to use our enhanced insight, 
data capability and membership  
scheme to become a more efficient 
organisation, ensuring:
• We retain and deepen our customer 
relationships with:
 – increased persistency
 – better cross-sell 
 – low acquisition costs
• We improve new customer targeting 
through more efficient acquisition spend
• We generate increased profits at lower 
risk, with lower capital through higher 
quality of earnings.
We are seeing the benefits of this work in 
our current business performance. These 
early signs of successful implementation 
have increased our confidence that we can 
continue to leverage Saga’s differentiated 
model to drive increased customer 
engagement and loyalty. This gives us 
further confidence to deliver consistent, 
sustainable earnings growth through 
increased efficiency and customer value 
across the business.
