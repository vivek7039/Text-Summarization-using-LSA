 Governance and directors’ report
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Leadership
During the year, the board undertook a detailed review of 
its composition, skills and experience in order to ensure 
that it is made up of members with the experience to 
challenge and contribute to NEX’s vision. As a result of 
this review, I am delighted that Anna Ewing will be 
joining the board of NEX as a non-executive director in 
May. Having previously worked for Nasdaq and Merrill 
Lynch, she brings significant technology and operations 
experience to NEX which I am confident will support  
our development and growth as a financial technology 
company. We look forward to working with Anna. In 
accordance with the articles of association of NEX, she  
is expected to stand for appointment at the annual 
general meeting in July.
John Sievwright was appointed to the board in July  
2009 and has been Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committees and the senior independent director for 
much of this time. With John’s length of service reaching 
nine years in July 2018, we are seeking to appoint a 
non-executive with the appropriate experience to take 
over, in due course, the chairs of both the Audit and 
Risk Committees.
Dear shareholders,
It is with great pleasure that I am introducing the first 
corporate governance statement and directors’ report 
as Chairman of NEX. During the year, the focus for the 
board and senior management was, to a very large 
extent, on ensuring a successful completion of the 
Transaction with TP ICAP. This was complex and took 
longer than anticipated and consumed a great deal of 
the board and senior management’s time. The result, 
with completion at the end of December 2016, was a 
very good outcome for shareholders. 
This focus led to the deferment of a number of other 
strategic priorities which had previously been identified 
for action and/or completion during the financial year. 
Because of the importance of the Transaction, the board 
supported the Remuneration Committee’s views on 
the impact this had on the executive directors’ bonus 
arrangements. Further details of the outcomes relative 
to the performance goals for 2016/17 are detailed in the 
remuneration report.

While these recruitment processes remain ongoing,  
we recognise that our diversity, in terms of gender and 
ethnicity, fell short of prescribed targets during the year. 
All board appointments will continue to be made on 
merit with due regard for the benefits of diversity. In the 
interim, we are confident that our diversity in terms of 
thinking and challenge remains strong within  
the boardroom. 
Governance
With the launch of NEX and its new position in the 
competitive financial technology marketplace, we  
have started a review of our governance framework.  
We recognise that, in this different competitive space, 
we must be ‘fit for purpose’ with all functions 
appropriate to the new environment, whether regulated 
or not. While there is more work to be done, the Risk 
Committee has begun its debate on its focus for 
2017/18 and the outcome of this discussion is 
documented within the risk management and Risk 
Committee’s activities sections of this Annual Report.
As a result of the Transaction and the subsequent review 
of the governance framework for NEX, we undertook 
internal evaluations of the board and its committees 
during the year, focusing on the outcomes of previous 
reviews and the requirements for the new Group.  
When our governance review has completed and the 
proposed changes to our board have been embedded  
for a suitable period during 2017/18, we will undertake 
an externally facilitated evaluation of the board and  
its committees. 
Culture
We have always recognised the need for a strong and 
identifiable culture and we want everybody within the 
Group to feel and be part of the NEX family as our 
business continues to develop and grow. As part of the 
rebranding to NEX, we are redefining our corporate 
values and the behaviours that support them. Once 
formalised, these values and behaviours will be 
embedded and reinforced throughout the Group. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all board 
members for their time commitment during the year 
and continued commitment and enthusiasm for NEX 
going forward.
In the new NEX world, we continue to strive to be a good 
investment, a great employer and a valued contributor 
to our communities, year after year. Thank you for 
continuing to support these goals.
