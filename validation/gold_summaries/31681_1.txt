 It gives me considerable satisfaction to report again on a 
successful year that reflects the hard work of our management 
team, the enthusiasm of our staff and the support of our Board.
National public policy continues to 
be a significant driver of local authority 
commissioning intentions and behaviour. 
For a number of years, public policy has 
encouraged greater personalisation of health 
and social care for adults. Commissioners 
and leading providers are driving change 
that will mean offering people more choice 
and control over the care, treatment and 
support they receive while at the same 
time maintaining the quality and safety 
of those services.
Our care priorities drive successful outcomes 
for our service users and follow closely the 
guidance from central Government.
Our key focus for delivering quality services 
and positive outcomes is supported by the 
following key factors:
Communication 
 – We have open and frank dialogue with 
our service users, their families and social 
workers, as well as the Regulators.
Independence
 – In our social care and health contracts 
we aim to help our service users to return 
to an ordinary independent life. It may 
be children who can return to their birth 
families or live independently. It may be 
adults who we can help on the pathway 
to recovery following a specialist services 
breakdown, or acquired brain injury or 
people with learning disability who we 
can support towards independent living.
Housing care and support 
 – We know that most people aspire to have 
a place of their own, employment and 
ongoing support. We have structured our 
services, developing new provision and 
creative partnerships with housing providers 
to enable these aspirations to be achieved 
whenever possible and we are tailoring 
training to assist young people and adults 
leaving our services to gain employment.
Self-directed support 
 – It is pivotal to government policy that 
adults and children receiving social care 
are fully engaged in the support that they 
require. With some adults this extends to 
the provision of a cash sum enabling them 
to purchase their care and support directly. 
CareTech managers have been further 
reviewing our systems and delivering 
training throughout the organisation 
to ensure that we are able to deliver the 
requirements of self-directed support.

Chief Executive Officer
Overview
The Group has continued to build upon 
its solid foundations and remains in a strong 
position to continue as a leading provider 
of high quality specialist social care services 
in a large and growing UK market which 
remains fragmented.
The Group has continued to develop through 
organic growth and reconfigurations and, 
with the acquisition of Selborne Care Limited 
in June 2017, it has gained an experienced 
management team with skilled leaders. 
The new business has integrated and settled 
well, and our focus on organic growth also 
remains strong.
In 2017, I am extremely proud of the 
establishment of the CareTech Charitable 
Foundation which is devoted to supporting 
the social care sector. This is further discussed 
in the Corporate Social Responsibility section 
of the report.
There have also been a number of staff 
initiatives to aid retention including the second 
Sharesave Scheme and a Level 5 in Care 
Management training scheme for Managers.
Consolidation and creating 
new opportunities
CareTech remains at the forefront of social 
care outsourcing in the UK across both 
Children and Adult services and, in the year, 
there has been a further increase in working 
closely with commissioners and regulators.

Chief Executive’s Statement and Performance Review
A strong basis  
 f o r ad v a n c e me n t  Quality and dignity
 – CareTech has always delivered high 
quality care in well maintained premises. 
However, we have never been complacent 
about this and have undertaken reviews 
to ensure that we deliver the right quality 
at a reasonable price. We have also learned 
a great deal from the experience of our 
NHS colleagues and developed a Dignity 
Test to ensure that our front line and 
administrative staff treat all our clients 
in ways that promote dignity.
Progress in the year
The year has seen continued progress as 
the Group concentrates on the introduction 
of innovative new services developed in 
partnership with local authority 
commissioners reconfigured from within 
our existing portfolio of properties or through 
new properties either purchased or rented 
for service users for supported living.
In June 2017 the Group acquired Selborne 
Care Limited for a total consideration of 
£16.6m in cash. Selborne is a high quality 
provider of specialist residential care, 
supported living and day care services for 
adults with learning disabilities and challenging 
behaviours. It had at acquisition 57 residential 
beds and 30 Supported Living Service users.
Excluding Selborne Care our Adult Services 
have added a net 81 beds in the year, being 
75 in Supported Living and six in Residential.
Children Services have added 49 beds in the 
year principally in eight services. 
The Group also continues to realise the benefit 
of organisational improvements put in place 
over the past few years. We have continued 
to strengthen our management structure 
with further senior appointments planned 
and to improve the efficiency of our processes 
following further investment in new systems 
which have gone live or we are working 
on now. We are seeing the benefits of new 
executive appointments which continue to 
have a positive impact across the services.
New systems were procured during the 
year for the Group’s recruitment and training 
solutions including e-learning with standard 
automated reports as well as for maintenance, 
hosting, data analytics and e-compliance in 
order to benefit from cutting edge technology.
These improvements have put us in a strong 
position to benefit from a number of the 
commissioning opportunities by working in 
partnership with the NHS and Local Authorities.
Care Pathway Range and Services
The Group’s focus remains the provision of 
specialist social care through its five divisions. 
This is underpinned by a well-defined range 
of provisions which meet the commissioner 
requirements. These services are now even 
more extensive and focused on providing 
high quality care and positive outcomes 
for all of our service users.
The Group has continued to develop and 
grow its existing five operating divisions, 
which come under the two outcome-based 
sectors of Adult Services and Children 
Services. We continue to extend both our 
geographic coverage and our outcome-
based Care Pathway range of services 
organically by acquisition and through the 
purchase of properties to meet the needs of 
our marketplace, specifically the requirement 
for greater acuity service provision for both 
Children and Young People and Adults. 
This ensures that CareTech is in a very strong 
position to address the demands of our 
evolving marketplace.
We remain committed to the growth 
of residential care solutions for adults and 
children with the most complex needs and 
the Group has embraced the development 
of home-based solutions including foster 
care where demand for more specialist 
services remains strong. Our residential care 
services for children cater for young people 
with particularly difficult issues and offer a 
national service; with strong growth seen 
in the North of England with ROC Northwest 
which has expanded both in care and 
educational services. In the year we have 
purchased properties in Scotland and North 
West England for both Spark of Genius and 
ROC Northwest to develop into new services. 
Our adult services offer a solid and reliable 
provision across the whole spectrum of 
service offerings which now includes 
acquired brain injuries and we see a particular 
volume demand in the area of supported 
living, balanced by renewed demand for 
more specialised residential care solutions.
Our strategy is to offer a bespoke range 
of options so that we can maintain the 
Care Pathways that distinguish us from 
other providers.
Overview of progress
Our focus during the past year has continued 
to be further building on the businesses 
which established the Care Pathways whilst 
introducing innovative new solutions to meet 
the challenges faced by care commissioners 
and then adding newly acquired businesses 
with complementary skills.
Capacity has increased by 215 places 
principally because we have continued to 
reconfigure services and acquired Selborne 
Care Limited with its 87 places. Occupancy 
levels within our mature services remain at 
a creditable 93%, or 86% when taking into 
account our services under development 
and transition.
Much has been written about personalisation 
and I felt it would be useful to set out our 
own understanding and commitment 
to personalisation.
Personalisation to us means recognising 
people as individuals who have strengths and 
preferences and putting them at the centre 
of their own care and support.
The traditional service-led approach has 
often meant that people have not been able 
to procure the kind of support they need, or 
receive tailored care assistance. Personalised 
approaches such as self-directed support and 
personal budgets involve enabling people 
to identify their own needs and make choices 
about how and when they are supported to 
live their lives. 
Our two business divisions of Adult Services 
and Children Services comprise the following 
four Care Pathways and our Learning 
Services division.
1. Adult Learning Disabilities
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £87.7m (2016: £79.4m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 52.9% (2016: 53.3%)
Underlying EBITDA* £26.3m (2016: £25.4m)
Capacity 1,735 (2016: 1,567)
Adult Learning Disabilities provides individually 
tailor-made solutions for people living in their 
own homes, residential care or independent 
supported living schemes. We can work with 
clients to deliver self-directed support packages.
For some people residential care will continue 
as the preferred option and we increasingly 
offer several types of supported living and 
packages of individualised self-directed 
support to people in their own homes.
This includes adult residential care homes, 
independent supported living and community 
support services.
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 21 We have continued to work closely with Local 
Authority and NHS commissioners and this 
has helped us to achieve our growth through 
the past year. We take a long-term view, 
recognising that change will continue and 
with this in mind I am pleased to report that 
redevelopment of some of our long stay 
residential provision has been a great success 
over the past year and will continue to meet 
the changing requirements of commissioners 
and families.
The market for high acuity care and the 
support of people with learning disability 
is growing year on year. Demand for lower 
acuity support has been impacted by the cuts 
in local authority expenditure but this is not 
an area of activity in which CareTech operates. 
Conversely, resources for those with the 
highest level of need are being maintained 
and increased in some local authorities.
During the past year we have withdrawn 
36 places in services for reconfiguration into 
new care models and have developed 47 beds 
through reconfiguration plus an additional 
70 beds have been brought into service. 
Further new provision is under development.
2. Specialist Services
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £15.5m (2016: £10.7m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 9.3% (2016: 7.2%)
Underlying EBITDA* £3.9m (2016: £2.7m)
Capacity 214 (2016: 216)
In March 2016, Oakleaf Care (Hartwell) was 
acquired and added its range of pathways from 
rehabilitation through to long-term and end of 
life care for men with acquired brain injury. 
This acquisition builds on the Group’s existing 
neurological services and represents a further 
regional growth platform for the Group. It has 
been put alongside the Mental Health Services 
to form the Specialist Services.
The reduction in capacity in Specialist 
Services arises because there have been 
a small number of beds reconfigured and 
transferred to Adult Learning Disabilities.
The principal reason for the increase 
in underlying EBITDA of £1.2m was due 
to Oakleaf Care (Hartwell) being included 
for the whole of 2017.
Specialist Services works in partnerships 
with the NHS to ensure a successful transition 
out of acute care, delivering pathways to 
independence. We have an outstanding track 
record for helping people away from acute 
care and supporting them in their own homes.
The adult services for this Care Pathway 
include a community-based hospital, adult 
residential care homes, independent 
supported living and community outreach 
with some transitional services transferred 
within the Group.
Community Specialist Services has always 
been a critical but relatively neglected area 
of social care. However, this is changing as 
the NHS drives to lower bed capacity and 
accelerated early discharge from acute 
psychiatric hospital care. 
The growth of social care is certain and the 
response by Government to one of the key 
difficulties is progressing. There has been 
some progress in the removal of large 
numbers of learning disabled people from 
the controversial “Treatment and Assessment 
Centres” operating at various locations 
throughout the UK. CareTech has never 
operated any centres of this type but we 
understand that the CEO of NHS England has 
been tasked with ensuring that these centres 
are re-provided as a matter of urgency. 
CareTech is seeking opportunities to support 
the project and to offer a comprehensive 
solution within its community homes.
We are well positioned for expansion in 
Specialist Services and have a sustainable 
infrastructure to deliver growth including 
plans to provide care for women with 
acquired brain injury in 2018. 
3. Foster Care
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £8.6m (2016: £8.7m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 5.2% (2016: 5.8%)
Underlying EBITDA* £1.9m (2016: £2.2m)
Capacity 301 (2016: 301)
Foster Care provides for both mainstream 
and specialist foster care in small supportive 
groups across England and Wales for children 
with disabilities. We also provide foster care 
family assessments in the home rather than 
in a residential setting.
The unchanged capacity and fall in revenue 
and underlying EBITDA in Foster Care is due 
to the competitive nature of the market as 
well the change to family assessments in 
the home. It is also due to capacity being 
reported on the basis of the children that 
carers are able to look after rather than 
the number that they are approved for. 
This trend is driven by cost considerations, 
where fostering is considerably less expensive 
than residential care and by perceived quality 
care factors. It is generally held that fostering 
in an ordinary family home delivers better 
quality than any residential setting. However, 
the rising tide of fostering has been 
constrained by the challenge of finding 
foster carers with the right skill and motivation 
alongside preference by social workers to 
place within local authority services rather 
than the independent sector.
In 2013, 46% of children placed in foster homes 
were outsourced to the independent sector. 
This compares with 67% placed in residential 
homes operated by independent providers.
Our Foster Care teams and Young People 
Residential teams are working closely 
alongside each other to offer the best 
outcomes for Young People.
Our market intelligence suggests that most, if 
not all, independent sector fostering agencies 
are still experiencing some degree of “hold 
back” at present. However, the consensus 
view is that this will not last long and local 
authorities will inevitably return to progressive 
outsourcing of foster care provision.
Outsourcing is well established in the culture 
of most local authorities, but the current 
austerity measures have led a small number 
of authorities to reflect on the 50% fee 
premium paid for independent fostering. 
This disparity of cost can be attributed in 
part to the fact that the most complex and 
therefore high cost cases are placed in the 
care of independent providers. However, it is 
also clear that local authorities fail to undertake 
a full cost analysis of their in-house provision. 
Wherever this has been done, outsourcing 
is demonstrably much better value.
Demand for foster care has increased overall 
but we have noted an increasing trend among 
some local authorities to make provision 
in-house for all but the most complex 
children. In our view this is an expensive and 
unsustainable approach that exposes local 
authority commissioners to risk. Our own 
services are being maintained at an 
acceptable level. 
22 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Statement and Performance Review continued * Before unallocated costs.
In October 2017 the All Wales Framework for 
the provision of foster care services outcome 
was that TLC (Wales) was ranked 1 and was 
placed in the New Tier 1. This should really 
assist in the growth of TLC (Wales) due to 
the level of referrals now being received.
Looking forward we are training our foster 
carers with the skills required to manage 
more complex work and have linked the 
fostering division with our residential team 
for children so that we can maintain an 
effective care pathway.
4. Young People Residential Services
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £43.8m (2016: £39.0m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 26.4% (2016: 26.2%)
Underlying EBITDA* £13.2m (2016: £11.8m)
Capacity 284 (2016: 235)
A number of children and young people need 
to live in specialised residential services and 
receive education. As far as practicable we 
aim to help these children move into a more 
normalised family style environment.
This segment contains children’s residential 
care homes, which includes facilities for 
children with learning difficulties and 
emotional behavioural disorders (“EBD”), 
and small specialist schools.
In December 2015 ROC Northwest was 
added and gave a further geographic spread 
to fit between the current Children residential 
services in Scotland (Spark of Genius and 
ACAD) and North Wales (Branas Isaf) 
and services in Staffordshire and Yorkshire. 
It also strengthened the residential care and 
education services for young people with 
complex needs, especially EBD.
In the year this segment benefited from new 
services which have added 49 beds to capacity 
with additions to Spark of Genius, ROC 
Northwest and the original Childrens services. 
Spark of Genius provides significant benefits 
across the division due to their well-established 
education facilities across Scotland and 
North East England which complement the 
ROC Northwest and Welsh education facilities. 
In the year the Education capacity increased 
by 46 to close at 312 Young People.
At the Laing Buisson Awards in November 
2017 the winners in Social Care for Children’s 
Services was ROC Northwest.
Children residential services have been 
growing as our reputation for quality care and 
support spreads. We are currently developing 
new beds and places that have been 
commissioned during the past year. 
5. Learning Services
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £10.4m (2016: £11.2m) 
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 6.2% (2016: 7.5%)
Underlying EBITDA* £0.9m (2016: £1.0m)
Learning Services comprises EQL Solutions 
which was acquired in 2013 and is a national 
provider specialising in employment and 
training services to young people and adults 
and Dawn Hodge Associates, a regional 
provider specialising in the social care sector, 
was acquired in 2016.
Their intensive pre-employment, 
development and apprenticeship 
programmes use public funds from the 
Skills Funding Agency to lay the foundations 
for individuals to achieve their career goals 
while helping to provide businesses with 
the vital skills they need in their workforce.
As well as supporting the workforce, Learning 
Services has also developed programmes for 
service users by enhancing the pathways to 
independent living and employment. Young 
People leaving care, for example, often do not 
know where to find the right job opportunities 
or have the opportunity to access employer-
focused training. We can now bridge that gap 
by supporting young people as they make the 
transition to adult life. We are also exploring 
how best to help individuals return to 
employment after mental illness and to give 
people with learning disabilities the skills and 
confidence to gain employment so that they 
are able to live more independently.
Good progress has been made in identifying 
the potential for Learning Services to add 
value to CareTech’s attraction and 
recruitment of staff and their retention, 
helping new employees gain the skills and 
qualifications to grow a successful career 
in care through an Apprenticeship.
The Aspire programme developed as a 
unique and innovative scheme that will 
ensure all CareTech’s support workers receive 
mandatory and statutory training to the 
highest standard whilst also being offered the 
opportunity to complete a Level 2 or Level 3 
Apprenticeship which has been carefully 
tailored to suit their role and 140 completed 
this apprenticeship in the last academic year.
CareTech apprentices continue their training 
with 321 CareTech support workers 
undertaking the apprenticeship programme.
The Team Leader programme has 47 staff 
members on Level 5 programmes.
In early 2016 Dawn Hodge Associates 
retained its Ofsted “Outstanding” which 
is an achievement that we are very pleased 
to have attained and provides an excellent 
base to build upon.
During 2017 with the introduction of 
the Apprenticeship Levy there have been 
significant changes to the Learning sector, 
but we believe that we are well placed to take 
advantage of the new market conditions.
However, both EQL Solutions and Dawn 
Hodge Associates faced a challenging start to 
the new Learning sector year. A reorganisation 
of the management of the division was 
undertaken and the budget for the rest of 2018 
shows an improvement on last year.
