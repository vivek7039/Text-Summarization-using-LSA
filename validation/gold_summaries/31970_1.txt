Performance – Overview
Review of 2017
This was a record year for revenue 
and whilst there was a boost from 
currency due to the Sterling weakening 
following the UK vote to leave the 
EU, there was still underlying growth 
at constant exchange rates of 14%. 
All product lines experienced growth, 
including strong growth for the position 
encoder line, which benefited from 
strong investments in the electronics 
sector in the Far East. This provided 
us with the confidence to continue our 
ongoing investments for the long-term 
sustainability of the Group, including 
global marketing and distribution 
infrastructure, the recruitment and 
training of skilled employees and 
new product development and 
manufacturing capacity.
The year saw continuing high levels of 
capital investment in the development 
and refurbishment of property. The new 
133,000 sq ft headquarters facility for 
Renishaw, Inc. was completed and is 
occupied, allowing us to consolidate 
operations from two existing sites, 
including the 37,500 sq ft  
former headquarters building which 
was sold for US$3.2m. The new 
building at West Dundee, Illinois, is 
much better aligned to our ‘solutions 
provider’ strategy with excellent 
customer demonstration and training 
facilities. In the USA we also completed 
a new 20,000 sq ft building in Detroit, 
Michigan, for Renishaw Advanced 
Consulting and Engineering, Inc., a 
business that we acquired in 2014 to 
help support sales of CMM products 
and Equator gauging systems in the 
USA. A small office has also been 
established in California to support 
customers within the electronics sector.
It was a very good year for Renishaw 
with record revenue for the Group and 
strong growth in both revenue and 
profit compared to the previous year. 
Investment for long-term business growth 
continued, including the recruitment 
and training of skilled people, new 
product development, manufacturing 
capacity and global marketing and 
distribution infrastructure.
D  Renishaw products, such as the SPRINT scanning system, are meeting market 
needs for ever-tighter production tolerances.
D  Renishaw Additive Manufacturing 
Solutions Centres provide a secure 
development environment.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 36 During the year, refurbishment of 
existing premises in Italy, France (Paris) 
and Sweden was completed, whilst in 
Spain, our subsidiary for the Spanish 
and Portuguese markets relocated 
to a new facility close to Barcelona, 
which has given them three times 
the space of their former building. 
As well as a new showroom which 
follows the highly successful template 
of the Renishaw Innovation Centre, 
the new Spanish office includes an 
additive manufacturing lab which 
includes material development facilities 
and post-processing equipment for 
3D-printed metal parts. The ongoing 
investment in infrastructure to support 
our additive manufacturing business 
also saw the formal opening of our first 
North American Additive Manufacturing 
Solutions Centre (AMSC) in November 
2016. Based in Kitchener, Canada 
and close to our existing office, it is 
one of a global network that is being 
established to increase the adoption of 
AM technology by providing a secure 
development environment in which 
our customers can expand their AM 
knowledge and confidence to enable it 
to be deployed in their own facilities for 
volume production.

In Mexico, work is nearing completion 
of a new building that will provide 
expansion space for sales and 
marketing operations. In October 
2016, a new 11,800 sq ft office in 
Taiwan was formally opened, allowing 
enhanced commercial and technical 
support to customers through 
product showrooms, training and 
demonstration facilities.
In the UK, we continued to expand 
our manufacturing facilities, with 
further expenditure on plant and 
equipment to enable the Group to 
meet the demands of a record order 
book. Following refurbishment, the 
Old Town site in Wotton-under-Edge is 
now being used as an R&D facility for 
metrology product development, whilst 
at the Miskin site in South Wales, the 
Healthcare Centre of Excellence was 
formally opened by the First Minister of 
Wales in September 2016.
We continued to invest in our global 
IT infrastructure to support all the new 
and refurbished facilities, including 
ongoing investments in regional data 
centres to improve performance across 
our subsidiary network.
The skills agenda continues to be a 
major topic of conversation amongst 
engineering and science-based 
businesses, with strong competition 
for the best talent that will ensure 
the future success of the business. 
We continue to work hard regionally 
and nationally to promote engineering 
as a desirable career and Renishaw 
as a desirable employer (see CSR 
report pages 54–63 on Education and 
Community). With such a competitive 
environment for skilled people, we were 
very pleased to again be recognised 
for our graduate recruitment by 
The JobCrowd (a UK graduate job 
review website). We received a Highly 
Commended Award for the benefits 
package offered to graduates, rated 
second behind winner Volkswagen 
UK. We have a planned intake of 
45 graduates and 48 apprentices 
this summer, whilst our in-house 
academy delivered 3,050 training 
days (2016: 6,500), with the reduction 
primarily due to changes to our 
graduate induction and apprenticeship 
programmes, which meant that less 
time was spent with the academy in 
favour of more ‘on-the job’ training.
During the year there were various 
awards for Renishaw including the 
prestigious Company of the Year award 
presented at the 2016 NMI awards 
(NMI is the UK trade association 
representing the electronic systems, 
microelectronics and semiconductor 
communities). There were also 
awards for products, including the 
XM-60 multi-axis calibrator winning 
the German MM Award for Innovation 
in the Measuring Systems category 
and a TASIA (The Analytical Scientist 
Innovation Award) 2016 award for our 
LiveTrack™ focus-tracking technology 
for Raman imaging.
Market conditions
As reported last year, we were already 
seeing a favourable environment for 
our position encoders line due to 
new investments in LED manufacture 
and the semiconductor sector. 
These investments have continued 
this year and have been boosted 
by a major investment cycle in flat 
panel display (FPD) manufacture in 
the Far East, where a combination 
of the right products, backed up by 
our excellent reputation for customer 
service, including delivery and 
engineering support, has enabled 
us to win significant business in this 
sector. With ever-shorter lead times 
demanded by this market, our ongoing 
investments in manufacturing capacity 
have given us an agile capability 
that allows us to quickly respond to 
such demands.
As well as strong trade in the Far East 
electronics sector, on a global basis 
we are continuing to see ongoing 
investment in production systems 
and processes, including automation, 
aided by an increasing awareness of 
the benefits to be gained by adopting 
Industry 4.0 and Smart Factory 
philosophies (see pages 26–27). 
Key sectors such as aerospace, 
automotive and energy require 
Renishaw systems to meet their need 
for ever tighter production tolerances 
and cost controls.
Strategy
To meet our key strategic aims, we 
continued to make investments, 
which this year included focusing on 
enhancing our ability to demonstrate 
our products and their applications, 
the infrastructure to support our 
additive manufacturing business, our 
manufacturing capabilities to meet the 
strong growth in business, and our 
continuing drive to develop a strong 
market presence in both established 
and emerging markets.
We continued to invest heavily in R&D 
to create strong market positions 
through technology leadership, 
with £78.0m (before net capitalised 
development costs and the R&D 
tax credit) expenditure on R&D and 
engineering during the year. We filed 27 
new patent applications and there were 
74 previously filed applications granted 
this year.
Another important aspect of our 
strategy is to utilise our existing 
technologies across different product 
lines; for example, the Z-axis on 
our new RenAM 500M additive 
manufacturing system, and the 
new REVO-2 measuring head (see 
page 35) all incorporate our optical 
encoders. Our MODUS
™
 metrology 
software platform, initially created for 
CMM applications, is also increasingly 
being applied across our metrology 
lines, and during the year, a new 
group was created to focus on its 
future development.
During the year we established a 
new subsidiary in Turkey to expand 
our marketing, sales, service and 
distribution infrastructure in this 
growing economy.
