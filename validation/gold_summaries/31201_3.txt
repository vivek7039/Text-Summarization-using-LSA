 I am pleased to report a very much 
improved performance for Laird in 
2017. After a difficult 2016, the swift and 
comprehensive action taken to address 
the problems has delivered reassuring 
results. We have achieved signiﬁcant 
progress in ﬁnancial performance, with 
substantial growth in revenue and a large 
increase in proﬁt. Following completion 
of the rights issue at the start of the year, 
the balance sheet is much strengthened. 
The business now has much more robust 
foundations and is better placed to take 
advantage of future opportunities. 
I have been particularly encouraged 
by the steps that have been taken to 
streamline the organisation and strengthen 
the management of the Company. 
The consistency of delivery across the 
business this year has been in no small 
measure due to these changes. The Board 
is conﬁdent about its plans and the 
Company’s potential. However, it has been 
disappointing not to see the signiﬁcant 
progress that the Company has made 
reﬂected in the share price.
The Board has now received an offer from 
Advent International that represents an 
attractive 72.6% premium to the closing 
share price as at 28 February 2018 and 
provides our shareholders with the 
certainty of realising value from their 
investment in the form of cash. We are 
recommending to our shareholders that 
this offer is accepted. 
Board
The Board reacted well to the difficulties 
in 2016 and continued to challenge and 
support management on both operational 
and strategic issues during 2017.
Following the appointment of Wu Gang as 
a new Non-Executive Director on 1 January, 
there were no further additions to the 
composition of the Board in 2017.
I should like to express the Board’s 
appreciation of our former colleague, 
Sir Christopher Hum, who retired from 
the Board after 10 years of service in 
May 2017. His judgement and wisdom 
were greatly valued.
We take board evaluation very seriously. 
We addressed points arising from a board 
evaluation in 2016 and have recently 
undertaken an independent evaluation 
led by Korn Ferry.

People
The recovery and the momentum that 
has been built in the business in 2017 
would not have been possible without 
the hard work of Laird’s people. I would 
like to thank them for their commitment. 
They deserve credit for the much stronger 
performance delivered by the Company 
during the year.
In a global, dispersed workforce, regular 
and transparent communication is 
essential. I was therefore particularly 
pleased at the excellent participation in 
the Laird Employee Engagement survey 
in 2017 and at the good and improved 
overall score for the business. The Board 
has visited several Laird sites over the 
year, taking the pulse of the Company. 
It also participated in a recent Leadership 
Meeting. This approach builds a culture 
of openness, support and constructive 
challenge which is vital for Laird’s success.
As three years have expired since our 
last Directors’ remuneration policy was 
approved in 2015, the Board is bringing 
a proposal to shareholders for a new 
incentive framework for approval this 
year. At the same time, we will align 
share-based incentive awards for senior 
management with those of the Executive 
Directors to ensure that all management 
awards are linked to delivery against 
targeted business performance objectives.
Outlook
Last year, I said that I remained conﬁdent 
about the potential of Laird and its 
ability to deliver for our shareholders. 
Operationally, we have recovered well 
from 2016 and delivered ahead of 
expectations in 2017.
We have put in place the teams and 
structures to underpin growth, build 
on Laird’s market positions and deliver 
long-term sustainable earnings growth 
and improved cash generation.
We feel that the offer received from 
Advent International is one which 
our shareholders would wish us to 
accept and that it will be easier for 
the Company to implement its plans 
in a private environment.
All successful companies need to be 
valued by their customers. Laird has 
been providing products and solutions 
for almost 200 years and our customer 
survey in 2017 showed that the Company 
retains its good reputation in the eyes of 
its customers. Our end markets remain 
strong and Laird’s businesses can look 
to the future with growing conﬁdence.
