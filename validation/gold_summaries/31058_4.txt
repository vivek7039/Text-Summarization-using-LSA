About us 
Hurricane is new generation of oil company 
that exists to discover, appraise and develop 
oil from fractured basement reservoirs. 
Fractured basements are a global 
phenomenon which have been produced 
successfully for extended periods in multiple 
locations around the world. However, in 
the UK they represent a new play type 
for a sector of the oil industry which has 
historically focused on sandstone reservoirs. 
Hurricane is the first oil company to target 
fractured basements in the region.
Unlike sandstone reservoirs, which hold oil 
in pores in the rock, fractured basement 
reservoirs are composed of very hard rocks 
such as granite, with the oil held in the 
fractures that have formed over the past  
2.5 billion years. 
Where we operate 
Hurricane has a portfolio of contiguous 
offshore licences on the UK Continental 
Shelf, to the west of Shetland. 
The area is a proven petroleum basin with 
a number of large producing oil fields 
including Clair, Foinaven and Schiehallion. 
Hurricane’s licences are focussed on the 
Rona Ridge, a major NE-SW trending 
basement feature. The water depth in the 
area is around 150 metres. All licences are 
owned 100%.
Extensive exploration and appraisal work 
programmes have led to a number of 
significant discoveries in the Company’s 
acreage, including Lancaster, Whirlwind, 
Lincoln, and Halifax. 
What we do 
Technically led and driven, we use our 
expertise to find oil where others have 
looked but not seen. We make and exploit 
discoveries, working towards realising the 
value of those discoveries. 
Hurricane has drilled eight wells on its 
acreage since 2009 including five on the 
Lancaster field.
Hurricane is now working towards the 
first phase of development of its Rona 
Ridge assets, the Lancaster EPS. Extended 
production will provide data to improve 
understanding of the reservoir to be applied 
across the Company’s portfolio in further 
appraisal activity. 
The first phase of development of Lancaster 
is an Early Production System (EPS). This 
involves tying two existing wells back to the 
Aoka Mizu Floating Production Storage and 
Offloading (FPSO) vessel. The Bluewater-
owned Aoka Mizu previously operated on 
the Blackbird and Ettrick fields in the North 
Sea and requires only limited upgrades and 
life extension to be used on Lancaster.
The EPS is key to delivering the reservoir 
information required to move to full field 
development. 
It’s objectives are to:
•  Provide long-term production data to 
enhance understanding of reservoir 
characteristics and associated full field 
development scenarios
•  Commence development of resources in 
phased manner with regard to managing 
uncertainties over reservoir characteristics 
and associated development risks
• Deliver an acceptable return on investment

Hurricane has focussed on implementing its strategy in the West of 
Shetland region of the UKCS. As fractured basement reservoirs have 
not previously been exploited in the UK, Hurricane has determined 
that it will need to maintain ownership of its assets for longer, and 
at greater levels, than is typical in more common reservoir types in 
the region. The Company believes that this approach will allow it to 
optimise the value it obtains for its discovered resources. 
Implementation of Hurricane’s strategy has led to a focus on the 
Company’s Lancaster field, which is now the best understood asset in 
its portfolio, following five wells drilled by Hurricane. The Company 
plans to bring the Lancaster field to commercial production, in 
an initial development phase, the EPS. This allows uncertainties 
associated with the reservoir to be removed whilst commencing a 
phased development and generating cash flow. 
The Company believes that it will achieve the best value for its asset 
base by progressing the portfolio as a whole. It will therefore explore 
and appraise its other assets in the surrounding vicinity, alongside 
the EPS development, to allow a read-across in reservoir properties 
and to demonstrate the size of the overall resource base.
Hurricane’s strategy is to 
create shareholder value 
through monetising the 
significant reserves and 
resources associated 
with naturally fractured 
basement reservoirs  
through exploration, 
appraisal and development.

Welcome to Hurricane’s 2017 Annual 
Report. This has been a transformative 
year for the Company.
Following first oil, with data from the EPS 
being generated and no imminent funding 
hurdles, we will be in a strong position to 
move towards establishing the value that can 
be ascribed to our overall acreage holdings. 
The positive working relationship between 
Hurricane and its Tier 1 contractors is a 
reflection of the Company’s contracting 
strategy. We chose our Tier 1 contractors 
on the basis of demonstrable industry 
reputation, technical expertise, health, 
safety and environmental track record, 
and supportive contractual structures. 
We believe that they are best placed, 
and appropriately incentivised, to take 
us through engineering and installation, 
to first oil and into the operations phase. 
The progress on the upgrade to the Aoka 
Mizu in Dubai and the excellent working 
relationship with the Bluewater Energy 
Services (Bluewater) team, is the most 
visible reflection of that strategy. We are 
aligned in wanting to see the vessel sail 
away on schedule and remain on track to do 
so. As for the well completion and subsea 
installation aspects of the development; 
with both Xmas trees delivered and 
flowlines, umbilical and manifold in the 
final stages of fabrication, we now look 
forward to the start of offshore operations. 
We secured our major contracts at an 
opportune moment in the industry cycle, 
and will continue to strive to minimise 
finding and development costs as we further 
explore, appraise and develop our Rona 
Ridge assets.
Successful delivery of the EPS is a core 
component of the Group’s remuneration 
strategy, including the Value Creation Plan 
(VCP). 2017 was the first full year of this 
five-year long-term scheme introduced in 
late 2016, concurrent with the November 
Interim Chairman’s Statement
shareholders. Management are fully aligned 
with our shareholders as the Company 
transitions to becoming cash generative, 
and in ultimately monetising the Company’s 
assets. The details of the VCP are set out in 
the Remuneration Report. 
At the beginning of 2016, Hurricane was an 
exploration and appraisal company, with 
processes and procedures that were fit 
for purpose at that time. The completion 
of our 2016/17 drilling campaign and 
obtaining FDP approval for the EPS means 
that Hurricane has evolved as a company. 
Our focus has extended beyond drilling 
additional exploration and appraisal wells, 
when funding allows, to transitioning towards 
organic cash generation. This evolution has 
required an upgrade to our organisational 
structure, processes and procedures. Initial 
work on gap analysis commenced following 
the July 2017 fund raise and the Listing and 
Governance Committee (LGC) of the board 
was formed to coordinate the work streams 
that will prepare the Company for the next 
phase of its development. The appointment 
of a new Chairman, following Dr Robert 
Arnott’s resignation, and subsequently one 
or more additional non-executive directors, 
will ensure that the composition of the board 
of directors of the Company (Board) and 
its committees are fully compliant with the 
Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), a standard 
not required of AIM-quoted companies. 
The newly constituted Board will evaluate 
the appropriateness and timing of an 
application for admission of the Company’s 
ordinary shares to a premium segment of a 
recognised stock exchange (Premium Listing). 
Notwithstanding those decisions, it is the 
Board’s view that the Company should act  
as if it were Premium Listed. 
As John van der Welle sets out in his report as 
Chairman of the LGC, we have taken a number 
of those steps already and will continue to 
ensure that your Company becomes and 
thereafter remains Code compliant.
2017 was indeed a fabulous year for 
progressing Hurricane’s operations and my 
thanks go to all those who helped make 
it happen, regulators who supported our 
drilling and early development activities, 
our contractors, who have been working 
collaboratively with us, and of course all 
the Hurricane staff, who have worked 
tirelessly throughout. 
I expect to be able to pass on the role of 
Chairman very shortly and then return 
to my non-executive role as Senior 
Independent director.
Following the successful $530 million fund 
raise required to take the Final Investment 
Decision (FID) on the Lancaster Early 
Production System (EPS), we were given 
approval by the Oil & Gas Authority (OGA) of 
the Field Development Plan (FDP), such that 
we could then proceed with the execution 
of the project. Given the challenging oil 
price environment in mid-2017, this was a 
great achievement by management. The 
data generated by the EPS will allow us to 
progressively evaluate the performance of 
the Lancaster reservoir system and gain 
increasing confidence in the volume of oil 
that we can expect to recover from our 
Rona Ridge assets. At the time of writing, I 
am delighted to report that first oil remains 
on schedule for H1 2019.
Throughout 2017 we continued to engage 
with industry in line with our stated aim 
of achieving a farm-out or sale in advance 
of a full field development. As we have 
progressed our asset base, we have seen 
interest build in the West of Shetland region 
and also in basement reservoirs in northwest 
“ At the time of writing,  
I am delighted to report 
that first oil remains on  
schedule for H1 2019”
It has been an honour to be your Interim 
Chairman. My interest in the Rona Ridge and 
its basement reservoirs started many years 
ago. Hurricane is now poised to demonstrate 
the potential of the Lancaster reservoir, a 
key step to providing the understanding 
which will underpin the development and 
monetisation of its assets.

management to achieve the Company’s 
strategy of de-risking and monetising its 
resource base. As operational hurdles are 
achieved it is increasingly important for 
management to ensure that this progress 
is translated into returns for shareholders.

Europe. The rapidity with which Hurricane 
has advanced Lancaster, from the drilling 
and testing of the -7 and -7Z wells in late 
2016, to a funded and approved FDP with 
target first oil approaching, is unusual in the 
industry. Moving at this pace has allowed 
us to remain at 100% in our licences, as we 
approach first cash generation.
