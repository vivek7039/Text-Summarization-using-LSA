 The year in review
There is no doubt that 2017 was a successful 
year and, most importantly, a year in which 
the leadership baton was smoothly and 
efficiently passed over to Charles Woodburn 
as Chief Executive of the Group.
The Company’s long-term health and growth 
were further underpinned by contracts 
successfully secured during the year on major 
programmes in our principal and international 
markets. Notably, these included contracts to 
supply frigates and submarines for the Royal 
Navy, new and upgraded land vehicles for 
the US, M777 howitzers for India, and strong 
global demand for our world-class defence 
and commercial electronic systems capabilities. 
In December, we entered into a contract 
to supply Typhoon aircraft to Qatar, subject 
to financing conditions, and we remain 
cautiously optimistic of securing further 
aircraft sales to international customers. 
Our cyber and intelligence capability 
remains in high demand from government 
and commercial customers around the world, 
in a challenging market environment. It is 
equally critical in ensuring best-in-class cyber 
protection for our own defence platforms, 
products and services. In recent years, we 
have leveraged our capabilities into the 
commercial sector, where on occasions 
increased volume has been achieved at 
the expense of value. This has now been 
addressed through a change of management 
and by refocusing the business into markets 
where specialised skills provide competitive 
edge and attractive returns.
During the second half of the year, our 
organisation structure was simplified and aligned 
with the demands of the business today.
 “There is no doubt that 2017 
was a successful year.”

Chairman’s 
letter These changes acknowledge the increasing 
requirement for in-country production by 
our customers, the need to continuously hone 
our competitive edge in all markets and the 
emphasis that must be placed on efficient 
execution of a strong order book.
For my part, as Chairman, I have been pleased 
to witness the Company’s ability to manage 
structural and leadership change in a 
turbulent year.
It has been made clear to me by customers, 
shareholders, employees and partners that 
all have valued the preservation of seasoned 
executive experience with the introduction 
of fresh thinking and renewed energy in 
the management team at a time of 
geopolitical turbulence.
Relationships and reputation are, of course, key 
to the success of any business. In this context, 
it is pleasing that close liaison with governments 
in the UK, US, the Gulf, Australia, India and 
many other key international markets, continues 
to ensure the strength of our relationships at the 
highest levels and underline our commitment 
to contributing to national priorities across 
the globe. This will be particularly important 
in 2018 in the pursuit of major business 
opportunities in air, maritime, land and 
cyber currently under negotiation. 
The year ahead, therefore, remains 
demanding, both in delivering the order 
book we have and building an even 
stronger backlog for the long-term future 
of the business, but we approach it with 
confidence and enthusiasm.
Our strategy
Whilst market conditions may fluctuate, 
our strategy remains clear. We are an 
international defence company operating in 
the domains of air, maritime, land and cyber 
with major business interests in the UK, US, 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia.
We manage a balanced business of products 
and services, employing world-class skills 
in technology and engineering to meet our 
customers’ current and future needs. We 
use these capabilities primarily in the defence 
sector but, where appropriate, extend our 
reach into related and adjacent commercial 
market areas.
We develop the skills necessary to supply 
our customers by a commitment to 
apprenticeships, graduate training and 
life-long learning. 
The cash we generate from the business 
is used to pay our people, pay our taxes, 
meet our pension obligations, invest in the 
business through research and technology 
and capital expenditure, reward shareholders 
and make acquisitions, when appropriate.
To deliver this strategy, we have a well-defined 
operational framework, underpinned by a 
strong culture which seeks to be trusted, 
innovative and bold.
Our culture
As a company, we focus not simply on how 
much money we make but, more importantly, 
how we make money. The tone is set at the 
top and cascades throughout the organisation.
We are proud of what we do and committed 
to serve and equip those that serve and 
protect us. We aim to inspire and excel in the 
work we do and the technology we develop.
The management ethos is to work with 
customers in the spirit of partnership, 
striving to go the extra mile in the products 
we make and the service we offer, 
recognising that we must earn everything 
and are entitled to nothing.
As Chairman, I believe we should place 
safety above profit, people above process, 
and ethics above outcomes, in an environment 
that promotes merit and values diversity. 
Our Corporate Responsibility Committee 
monitors performance in these areas.
Our Remuneration Committee focuses on 
the importance of rewarding management 
commensurate with performance and 
creating a structure that is fair, transparent 
and inclusive in recruiting, securing and 
retaining the best talent.
We believe it is only by adopting these 
principles that we can win the backing of 
our stakeholders and the support of society 
at large.
The Audit Committee continues to be the 
check and balance that we have to ensure 
we account conservatively, manage prudently 
and manage risk effectively. In discharging 
these responsibilities, the Committee works 
closely with management, internal audit 
and the external audit team to gather 
their perspectives and ensure the integrity, 
accuracy and veracity of our financial 
reporting to a high standard.

BAE Systems
Annual Report 2017
Strategic report Governance Financial statements At the heart of the business are the people 
we employ and the talent we build from 
apprentice to boardroom. As an international 
leader in engineering and technology, we 
believe we have a responsibility to develop 
a deep pool of expertise through high-quality 
training and apprenticeships, with some 
2,000 apprentices and 500 graduates 
currently in training in the UK.
Board and Executive Committee
With effect from 1 July, Charles Woodburn 
succeeded Ian King as Chief Executive. 
Ian retired after a career spanning more than 
40 years at the Company, including leading 
BAE Systems as Chief Executive since 2008. 
Building a pipeline of talent and managing 
succession at all levels in the business is, of 
course, an essential part of strategic planning. 
Our Nominations Committee consistently 
reviews membership of the Board and 
Executive Committee. In this respect, in 2017, 
we were fortunate to recruit Revathi Advaithi 
as a non-executive director bringing wide 
international operational experience with 
strong engineering and digital credentials, 
and Karin Hoeing as Group Human Resources 
Director and member of the Executive 
Committee. As we look forward, beyond 
the current year, we will continue to refresh 
the Board and Executive Committee to ensure 
our experience and skillset is fit for purpose 
in a changing world.
To avoid complacency and in the pursuit 
of excellence, we conduct rigorous annual 
reviews of the Board with the employment 
of an external advisor every other year. The 
key findings of the 2018 Independent Board 
Evaluation are outlined in the Chairman’s 
Governance letter on page 72 of this report. 
As a Board, we debate and review our 
culture each year to ensure we continue to 
treat everyone respectfully, trade responsibly, 
act with integrity and govern scrupulously.
Summary
In summary, we have been pleased to deliver 
another year of good performance with sales 
of £19.6bn and underlying earnings per share 
of 43.5p, underpinned by an order backlog 
of £41.2bn.
Against the background of a strong Board, 
and a refreshed and committed management 
team, we are both content with the year’s 
performance and positive about our future 
prospects. 
The Board therefore has recommended a final 
dividend of 13p for a total of 21.8p per share 
for the full year. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the May 2018 Annual General 
Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 1 June 
2018 to holders of ordinary shares registered 
on 20 April 2018.
