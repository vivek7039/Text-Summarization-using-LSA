Sustainable Business Improvement Plan 
t he Sustainable business Improvement Plan was 
launched in April 2017 to all the key leaders and 
influencers in Flybe. t he plan is based on the following 
six pillars:
1 The customer 
t he customer will be put at the heart of everything 
we do. Sales and marketing will deliver sustainable 
revenue growth to maximise profitability while 
optimising the customer experience and improving 
the customer interface at every touch point. Flybe’s 
digital proposition will be enhanced through a strong 
digital e-commerce platform and the Flybe product 
will be developed in line with insights gathered from 
a better understanding of Flybe customers. t his 
requires significant investment and will take several 
years to deliver in full.
2 Network and fleet optimisation
We will deliver an optimised network focusing 
on positive route contribution based on customer 
and financial analytics starting from Winter 2017. 
t he delivery of the tighter network will follow 
a structured process with minimal changes once 
the schedule is published.
We intend to make a decision during this financial 
year on the long-term fleet configuration. 
3  Operational excellence with reliability and  
on-time performance
With a better understanding and knowledge of our 
customers and a demand-driven network, we need 
to improve reliability and on-time performance and 
always seek continuous improvement. We also plan 
to re-design and implement a new structure for 
our engineering organisation which remains core 
to our business. t he expert support offered by our 
t raining Academy will be important to plans to 
drive customer service and profitability.
4 Organisational excellence 
We shall design and implement a cost-effective 
organisation structure with clear and aligned KPIs 
cascaded and embedded in every role profile and 
annual performance measurement. t he basics 
need to be in place combined with a strong 
backbone of policies, processes and a transparent 
remuneration policy. 
5 Technology 
We will build further resilience into our It platform 
during 2017 and invest in the core operational 
platforms as we move towards improving the 
digital experience for passengers and implementing 
industry leading support systems for our 
engineering platforms. 
In 2018, we will move towards offering our 
customers a truly digital online experience as 
we invest in a new platform. t he new platform 
will not just benefit our customers. t he first 
phase will commence this summer when we will 
launch the electronic Flight bag which will bring 
paperless working to our flight deck, enabling 
operational data to flow more efficiently into our 
operations team.
A principal reason for customer dissatisfaction is 
the quality of our website and their interaction with 
it. o ver 80% of our customers are booking online 
via our website, with the majority being repeat 
customers. o ur new digital platform, backed by 
our sales and marketing action plan, will enable 
us to attract new customers and enhance our 
customer relationship management.
6 Costs
We will continue to look for ways to reduce costs 
at all levels of our business without hindering our 
performance and the quality service we deliver to 
our customers. 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Strategy
Flybe is well placed as it enters 2017/18 as it will be 
in control of its capacity going forward. Flybe has a 
clear business plan, which will form the foundation of 
a longer term plan to become the best regional airline 
in europe. As part of this plan, we will optimise our 
fleet and network, expand our partnerships, improve 
our distribution approach and optimise our customer 
proposition in the coming years.
Moving forward we will have additional opportunities 
to optimise our route network and our fleet: 
 > o ur route network will be optimised by focusing on 
domestic u K and u K to europe routes, eliminating 
underperforming routes and exploring opportunities 
through partnerships; and 
 > Regarding our fleet, we will continue our discussions 
with the regional original equipment manufacturers 
(oe Ms), both to further improve the reliability of the 
existing fleet and to explore opportunities to replace 
our existing fleet with new aircraft over time.
t he three year project to digitalise Flybe commences 
this year. o ur digital transformation will empower us
with industry standard solutions to attract more 
passengers, improve the customer journey and 
optimise our revenue per seat. t he proximity to 
our customers and our ability to serve them will be 
improved through the implementation of a long 
awaited customer relationship management suite.
I am truly passionate about the airline industry and 
I see tremendous opportunities for Flybe to connect 
and engage with communities and to establish a 
reputation for excellence in serving our customers. 
We will be successful in delivering by continually 
focusing on our costs, increasing our knowledge about 
who our customers are and what makes them tick, 
achieving industry-leading operational excellence and 
implementing a great digital platform. 
Flybe has a great future as europe’s largest regional 
airline. My team is focussed on delivering an 
exceptional customer experience and building value 
for shareholders.

Passenger revenue  
per seat
Passenger revenue per seat is 
a combination of passenger 
yield and load factor. 
 
 
Passenger revenue per seat
£50.64 15/16
£48.84 16/17
£51.35 14/15
Performance
During 2016/17 we have seen 
a 3.6% reduction in passenger 
revenue per seat, as our 
capacity grew 12.3% in a 
competitive marketplace. We 
managed to maintain our yield, 
which measures our passenger 
yield per sold seat, at £70.20 
(2015/16: £70.23). 
 
Goal
Our goal is for year-on-year 
improvement in passenger 
revenue per seat now that 
we are in control of our fleet 
and capacity.
Load factor
l oad factor is measured as 
sold seats as a percentage of 
available seat capacity. 
 
 
 
Load factor
72.6% 15/16
75.2% 14/15
69.6% 16/17
Performance
l oad factor has decreased 
by 3.0ppts due to a capacity 
increase of 12.3% and tough 
competition within the market.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Goal
r aising load factor is a 
key driver to improve 
passenger revenue per seat. 
Our s ustainable business 
improvement Plan aims to 
deliver a 75% load factor.
Reliability
A key enabler for operational 
excellence is the reliability of 
our fleet. t his is measured 
as the percentage of aircraft 
which depart within 15 minutes 
of scheduled departure time 
without a technical fault.
Reliability
98.8% 15/16
98.6% 14/15
99.0% 16/17
Performance
Investment in reliability 
modifications for the Q400 
has contributed to an 
improvement in our technical 
despatch reliability to 99.0% 
across our fleet. 
 
 
 
 
Goal
Our business plan includes 
further improvements 
to improve reliability 
above 99.0%.
On-time performance
A key measure for our 
customers is on-time 
performance, measured as the 
percentage of flights which 
arrive within 15 minutes of their 
scheduled arrival time. 
On-time performance
85.4% 15/16
84.5% 14/15
82.7% 16/17
Performance
We have seen a significant 
reduction of our on-time 
performance due to various 
reasons, including weather, 
technical issues and French 
air traffic control strikes. 
Despite this reduction, Flybe 
was named as the best u K 
airline for punctuality by o AG 
in January 2017, placing us 
sixth worldwide.
Goal
We will continue to improve 
our on-time performance in 
order to achieve our goal of 
operational excellence.
Total passenger revenue
t otal passenger revenue 
is ticket revenue plus 
ancillary revenues. 
 
 
 
Total passenger revenue
£571.7m 15/16
£528.6m 14/15
£619.3m 16/17
Performance
During 2016/17 the increase 
in sold passenger numbers 
resulted in an increase in 
passenger revenue of 8.3%. 
t his increase was partially 
due to the 12.3% growth 
in capacity. 
 
 
 
Goal
Our goal is to optimise 
total passenger revenue 
to maximise profits.
Key performance indicators 
Measuring our progress
Revenue optimisation Operational excellence
We measure passenger revenue performance in two ways: 
passenger revenue per seat and total passenger revenue.
We track three measures of operational performance: load factor, reliability  
and on-time performance.

Profitability and cash
Adjusted profit before 
tax (PBT)
Adjusted Pbt is reported Pbt 
excluding the impact of u SD 
aircraft loan revaluation, which 
is a non-cash item. t his is the 
adjusted profit measure used 
by Flybe (as defined in the 
Financial Review).
Adjusted proﬁt before tax 
(PBT)
£5.5m 15/16
0
£(6.7)m 16/17
£(25.4)m 14/15
Performance
t he adjusted loss is as a 
direct result of the fleet being 
at its peak size, which will 
start to decrease next year, 
and passenger revenue per 
seat falling.
Goal
We aim to grow our profit 
sustainably.
EBITDAR
eb It DAR is a key metric to 
compare profitability across 
the airline industry. It measures 
operational profitability as 
it excludes items relating to 
aircraft ownership (whether 
owned or leased).

Cost reduction
We measure our cost reduction effectiveness  
by tracking unit cost performance via two cost 
per seat indicators.
We use two indicators 
to measure each  
of these.
Performance
t otal cash has reduced due to capital expenditure on fleet during the 
financial year with net debt increasing due to the debt financing of 
aircraft acquisitions in 2016/17. 
Goal
Maintaining and generating cash is a priority for f lybe alongside 
reducing debt to give a more favourable net debt and ultimately net 
funds position. 
Cost per seat  
including fuel
1
Cost per seat  
excluding fuel
1
Due to the proportion of our costs that are driven by fuel, we therefore 
measure cost per seat including fuel and also excluding fuel. We also 
look at the impact of currency through application of constant 
currency rates.
Performance
Cost per seat including fuel has increased by 2.0%, however on a 
constant currency basis it reduced by 5.2%. t he growth of the SAS 
White l abel business adds costs, which are included in the cost per 
seat calculation, whereas the additional seats are excluded from the 
seats, which is adversely impacting the cost per seat. 
Fuel costs fell by 3.6% due to falling fuel prices offsetting higher costs 
associated with increased sectors flown. Cost per seat excluding 
fuel has increased by 5.5%, however on a constant currency basis 
it reduced by 0.6%.
 
Goal
f lybe will continue to focus on cost reduction across all cost lines as 
well as optimising the use of its resources.

For profitability, we use adjusted profit before tax to exclude the non-cash impact of 
uSD aircraft loan revaluation and we use ebIt DAR which enables comparison across the 
airline industry as this measure excludes aircraft ownership costs. t o measure our progress 
on use of cash we track total cash and net funds/(debt).

o ur major legacy issues have 
been resolved, enabling us 
to now focus on making the 
business more resilient and 
customer-focused.
In addition to our existing codeshares with Aer 
l ingus, Air France, british Airways, Cathay Pacific, 
emirates, etihad and Finnair, we signed new codeshare 
agreements with Virgin Atlantic, Air India, Air berlin 
and Singapore Airlines, adding to the ‘o ne Stop to the 
World’ programme and giving our customers greater 
access to long-haul destinations via our key hubs. 
We also continued to review our relationships with 
airport partners. t he commercial arrangements with 
Cardiff, Doncaster Sheffield, exeter and Norwich to use 
the bigger e195 jets have all been fully implemented 
and are being continuously optimised. We maintained 
a strong presence at regional airports with the highest 
frequency share at airports including Manchester, 
birmingham, belfast City, exeter and Southampton.
In 2016/17 Flybe u K made an adjusted loss before 
tax of £(5.8)m (2015/16: profit of £8.8m). t his loss 
excludes Group costs of £(4.3)m (2015/16: £(5.8)  m) 
and u SD loan revaluation losses of £(13.2)m 
(2015/16: £(2.8)m). t he adjusted loss includes the 
following one-off items:
 > £4.3m intangible assets write-off;
 > £0.5m accelerated amortisation for intangible 
assets with a reduced useful economic life;
 > £(3.6)m bonus accrual released on assessment of 
2015/16 performance conditions; and
 > £(4.2)m deferred income released following 
a detailed review of historic balances.
Further detail can be found in the Financial Review 
on pages 28 to 35.
Flybe continued to review and optimise its partnerships. 
We extended our franchise partnerships by bringing 
in Channel Islands-based operator, blue Islands. 
During the year we also announced that the franchise 
arrangement with Scotland-based operator, l oganair, 
will end in Autumn 2017. In June 2017 we signed 
Heads of t erms for a new franchise and joint venture 
alliance with eastern Airways. We will continue to 
review our franchise opportunities to ensure they 
generate a positive contribution to the Flybe brand 
and our profitability.
Business review
Focusing on the customer
Flybe UK
t he legacy fleet deliveries of Q400 aircraft plus 
increased flying of the e195 jets (which contributed 
approximately half of the additional seats) lead to an 
increase in capacity of 12.3%. t he additional capacity 
was deployed on 33 new routes and an increase in 
frequency on existing routes.
t his year we served more passengers – 8.8 million, 
an increase of 7.6% – and reached 64 scheduled 
destinations. Increased competition from other 
airlines and train operators, and overcapacity of 
the market, put pressure on our yield and load factor. 
both declined, but this reduction was partially offset 
by significant cost savings made elsewhere.
Flybe – europe’s leading regional airline has 
a long relationship with birmingham Airport 
and continues to be one of our largest customers. 
t he airline fulfils a number of market roles for the 
midlands providing frequent connectivity between 
birmingham and key u K and european cities and 
off-peak travel to leisure destinations. It brings real 
competitive tension to the market which means 
that our passengers and midlands consumers get 
great choice and value for money.”
Paul Kehoe 
Ceo , birmingham Airport
As the largest carrier linking Wales to 
major markets in the u K and europe, 
Flybe brings a unique dynamic that allows us to 
explore new opportunities to offer our customers 
a wider choice of destinations that are priced 
competitively and offered at convenient times – 
and the airline’s ever-growing network of routes at 
Cardiff is testament to this. 
As the national airport of Wales, we are committed 
to promoting both Wales as a tourism destination 
and accessible air travel from Wales across the u K, 
europe and beyond. Flybe’s provision of routes 
to key capital cities and hubs makes the airline 
an important factor in more and more of our 
customers deciding to fly from Cardiff.”
