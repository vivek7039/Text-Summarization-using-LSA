 Whilst I am pleased to present the Group’s results in our first 
full year since listing on the London Stock Exchange, there 
is no doubt that the past year has been challenging and 
disappointing with net operating income down 5% and 
underlying profit before tax down 22%. The year-on-year fall  
in  net operating income was primarily driven by more 
challenging market conditions with sustained periods of 
significantly lower market volatility, providing fewer trading 
opportunities for our clients.
The more significant fall in underlying profit before tax of 
22% was a function of the lower level of net operating income 
combined with our continued investment in the strategic 
growth initiatives, which will drive the medium to long-term 
growth of the Group. We have made strong progress on each of 
the strategic initiatives, greater detail of which is included later 
in the annual report.
Although the financial performance is disappointing, the 
underlying fundamentals within the business have continued to 
improve with a 5% increase in active clients and client money at 
record levels.
The results for the year have been somewhat overshadowed by 
the proposals from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
and other European regulators as they reform the way that 
contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting products are 
offered. The Group welcomes strong regulation and is working 
with regulators throughout the consultation periods, to achieve 
their objectives. It is likely that once finalised, these changes will 
impact the profitability of the Group in the short term, although 
in the medium to long term we believe that the Group will 
benefit from these changes as smaller operators leave the 
industry and we grow market share.
Governance and the Board
Prior to the listing in February 2016, we made a number of 
changes to the Board, strengthening it in a number of key areas. 
This is the first full year that the Board has been in place and 
following a formal evaluation process the Board has agreed 
that it has operated effectively throughout the year. More detail 
is included in the Nomination Committee report.
Manjit Wolstenholme will be stepping down from the Board 
at our Annual General Meeting on 27 July 2017. I would like 
to thank Manjit for her valuable contribution as we prepared 
for our listing and during our first year as a public company, 
and wish her every success for the future. We have commenced 
a thorough search for a successor.
Our people
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of our staff for 
their hard work once again. Their effort and commitment has 
helped to ensure that we successfully managed the market 
volatility around the EU referendum as well as other significant 
market events during the year. The quality of our staff gives me 
the confidence to know that we will successfully deal with the 
regulatory changes, Brexit and other events that will impact the 
operations of the Group in the coming years. We have a 
considerable talent base in our London head office and intend 
to maintain the UK as our global headquarters. Continuing 
investment in our key talent will be an absolute priority for the 
Board in the coming year.
Dividends
CMC Markets continues to be a highly cash generative 
business. Whilst the Group’s policy is to pay dividends of 50% 
of underlying profit after tax, given the Group’s strong cash 
position, the Board has decided to maintain the full year total 
ordinary dividend in line with the prior year.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.95 pence per 
share, which represents a total ordinary dividend of 8.93 pence 
per share.
Outlook
2018 will be an important year for the Group as the regulatory 
changes are finalised and the way the Group will best serve the 
needs of our clients within that environment becomes clear. 
With our award winning technology, focus on client service and 
strong balance sheet, we believe that as the industry adjusts to 
these changes we will be in a position to emerge as a stronger 
business, delivering future growth and shareholder value.

Chairman’s statement
CMC Markets plc Chairman’s statement
8 9 Peter Cruddas collaborates on product development plans.
I founded CMC Markets in 1989 and over the intervening years 
the business has grown and has dealt with many periods of 
significant change; in many cases we have pioneered the change. 
This has included embracing the internet and new technologies 
including mobile and adapting to regulatory change. I love being 
at the helm of the business and I plan to steer us through any 
proposed regulatory changes ahead. That is what I have done 
successfully for 27 years and I will continue to do going forward. 
Financial performance and KPIs
Over the year, global markets were less volatile than historically, 
particularly in our major asset class, indices, and despite 
short-term volatility around the EU referendum and US 
presidential election, this ultimately led to fewer trading 
opportunities for our clients. Against this backdrop of low levels 
of market volatility, particularly in the first half, clients traded 
less than the prior year with net operating income being 5% 
lower than the prior year at £160.8 million. Operating expenses 
before exceptional costs increased by 6% to £105.8 million, due 
to increased investment in marketing and higher staff costs.
Profit before tax was £48.5 million, a 9% decrease on the prior 
year, driven by the reduced net operating income and the low 
level of variable cost within the business. However, with this 
operational leverage we anticipate that when revenues increase 
there will be a low incremental increase in cost, and therefore 
believe that our strong client metrics are a good foundation for 
future earnings growth. Own funds generated from operating 
activities were £47.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 
and the Group continues to have a strong regulatory total 
capital ratio of 31.5% as at 31 March 2017.
Although the Group’s policy is to pay 50% of profit after tax 
as dividends, given the Group’s strong cash generation and 
liquidity position, the Board has recommended to maintain 
last year’s total ordinary dividend and pay a final dividend 
of 5.95 pence per share despite the lower earnings.
Active clients have increased by 5% for the Group to 60,082; 
however a 6% reduction in the number of trades and a 3% 
decrease in the value of those trades contributed to a fall in 
overall revenue per active client (RPC) of 11% to £2,517. 
Although lower than the prior year, RPC remains amongst the 
highest in the industry and is a reflection of the quality of our 
client base. RPC is presented net of retail and Institutional client 
rebates, which were £9.9 million for the year, a decrease of 6% 
from the prior year.
2017 has generally been a good year for overall client 
acquisition for the CFD and spread betting businesses, with 
new clients increasing by 13% compared to the prior year. 
Our stockbroking business has seen client acquisition 
increase by 20%.
Regional review
The UK continues to be Group’s largest market; net revenue
1
 
fell by 3% although the value of trades increased by 6%. The 
value of trades saw an increase in lower margin institutional 
business offset by a large decrease in indices business.
In Europe net revenue fell by 7% marginally higher than the 
reduction in the value of trades, whilst in APAC & Canada net 
revenue decreased by 11%, again slightly higher than the 
value of trades.
2017 has been a busy and eventful year for CMC Markets, as 
we completed our first full year as a public company. We have 
made strong progress on our five strategic initiatives outlined 
for our investors during the listing process, including signing 
of a partnership with ANZ, launching new products (binaries 
and Knock-Outs) and continuing to develop our award winning 
Next Generation platform. 
Our financial performance has been lower than last year driven 
by lower client activity resulting from an unusual lack of market 
volatility for large parts of the year. However, active client 
numbers and client assets have continued to increase. I am 
therefore confident that we have the right foundations in place 
for the business moving forwards.
The big industry event of the year, which was outside our 
control, was the decision of a number of European regulators  
to announce changes or commence consultations around client 
appropriateness, minimum retail margins, risk warning 
amendments, client incentive schemes and marketing of 
leveraged products. 
Our primary focus has been on the consultations within our 
core markets, in particular the UK and Germany where the 
consultation period took place from December 2016 through  
to March 2017, and we have made thorough and detailed 
responses. These consultations were initiated as a result of 
low-quality providers applying low levels of regulatory 
compliance, questionable sales practices and irresponsible 
behaviour, primarily from overseas jurisdictions. CMC Markets 
has always had a strong focus on compliance and service and  
I am confident that by working with regulators, in the long term 
the Group and the industry will emerge in a stronger position.
The recent German regulatory consultation has resulted in the 
regulator maintaining its initial position which requires the 
implementation of negative balance protection for retail clients 
by 10 August 2017, whereby clients cannot lose more than 
their account balance. The flexibility of our Next Generation 
platform means that we are able to quickly adapt the platform’s 
functionality to meet these new requirements. We await 
communication of the outcome of the UK consultation.
The other significant event for CMC Markets during the year, 
which was specific to the Group, was being chosen by the 
Australia and New Zealand Bank (“ANZ Bank”) to service their 
stockbroking business, where our technology was one of the 
main catalysts for winning the transaction. The agreement 
means we will transfer and service over 250,000 ANZ Bank 
annual active stockbroking clients from September 2018. CMC 
Markets is already the largest non-bank retail stockbroker in 
Australia and this transaction will propel us to the number two 
position in Australia overall with a 23% market share based on 
ASX trading statistics.
This transaction is expected to be highly profitable for both 
CMC Markets and ANZ Bank once we have fully integrated the 
software and migrated their clients onto our platform which is 
expected to commence in September 2018. Combined with our 
existing business we will have in excess of 300,000 annually 
active stockbroking retail clients, a number of intermediaries 
and total client assets in excess of A$53 billion. Naturally for a 
deal of this magnitude, although revenue streams will not begin 
for over a year, a project is underway to ensure that the 
transaction is a success. We are developing additional 
stockbroking platform functionality, and increasing the property 
and hardware capacity needed to support the anticipated rise in 
trading activity and staffing required to service the client base.
CMC Markets targets experienced clients through a more 
feature rich trading platform and excellent client service. 
Our award-winning, proprietary Next Generation platform 
was specifically built to attract more experienced clients and, 
more importantly, to retain them. We aim to have a long 
relationship with our clients and this has been achieved as 
illustrated through the fact that approximately 32% of our 
active clients have been with us for over three years which  
is significantly higher than the industry average. 
In addition to our Next Generation platform, we employ 
experienced sales trading teams that are available to speak 
to clients any time and keep them updated on market 
movements. We also target experienced stockbroking clients 
through our Pro platform in Australia. Overall globally we 
won 34 awards for service, platform and technology during 
the year.

Strategic progress
Despite the regulatory uncertainty, we continue to focus on our 
clear strategy to grow the business in the future around five 
strategic initiatives, and underpinning each of these is our 
continuing focus on client service, innovation and technology. 
When looking solely at financial performance, it has been a 
mixed year for the initiatives, but we are continuing to make 
progress across each of them, and will continue to refine them 
as the regulatory outlook becomes clear.
In our established markets, the lacklustre market activity has 
been the main driver of lower revenue by reducing the number 
of trading opportunities for existing and returning business. In 
addition, our increasing marketing spend has also not had the 
expected impact on new accounts, with cost per acquisition flat 
on the prior year. 
Regarding new markets and developing regions, our Poland 
office has shown good growth since its launch in October 2015, 
but in size it remains immaterial to the Group at present with  
a contribution of 1% of net revenue. Despite regulatory change 
in France, another year of growth has been achieved. We have 
also incorporated an education entity in China in readiness to 
open an office in Shanghai in the first few months of the new 
financial year.
From a digital perspective we have focussed on our mobile 
marketing capabilities, whilst also continuing to improve 
websites and the client journey.
Our institutional business, where we offer white and grey label 
and API
1
 connectivity to banks and brokers worldwide, 
continues to grow and CMC Markets had 154 active 
institutional relationships during the year, an increase of 43% 
against the prior year. This growth in clients contributed to a 
38% increase in net revenue to £22.7 million.
Throughout the year we have continued to make improvements 
and enhance our award winning Next Generation technology. 
Innovation is core to the Group and during the year we 
successfully launched our full binary offering, the ‘Knock-Out’ 
product in Germany and continued to improve our API
1
 offering 
to institutional clients. In the coming months the platform will 
be upgraded to HTML5 which will help to provide additional 
flexibility in the future, as well as maintain our leading position 
in technology against our peers.
Having returned as the Group’s full time CEO in 2013, the hard 
work in developing our technology, platform and premium client 
strategy is giving us a clear advantage. Our technology 
innovation is hugely valuable and important to our clients and 
our business. It is key to our future growth and scalability and 
we continue to invest in technology as a platform for our 
success. Owning and developing the key components of our 
platform software means we are able to innovate rapidly, driving 
our business forward and responding to the needs of our clients 
and our regulators.
In the last year or so I have visited our offices in Australia, 
New Zealand, Singapore, Germany, Austria, Dubai (major 
partner) and there continue to be many opportunities around 
the world for us as a business. 
I would like to thank our staff for their continued hard work and 
dedication throughout the year. We have very talented people 
across all areas of the Group and their commitment is key to our 
future success.
I would also like to thank our clients for their continued support. 
We strive to provide the best levels of service and a great 
trading experience to our clients, and during the year I have met 
many of our clients from across the globe. The feedback we get 
is invaluable and vital to our ongoing success, ensuring we meet 
or exceed our clients’ needs. 
I believe that becoming a public company in 2016 was the right 
decision for the business, as there is no doubt that being listed 
provides us with additional opportunities. Some of the 
institutions and clients we are speaking to would only work with 
us if we were a public company.
It has been a transitional year and I am looking forward to our 
future. Over the coming year the regulatory uncertainty will 
reduce and we can continue to move forward. These are 
exciting times for the Group as we progress our diversification 
across different continents, products and technology. For now 
the sector is shrouded in uncertainty around regulatory change, 
but for CMC Markets development and innovation continue as 
they have done for 27 years and I firmly believe that the Group 
will be a long term beneficiary of the expected improvements in 
the industry in the future.
