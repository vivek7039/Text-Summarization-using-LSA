PRS investments
Private rented sector portfolio
We have 4,789 private rented sector 
(‘PRS’) homes in our portfolio. These 
well-located assets are attractive to 
customers and, with our expert 
operational team managing the  
properties directly, our portfolio  
continues to outperform the market. 
Our aim is to offer attractive homes to our 
customers and provide a reliable service 
for them. This means we have more 
satisfied customers, who are staying with 
us for longer, making sure our assets stay 
in high demand. In turn, this generates 
attractive and sustainable long-term total 
returns for our shareholders.

Regulated tenancy portfolio
Our portfolio of regulated tenancies 
generates stable and reliable cash flow 
of at least £100m per annum.
Around 6.5% of our regulated tenancies 
become vacant each year, enabling us to 
capture the uplift from their tenanted 
value to their vacant value as we sell them. 
Returns from regulated tenancies are 
generated in three ways: rental income, 
capital growth and the reversionary 
surplus (crystallising the reversion when 
they become vacant). Our regulated 
tenancy portfolio provides a resilient 
rental income with growth linked to the 
Retail Price Index, albeit with lower yields 
than our PRS assets. 
We are reinvesting these proceeds into 
higher-yielding new PRS homes.
