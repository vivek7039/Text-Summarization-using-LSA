Dear shareholders,
We were expecting to be moving forward towards
the targets set in the prior year in terms of
production, however our progress was held back
by the lack of equipment. Positive progress was
made in developing the underground mine in
relation to the ore bodies and infrastructure.
However the lack of equipment had a direct effect
on the level of output and grade achieved.
During the year in order to move the project
forward, which requires capital investment, a great
deal of work was done with investment advisors
and potential lenders. The potential offers were
carefully vetted and assessed to ensure that the
finance to be provided was the correct fit for the
Company. This necessarily involved additional time
and resources and the time lines were extended to
those originally envisaged. The management are
working to ensure that the current funding being
accessed for the required investment in equipment
is at a competitive price for the shareholders and
affordable for the Company. To this end they have
identified two sources that will provide the
necessary funding required to move the project
forward, and are currently in the final stages of
confirming the funding.
During the year the Company maintained tight
control of costs to conserve working capital, with
further savings being made in 2018 both at head
office and at subsidiary Company level in
Kazakhstan. At Head Office the administrative costs
have been reduced by cutting office and
professional fees. In the subsidiaries rent, travel and
other overheads have been reduced. In Q1 2018
these have been further reduced. Employment
costs have been reduced with a rationalisation of
the workforce principally at the mine site. 
During the year the Company met its commitment
to repay the balance of the EBRD loan, which was
settled in October 2017. The consequent finance
cash flows in relation to servicing of this debt will
prove useful in meeting its obligations on any new
financial liability. 
The decline has now progressed down to 150masl,
and a number of ore bodies are now accessible to
progress 2018 production.
Underground development
150masl
The decline is now at 150masl and a number of ore
bodies are now accessible to progress production in
2018
We are confident from the work conducted so far
that the mine will generate a very good return to
the shareholders. The underground asset and
infrastructure have been developed so that it can
deliver the production required, via the new range
of equipment to be purchased. This is expected to
quickly transform the productive capacity, and
move towards the targeted output levels. The
recent drilling undertaken at Karasuyskoye has
delivered promising results and the Company are
expecting to move the project forward to the CPR
stage in the near term.
I would like to thank the shareholders for their
patience, as I am aware that the gold price was
trending up whilst our share price was trending
down. Based on the fundamentals and our
understanding of the asset we see the long-term
future of the Company in a positive light and the
patience of shareholders will be rewarded.
With the ore bodies ready for exploitation and
infrastructure in place including the refurbished
processing plant. The additional equipment will
now provide the necessary feed stock to the
processing plant to see the results of all the hard
work come to fruition.
Finally, may I once again thank all our employees
and our Management team for their hard work, and
we look forward to an exciting and fruitful year
ahead for Altyn.
