Strategic Report
A strong platform  
for the future
The announcement of a soft drinks 
sugar tax in the Chancellor’s budget  
in March 2016, and the devaluation of 
sterling following the UK’s referendum 
vote to leave the European Union in 
June, added additional external 
headwinds in a soft drinks market 
already impacted by price deﬂation. 
Despite these macro external inﬂuences, 
the business has retained a clear focus  
on the execution of its strategy and in 
particular on internal improvement actions. 
Financially, the business has delivered 
another solid performance with proﬁt 
before tax and exceptional items* of 
£42.4m, an increase of 2.7% on the prior 
year (£41.3m), and exits the year with  
a strong balance sheet.
We maintained our market share across 
the period and continued to invest in our 
brands, with the key brands, IRN-BRU 
and Rubicon, delivering good growth. 
Innovation has been a key strategic 
focus across the year and the launches 
of IRN-BRU XTRA and Rubicon Spring 
in particular, both no added sugar 
products, have proven successful. 
As consumer tastes and preferences 
continue to change, and the demand for 
great tasting, reduced sugar products 
increases, the recent announcement 
that 90% of our Company owned 
brands will contain less than 5g of total 
Over the past 12 months we have seen some extremely 
signiﬁcant events unfold across the UK and beyond.
Chairman’s Introduction

sugars per 100ml by the autumn of 2017 
is an extremely positive demonstration 
of how the business is responding with 
both pace and commitment. 
Our key partnerships with Rockstar and 
Dr Pepper Snapple Group continued to 
progress, complementing our own 
portfolio both in the UK and increasingly 
on an international basis, where we have 
delivered further growth, extending our 
international footprint and our franchise 
territory agreements.
The Funkin business, acquired in 2015, 
continues to exceed our acquisition 
expectations, and we remain highly 
encouraged by the continued growth 
momentum of the Funkin brand  
and business.
Our drive for improvement across  
the business has not abated. We have 
continued to invest in our asset base, 
including the installation of a new  
glass ﬁlling line at Cumbernauld, and  
are in the process of adding new PET 
capability in our Milton Keynes facility.  
In addition, we have successfully 
completed a Company-wide business 
reorganisation that has both enhanced 
our organisational capability and 
reduced our overhead base.
We exit the year with a strong balance 
sheet, and are well placed to exploit growth 
opportunities as and when they arise.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to be in a position to 
maintain its commitment to a progressive 
dividend policy and recommend a ﬁnal 
dividend of 10.87p per share to give a 
total dividend for the full year of 14.40p 
per share, a full year increase of 8% on the 
prior year. The ﬁnal dividend is payable 
on 9 June 2017 to shareholders on the 
Register of Members at the close of 
business on 12 May 2017. The ex-dividend 
date is 11 May 2017.
Share repurchase programme 
Given the strength of the balance sheet 
and the cash generative nature of the 
business, the Board has decided to return 
up to £30m to shareholders via an 
on-market share repurchase programme. 
This programme is anticipated to 
commence in the spring of 2017 and 
complete within 24 months. The AGM in 
May 2017 will be requested to approve 
the renewal of the authority granted in 
June 2016 for the Board to repurchase  
up to 10% of the Company’s own shares. 
We do not believe that the repurchase 
programme will have any material impact 
on our ability to secure acquisition 
opportunities should these be identiﬁed.
People
The continued success of the business is 
testament to the commitment and skills 
of the whole team and I would like to 
take this opportunity to extend a thank 
you to each and every team member for 
their eŽorts across this year of change 
and reorganisation. 05
