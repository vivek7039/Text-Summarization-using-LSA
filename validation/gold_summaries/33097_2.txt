Notes
1. David Atkins has external non-executive appointments, disclosed in the Directors’ Biographies on page 98. He does not receive a fee for any of these appointments.
2. Timon Drakesmith acts as the Company’s representative as a non-executive director of Value Retail PLC. He does not receive a fee for this appointment. 
3. For consistency and comparison against other Executive Directors, Jean-Philippe Mouton’s remuneration has been converted from euros into sterling in table 52.  
The exchange rate that has been used is £1: €1.241 (2013: £1:€1.178). His base salary was €400,000 in 2013 and €408,000 in 2014.
4. Benefits: taxable benefits (company car or car allowance and private medical health and, for Jean-Philippe Mouton, a seniority allowance and welfare contribution)  
and all-employee arrangements (for the UK Executive Directors, SIP and Sharesave; for the France Executive Director, profit sharing scheme and employer’s contribution  
to an employee savings scheme).
5. AIP: Achievement against Company financial targets and personal objectives (using estimated TPR outcomes) resulted in an average entitlement for Executive Directors  
of approximately 65% (2013: 54%) of the maximum bonus opportunity. Details of annual bonus outcomes are on page 79.
6. LTIP: 2013 figures were estimated in the 2013 Annual Report as final data for the TPR performance measure was not available at the date of publication. The 2013 figures  
above have been updated to reflect the actual outcome using final TPR data. Details of the calculation for the 2013 and 2014 LTIP are at table 53 below. Final figures for  
2014 will be presented in the 2015 Annual Report. Estimates are for reporting purposes only. 
7. Pension: Full pension details and the method for calculating the pension figures above are given on pages 82 and 83. 
8. During the year, no payments were made to Executive Directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly in the course of their employment.
Basis for calculating the values attributable to each performance measure for the L TIP
Table 53 provides a breakdown of the values attributable to each performance measure that when aggregated produce the single figure for  
the LTIP in table 52. The basis for any assumptions used is also detailed. Details of the LTIP award that vested in 2014 can be found at table 59.

Performance measure data and notes on estimation
TSR The 2014 figure for TSR is for the 2011 LTIP award that vested in 2014. The performance period ended on 1 April 2014 for awards to David Atkins, Peter Cole and 
Jean-Philippe Mouton. For Timon Drakesmith, the performance period ended on 6 June 2014 (2011 LTIP award and second tranche of the Recruitment Share Award). 
Values are calculated using actual performance and the share price on the date of vesting (615.50p for Timon Drakesmith).
TPR The 2014 figures are estimated values for awards scheduled to vest in 2015 (where the performance period ended on 31 December 2014) as final IPD index data is  
not available at the date of publication. The estimate compares the Company’s actual TPR figures with the best available information. Final IPD data will be available  
in April 2015 and the award will vest in May 2015. The estimated value is nil. The actual 2014 figure for TPR will be reported in the 2015 Annual Report.
The 2013 figures for TPR where the performance period ended on 31 December 2013 was estimated ‘nil’ in the 2013 Annual Report as some IPD index data was not 
available at the date of publication. The 2013 figures for TPR are the actual values that vested (see table 59). The values are calculated using the share price on the  
date of vesting (615.50p for Timon Drakesmith, 576.00p for other Directors).
Absolute 
NAV
The 2014 figures for Absolute NAV are the values for awards that are scheduled to vest in 2015 (where the performance period ended on 31 December 2014).  
The value for 2014 is nil.

 www.hammerson.com 77 2014 REMUNERATION: IMPLEMENTATION REPORT CONTINUED
BASE SALARY
As reported last year, base salary levels for the Executive Directors increased in 2014 by between 2% and 3.6%. For 2015, the Committee 
determined that there would be no increase in base salaries. A number of factors were considered in making this decision including the impact  
of historically low inflationary pressure and the Company’s cost reduction objectives. Executive remuneration benchmarking data was reviewed 
to ensure that base salaries remain competitive.
Jean-Philippe Mouton’s salary (and the other elements of his remuneration) is denominated in euros. When converted, the sterling equivalent  
will vary with currency movements.

2.  In the opinion of the Board AIP performance conditions and personal objectives for 2015 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed. These will be  
reported on in the 2015 Annual Report. 
3.  IPD is the Investment Property Databank’s aggregate full-year UK Retail Property (70%) and France Retail Property (30%) indices.

The TPR performance measure is based on IPD UK Retail Property (70%) and France Retail Property (30%) indices. However, data for the IPD  
France Retail Property index is published each year in April, and is not available at 13 February 2015. Accordingly, the level of payout for 2014 is 
estimated, based on management’s best estimate using available data (see page 49, table 32 for property returns data). The TPR element of any 
bonus payment to Executive Directors (including the deferred shares element awarded under the DBSS) is made only when all the IPD index  
data is available for the calculation of the TPR performance measure.
The element of bonus determined for each performance measure is calculated by interpolating the actual performance achieved for each 
measure against the scale between entry threshold for vesting and the target to achieve full vesting.
The cost control target was changed in 2014 from an absolute measure to a ratio to align it with the Company’s stated intention of reducing  
the Group total operating costs as a percentage of the income to 21% by 2016.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ PERSONAL OBJECTIVES
Executive Directors are able to earn up to 30% of the maximum award for achieving personal objectives. All Executive Directors’ personal 
objectives were designed to focus not only on the delivery of the Business Plan for 2014, but also on the strategic objectives set out  
on page 3. 
Table 57 below provides detail of some of the significant achievements against personal objectives for the Executive Directors. The personal 
objectives for each Executive Director in 2014 were not disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report as the Board considered them to be commercially 
sensitive. Payout levels were 100% for Timon Drakesmith, 80% for David Atkins and Jean-Philippe Mouton and 65% for Peter Cole.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The structure of the LTIP awards, as well as the performance measures and conditions attached to the awards align closely with the Company’s 
strategic focus. Since 2011, the awards have incorporated a balance of relative and absolute measures, and the Remuneration Committee believes 
that this balance remains appropriate.
The structure of the 2015 awards remains the same as the 2014 awards. The comparator group for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure 
focuses on major European retail real estate companies and the Total Property Return (TPR) measure compares performance against a retail  
only property index. With regard to the absolute performance measure, earnings per share (EPS) continues to align the interests of Executive 
Directors with those of shareholders. Details of the LTIP structure are set out in table 58.

1. Corio will be excluded from the comparator group on the assumption that the takeover offer by Klepierre announced in July 2014, will proceed.
2. Subsequent to publishing the 2013 Annual Report but prior to granting awards, IVG entered into insolvency. It was excluded from the comparator group when the awards 
were made.
3.  In order to smooth the transition from a three-year performance period to a four-year performance period, an enhanced award of 300% of salary was made in 2011, with half of 
the award subject to a three-year performance period (which vested in 2014) and half subject to a four-year performance period (vesting in 2015). This avoided a vesting ‘gap’ in 
2014 and, overall, results in only a modest reduction in potential awards vesting to Executive Directors in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 (assuming a consistent level 
of performance is achieved). The second half of the award (i.e. 150% of salary) is shown above, as it remains outstanding and will, subject to performance, vest in 2015.

LTIP PERFORMANCE MEASURES
TSR TPR EPS/Absolute NAV
Performance is measured over the four-year 
period from the date of grant, in comparison 
with a comparator group, including some 
European real estate companies.
Performance is measured over the four 
financial years commencing with the year  
of grant and in comparison with a composite 
index comprising: 
• For awards granted from 2013: 
Investment Property Databank’s  
UK Annual Retail Property Index and 
France Annual Retail Property Index. 
• For awards granted from 2009 to 2012: 
Investment Property Databank’s UK 
Annual All Property Index and France 
Annual All Property Index. 
The relative composition of the indices  
may vary with each grant to ensure that it 
reflects the Company’s portfolio.
Performance is measured over the four-year 
period from 1 January in the year of grant,  
and is calculated with reference to the EPRA 
Best Practices recommendations. 
EPS (for awards granted from 2013).
The composition of the EPS measure may  
vary with each grant to ensure it reflects the 
Company’s portfolio. From 2015, a blend of  
UK and French CPI will be used, whereas in  
2012 to 2014 RPI was used.
Absolute NAV (for awards granted in 2011  
and 2012). 
Calculated as adjusted shareholders’ funds 
divided by the adjusted number of shares  
in issue. 
Table Fig 61
LTIP PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS
TSR TPR EPS/Absolute NAV
Vesting under the TSR performance  
measure is as follows:
Less than TSR of median-ranked  
entity in comparator group 0%
Equal to TSR of median-ranked  
entity in comparator group 25%
Equal to TSR of upper quartile- 
ranked entity in comparator group 100%
Vesting for intermediate performance 
between median and upper quartile-ranked 
entities is on a linear scale between 25%  
and 100%. For awards made from 2014 
onwards interpolation is between the TSR  
of the median and upper quartile-ranked 
companies on a straight-line basis on 
performance of those positions between 
25% and 100%.
Vesting under the TSR performance measure 
is subject to the Committee’s satisfaction 
that the Company’s underlying performance 
has been satisfactory in comparison with 
that of the FTSE Real Estate sector.
Vesting under the TPR performance 
measure is as follows:
Less than Index 0%
Equal to Index 25%
Index +0.5% (average) p.a. 55%
Index +1.0% (average) p.a. 85%
Index +1.5% (average) p.a. 100%
Vesting for intermediate performance 
between these levels will be pro-rated  
on a straight-line basis between 25%  
and 100%.
Vesting under the EPS performance measure 
for the 2015 awards is as follows:
Less than CPI +3.0% p.a. growth 0%
Equal to CPI +3.0% p.a. growth 25%
Equal to or more than CPI  
+7.0% p.a. growth 100%
Vesting under the EPS performance measure 
for the 2013 and 2014 awards is as follows:
Less than RPI +3.0% p.a. growth 0%
Equal to RPI +3.0% p.a. growth 25%
Equal to or more than RPI  
+7.0% p.a. growth 100%
Vesting under the Absolute NAV performance 
measure for the 2012 award is as follows:
Less than RPI +3.0% p.a. growth 0%
Equal to RPI +3.0% p.a. growth 25%
Equal to or more than RPI  
+7.0% p.a. growth 100%
Vesting under the Absolute NAV performance 
measure for the 2011 award is as follows:
Less than 7.5% p.a. growth 0%
Equal to 7.5% p.a. growth 25%
Equal to or more than  
15.0% p.a. growth 100%

PENSION*
Pension arrangements for the year ended 31 December 2014 are detailed below. All salary supplements paid to Executive Directors as part  
of their pension arrangements are subject to deductions as required for income tax and social security contributions in the UK and France.  
Salary supplements and the pension benefit received by Jean-Philippe Mouton do not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP .  
All benefits accruing under the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (Scheme) and all salary supplements are reflected in the Single Figure 
Remuneration Table (table 52).
Timon Drakesmith
Timon Drakesmith receives a salary supplement of 20% of base salary by way of pension provision. The actual amount paid by the Company  
for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £81,200 (2013: £80,000). 
Jean-Philippe Mouton
Jean-Philippe Mouton receives a salary supplement of €80,000 in lieu of any supplementary pension benefit. In addition, he participates in a 
legacy collective supplementary defined contribution pension scheme operated by his French employing company where the contributions  
are subject to statutory limits. For 2014, the benefit he received under this scheme was €12,105 (2013: €11,939).
David Atkins
David Atkins receives a salary supplement of 30% of base salary by way of pension provision. This was effective from 2 April 2014, when he  
ceased to accrue further benefits in the Scheme.
For the period 1 January 2014 to 1 April 2014, David Atkins received a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits as he elected to restrict the 
value of the pension benefits accrued in the Scheme over the 2013/2014 tax year to the annual allowance defined under pension legislation 
(currently £40,000). The salary supplement was calculated to be equal in value to the pension benefits that David Atkins would otherwise have 
accrued in the Scheme over the period, at a rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year of service.
On ceasing to accrue further benefits in the Scheme, David Atkins became eligible for a deferred pension based on his pensionable salary and 
service at that point. Further details of this are provided below.
The actual salary supplement paid by the Company for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £177,214 (2013: £97,829).
Peter Cole
Peter Cole receives a salary supplement of 30% of base salary by way of pension provision. This was effective from 1 July 2014, when he ceased  
to accrue further benefits in the Scheme.
For the period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2014, Peter Cole accrued benefits in the Scheme at a rate of approximately 1/45th of final salary for  
each year of service.
On ceasing to accrue further benefits in the Scheme, Peter Cole became eligible for a deferred pension based on his pensionable salary and 
service at that point. Further details of this are provided below.
The pension figure disclosed for Peter Cole represents the increase in accrued pension in the Scheme over the year (net of inflation) multiplied  
by a factor of 20, plus a salary supplement of £65,250 in respect of the period 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2014.
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
In 2014, David Atkins and Peter Cole ceased to accrue benefits in the Scheme. Pension entitlements are calculated by reference to base salary.  
The Scheme is non-contributory for members. The normal retirement age under the Scheme is 60; members may draw their pension from age 
55, subject to actuarial reduction and the Trustees’ consent. Further information concerning the Scheme can be found in note 6 to the accounts 
on pages 122 to 124 and the Policy reproduced from page 170. A detailed breakdown of deferred benefits under the Scheme for David Atkins 
and Peter Cole is provided in tables 62, 63 and 64.
82 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Executive Directors’ deferred benefits under the Scheme
In the table below, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2014 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on retirement, 
given the length of pensionable service and salary of each Executive Director at the date each ceased accruing benefits under the Scheme.  
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when 
compared with the position at 31 December 2013. The increase in accrued benefit during the year excluding the effect of inflation is also shown.

Table 63 shows the transfer values calculated in accordance with regulations 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pensions Schemes (Transfer Values) 
Regulations 1996 and subsequent amendments. 
The Listing Rules figures in table 63 represent the transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits during the period to 31 December 2014 
(excluding inflation) for each Director. 
Transfer values of accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider  
on transferring the Scheme’s liability in respect of the Executive Director’s pension benefits. They do not represent sums paid or payable to 
individual Executive Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration. Instead, they represent a potential  
liability of the Scheme. The statutory disclosures are based on required assumptions.

General notes
1.  Face values for the DBSS and LTIP awards made in 2014 have been calculated using the grant price in accordance with the respective plan rules:
 – For the DBSS, the grant price was 576.83 pence, which was the average share price over the three business days immediately preceding the award date; and
 – For the LTIP , the grant price was 555.40 pence, which was the average share price over the five business days immediately preceding the award date.
 – Notional dividend shares accruing are not included in the calculation.
2. Details of the performance measures and conditions for the LTIP can be found on page 81.
3.  The aggregate gain from share awards that vested during 2014 was £1,081,131 (2013: £3,025,252). 
4.  For LTIP awards made to Jean-Philippe Mouton prior to 2014, there is no accrual of notional dividend shares. For French tax reasons, LTIP awards granted to Jean-Philippe 
Mouton are in the form of conditional awards of free shares, not share options.

92 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The objective of the Committee in implementing the Policy during 2015, in line with the Main Principle D.1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, is to ensure that the design of Executive Directors’ remuneration promotes the long-term success of the Company and that performance-
related elements should be transparent, stretching and rigorously applied. The variable pay arrangements reflect the Company’s strategic 
priorities, taking suitable account of risk and corporate social responsibility factors. Variable pay structures include provision for malus and 
claw-back as set out in the Policy, which is reproduced from page 170. 
Implementation of the Policy requires the Committee to continue to take into account remuneration packages available within other comparable 
companies, the Company’s overall performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and experience, 
published views of institutional investors and general market trends and performance. 
Generally, two-thirds of the Executive Directors’ total target remuneration (excluding pension and benefits) is performance related, through the 
annual performance-related bonus plan (AIP) and a long term incentive plan (LTIP). Performance measures associated with remuneration are 
linked to key performance indicators incorporating group financial targets, as set out on page 3 and stretching personal performance objectives.
