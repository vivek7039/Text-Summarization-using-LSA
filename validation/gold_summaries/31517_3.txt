 From the Chairman
04  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Overview 
2017 was another successful year. Our client service results
demonstrated that we continued to deliver for our clients
at one of the most diﬃcult times in their lives and we met
ﬁnancial expectations.
However, our ﬁnancial success was achieved against 
the backdrop of a rapidly changing and increasingly
competitive market and accelerating erosion of our market
share. It is clear that the pace of change and the ﬁerceness
of competition, particularly for our funeral business, will
continue to increase. For this reason, the Board took
decisive action in January 2018 to change our pricing
strategy and market positioning in order to protect market
share and recalibrate the Group for future growth.
This new pricing strategy is to protect market share by
oﬀering a range of new price points and services to our
clients while preserving our unrivalled levels of service. 
We have therefore signiﬁcantly reduced the price of some
funerals and frozen the price of others as part of this
evolving pricing strategy. As we have also stated clearly this
action will have a substantial impact on proﬁts in 2018 and
the new relationship between volumes and margins will
take time to become clear.
The combination of new price points and industry-leading
service levels means that we can now position ourselves 
as the best value service provider in the market. Delivering
excellent client service remains a key strategic priority. 
Our strong investment over the years means that we are
well positioned to provide the best quality service at each
price point and market segment we choose to compete in.
At the same time, the Group has embarked on a rigorous
review to ensure that our funeral operations are organised
to run more eﬃciently and eﬀectively in the light of this
change of pricing strategy and market positioning.
In meeting the challenges ahead, we will continue to build
on the strong strategic initiatives we developed in 2017, 
in particular, our digital marketing and brand strategies.
There are signiﬁcant opportunities to lead the industry 
in digital marketing and to leverage the Group’s scale 
to develop national recognition online to complement 
our existing physical national network. Dignity will also
continue to lead calls for greater regulation of the funeral
sector while continuing to set the standard for what
constitutes best practice in the industry.
Dividends
The Board is proposing to maintain the ﬁnal dividend at
15.74 pence per Ordinary Share bringing the total dividend
for the year to 24.38 pence, an increase of three per cent
on the previous year. If shareholders approve this payment
at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 7 June 2018, then
it will be paid on 29 June 2018 to members on the register
at close of business on 18 May 2018. 
Board change
In March 2017, Mary McNamara was appointed to the
Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and has
been Chair of the Remuneration Committee since the
beginning of 2018. In June 2017 we announced that our
It is clear that the pace of change and the
ﬁerceness of competition, particularly for our
funeral business, will continue to increase. 
For this reason, the Board took decisive action
in January 2018 to change our pricing strategy
and market positioning in order to protect
market share and recalibrate the Group for
future growth.

long-serving Operations Director, Andrew Davies would
retire in April 2018. He stepped down from the Board in
January 2018. His successor was appointed from within 
the Company and will not be a Main Board appointment.
On behalf of our shareholders and my Board colleagues 
I want to thank Andrew for his magniﬁcent service to the
Group and wish him a long and happy retirement.  
Alan McWalter retired in January 2018 having completed
nine years as an independent Non-Executive Director. 
In order to maintain a balanced Board he will not be
replaced as Andrew Davies’ replacement will not be a 
Main Board Director. Alan has provided wise counsel to the
Board during his time as a director. Whilst Alan is stepping
down as a director, given the challenges facing our funeral
business and his industry knowledge, I am delighted that
he has agreed to remain as a consultant to the Board until
the end of July 2018. 
Directors’ remuneration
The Group’s 2017 ﬁnancial performance was suﬃciently
strong to justify an award to Executive Directors of 95 per
cent of the maximum amount possible of their annual
bonus opportunity. However, in light of the signiﬁcant
reduction in ﬁnancial expectations for 2018 following the
trading update in January 2018, the current Executive
Directors have decided to voluntarily waive their
entitlement in full.
In addition, no Board member will receive an increase in
basic salary or fees in 2018.
Our people and culture
We are truly a people business because we help people 
at an extremely diﬃcult time in their lives. Meeting their
needs means that our employees must be caring,
thoughtful and truly engaged with those they serve.  
I want to thank all Dignity staﬀ for the continued care and
commitment they show their clients, demonstrating what 
I like to think of as ‘The Dignity Way’. This describes a
special culture and way of working that means delivering
the highest standards of service and going the extra mile.
Thank you once again for making this company what it is
and for your continued support in meeting the challenges
that the Group faces. 
Outlook for 2018 and beyond
The business model for the Group’s funeral business is
changing as the Board focuses on protecting market share
by introducing new service oﬀerings and price points. 
As indicated in January, the Board believes that whilst the
combination of action being taken will lead to substantially
lower proﬁts in 2018, it should create a new platform to
allow many years of further stable growth.
The Oﬃce for National Statistics anticipates approximately
580,000 deaths in 2018, a small decrease of 10,000 on the
actual deaths in 2017. However, the number of deaths in
the ﬁrst two months of 2018 are approximately seven per
cent higher than the prior year.
Committed to the highest standards 
of governance
Good governance is the basis on which we as a business
can build an environment of trust, transparency and
accountability. It also diﬀerentiates us from many
competitors in what is still, regrettably, an unregulated
industry. As such it provides assurance and conﬁdence
to our clients and fosters long-term investment,
ﬁnancial stability and business integrity. As a Board 
we are therefore committed to maintaining our high
standards of corporate governance and ensuring there
is a high level of cultural integrity embedded within the
way we operate.
Board priorities
The Board provides strategic leadership to the Group
within a framework of robust corporate governance and
internal control, setting values and standards that are
embedded throughout the business to deliver long-term
sustainable growth for the beneﬁt of our shareholders
and other stakeholders.
Compliance
Our governance framework, which is shaped by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act
2006 and secondary legislation and Financial Conduct
Authority rules and guidance, sets out standards of 
good practice in relation to Board leadership and
eﬀectiveness, remuneration, accountability and 
relations with shareholders.
