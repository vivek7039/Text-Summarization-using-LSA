I am pleased to be able to report on considerable progress made by your company during the last year. 
Overview 
During 2017, revenue more than doubled. We further extended and developed our UK distribution capability, 
expanded our direct to market sales and successfully established a technology and distribution relationship with 
Apple. Post year end we also completed our largest fundraising to date, which saw us add two major institutional 
investors to the shareholder list.  
We have built on the progress of the previous year with more market awareness, distribution led sales and through 
ensuring Lightwave products and technology continue to develop. In addition, we have developed our direct sales 
capability, supported by a dedicated customer services function. The smart home market is now becoming more 
clearly defined, which is helping Lightwave better communicate its proposition and capability.  
Offering access to the Lightwave platform either directly or through Amazon, Apple and Google as well as the growth 
of voice control, opens up many opportunities for the business. The broad challenge as ever will be to ensure we 
prioritise our strategic goals so that we bridge the gap between short term achievements and the long-term ambition 
to build a scaled business in the smart home sector.  
We are continuing to strengthen our management and technology capability. As well as welcoming new chief 
executive, Andrew Pearson, to the board in March, we have broadened our teams’ skill sets with the addition of new 
staff. This is all directed to putting solid building blocks in place for the much larger business we aim to create. I would 
like to take the opportunity to thank our staff, our suppliers and subcontractors for the effort they have applied during 
the year to achieve a further step change for the business.  
Financials 
Revenue for the 2017 financial year was £3.03 million, more than double last year (2016: £1.44 million). Gross margins 
further improved to 35.5% (2016: 32.5%) benefiting from the growth of direct sales. Administrative expenses were up 
to £2.12 million (2016: £1.49 million) as we spent more on marketing, research and development. Capitalised 
development expenditure was £0.69 million (2016: £0.51 million) in accordance with IAS38, reflecting the 
commitment to the development of our Generation 2 technology and devices. The loss before and after tax was £0.85 
million (2016: £0.84 million).  
Our balance sheet has now been considerably strengthened through our post financial year end fundraising, giving a 
strong and stable foundation upon which to develop our business. The pro-forma group statement of equity after this 
fundraising is as follows:

Outlook 
Completing a two-year long process of technology development which has met the exacting criteria of Apple and 
other major companies has been a major achievement for a small company. We now have the funds in place to further 
strengthen our management capability, marketing and sales as well as continuing to ensure our technology remains 
at the forefront of the smart home revolution. 
We very much look forward to upping the pace of our progress through 2018.
