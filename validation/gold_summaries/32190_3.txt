Trading and Financial Performance
Following our successful admission to the 
London Stock Exchange in May 2016, our 
trading and financial performance in the 
weeks around the UK Referendum on EU 
membership and in the months that followed 
was undoubtedly disappointing and 
affected the whole year’s performance. 
Whilst there are always lessons to be 
learned, I believe that management made 
appropriate decisions in this period of 
uncertainty and reduced demand. The 
impact of these external factors was also 
exacerbated by our accelerated site 
opening programme, which, although it 
bodes well for long term value creation,  
did stretch management resources,  
an issue which we have addressed.
The second half of the financial year was 
much more promising, and there were  
some notable achievements during the  
year, including the opening of our 10th and 
11th sites, and securing a site for our 12th 
business which opened in Sheffield in late 
April 2017. Our management team has  
been strengthened and broadened.
Our Market
We have seen the market continue  
to grow this year, a demand that we  
are ideally positioned to deliver. The 
franchised dealer groups have stated  
their ambition to grow their used car 
revenue as the outlook for the new car 
market loses momentum. But our business 
model is built on a unique customer 
proposition based on Choice, Value and 
Service, a commitment to getting a highly 
engaged team and the flexibility that 
independence from the manufacturers 
gives. We will continue to prove our ability  
to win the admiration and loyalty of our 
customers and take market share.
Dividend 
I am pleased to announce that the Directors 
have recommended a final dividend of  
2.90 pence per share, which would give  
a total for the year of 4.23 pence per share. 
This represents dividend cover of 3 times  
of adjusted EPS.

Your Board 
I am delighted to be working with our 
independent non-executives with each of 
Mary McNamara, Gordon Hurst and Steve 
Weller joining on our flotation in May 2016. 
They bring a wealth of experience and 
independence, and already the Board is 
working very effectively. I look forward to 
their support over the years ahead.
David Shelton, co-founder of Motorpoint  
and an Executive Director, will be making  
a phased shift from being executive to 
non-executive over the next nine months. 
We are glad to be able to retain David’s 
passion, experience and knowledge of the 
motor industry within Motorpoint.
Reaching our first year end as a public 
company I am proud to have overseen the 
smooth transition from private ownership. 
This year we have invested significant time in 
building our governance structure, including 
developing our risk appetite and setting this 
in context of our long term strategy.
The Year Ahead
Everyone at Motorpoint knows that to stay 
ahead we need deliver better, faster and 
more simply for our customers. There 
remain dampening external factors on 
consumer confidence in the UK, but if we 
pursue with relentless energy our core 
retail proposition of Choice, Value and 
Service we will continue to grow market 
share: through our like for like estate, our 
leading online offer and our new sites as 
they mature.
