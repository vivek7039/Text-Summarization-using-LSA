*  The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’) which are non-IFRS measures to monitor the performance of its operations  
and of the Group as a whole. These APMs along with their definitions and reconciliations to IFRS measures are provided in the APMs section  
on pages 176 to 179. 
Certain statements made in this Annual Report are forward-looking. These represent expectations for the Group’s business, and involve risks and uncertainties. The Group has based these forward-looking 
statements on current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as ‘will’, ‘anticipates’, ‘should’, 
‘expects’, ‘is expected to’, ‘estimates’, ‘believes’, ‘intends’ or similar expressions. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future and reflect the Group’s current 
expectations and assumptions as to such future events and circumstances that may not prove accurate. A number of material factors could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from  
those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Annual 
Report. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements other than as required by law.
