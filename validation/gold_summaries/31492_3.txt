 04 Belvoir Lettings plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that the Belvoir Group has made significant 
progress, increasing profitability by over 60%, in a year that has 
been a testing one for some companies in the property sector.
Performance
Total revenue of £11.3m was underpinned by increases in both MSF 
from lettings and sales of 23% and 21% respectively, with organic 
growth being enhanced by growth from acquisitions and increased 
take-up of property sales by both the Belvoir and Northwood 
networks. This is a testament to the resilience of the business 
format franchising model and the responsiveness of this model to 
changing markets. In the face of uncertainty from the introduction 
of new regulations, our franchisees have risen to the challenge with 
many seeing growth through portfolio acquisition opportunities at a 
local level and pursuing new revenue streams, such as property sales 
and financial services, as a means to securing their long-term future. 
Strategy
The Board of Belvoir identified financial services as a potential 
growth area for the Group, and in July 2017 acquired Brook 
as an excellent vehicle for maximising our return from individual 
property transactions through the sale of specialist mortgage 
and property-related financial services. I would like to take this 
opportunity to welcome Michelle Brook and her team to the 
Belvoir Group. Brook is already working closely with all 39 Newton 
Fallowell offices and, with 25 Belvoir and six Northwood offices 
already on board, I have every confidence in their ability to roll out 
their financial services offering across the other Group networks.
At the Group level, we continue in our aim to extend our share of 
the UK property market by leveraging our expertise as a franchisor, 
as we see a genuine benefit to all stakeholders from further 
consolidation within the sector. We firmly believe that Belvoir is 
best placed to take advantage of consolidation at both the franchisee 
and franchisor level. Furthermore, the Board is committed to 
broadening the range of property services offered by our franchisees, 
building on their reputation for delivering a highly professional 
lettings and estate agency service throughout the customer 
property journey.
Experienced management team 
delivering significant progress
2017 marked 21 years of uninterrupted 
profit growth for the Belvoir Group.
Senior management
As Chairman, I am especially pleased with the strength and depth of 
our senior team, from the main Board Directors to the management 
teams of our various trading subsidiaries, Belvoir, Northwood, 
Newton Fallowell and Brook, all of whom are long serving and 
very capable. These dedicated teams have been instrumental in 
doubling the number and value of transactions under the Assisted 
Acquisitions programme, successfully integrating the Northwood 
network to deliver a 58% increase in its EBITDA within 19 months, 
and starting the process of cross-selling financial services to the whole 
Group through Brook. In addition we have recently completed our 
planned programme to franchise all but the two original Grantham-
based Belvoir and Newton Fallowell corporate offices, enabling us 
to focus entirely on the further development of our franchise model. 
Growth
Our headline figures reflect how successfully the Belvoir Group 
has performed in 2017. Revenue increased by 14% to £11.3m 
(2016: £9.9m), operating profit of £3.9m (2016: £2.5m) is an increase 
of 56%, profit before tax of £3.9m (2016: £2.4m) is up 62%, and there 
has been a 28% improvement in the adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) to 11.3p (2016: 8.8p). These figures reflect a full year of 
Northwood and a part-year contribution from Brook but nevertheless 
they are significant and have encouraged us to increase our dividend 
to 6.9p per share, showing our confidence in the strength of the 
Group to continue to deliver on its growth strategy.
Board changes
Finally, we say farewell to Nicholas Leeming as a Non-Executive 
Director and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Nicholas has been with us for over five years, having joined just 
after Belvoir floated on AIM, and in that time he has brought a wealth 
of experience and wisdom to the Board. I would like to thank him 
for his valuable contribution and wish him the very best for the future. 
At the same time we welcome Michael Stoop to the Board. Michael 
has over 40 years’ experience of the franchise property market, 
having held the role of group managing director initially at Winkworth, 
then at Legal and General’s estate agency network, Xperience, 
where he was instrumental in converting the corporate-owned 
offices into a wholly franchised network of 95 offices, and most 
recently at the Property Franchise Group plc until he stood down 
in 2016. I am confident that with his background and experience 
Michael will make a valuable contribution to the Group’s strategy.
Mike Goddard
Chairman
“ Looking to the future I have every confidence 
in the success of our franchise business model 
which, having flourished historically in all phases 
of the property market, can and will adapt to 
the current changing market conditions.”
