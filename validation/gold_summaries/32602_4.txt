ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
2 Saga aims to deliver consistent long-term earnings 
growth with the right balance between investing  
for growth, paying down debt and returns  
to shareholders via dividends
How we are different
Saga focuses on the over 50s, the 
fastest growing demographic in the 
UK. This demographic tends to be 
wealthier and more resilient during 
times of economic uncertainty. Our 
customer insight allows us to gain 
unique insight into the traits of  
our target demographic, helping us  
to develop products and services  
that we know will be valuable to our 
customers. We operate across sectors 
which provide services that people  
need. This means that demand for  
our products and services remains 
consistent amongst a customer  
base that predominantly spends  
unearned income.
The model works
The Group has an excellent track 
record of delivering consistent earnings 
growth. The capital efficiency of the 
model means that we are highly cash 
generative. This enables us to invest for 
future growth, whilst continuing to pay 
down debt and enhance long-term 
returns to shareholders through our 
progressive dividend policy. 
Confidence in future delivery
Our existing strategy is robust. The 
in-depth work we have undertaken  
to deepen our understanding of our 
customers has provided the logical  
next step in the evolution of our model. 
We are now in a position to use our 
enhanced insight and data capability 
through a membership structure to 
become a more efficient organisation, 
ensuring that we:
• retain and deepen our customer 
relationships;
• increase new customer targeting; and
• generate increased profits at lower 
risk, with lower capital.
This strategic evolution increases our 
confidence in our ability to generate 
consistent long-term earnings growth 
on a sustainable basis.
Saga as an investment
Why invest in us?
...to deliver profit and dividend  
growth, strong cash generation  
and sustainable shareholder return.
