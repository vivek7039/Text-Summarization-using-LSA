 2018 has been another year 
of progress with the Group 
performing in line with the 
Board’s expectations.
Overview
The demand for our products has again 
been strongly supported by good activity 
levels across the UK new housebuilding 
market. Market-wide demand has been 
such that our customers have on occasion 
faced extended waiting times for some of 
our products, especially soft mud bricks 
and roof tiles. This reduced availability 
underpins the Group’s strategy to increase 
capacity and highlights the importance of 
the Board’s decisions to invest in our new 
soft mud brick factory in Leicestershire 
and roof tile line in Leighton Buzzard. 
The Board is responsible for the 
governance of the Group, and we 
recognise its crucial role in helping Ibstock 
deliver our long–term success. I should 
draw your attention to my Corporate 
Governance statement on page 44, 
which summarises our progress in this 
area during 2017 when we achieved 
compliance for the full year with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. However, 
I am conscious of the ever evolving 
regulations and guidance surrounding 
corporate governance, and so we have 
sought to enhance our disclosures 
within the Strategic Report in light of 
these changes. 
Board changes
As a Board we have consistently focused 
on succession planning as one of our 
most important activities.
In October 2017 , we announced that 
Wayne Sheppard, Group CEO, had 
notified the Board of his intention to retire 
in 2018 and that Joe Hudson would join 
the Board as CEO designate in early 2018. 
Wayne has been instrumental in Ibstock’s 
success. As CEO, he has led the Group 
through a successful IPO and delivered 
strong growth. I wish him well in his 
retirement and on behalf of the Board 
and the shareholders I thank him for his 
efforts and significant achievements.
I am absolutely delighted that we have 
managed to secure the appointment of 
someone of Joe’s calibre and experience. 
His track record of performance at 
Aggregate Industries and Lafarge Holcim 
has been outstanding and we look forward 
to him leading Ibstock through the next 
stage of its development.
In addition to the CEO change, the 
composition of our Non-Executive 
Directors also altered during 2017 .
As reported in last year’s Annual Report 
and Accounts, Justin Read joined our 
Board as an independent Non-Executive 
Director from 1 January 2017 . Since his 
appointment, Justin has provided a wealth 
of experience that has been of great 
benefit to Ibstock as we continue to 
develop our business. 
Matthias Boyer Chammard and Michel 
Plantevin, who were representatives of 
Bain Capital Europe, resigned from the 
Board in May 2017 and did not seek 
reappointment at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. I wish to thank both Michel and 
Matthias for the constructive and thoughtful 
contribution they have made to the Board 
and the Company during our time as 
a listed company.
In December 2017 , Lynn Minella who has 
been an independent Non-Executive 
Director since February 2016, resigned 
from the Board following her relocation to 
the United States. As well as being Chair 
of our Remuneration Committee, Lynn has 
served as a member of our Audit and 
Nomination Committees. I wish to thank 
her for the contribution she has made to the 
Group since the time of her appointment 
and wish her every success in her new 
role. Lynn will be succeeded as Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee by Tracey 
Graham, an experienced Chair of such 
committees, and who has served on the 
Group’s Remuneration Committee since 
February 2016.
As recently announced, I will be stepping 
down as Chairman at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting in May 2018. 
I have greatly enjoyed my time guiding the 
Group in its first years as a listed business. 
However, following my appointment as 
Chairman of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc, 
and in the interests of good corporate 
governance, I have taken the difficult 
decision to step down from the Board of 
Ibstock plc. Following the conclusion of 
our Annual General Meeting, our Senior 
Independent Director Jonathan Nicholls, 
will be appointed Chairman of the Board. 
Tracey Graham will be appointed as the 
Senior Independent Director. In addition 
to her current role as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and Justin 
Read will be appointed Chair of the 
Audit Committee.
Shareholder returns and dividends
We paid our interim dividend on 
22 September 2017 of 2.6 pence per 
ordinary share and propose to pay a final 
dividend in respect of 2017 of 6.5 pence 
per share, making a total dividend of 
9.1 pence. The Board proposes to pay 
our final 2017 dividend payment on 8 June 
2018 to shareholders on the register on 
11 May 2018. During 2017 , we clarified our 
dividend payment policy such that our 
interim dividend equated to one-third of 
the full year dividend for the prior year. 
The Board believes that this clarification 
provides greater certainty to shareholders. 
The Board has also determined a 
supplementary dividend policy as part of 
the Group’s wider capital allocation policy. 
This is discussed in more detail within the 
Financial Review on page 40.
Colleagues
Employees are our greatest asset and the 
progress made during the year has only 
been possible due to their effort and 
dedication. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all our employees for 
their contribution.
