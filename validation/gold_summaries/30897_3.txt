Board of directors and Governance 
At the end of 2016, we welcomed Richard Petti 
to the Board as the new Chief Executive Officer. I’m 
delighted that he has stepped into the role successfully, 
enabling me to resume my non-Executive Chairman 
role in August 2017. Richard has led the business, 
clarifying the positioning and strategy of the company’s 
two product portfolios, focusing and training the sales 
force whilst we continue to build the sales capacity. 
The structure of the Board and individual responsibilities 
remain unchanged from last year. We ensure that 
the Company adopts proper standards of corporate 
governance and that the principles of best practice 
as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
are followed where reasonably practicable. The 
Board continually reviews its composition and that 
of its committees and feels that, at this stage of the 
Group’s development, the skills and mix of its 
members best serves our current needs.
Group strategy 
In October 2017 we led a successful £5.5 million 
fundraise with new and existing shareholders, to 
allow us to capitalise on our strategy and accelerate 
our go-to-market and development activity. 
Driving value from 
our own products 
We've refocused our sales effort and development towards the two 
enterprise location intelligence software platforms – Real-Time Location 
System (RTLS) SmartSpace and Geospatial myWorld. 
Results overview 
2017 results continued to demonstrate that Ubisense 
has excellent products which deliver measurable 
benefits for customers as they strive for productivity 
improvements. In total, Ubisense has delivered 28% 
revenue growth for the company’s own products, 
RTLS SmartSpace and Geospatial myWorld, offsetting 
the planned decline in Geospatial revenues associated 
with third party products. We have continued to see 
growth in our own software revenues, which remains 
of key importance to us as we drive growth in new 
and recurring revenues.
The RTLS SmartSpace agreement with Lockheed 
Martin for the F35 program highlighted the productivity 
gains that industrial customers need to make, with 
integration of location information a key success-enabling 
factor. The strength of our technology alongside a 
flexible, highly scalable software platform that can 
integrate multiple location technologies were key 
factors in this aerospace win. A win in the satellite 
and space sector highlights the further opportunities 
that exist in high-tech manufacturing. 
Our Geospatial myWorld customers are now exploiting 
the flexibility of the platform to create new use cases 
liberating geospatial information across their 
organisation, integrating with other platforms and 
driving productivity improvements. For Ubisense, 
this drives sales of additional licences, further 
services engagements and involvement in 
customers’ longer term IT strategy.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Enabling our customers to 
create digital twins of their 
physical environments is 
helping companies worldwide 
to improve their profitability 
and meet the most stringent 
quality control requirements. ”
“
Some of the customer productivity improvement 
opportunities based on Ubisense software 
platforms include:
RTLS SmartSpace: substantial investment in Industry 
4.0 / Smart Factory / Industrial Internet of Things (IIo T) 
in industry with automation of non-linear processes 
using location information.
Geospatial myWorld: communications and utility 
operators spending billions of dollars upgrading 
their networks, needing to optimise the workflow 
across their organisation with accurate real-time 
geographically-based information. 
For the Geospatial business, we will continue to 
leverage the highly specialist skills that we have in 
the team, focusing on increasing the volume of 
myWorld activity. In line with our strategy to reduce 
third party Geospatial consulting services, agreement 
was reached in March 2018 to dispose of that part 
of the Japanese business effective 30 March 2018. 
To strengthen sales of our own products we have 
recruited strong new sales leadership in Japan and 
are making good progress on sales of myWorld and 
SmartSpace with our Japanese and Thai partners. 
Corporate social responsibility 
We are committed to corporate social responsibility 
that is tangible, practical and fits with the ethos of the 
business; this ensures that it is supported globally. 
During 2017 we continued our charity day program, 
allowing employees to take time off to support 
their charity of choice as well as organising local 
fundraising events. We continue to collaborate with 
local and national organisations to engage interns, 
industrial placements, apprenticeships and mentoring 
schemes, as well as being active members of local 
networks and clubs. 
Current trading and outlook
The market opportunity for the Group is excellent for 
both divisions, with software-led strategies targeting 
productivity-enhancing opportunities in industry sectors 
that are growing and investing heavily in digitisation. 
By enabling our customers to create digital twins of 
their physical environments, we are helping companies 
worldwide to improve their profitability and meet the 
most stringent quality control requirements.
Trading in the first two months of 2018 has been in 
line with our expectations and we intend to build on 
our strengths through continued focus on developing 
and commercialising our software portfolio. We have 
improved the sales and go-to-market skills of the 
organisation and intend to further accelerate the 
momentum of sales of our own products through 
both divisions, which will ultimately drive improved 
gross margin and profitability.
We expect that the run-off of legacy third party services 
revenues will largely complete over the course of 2018, 
following which our results should better reflect the 
growth we are targeting in our own products, and as 
the proportion of third party services revenue in our mix 
declines, our gross margin will also naturally increase.
The growing success of our products, our stronger 
pipeline and discussions with customers lead us to be 
very excited about the prospects for our myWorld and 
RTLS SmartSpace products.
Our success is thanks to our people; we have a great 
team who have not only made this growth possible but 
are well positioned to take the business forwards.
I would like to thank our shareholders - old and new - 
for their continued support and our employees for their 
commitment in delivering success across both divisions.
