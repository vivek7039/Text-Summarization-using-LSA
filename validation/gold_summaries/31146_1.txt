Chief Executive’s Review
Patrick Coveney
Securing profitable 
growth and returns
This year has been about  
setting the Group up for  
profitable growth and returns  
in a dynamic marketplace. 11 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
Q: 
IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR,  
YOU ANNOUNCED THE BOARD’S 
INTENTION TO ACQUIRE PEACOCK 
FOODS. YOU ARE NEARLY A YEAR INTO 
YOUR OWNERSHIP – HOW HAS PEACOCK 
FOODS INTEGRATED INTO THE GROUP?
Our acquisition of Peacock Foods in December 
2016 was both the largest transaction and  
the most transformational portfolio and 
organisational change in Greencore’s history. 
Our US business has now increased to more 
than four times its original size and we are, 
more than ever, an international convenience 
food leader. Of course, with the acquisition,  
we have also welcomed 3,000 new colleagues 
into our Group. 
The onboarding, integration, and development 
of Peacock Foods is going well. There is ‘much 
to do’ but we are excited by what the new 
business brings in every respect. We are 
learning a lot too. Having visited our new sites, 
met with many new colleagues, and engaged 
extensively with the Peacock Foods’ original 
customers, I am struck by how aligned we are 
culturally – a strong theme which has been 
evident since our first interactions with the 
Peacock Foods leadership team. In terms of 
culture, people, commercial relationships, 
strategy and momentum we have a platform 
now to deliver our US strategy and Group vision. 
Q: 
YOU RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A SET 
OF ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES  
IN THE UK? WHAT IS THE REASONING 
BEHIND THEM AND WHAT BENEFITS WILL 
THE NEW APPROACH BRING? 
While we have driven exceptional results in the 
UK for much of the past decade, we are very 
conscious of the challenges we continue to 
face in the UK – from the market in general 
and with our customers’ business models 
being under pressure. We must now look to 
the future, confronting these challenges as  
we build an even better business for the next 
decade. A different operating model with 
stronger capabilities is required to improve 
Cost Efficiency and to rebuild returns. 
To do this, we have put in place a 
comprehensive structural, organisational and 
efficiency programme – actually a renewed 
focus on The Greencore Way, to enable the 
Group to deliver more effectively against its 
strategy and win in the future. We will do this  
by adopting a new approach to operations  
and major projects, creating a refreshed two 
divisional UK structure, having greater functional 
centralisation, injecting new capabilities into the 
business to support our strategy, standardising 
our processes, and reducing overheads across 
the business. We plan to have the following 
changes in place in early 2018: 
• Our UK business will operate under a two 
divisional structure. Our former Prepared 
Meals divisions and parts of our former 
Grocery division will form a new division, 
called UK Convenience Foods, which will 
operate alongside Food to Go. This will 
enable us to serve our customers better 
and operate more consistently as one  
UK business. 
• We will create a more consistent and 
efficient approach to the delivery of  
UK functions: Finance, HR, Technical, 
Purchasing and IT and create three new 
central UK capabilities: Operational 
Excellence, Strategy & Development  
and Major Projects. 
• We will create a new, wider UK senior 
leadership team, comprising both divisional 
and functional leaders to embed and 
operate this new approach. 
• We expect these changes to be better  
for our people as they will provide greater 
scope to drive performance, more focus  
on what really matters, leaner and simpler 
structures, bigger roles, and better ways  
of working together.
Q: 
OVERALL, DO YOU THINK THE 
GREENCORE WAY IS WORKING 
ACROSS THE WHOLE GROUP? IS IT BEING 
EMBEDDED EFFECTIVELY THROUGHOUT 
THE NEWLY ADDED SITES? 
We have never sought to create or impose a 
culture from scratch; our approach is grounded 
in who we are and what we value. A central 
feature of The Greencore Way approach is  
that so many of our colleagues recognise  
much of their organisation, their team, their 
way of doing things, and indeed themselves  
in it. It is who we are! 
Onto these strong cultural foundations, we 
have now layered our new UK organisational 
model, our integration of the former Peacock 
Foods’ sites, and a ‘whole Group’ view on 
processes and implementation. We are 
excited by the possibilities that this ‘one 
Group view’ brings. 
Patrick Coveney was appointed  
Group Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’)  
in March 2008, having joined the  
Group in September 2005 as Chief 
Financial Officer. 
Greencore has undergone a sustained 
period of strategic, directional and 
operational change since Patrick took 
over the role of CEO, most recently in 
terms of its people agenda, geographic 
strategy and its increased capabilities. 
FY17 has seen a step-change in 
Greencore’s US strategy and organisation 
which has presented many challenges  
to overcome. It has been a transitional, 
transformative and challenging year  
for the Group in every respect; in terms 
of Greencore’s performance, strategy, 
commercial relationships, culture, 
organisational structure and leadership. 
Now in his tenth year as CEO, Patrick 
talks about some of these changes, 
challenges and opportunities.  12 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT – OUR STRATEGY
Through all of it, our core Greencore Way 
principles remain the same: 
• People at the Core
• Great Food
• Business Effectiveness
• Cost Efficiency
In the last year, we have delivered the most 
ambitious strategic, commercial, new capacity, 
and capability-building programme in  
our history. The level of change has been 
extensive and FY17 has not been without its 
challenges. However, throughout, our people 
and our Great Food have stood out and have 
remained at the heart of all that we do; it is  
our people, our food and our culture that 
underpins who and what Greencore really is. 
The Greencore Way has been a rallying point  
for our leadership approach and integration 
delivery in the US. Our approaches to people, 
culture, food and efficiency are as strong and 
consistent in the US as they are in the rest of 
Greencore. We held two extended Board 
meetings in the US – visiting Chicago, Anaheim 
and Seattle, where the senior US team engaged 
strongly with our full Board on all strategic, 
integration, operating, people, and 
performance matters – using The Greencore 
Way as a roadmap. Our US team have visited 
their colleagues in the UK to see The Greencore 
Way in action (bringing US customers in several 
instances). They have been energised by these 
engagements – taking ‘lessons learned’ back  
to their own teams. Importantly, our UK and  
US operations leadership teams are working 
together to build a single Group-wide approach 
to manufacturing and production excellence.
Q: 
CONSUMER AND CUSTOMER 
SENTIMENT ACROSS THE WORLD 
CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILE. WHAT 
TRENDS HAVE YOU SEEN IN 2017  
AND HOW ARE THEY IMPACTING  
THE BUSINESS?
Across our Group, each of our markets has 
seen significant political and marketplace 
changes in the last number of years – this has 
accelerated in the last 12 months. Despite 
these shifts, our business has continued to 
grow strongly in FY17. 
We are a customer-centric business – it is 
through the supply chains, store networks,  
and brands of our customers that we meet 
consumers’ needs for convenient, high-quality, 
great tasting food. As consumer preferences 
and tastes have evolved and fragmented,  
so too the routes to market and consumer 
engagement models have changed. 
Our customers are responding to consumer 
changes by driving new formats and ranges  
in partnership with us and other strategic 
suppliers. Meeting the needs of ‘on the go’ 
consumers remains central to our strategy.  
In this part of the food market, traditional 
definitions of channels have blurred. For 
example, if you leave the office for lunch in 
Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, or London, or in 
Chicago, Washington, Boston or Seattle, you 
don’t confine your choice to supermarkets, 
quick service restaurants (‘QSRs’) or coffee 
shops. You consider the full set – all channels, 
all formats and all brands. You then make  
your choice based on some combination of 
location, brand, value, taste and service. Our 
strategy, customer relationships and business 
model sets us up well to ensure that we have 
Great Food available at whatever point of 
purchase customers demand. 
Of course, we recognise the changes in the 
political and consumer environments of the 
UK and the US during FY17. Given the scale  
of our UK business, our management team  
is actively engaged in understanding, 
influencing and planning for different Brexit 
scenarios. More broadly, we take consumer, 
customer and regulatory risk seriously and 
have plans in place at all levels to manage 
these risks. 
Q: 
THE STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN 
UNDER PRESSURE THIS YEAR. HAS 
IT IMPACTED ON YOUR CONFIDENCE 
AND THAT OF THE BOARD IN THE 
STRATEGY OF GREENCORE? 
Clearly, I am not happy with the performance 
of our stock price this year. While rights issues 
and large strategic acquisitions can often 
contribute to stock price volatility, I have been 
disappointed with the performance since then 
– I say this both as CEO and as a shareholder! 
However, all of us – our Board, our leadership 
teams, me – are committed to building a better 
and stronger business for the long term. 
Chief Executive’s Review  
continued
FY17 has very much been a transitional year. 
There have of course been challenges during 
this transition – understandable questions 
regarding our strategy, the level of investment 
and restructuring, and a sense of chasing  
hard for performance in some of the smaller 
parts of our portfolio. Undoubtedly these 
challenges will have impacted stakeholder 
confidence and sentiment towards our stock. 
Importantly though, they have not dented our 
Board’s confidence, optimism and excitement 
for the future. It is crystal clear to me that our 
business is in better shape today in every 
respect than it has ever been. We have large 
scale, fast-growing, well invested convenience 
foods businesses in both the UK and the US;  
a set of robust, deeply embedded long-term 
customer relationships; enhanced capability, 
management teams and culture; and an 
economic model that will drive profitability, 
cashflows and returns going forward. I am 
confident the full delivery of this agenda 
should generate value for shareholders in  
the years ahead.
In closing, I would like to say that I am 
immensely proud of our Greencore colleagues 
and it is a pleasure to work with them during 
this challenging but exciting time in our 
evolution. In addition, I wanted to specifically 
thank my Board and the other senior leaders 
for the counsel, insight, skill and commitment 
that they bring to our Group. I also want to 
thank our customers and shareholders for their 
continued support as we strive to make our 
business better. 
It is a privilege to lead this organisation –  
and fun too! We are committed to making 
Greencore better in every respect. I look 
forward to helping Greencore deliver 
industry-leading performance over the 
coming years.
