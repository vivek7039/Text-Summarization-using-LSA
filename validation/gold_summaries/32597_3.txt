Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
On behalf of the Board I am very  
pleased to report excellent progress in 
pursuit of our ambition to become a 
leading global retailer of musical 
instruments and equipment.
When writing this statement last year,  
our revenue growth expectation for the 
year ahead was 37%, and the 58% growth 
we actually achieved reflects the huge 
effort made by our staff right across the 
business, from the Board of Directors 
and senior management, through to our 
customer service and warehouse teams.
International growth of 124% has been 
particularly pleasing, and this is an area  
in which we will continue to invest 
significant effort and resource to improve 
and increase our global reach, building 
on the early success of our recently 
launched Swedish and German 
distribution operations.
Notwithstanding the investment 
necessary for our next phase of 
expansion, the Board remains focused 
on delivering profitable growth, and  
as such is pleased to announce an 
operating profit of £2.6m which is a 
£1.7m (+192%) improvement on FY16’s 
underlying operating profit (adjusted  
to remove one-off IPO costs). This 
translates into net profit of £2.3m  
and earnings per share of 11.5 pence.
In many ways, this has been a 
transformational year for the business, 
and to effectively manage further  
growth and operational complexities  
the Group formed an Operational  
Board on 1 March 2017 to support and 
complement the plc Board, comprising  
a wide breadth and depth of operational 
and commercial experience.
To ensure we remain positioned for 
further growth, the Group requires 
additional head office capacity, and  
the Board is delighted to announce a 
property acquisition that provides an 
excellent long-term solution to our 
growth needs in our home city of York.
In 2012, private equity firm Key Capital 
Partners invested into the business,  
and in October 2016 sold its final 
shareholding. On behalf of the Board  
I would like to thank them and Peter 
Armitage, who represented Key Capital 
on our Board, for their efforts and 
support over the last four years. I’m also 
delighted to welcome new institutions 
and individuals onto our share register as 
we embark on the next chapter in the 
Gear4music growth story.
Given the investments scheduled for  
the current year to support continued 
growth, the Board has decided not to 
declare a dividend for FY17, but will again 
review its dividend policy in the next 
financial year.
Finally, I would like to again express my 
sincere thanks and appreciation to the 
extended Gear4music team for their 
commitment and hard work. It is their 
passion and knowledge that provides 
such a strong proposition for our 
customers and has helped to make our 
second year as a public company such  
a success.
