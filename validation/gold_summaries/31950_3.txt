STRATEGIC REPORT
2 Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Strategy for success
Diurnal aims to develop and commercialise products to address 
unmet patient needs in chronic endocrine (hormonal) diseases, 
typically where there is either no licensed medicine or where 
current treatment does not sufficiently improve patients’ health. 
Diurnal has identified a number of such needs within the field of 
endocrinology, which the Group believes represents a multi-billion 
Dollar combined market opportunity . Diurnal is able to gain valuable 
insights into the burden of living with these diseases through our 
interaction with physicians and patient groups. These discussions 
have helped, and continue to help, shape the Group’s development 
plans, such that we can deliver products that not only address 
important unmet needs and improve patients’ lives but also have 
a positive impact on healthcare budgets.
Investing for development and value creation
During the year, Diurnal continued to make significant clinical 
development progress with its late-stage pipeline products, as 
well as establishing commercial operations in anticipation of 
future product launches. Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 are in 
late-stage clinical development targeting indications of cortisol 
deficiency: Infacort
®
 has completed a Phase III clinical trial and 
has been submitted for marketing authorisation in Europe, and 
Chronocort
®
 is currently undergoing a Phase III clinical trial 
for Europe. The Group has put in place strong commercial 
infrastructure in Europe to support the planned launch of 
Infacort
®
, for which the Group anticipates receiving market 
authorisation in Europe towards the end of 2017 , at which stage 
development costs will begin to be capitalised in accordance 
with International Accountancy Standards (IAS). The Group plans 
to leverage its investment in the commercial team through the 
timely introduction of Chronocort
®
 following completion of 
the ongoing European Phase III clinical trial and regulatory review, 
expected around the end of 2019. The Group also remains 
mindful of external growth opportunities and continues to 
assess endocrinology assets that fit within its disease focus. 
The US remains a key market for Diurnal and the Group intends 
to progress the Phase III development of both Infacort
®
 and 
Chronocort
®
 in this region during the new financial year, whilst 
assessing the optimal commercialisation strategy, in parallel.
As planned, the funds raised at the IPO have allowed the Group 
to continue to build its team, and we have been able to attract 
highly skilled individuals across the organisation. The agreement 
with Ashfield Healthcare, announced during the year, has facilitated 
a rapid and efficient build-out of our European commercial 
organisation without the need to undertake costly upfront 
investment in infrastructure in each of our key territories. I am 
pleased to see that the Ashfield team has integrated seamlessly 
with Diurnal staff and are rapidly implementing our launch plans.
Diurnal also continues to invest in its earlier-stage pipeline, with 
good progress being made with the Group’s oral native testosterone 
product, which entered human clinical trials during the year, 
as well as our programmes in Cushing’s Disease (cortisol excess) 
and hypothyroidism. 
Meeting milestones, building our future
Chairman’s statement
It is with great pleasure that I report on the 
significant progress Diurnal has made this 
financial year towards becoming a world-leading, 
endocrinology-focused specialty pharma 
company. Most notable is the delivery of key 
milestones towards first commercial revenues. 
Through this period of development, Diurnal has 
maintained its entrepreneurial and patient-centric 
approach, which has enabled the progression of a 
valuable portfolio of novel prospects and provides 
a solid platform for our future development. 3  Diurnal Group plc _ Annual Report 2017
Board changes and governance
Diurnal strengthened its Board during the year with the 
appointment of Richard Bungay as Chief Financial Officer. 
Richard’s extensive experience in corporate roles within the 
biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector, with a particular focus 
on financing, investor relations and business development, will be 
invaluable as the Group executes its ambitious development plans. 
As the Group continues its rapid development, the Board and 
senior management are focused on maintaining a strong system 
of internal controls and appropriate risk management systems, 
to ensure that the business is well controlled. The Group has made 
significant investments during the year to ensure that it maintains 
the highest standards of quality in its operations. The Board 
continues to monitor the potential effects of Brexit on the 
Group’s business and, in particular, any impact on the regulatory 
framework for pharmaceutical product development, approval 
and commercialisation as well as any trading impacts as we 
prepare to commercialise Infacort
®
 across Europe.
People and culture
I would like to thank our employees for their continued support and 
hard work in driving the Group’s progress towards commercialising 
its first products. Few companies in the UK have successfully 
taken their own product into a regulatory review and on to 
commercialisation: it is a testament to the Diurnal team that our 
key milestones have been met during a period of intense activity 
and change. I would also like to thank my fellow Board members 
for the progress made this year in overseeing a strategy that will 
ensure continued and sustainable growth from our pipeline. 
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support as Diurnal aims to make a real difference to patients without 
effective treatment options for chronic endocrine diseases.

Diurnal’s progress towards becoming a world-leading 
endocrinology-focused specialty pharma company has been 
characterised by a strong focus on capital efficiency, whilst 
making sure that high quality resources are available on a timely 
basis. Diurnal’s organisation reflects the need for different skills 
at different stages of the product development cycle and 
provides the ability to respond flexibly to business needs.
Key elements of Diurnal’s structure are:
 + A core internal team covering development, regulatory, 
manufacturing, supply chain and commercialisation, 
in addition to administration. 
 + Many of Diurnal’s team work virtually, giving the Group 
access to the best individuals worldwide regardless of location.
 + Trusted consultants and contractors bringing expertise 
to Diurnal’s development, manufacturing and 
commercialisation activities.
 + A network of contract organisations, providing robust support 
for critical business activities worldwide. Diurnal has had 
successful long-term relationships with many of its partners. 
One example of such a relationship is with Glatt GmbH, 
who manufacture Infacort
®
 and Chronocort
®
 products. 
Diurnal started working with Glatt in 2010, initially for the 
development of formulations then moving onto clinical 
trial product manufacture, scale up and, for Infacort
®
, 
progression to manufacture of commercial product 
at Glatt’s facility in Binzen, Germany.
