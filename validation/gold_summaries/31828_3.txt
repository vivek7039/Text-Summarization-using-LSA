 Performance
I am pleased to report strong financial results from Softcat 
in 2017 against a background of mixed performance in 
the IT reseller market. Growth in gross profit, our primary 
measure of income, was 12.9% to £136.3m and adjusted 
operating profit increased by 10.1% to reach £51.5m. 
Revenue growth was especially strong at 23.8% with 
software, hardware and services all delivering double-digit 
growth. The Company has made significant investments 
in new sales, services and technical resource over the 
past two years and the return on those investments is 
evident in our performance. More information on how we 
performed can be found in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
and Financial Review on pages 7 to 10 and 22 to 23.
Board
We announced in May 2017 that our Chief Executive, 
Martin Hellawell, had decided to step down once his 
successor is in place. Since the announcement, the 
Nomination Committee has been focussed on finding 
a successor with the appropriate energy and passion to 
drive the Company through its next stage of development. 
The search is progressing and, once his successor is 
in place, the Board intends to appoint Martin as Non-Executive 
Chairman at which time I will retire from the Board. I am 
confident that these plans will ensure a very orderly 
transition in due course. Details of the search are set out 
on page 43.
I would like to thank Martin for the exemplary leadership 
role he has played in driving the business forward over the 
past eleven years. Softcat has achieved exceptional growth 
during Martin’s tenure. The start of Martin’s tenure as Chairman 
will open a new chapter and I am very confident that the 
Company will perform strongly in the years ahead. The 
Board’s focus will be on supporting both Martin and the 
new Chief Executive in their new roles for the benefit of 
the Company and shareholders alike. For my own part, it 
has been a privilege to chair Softcat through its IPO in 2015.
Shareholder returns
Our dividend policy remains a progressive one which targets 
an annual dividend of between 40% and 50% of the Company’s 
profits after tax in each financial year before any exceptional 
items. Subject to any cash requirements for ongoing investment, 
the Board will consider returning excess cash to 
shareholders over time. 
We recommend a final dividend of 6.1p, taking the total 
dividend to 9p per ordinary share. In addition, we recommend 
a special dividend of 13.5p per ordinary share is paid at 
the same time as the final dividend. Shareholders will be 
asked to approve the final and special dividends at the 
AGM on 8 December 2017.
Looking ahead
People and succession planning will remain one of the Board’s 
key priorities, alongside the development of strategy and its 
execution. Much of our focus will be on supporting the 
leadership team through the next chapter of growth for the 
benefit of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding Brexit, 
the business is in a confident mood and its relentless 
focus on customer service and employee engagement 
provides good grounds for optimism going forward. 
Our success this year would not have been possible 
without the passion and commitment of our outstanding 
employees. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
everyone across the Company for their contribution in 
making this a successful year for Softcat. I have always 
found our people to be committed, positive and dedicated 
to our customers. Each and every one shows huge pride 
in working for this unique business, and I would like 
to extend our gratitude to them all.
