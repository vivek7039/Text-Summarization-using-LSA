CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
TEN YEARS OF CREATING VALUE 
THROUGH GROWTH AND RETURNS
Although the Group has a history 
stretching back over a century, Fresnillo 
only became a listed company in 2008. 
Today, as we stand on the brink of our 
second decade, we can look back on 
our achievements with justifiable pride. 
Despite a changing market environment 
and pressures affecting the mining 
industry as a whole, we are delivering 
on our long-term commitments  
and continuing to create value  
through growth and returns for our 
stakeholders. Over the last decade,  
we have paid close to US$2.5 billion in 
dividends, invested over US$4 billion to 
sustain and expand our operations and 
develop new projects, and increased 
attributable silver and gold production 
by over 55% and 245%, respectively.

ACHIEVEMENTS – IN BOTH FINANCIAL  
AND NON-FINANCIAL TERMS – SINCE  
THE IPO IN 2008 
SEE PAGES 12, 26, 52, 72
While we remain confident about our 
future and growth potential, we do  
not ignore the challenges faced by the 
mining industry. These include lower 
grades, access to land, environmental 
demands, social pressures and 
growing complexities in the permitting 
processes, among others. Managing 
these pressures requires increased 
focus and expertise to avoid excessive 
delays to projects and to maintain our 
social licence to operate.

2017: A YEAR OF PROGRESS
2017 has again proved the importance 
of a consistent, conservative long-term 
strategy based primarily on organic 
growth, developed and implemented  
by a committed professional team  
and fully supported by the Board. This 
provided the foundation for another 
year of record silver production and 
stable gold production. The commitment 
to exploration across precious metals 
price cycles continues to be the  
key to our success, growth and 
long-term prospects. 
WE END OUR FIRST DECADE OF OPERATIONS AS WE STARTED IT –  
FIRM IN OUR COMMITMENT TO GROWTH AND RETURNS, ENERGISED  
BY THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY AND CONFIDENT ABOUT  
OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS.

Against a backdrop of relatively stable 
precious metals prices and an upward 
trend of by-product base metal prices,  
we have delivered sound financial results. 
The Group generated over US$2,230 
million in adjusted revenue in 2017,  
a rise of 9.2% over the prior year,  
with a 32.0% increase in profit for the 
period. Cash and other liquid funds

CONSISTENT DIVIDEND POLICY
Fresnillo plc’s dividend policy is  
closely aligned with our focus on 
creating value through growth and 
returns, and is based on paying out 
33-50% of profit after tax each year, 
with certain adjustments made to 
exclude non-cash effects in the income 
statement. Dividends are paid in the 
approximate proportions of one-third  
as an interim dividend, with the balance 
as a final dividend. 
Before declaring a dividend, the Board 
carries out detailed analysis of the 
profitability of the business, underlying 
earnings, capital requirements and cash 
flows. Our aim is to maintain sufficient 
flexibility to respond to movements in 
precious metals prices and other factors 
that could impact our business. 
We declared an interim dividend of 
10.6 US cents per share, with a final 
dividend of 29.8 US cents per share, 
bringing the total for the year to 
US$297.7 million. 
MEETING OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS
At the time of the IPO, we set ourselves 
two demanding targets for our first 
decade of operations. Our target for 
gold production of 750 koz was reached 
in 2015, three years ahead of plan, 
while the 65 moz objective for silver  
is on track to be achieved in 2018. 
There were a number of key 
operational developments during the 
year, but here I would like to focus on 
two in particular . Firstly, the second 
phase of our silver-gold San Julián 
project was commissioned. This new 
mine, discovered by our exploration 
team, is a cornerstone of our future 
prospects and opens a promising, 
remote district to further growth. 
Several Board members visited the  
site during 2017 and saw at first-hand 
how the plans of the Board and 
management have become reality.
Secondly, despite falling short of our 
expectations due to several operational 
issues, performance at the Fresnillo 
mine continued to improve. We have 
taken a number of corrective steps  
to address these issues, including: 
strengthening our operational leadership 
team; improving contractor efficiency; 
and eliminating bottlenecks caused by 
inefficient working practices. 
We expect the construction of the  
new Pyrites plant to significantly 
advance towards commissioning in 
2018, improving the gold and silver 
recovery from the tailings at both  
the Fresnillo and Saucito mines. In 
addition, we started construction of the 
second line at the Dynamic Leaching 
Plant at Herradura, which will improve 
gold recovery, particularly as we 
encounter increasing quantities of 
higher sulphide grade ore. The Board 
expects to approve the development  
of our joint venture with Mag Silver at 
Juanicipio in the first half of 2018, and 
we anticipate the start-up of production 
in the first half of 2020. Juanicipio is 
the next major project for Fresnillo and 
management is committed to ensuring 
that the mine fulfils its true potential.
We have a well-established record of 
replenishing reserves and resources, 
and 2017 again saw good progress in 
this respect. Exploration results for the 
year were positive. Overall, our resource 
base has expanded significantly. Silver 
resources have grown from 2,171 moz  
in 2016 to 2,320 moz in 2017, while gold 
resources remained stable at 38.5 moz. 
Gold reserves increased by 22.7%, 
mainly due to the Herradura mine,  
while silver reserves showed a decrease 
of 5.4%, with an increase at Saucito 
offset by falls at Fresnillo and Ciénega. 
Exploration remains a key pillar of our 
Company as we move towards achieving 
our 2018 goals and further success in 
the years beyond.
OUR WORKFORCE
Health and safety remain the paramount 
priority of our Board. I regret to report 
that one fatal accident occurred in early 
2017. While the trend of the broader 
safety indicators continued to improve, 
supported by our drive towards a more 
systematic approach to incidents, this 
fatality is unacceptable. One fatality  
is one too many, and our sincere 
condolences and support have been 
conveyed to the family of the victim. 
We will never sacrifice the health and 
safety of our people – or the long-term 
sustainability of our business – for 
short-term gain, financial or otherwise, 
and strive to implement best-in-class 
systems and practices throughout the 
Company. However, it is clear that there 
remains much work to do, particularly 
where contractors are concerned. 
Contractor staff do not always display  
a consistent focus on safety and lack 
sufficient training due to frequent 
rotation of personnel. During the year 
we took decisive steps to engage them 
in our health and safety culture. This 
new approach has already borne fruit 
and will be extended in 2018.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  
CONTINUED
The Board’s Health, Safety, 
Environment and Community Relations 
(HSECR) Committee continued to 
review our culture and values as part  
of its work and will be monitoring 
progress in the coming year . We again 
increased our HSECR activities during 
2017, supporting a large number of 
new and established programmes 
which underline our commitment to 
the wellbeing of our people and their 
communities. Please see the Social 
and Sustainability Report on pages 
74-103 for more details.
SUPPORTING OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM
The Board plays an active role in  
setting Group strategy and supporting 
the Executive Committee. We regularly 
review progress versus plan, ensuring 
that the business has the required 
flexibility to respond to changing 
market conditions while at the same 
time fulfilling our commitment to 
continuous investment across 
price cycles. 
During 2017, we again ensured that 
capital allocation was balanced by 
growth, shareholder returns, financial 
strength and flexibility, within the 
context of our commitment to 
sustainability and risk management. 
Familiarity with the business is key for 
an effective Board. I encourage Board 
members to gain practical knowledge 
about our activities, and over the course 
of the year my colleagues visited a 
number of operational sites. For example, 
six Directors visited San Julián to  
gain first-hand understanding of  
the importance and challenges  
of the operation. 
STRENGTHENING OUR  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The most important function of  
the Board is to ensure strong and 
effective corporate governance.  
We have continued to identify and, 
where appropriate, implement best 
practice in line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and evolving 
stakeholder expectations in both  
the UK and Mexico. 
I have set out details regarding the 
major developments in my introduction 
to the Corporate Governance section on 
page 117. In summary, these include:
• New anti-bribery and corruption 
legislation in Mexico. The work  
we have undertaken over the past 
few years to ensure compliance  
with UK legislation enabled us to 
accommodate the requirements  
of the new Mexican legislation 
with ease. 
• Continued support for greater 
gender diversity at Board level,  
in line with our commitment to  
align Fresnillo more closely with 
expectations relating to diversity  
on FTSE 100 boards.
• Evolution of the independent 
representation on the Board.
• The continued support of over 99% 
of our independent shareholders for 
our executive remuneration policy.
As we approach the tenth anniversary 
of our listing on the London Stock 
Exchange, I am pleased to report  
that, while our business model has 
remained essentially the same,  
we are also continuing to learn and 
evolve – particularly in the areas of 
sustainability, the application of IT and 
corporate governance. For example, 
our Code of Conduct was reviewed and 
benefited from updates during the year, 
reflecting our commitment to building 
and maintaining an ethical culture 
across all our operations. Based on  
our values of Responsibility, Integrity, 
Trust and Loyalty, this culture is the 
cornerstone of our past achievements 
and the platform for our future success. 
2017 again saw us complement regular 
workshops and master classes with 
online training in order to ensure  
that all our people are aware of the 
importance we attach to our values.
Corporate culture is a key agenda item 
for every Board meeting, with updates 
on the cultural programme provided  
as part of the CEO’s report. These 
regular bulletins are supported by  
an annual presentation by the Head  
of Sustainability.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
In May, I was delighted to welcome 
Dame Judith Macgregor as an 
Independent Non-executive Director . 
Dame Judith was the British 
Ambassador to Mexico from 2009 to 
2013 and has been the President of  
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
(FCO) Women’s Association since 2006, 
overseeing a significant increase in  
the number of FCO women in senior 
grades. Dame Judith is the third female 
appointment to the Board in the past five 
years, and is currently one of two female 
members. With women continuing to  
be under-represented on our Board  
and in our workforce, during the year  
we developed a new policy which aims  
to encapsulate our commitment to 
greater diversity and inclusion.
OUTLOOK FOR 2018 AND BEYOND
We will continue to maintain our 
disciplined approach to investment  
in order to support the key ‘Explore, 
Develop, Operate and Sustain’ 
elements of the business model. Our 
focus will once again be on efficiency 
and cost control to underpin projects, 
ongoing performance improvements at 
Fresnillo, increased production at San 
Julián, development of Juanicipio and 
the continued evaluation of the Orisyvo 
gold project.
Human Capital is key to our ability  
to create value through growth  
and returns. Throughout 2017, our 
people again showed the skills and 
professionalism needed to overcome 
challenges as well as the commitment 
to deliver results. On behalf of the 
Board and shareholders I want to 
express my gratitude for their efforts.
The Board and I reiterate our 
confidence in the established and 
proven strategy and in the capacity  
of the Executive Committee to execute 
it. While volatility in exchange rates or 
precious metals prices may present 
short-term challenges, we anticipate 
further growth and returns over the 
longer term.
