 10 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chariot’s continued focus over the last 12 
months on capital discipline, partnering and 
portfolio management has culminated in the 
current drilling programme, targeting some 
of the world’s largest prospects of 2018, with 
the capacity to transform the Company’s value 
and offer substantial follow on potential in the 
success case. At the same time, its technical 
focus ensures the Company continues to mature 
the rest of the portfolio and its new venture 
strategy has successfully sought to capitalise 
on any further information gained from our 
near term drilling programme to add to our 
longer term prospect inventory. 
The importance of this de-risking strategy is 
highlighted through the recent disappointing 
results of the Rabat Deep 1 well, which tested 
one of the play types, a Jurassic Carbonate, 
within the Company’s wider portfolio focus. 
Through partnering Chariot was able to 
participate in this well at no cost. At the same 
time as using the information gained from this 
well to de-risk those prospects with similar 
properties, with a diversified portfolio Chariot 
can offer exposure to other high impact drilling 
opportunities which fall across several basins  
in a number of play types within the Atlantic 
Margin, and the Company looks forward to the 
drilling of Prospect S in Namibia during Q4 2018.
Crucially, it is the in-house team that has been 
able to identify these giant, high margin assets 
and manage them in a challenging business 
environment that makes Chariot’s offering truly 
compelling. Using its strategic foresight the 
Company has invested in the opportunities 
that have arisen from a lower for longer oil price 
environment, taking advantage of significant 
reductions in the seismic market and now 
having captured the same effect on rig rates. 
Through this and our recently bolstered funding 
position, we expect to achieve a balance of 
equity, technical risk and cost through our 
ongoing partnering negotiations with the aim 
of maximising our exposure to the drilling of our 
near term giant prospects at the optimum point 
of the cost cycle.
Accelerated Drilling Campaign in a Low 
Cost Window of Opportunity
In Q1 2018 Chariot participated in the first of 
three giant potential wells that the Company  
is aiming to drill over the next 18 months.  
The Rabat Deep 1 well, targeting the JP-1 
prospect in Rabat Deep offshore Morocco,  
was drilled by the Rabat Deep partnership to  
a total depth of 3,180m with the Saipem 12000 
sixth generation ultra-deepwater drillship. It 
penetrated a thick top seal and encountered 
tight, fractured carbonates in the primary target 
and consequently was plugged and abandoned 
with the data collected used to calibrate existing 
data sets to understand the implications on the 
prospectivity of the surrounding area. 
Whilst the outcome of the well is very 
disappointing, having farmed down the acreage 
at both the seismic and drilling investment 
phase, Chariot was able to participate in a 
potentially transformational well at zero cost to 
the Company. This may not be achievable across 
the entirety of the portfolio, but Chariot aims to 
capitalise on opportunities where it is able, and 
with the recent successful fundraising it is funded 
to lock in the current reduction in rig rates which, 
in response to decreased world-wide exploration 
activity, are now a quarter of their previous cost. 
This timing is crucial. With a recently stabilised oil 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
STAYING AHEAD
• Rigorous tendering processes carried 
out to fulfil acquisition of 2D and 
3D seismic over Mohammedia and 
Kenitra, Morocco, at significantly 
reduced prices
• David Brecknock, experienced Drilling 
Manager, hired to undertake drilling 
preparations across Namibia and 
Morocco, with Ocean Rig Poseidon 
secured for Namibia in the current  
low-cost environment
• Partnering strategy continues from 
a position of financial strength and  
at a commercial advantage with the 
aim of maximising retention of licence 
equity and drilling at the optimum 
point of the cost cycle
Staying Ahead in 
a Cyclical Market
“We look forward to a number of material value triggers in the 
year ahead, where Chariot’s high impact portfolio will be tested 
in the knowledge that, with its wider portfolio focus, we have 
secured follow on potential for the success case, and additional 
high impact drilling opportunities across a variety of basins  
and play types beyond the current objectives in the broader 
Atlantic Margin. ”

price and the reduced cost price environment 
encouraging more seismic activity, we see signs 
of a return to exploration from the industry, and 
with increasing demand for these services, will 
come increasing prices. It is for this reason that 
we are looking to act now, while this window 
of opportunity remains open. 
Drilling preparations have therefore 
commenced for Prospect S (audited gross 
mean prospective resources of 459mmbbls) in 
Namibia in anticipation of a Q4 2018 spud and 
Kenitra-1 (gross mean prospective resources 
of 464mmbbls) in Chariot’s operated acreage 
in Morocco where we are targeting drilling 
to commence in H1 2019, depending on 
drilling outcomes and partnering processes. 
Management believes that this preparatory work 
will avoid unnecessary delays associated with its 
plans to drill, strengthen its position in partnering 
negotiations and ensure it capitalises on the 
current low-cost oil services environment. 
As well as the financial capacity to do this, we 
now also have the operational skill set with the 
addition of David Brecknock, Drilling Manager, 
to the team in October 2017. David has held a 
variety of drilling operations and management 
roles, principally in deep-water drilling, with over 
20 years of international experience gained with 
Enterprise, Shell, BG, Devon, Perenco and Ophir. 
Most recently David led a team which delivered 
a deep-water exploration well in Cote d’Ivoire 
for less than US$20 million gross – a well drilled 
in similar water depth and depth of primary 
target as Prospect S in Namibia, which we aim to 
deliver safely and efficiently under his leadership. 
Partnering – Getting the Balance Right
Locking in the reduced rig costs is also deemed 
important to our negotiating position in the 
ongoing partnering processes on our Namibian 
and operated Moroccan acreage. The very 
process of carrying out a dataroom and the 
potential partnering negotiations that follow 
provides the third party validation and technical 
de-risking that the Company looks for to ensure 
that the potential of the asset is endorsed. The 
subsequent decisions are based on balancing 
the asset’s associated risk, with the cost and 
ultimate value of success to Chariot – taking into 
account external commercial factors such as the 
current economic environment. 
Where seismic was carried out at the peak of 
the market cycle in 2014 on the Rabat Deep 
asset, for example, partnering was essential 
to balance the cost of this and the rig market 
conditions at the time. The resulting equity left 
in the asset was representative of the anticipated 
financial outlay. At the moment, however, with 
rig rates down from US$650,000/day (2012) to 
less than US$200,000/day (2017), the costs of 
the upcoming drilling programme are vastly 
reduced. As such, and given Chariot’s recently 
strengthened financial position, this balance in 
the partnering process has shifted allowing the 
Company to retain larger equity in a low cost 
well (as anticipated for Prospect S) instead of a 
smaller equity position in a high cost well. 
Chariot aims to capitalise on 
opportunities where it is able, 
and with the recent successful 
fundraising it is funded to lock in 
the current reduction in rig rates 
which, in response to decreased 
world-wide exploration activity, are 
now a quarter of their previous cost. 
This timing is crucial. With a recently  
stabilised oil price and the reduced cost  
price environment encouraging more  
seismic activity, we see signs of a return 
to exploration from the industry, and with 
increasing demand for these services, will 
come increasing prices. 
Drilling preparations have therefore 
commenced for Prospect S in Namibia in 
anticipation of a Q4 2018 spud and Kenitra-1 
in Chariot’s operated acreage in Morocco 
where we expect drilling to commence in 
H1 2019, depending on drilling outcomes 
and partnering processes. Management 
believes that this preparatory work will avoid 
unnecessary delays, strengthen its position 
in partnering negotiations and ensure 
it capitalises on the current low-cost oil 
services environment. 
Successful Placing and Open Offer – What it Means for Chariot 12 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Continued
Opportunities in the Low-cost Environment
Drilling costs at historic lows
•  Down by 65% – 75% of the 2014 peak, 
but expected to increase with a return 
to exploration 
•  Rig day rates down from >$650k/day 
to <$200k/day 
•  Ayame – 1x ultra-deepwater well offshore 
Cote d’lvoire drilled for <$20m (2017) 
– similar design and target depth to 
Chariot’s wells
Low cost window is expected to close
•  Chariot captured the bottom of the seismic 
market with extensive surveys in Morocco, 
Namibia and Brazil 
•  Seismic costs are now recovering from 
historic lows with growing limitations on 
streamer availability 
•  Increasing seismic activity enables additional 
exploration drilling
Industry return to exploration
•  In response to stabilised oil price, reduced 
cost environment and the challenge of 
reserve replacement 
•  First signs of increasing drilling activity 
in West Africa
It is thus that the Company will continue to look 
to balance its equity stake and cost in its licences 
while, at the same time as achieving third party 
validation and capital discipline, delivering the 
greatest value possible to its shareholders.
Successful partnering on these near term wells 
will also offer the potential to liberate funds to 
extend the current drilling programme. In the 
Central Blocks in Namibia, for example, with 
success in Prospect S and with partnering, Chariot 
will aim to drill the neighbouring Prospect W 
(284mmbbls gross mean prospective resources) 
back-to-back and, by using the same rig, to 
benefit from cost reduction through operational 
synergy. Similarly, at Kenitra-1, with success and 
partnering the Company would aim to drill 
LKP-1a (350 mmbbls gross mean prospective 
resources) back-to-back in the neighbouring 
Mohammedia Permits. It is thus that through the 
strong financial position of the Company and 
potential additional partnering Chariot could drill 
up to a further two prospects in the near term.
Focused Portfolio Management
Chariot continues to strive for a diverse 
portfolio that creates a variety of opportunities 
for substantial play opening targets with an 
optimum chance for long term success. As 
part of this focus, the team has continued to 
analyse the wider opportunities presented in 
the Atlantic Margin, particularly keeping in mind 
the objective of locking in follow on potential 
that may result from any success and improved 
technical understanding from near term drilling. 
In this way, having identified prospectivity 
extending into neighbouring acreage in the 
Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous plays from Rabat 
Deep, the team secured the Mohammedia 
permit in 2016 and, during 2017, Kenitra, 
offshore Morocco with a 75% equity holding 
– which now make up part of the near term 
drilling programme. 
In 2017 the team acquired and processed 
a further 1,027km
2
 of 3D and 2,254km of 2D 
seismic in this operated Moroccan acreage, 
concluding all remaining commitments at 
favourable rates. This, combined with the 
calibrated results of the Rabat Deep 1 well,  
will allow the team to improve the description 
of its drilling targets, Kenitra-1 and LKP-1a,  
in the Cretaceous siliciclastic play.
The team also continues to work towards 
maturing the longer-term prospect inventory 
from its current portfolio. This year the team 
completed its analysis of the 3D seismic data 
it acquired in 2016 across its Namibian and 
Brazilian licences, integrating five new prospects 
(S, T, U, V and W), ranging from 283 – 459mmbbls 
in gross mean prospective resources, into the 
drilling inventory from the former, and a large 
four way dip-closed structure in the latter, on 
which an independent audit of prospective 
resources has been completed, and a dataroom 
is currently open. The Brazil portfolio consists of 
seven prospective reservoir targets individually 
ranging up to 366mmbbls and collectively in 
excess of 1.4Bnbbls of gross mean prospective 
resources. With well operations now funded for 
Prospect S, it is intended that partnering followed 
by a drilling campaign on the rest of these newly 
defined targets, along with any additional new 
ventures, will secure the longevity and extend 
the follow-on potential of the Company’s 
portfolio beyond the current objectives. 
“Having captured the bottom 
of the seismic market with 
extensive 3D surveys in 
Namibia and Brazil in 2016, 
the team continued its 
rigorous tendering processes 
in 2017 to acquire and 
process a further 1,027km
2
 
of 3D and 2,254km of 2D 
seismic in its operated 
Moroccan acreage. With this 
complete, the Company 
also aims to take advantage 
of reduced rig rates, which, 
in response to decreased 
world-wide exploration 
activity, are now a quarter 
of their previous cost. ” STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As well as looking to add prospectivity, the team 
also consistently streamlines the portfolio to 
identify those parts that, despite being giant in 
their potential, may present higher risks. With this 
in mind, in August 2017, the Company reported 
that it had decided not to enter the next period 
of exploration in the Southern Blocks, Namibia. 
It has, however, secured an option to back-in 
for 10% equity after the completion of future 
exploration drilling in region for no financial 
consideration in exchange for facilitating  
a partnering programme which will be 
undertaken by the state oil company, NAMCOR. 
In doing so, the Company still retains exposure  
to the upside on this acreage, whilst being able 
to focus its funds on maturing its near-term 
drilling inventory.
Our T eam
Crucial to these achievements is Chariot’s 
in-house team. With a combined knowledge 
base of over 200 years on the Atlantic Margins 
we believe that Chariot has one of the best 
understandings of this geology amongst our peer 
group and by continuing to apply its technical 
strength, it aims to deliver on its goal; to discover 
material accumulations of hydrocarbons. This is 
complemented by the financial and commercial 
capabilities of the team in negotiating excellent 
contract rates and terms, with a focus on capital 
discipline ensuring for a robust fiscal position. 
We were also very pleased to welcome the 
aforementioned David Brecknock to the team 
in 2017 as Drilling Manager, in anticipation of  
safe, efficient and cost-effective drilling operations 
in the year ahead.
With another challenging year within the oil and 
gas industry I would like to thank the team for 
their continued hard work. The recent upturn 
in the sector, including interest from the equity 
markets, means Chariot is well positioned to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented at this 
point of the cost cycle and looks forward to the 
developments of the year ahead.
Outlook
Chariot remains on track in its goal of drilling 
three high impact wells of transformational 
potential in the near term, with the drilling 
of the Rabat Deep 1 well by the Rabat Deep 
partnership complete and preparations 
underway for the drilling of Prospect S in Q4 of 
this year and, depending on the outcome and 
partnering, a further well, either in Namibia or 
Morocco in H1 2019. It is owing to the continued 
focus on capital discipline, technical expertise 
and the de-risking strategy that we have been 
able to initiate this drilling campaign at no cost 
to the Company and we will continue to seek a 
partnership balance in which the technical risk 
is measured against the cost and its associated 
prize, to maximise the retention of licence equity 
and achieve drilling at the optimum point of the 
oil services cost cycle.
At the same time we remain vigilant of the 
potential ongoing volatility in the market 
and will continue to ensure the stability of 
the Company’s long term. With no remaining 
commitments across the portfolio we stand in a 
robust financial position from which we can look 
to technically mature our current assets and seek 
partners to enable the acceleration of drilling the 
follow-on portfolio. In addition, we will continue 
to leverage our knowledge of the Atlantic margins 
to access additional giant potential new ventures, 
with the aim of offering exposure to a sustainable 
pipeline of high impact drilling opportunities.
