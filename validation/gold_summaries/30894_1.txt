STRONG TRADING 
IN 2017
MARKET TRENDS 
The UK financial services industry remains the primary market 
for our Customer Experience division. Our clients and prospects 
within this market continue to see lower headline growth due to 
saturation and are therefore primarily focused on retention of 
market share and enriching their customer relationships. The 
continued migration to digital channels, improving customer 
experience and emphasis on quality of customer 
communications are central to this and our solutions and 
services are well placed to fulfil client needs.
Within the insurance market, organisations are more focused on 
gaining market share over retention and are proactively acquiring 
the capability to shift to channels of customer preference. Digital 
channels are therefore preferred and communications are 
typically complex and highly personalised. The utilities sector 
again is typified by lower headline growth but customer habits are 
changing and moving more digital to take personal control of 
consumption and respond to environmental concerns.
Demand for specialist content marketing capability, such as that 
provided by our Editions Financial business, is strong in the UK 
and US. Experience during 2017 suggests that high quality content 
delivered by genuine sector specialists is being favoured by chief 
marketing officers to enable brands to speak with authority.
Within the international FMCG market, the challenge for most 
brand owners in 2017 was the fluctuation of currency and how 
this has affected the repatriation of Euros or Pounds to Dollars 
(typically). This has caused some pressure on marketing budgets. 
In-store marketers are responding to the trend to cheaper, own 
brand alternatives and online shopping. There has been a drive 
towards standardisation to increase production leverage and 
efficiency and a desire for displays to be more permanent. There 
is still a focus on supply chain efficiencies and eliminating waste/
failed delivery with some market estimates at up to 20% of 
pre-filled free-standing display units not making it to their 
intended shop floor destination. Such challenges represent 
opportunity for our Brand Deployment division.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

With the increased sales in the craft drinks sector (whether 
that be beers, gins, etc.), major brand businesses have needed 
to respond to keep on-shelf presence in supermarkets. Brands 
are therefore offering more events or Gift with Purchase (GWP) 
to keep their in-store presence and increase sales. As a result, 
we have seen a marked increase in the requirement for fast 
turnaround co-packing of GWP for major shopping events 
(Christmas, Father’s Day and other anniversaries). We expect 
to see this trend increase in 2018.
The broader agency market dynamic is changing significantly 
at present, driven largely by the entrance of consultancy-based 
businesses into the sector. This has increased commoditisation 
of service and has led to a reduction of fees. That said, with the 
increased pushback on the lack of transparency online, agencies 
are being asked to deliver more demonstrable sales and can 
charge for that effectiveness. In addition, there are increased 
calls to design products for in-store that can be used efficiently 
as well as effectively to reduce costs and increase sales. There 
remain strong opportunities in brand awareness and product 
launches and this is where, for example, our agency Twelve 
has been successful.
We still anticipate further consolidation within our sectors. As we 
focus increasingly on provision of digital products and services, 
our competitor set has shifted somewhat. This now includes 
technology-based competitors, as well as consultancy businesses.
We continue to monitor the impact of Brexit negotiations on the 
economies in which we operate. There are not yet any clear 
political outcomes but given our activity in the wider supply 
chain for staple consumer goods and employment of foreign 
nationals, in-country, we continue to believe that we are 
relatively well protected from potential negative economic 
impacts Brexit may have.
RISK/GDPR/REGULATION
The Group has a formal approach to risk management. In 
considering the risk to the business over the past 18 months, the 
Group has reviewed and refined its approach to data protection 
in line with the changing global landscape and new legislation. 
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is of 
particular focus and is a regulation which updates rights and 
provides opportunities for individuals and companies in the 21st 
century. The primary objective of the GDPR is to give back control 
of personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for 
international business. When it is implemented in May 2018, in the 
words of the Information Commissioner, GDPR will be ‘a game 
changer for us all’ by:
• putting the spotlight on accountability;
• emphasising transparency;
• extending the scope of data protection;
• introducing fines for non-compliance; and
• realising the business benefits of this changing environment.

RISK/GDPR/REGULATION CONTINUED
Communisis’ activities as both a Data Controller and a Data 
Processor have required us to review our operations against the 
new regulations and put in place actions to address the risk of 
non-compliance. As part of our ongoing investment that 
supports the business, we have integrated Data Protection within 
the Group as part of our Information Security Management 
System. This investment, comprising £0.8m capital and £0.8m 
operational expenditure in 2018, includes:
• dedicated Data Protection Compliance Officers, who are 
experienced subject matter experts, bringing in skills and 
experience from both the public and private sectors;
• developing ‘Records of Processing Activities’ models which are 
used to assess the processing Communisis undertakes as both 
a Data Controller and Data Processor and feed into an 
updated risk assessment procedure and Data Processing 
Impact Assessment;
• implementing enhancements in technology to support new 
regulations; and 
• undertaking work, in compliance with the Information 
Commissioner’s Office (ICO) guidance on contracts and 
liabilities, to assist clients in their compliance.
DETAILED TRADING REVIEW PER DIVISION FOR 2017  
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
2017 was a positive year for Customer Experience with a strong 
overall increase in profitability. The Direct Mail business 
performed well, showing significant improvement on prior year 
numbers. This was largely driven by increased insourcing of work 
and stringent cost control. The overall transactional business 
(outbound and inbound) improved profitability against prior 
year, driven by new contracts and increased volumes. Our 
technology business also outperformed 2016. This was related to 
transition activity on-boarding a new client to our Connect
TM
 
digital platform for customer communications management. 
The Security Print business (predominantly cheque book 
production) was down on volume but demand for our new 
digital technology for fraud prevention has increased with a 
number of bank clients now using our system for eUCN, a 
patented cheque fraud feature exclusive to Communisis. 
We refocused our general creative agency Psona onto 
Communisis’ core client bases in Financial Services and FMCG 
and restructured to integrate its ongoing and future client activity.
BRAND DEPLOYMENT
This division achieved proportionately less profit growth than revenue 
growth, mainly in our core Managed Services business, driven by 
country mix and investment in new markets. The Campaign Fulfilment 
business outperformed expectations as it brought various new 
contracts on-board and we expanded our services in the drinks 
sector. The Agencies finished ahead of prior year, mainly due to 
projects relating to the telecommunications sector within T welve.
TECHNOLOGY
The continued importance of technology, in the delivery of 
services to our clients and supporting our operating model, 
provided focus to improve capability, control and visibility of 
services and systems in 2017. To enable this, we made a number 
of significant industry hires in the year. We implemented a best 
practice approach to enterprise architecture enabling us to align 
people, process and technology with specific expertise from the 
financial services sector. Amongst other benefits, this approach 
allowed us to develop a scalable, multi-tenanted product for 
digital asset management and workflow during 2017 which now 
supports five clients, with capacity and capability for further 
on-boarding. This allows marketing teams access to creative 
content for action and approval.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CONTINUED

15 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Formal service reviews with stakeholders are now embedded, 
creating dialogue which enables transformation plans aligned to 
business need and strategic priorities. This is supported by an 
internal customer satisfaction survey, providing quantitative 
understanding of the service we deliver and assisting us to 
shape our future planning. Through systematic selection and 
contracting with 3rd party vendors (the latter being increasingly 
pertinent as we continue to develop real time digital products), 
we have improved services received from our technology supply 
base, in addition to generating important savings in the year.
We have also prioritised investment in technology solutions 
and services. This includes major software expenditure over 
two years with ‘Noosh’, a product which allows Communisis 
to support marketing services and print procurement in a more 
operationally efficient and expedient way, a significant step in 
the digitisation of our business processes in Brand Deployment. 
We also adopted ‘Solarwinds’ in the year for service and incident 
management and products for internal and external collaboration. 
This extends to federation with clients to improve lines of 
communication and manage costs more effectively.
CASE STUDY
MAJOR UK HIGH STREET BANK
ENHANCING CUSTOMERS’ BANKING EXPERIENCE
Our work with this banking client has become the backbone 
of their communications operation. Their task for us was to 
decrease the operational costs of processing inbound 
communications. Our solution was to transfer 430 
employees to Communisis with all non-core banking activity 
and collaborate with the bank to create an end to end 
solution to link inbound and outbound communications. 
The results were increased customer responsiveness, a more 
cost-effective system and the start of a decade long 
relationship between Communisis and the bank.
OVER 3,000,000 INBOUND COMMUNICATIONS A MONTH 
PEOPLE 
Our progress with people related matters remains strong and 
supports our strategic agenda. We are delighted to have 
retained with an improved result, our Gold Level accreditation 
from the ‘Committed to Equality’ organisation. In 2017 we also 
made significant strides with managing and developing our 
talent, boosted by a strong focus on personal performance 
management and leadership development programmes, with 32 
candidates completing a leadership programme in the year.
