PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
Innovation 
thrives in a 
challenging 
environment
At Plant Impact this year we have invested more 
in R&D and been rewarded with advances in 
our pipeline of products. Recent industry-wide 
commercial challenges have not slowed 
our scientific progress.
DR DAVID JONES
CHAIRMAN
The last 12 months have been eventful 
ones for our industry and for our 
business. We have seen a remarkable 
uptick in the pace of technical 
innovation from smaller companies, as 
well as from industry multinationals. 
There have been numerous scientific 
and technical developments in the 
areas of biostimulants, AgData, 
plant genetics and advanced sensing 
and diagnostic tools. The future of 
technology on the world’s farms and in 
its food supply chain looks very bright 
over the next 5-10 years: growers will 
have better inputs, better information 
about how to use them, and newer, 
more efficient ways of doing business.
The short-term commercial 
environment in agriculture looks 
very different, however. An unusual 
succession of strong harvests over 
the past five years (prompted by both 
good weather and grower adoption of 
new, high-tech inputs) has depressed 
commodity prices in the world’s big 
crops: corn, soybeans, wheat and rice. 
This has created significant pressure on 
growers’ profitability and the financial 
performance of the distributors and 
input manufacturers who supply them. 
Cost-cutting behaviour by farmers has 
reduced input consumption, creating 
significant channel inventory in many 
markets, notably Brazil and the United 
States. The industry is adjusting to these 
new conditions in a number of ways, 
most conspicuously by consolidation.
Plant Impact’s business progress in the 
last financial year reflects these broader 
sectoral trends. We have invested more 
in R&D and have been rewarded with a 
step advance in our pipeline of products. 
In the next two years, we expect to 
launch new crop enhancement products 
for both soybean and our second target 
crop, wheat. Following investments and 
partnerships for early stage discovery 
of new yield-enhancing small molecules

suitable for soybean, wheat and other 
major dicot and monocot crops, we have 
made many promising discoveries. We 
expect these to generate significant 
new revenue in the medium term.
Commercially, the Group’s Brazil

 business – still the majority 
of its sales – experienced a shortfall 
in grower consumption relative to 
campaign targets, impacting our sales 
for the 2016/17 financial year and the 
outlook for the 2017/18 year. In spite 
of this, we made the important step of 
establishing commercial positions in 
the United States and Argentina, which 
– along with Brazil – make up more than 
90% of the world’s soybean production.
The Group’s Board and management 
have evolved the strategy of the 
Company to reflect the richer flow of 
development products we are now 
seeing. We are moving from a sole 
focus on the exploitation of products 
in hand, to orientating ourselves to a 
future where our R&D platform will 
significantly broaden our offer (and 
with it, of course our development 
challenge). Detail on this is explained 
more fully in the Chief Executive’s 
Review. Having worked successfully 
with the previous strategic plan from 
2011 to 2016 of globalising and placing 
our products into important sectors 
of world agriculture, this evolution of 
our strategy will emphasise and build 
upon our productive R&D discovery 
capability. We believe that a wealth of 
novelty in discovery coupled with proven 
development and commercial placement 
capability is the best choice we can 
make. Our aim remains to become 
the industry leader in the discovery 
and development of small molecule 
chemistry for crop yield enhancement, 
establishing this emerging category 
of agricultural inputs as one that 
growers can trust and will adopt.
The Brazil purchasing outlook for the 
coming 2017/18 season translated into a 
lower level of internally-generated cash 
to fund R&D over the next 12 months. 
Given the progress we had made over 
the last two years and the desire to avoid 
losing R&D momentum, we approached 
shareholders for additional funding to 
maintain our investment in the future. 
We were pleased by the support we 
received which resulted in a fund-raising 
of £4m. We will invest this in R&D 
activities, primarily in bringing to market 
the products that are closest to launch.
Finally, I would like to thank our 
employees for the commitment 
and support that they have shown 
over the last year. It is their drive, 
enthusiasm and skill that produces 
the progress we seek and their efforts 
in this regard have been exemplary.
