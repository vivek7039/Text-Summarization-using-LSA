 Chairman’s statement
bpha’s success has helped attract  
good people and good people are  
key to continued success.
I am writing this statement in the immediate aftermath of the 
tragic event of the Grenfell Tower fire in which so many people 
have sadly lost their lives. Everyone here at bpha extends their 
sympathy to all involved. There will be a need to review the 
information that emerges from the Inquiry as that unfolds; in the 
meantime working with fire service representatives we have 
looked again at bpha tenants’ safety and the fire precaution 
measures that are in place in the tower blocks that bpha owns. 
Tenants’ safety continues to be our number one priority. 
The year to 31 March 2017 has seen continued progress in many 
areas, details of which are set out in the pages which follow. In this 
statement, I wish to focus upon governance, people and strategy.
Governance 
Following my appointment as Chair in February 2015, the Board 
concluded that bpha’s governance would benefit by working to 
a greater extent through committees; this would facilitate greater 
scrutiny outside of the formal Board meetings by specialist 
Non-Executive and Independent Members who could bring 
both constructive challenge and support to the Executive 
whilst providing greater assurance to the Board. 
Accordingly the Finance & Treasury Committee was established in 
2015 under the Chairmanship of Dr Martin Hurst, a then recently 
appointed non-executive member of the Board. In the two years 
since, I believe that this committee has proved very effective.
Development of new housing has been at the heart of bpha’s 
activities for many years. Post-Brexit referendum, there are 
numerous economic and political uncertainties and whilst bpha is 
committed to building new homes, this needs to be done prudently 
so as to protect the organisation’s long term viability. In 2017, the 
Board established a Development Committee to provide greater 
assurance and scrutiny over all development activity. Paul High, a 
co-opted independent Board member with extensive sector house 
building experience, has been appointed to Chair this committee. 
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the members 
of the Service Improvement Panel, The Resident Inspector Team 
and the Complaints Review Panel for their hard work and vital 
contribution throughout the year to governance, scrutiny, 
engagement and to driving further improvements.
People
The ongoing process of Board succession sadly means that we also 
had to say goodbye to three colleagues and I should like to take this 
opportunity to express my thanks to Neil McGregor-Patterson and 
Geoff Potton for their service to bpha, both of whom stepped down 
in 2016 after serving their full-term of six years, and to Sarah Ireland 
who, as the executive lead for development, played a significant role 
in the success of that department over the last decade. 
In addition to the appointment of Paul High, I was delighted to 
welcome Jill Ainscough to the Board as Chair of the Remuneration 
and Nominations Committee, replacing Neil. Ian Ailles has agreed 
to serve as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. Ian will succeed 
Peter Male and Peter will remain as Senior Independent Director. 
Profiles of all the non-executive members of the Board appointed 
since I took over as Chair are set out on page 13.
Over the last three years bpha has made a lot of new 
appointments at executive and head of service level which 
helped drive improvements as we grew in a carefully controlled 
manner. I am certain that the widened committee structure and 
new Board appointments have strengthened the range of skills 
and experience which complements the management team and 
provides a firm basis for future success.
Strategy
The Board has held a number of detailed strategic discussions 
during the last 12 months. We supported the Executive in committing 
to investment to support new ways of working, including a greater 
emphasis on remote and flexible working and in investing in IT to 
drive efficiencies. We take a long-term view and critically examined 
all aspects of our strategy and operations, including our capacity 
to deliver both Value for Money and more new homes. 
We have set out in these financial statements details of bpha’s 
business model and strategy, how we are investing in people to 
build capability and our development programme. To continue 
to be successful bpha needs to have the right people at all levels; 
bpha’s success has helped attract good people and good people 
are key to continued success. I should like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone at bpha for their contribution to this success and 
in delivering service for the benefit of all our customers.
