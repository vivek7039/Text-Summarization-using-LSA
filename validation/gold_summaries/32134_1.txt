 STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive's review
It’s difficult to remember a year when there’s been 
as much change in the food market as we’ve seen 
in the last twelve months. The rapid switch from 
food price deflation to inflation, changing retailer 
promotional strategies and the surprise result of the 
EU referendum have all combined to make this past 
year a difficult one, not only for Premier Foods but 
right across the UK food and drink industry.
Like others, our results have been adversely affected 
although I’m encouraged that we still out-performed 
the majority of our peer group, particularly in the 
latter half of the year. 
Fundamentally we’re doing the right things and our 
strategy is delivering in important key areas. We’ve 
continued to invest in our brands in line with consumer 
trends for snacking, convenience and health and 
six out of our eight key brands grew market share in 
2016/17. Our International business continues to grow 
strongly quarter after quarter and is now 34% larger 
in terms of revenue than it was when we started to 
invest in this area two years ago. And our strategic 
partnership with Nissin Foods is progressing well 
with the launch of Batchelors Super Noodles in a pot 
format in February together with our distribution of 
Nissin’s Soba brand of noodles in the UK. 
But in today’s challenging marketplace we can’t stand 
still. Together with the Board we’ve therefore taken 
the opportunity to review our strategy and agreed to 
adjust the balance of priorities between our strategic 
objectives of delivering revenue growth, driving 
cost and efficiency savings and cash generation. 
Previously this balance has been weighted more 
towards delivering category and revenue growth but 
in future will be more evenly balanced with a specific 
focus on reducing our net debt/EBITDA ratio to below 
3.0x, helping ensure we generate best value for our 
shareholders over the medium-term.
Our rebalanced strategy has three main pillars:
Protect and drive revenues 
We plan to continue investing in our brands but 
in a more focused way supporting innovation that 
is closer to our core brand offering and making 
sure that our marketing spend is used in the most 
efficient way to get the best return on investment. 
We’ll also continue to build on our strong customer 
relationships through closer collaboration, category 
management expertise and shopper insights helping 
us drive growth ahead of category levels.
Our plans in the UK will be enhanced by the strong 
momentum we’ve built in our International business. 
We’ve made great progress in key markets, notably 
Australia, and we aim to continue delivering double-
digit revenue growth in the medium-term through these 
markets and others. 
Our strategic partnerships will add further to our 
growth plans in the UK and internationally. The first 
products we’ve been working on together with Nissin 
are exceeding expectations with more to come, both 
in the UK and through tapping into Nissin’s broad 
global network. I’m also delighted that we’ve agreed 
Heads of Terms with Mondelez International for a 
new strategic global partnership for Cadbury cakes. 
This partnership is a significant improvement on our 
current licence arrangements and opens up exciting 
new growth opportunities in a much wider range of 
countries representing a further boost to our fast-
growing International business. It also gives us the 
potential to access the full Cadbury brand family in 
addition to the Oreo brand.
Cost and efficiency 
Closely managing our costs is imperative in the 
current environment and will be key to funding future 
investment in the business and supporting the profit 
needed to be able to accelerate our debt reduction. 
In January we announced a major cost reduction 
and efficiency programme designed to deliver 
savings of £20m over the next two years. 
A major part of this will come from combining our 
separate Sweet Treats and Grocery warehousing 
and logistics operations into one consolidated 
warehousing and transport solution helping drive 
greater efficiencies, improved customer service 
and fewer road miles. And we’re continuing to 
drive our continuous improvement programmes in 
manufacturing and procurement via both capital  
and non-capital cost reduction projects.
We’ve also streamlined our overhead cost base, 
reducing duplication and complexity and creating 
a leaner and more agile management structure. 
Regrettably this has meant over 50 valued 
colleagues have had to leave the business and  
we wish them well in their future careers. 
Cash generation 
We plan to keep a tight focus on managing cash. 
Our capital expenditure will be held to £20–£25m 
over the medium-term. Additionally, in March we 
announced an agreement with the trustees of our 
pension schemes to reduce our deficit payments to 
the schemes by £32m over the next three years. And 
we’re continuing to maintain diversified sources of 
financing through an extension of the maturity of our 
revolving credit facilities and launch of a new 5 year 
floating rate note due 2022. 
Whilst it’s been a difficult year overall, I believe we’ve 
continued to make progress in many important 
areas helping us out-perform the marketplace. By 
rebalancing our strategy to give equal focus to revenue 
growth, cost efficiencies and cash generation I’m 
confident we can be successful in this environment, 
reduce our leverage and deliver shareholder value.
