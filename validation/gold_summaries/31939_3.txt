targeting, giving customers much more 
value and offering retailers the chance 
to truly understand their customers, 
rewarding them whilst they are still in 
store, thereby maximising engagement. 
Large retailers can’t shift the dial 
The big retailers have substantial 
analogue schemes which are so 
embedded in the organisation that it is 
a challenge to upgrade and innovate 
their systems. However, with the growing 
importance of digital channels, in order 
to meet consumers’ expectations and 
utilise digital, they must look outside 
of their core schemes to remain 
competitive. This means they are 
looking for alternative routes to get new 
schemes to market quicker presenting 
a sizeable market opportunity for Eagle 
Eye’s innovative loyalty offering.
Measuring the effect of social media
There is increased pressure for 
businesses to measure marketing Return 
on Investment (“ROI”) across social 
media channels and prove that it’s a 
valuable revenue stream. This can be 
solved through real-time redemption 
capability, linking online to offline. 
Brands using Eagle Eye can send 
personalised offers to consumers and 
track redemptions in real-time, enabling 
businesses to invest back into the 
consumer’s social media channels. This 
real-time element ensures campaigns 
can be tracked and optimised to 
maximise success rates, whilst 
delivering genuine value to consumers. 
Through bridging online to offline 
creating digital connections to track 
behaviour, eventually retailers can 
augment the shopping trip beyond 
the internet, and build a richer 
single view of the customer.
We are uniquely placed to address 
these global issues which retailers 
are facing today by helping them 
create an intelligent real-time 
connection with their customers. 
Win, Transact, Deepen
Following my appointment in September 
2016 our focus has been on building 
on our strategy to become a global 
digital marketing leader. To achieve 
this we aspire to be “Better, Bigger, 
Faster” by improving in three core 
areas of customer interaction: “Win” 
(bringing more customers onto the 
Eagle Eye AIR platform); “Transact” 
(driving higher redemption volumes 
through the platform); and “Deepen” 
(building relationships with customers 
as the breadth of our product portfolio 
becomes more developed). 
1. Win
We made continued progress adding 
new retailers and brands to the AIR 
platform in the year. At the end of the 
year, Eagle Eye had 233 live users, 
including 74 FMCG brands, up from 
219 users with 70 brands at the end 
of 2016. At the start of the year we 
set out to increase the number of 
redemption points to the network; new 
retailer signings included the Society 
of London Theatres, English Heritage 
and additional Mitchells & Butlers 
(“M&B”) brands: Chicken Society, 
Son of Steak and Stonehouse. 
In addition, in May 2017, the Company 
signed a three-year contract with 
John Lewis PLC (“John Lewis”) for the 
deployment of AIR to deliver improved 
digital customer marketing. Since 
the financial year end the Company 
announced the two-year renewal 
of its contract with Toshiba Global 
Commerce Solutions for the use of 
the AIR platform within Asda that 
integrates with existing Asda-Walmart 
POS solutions across Asda stores. Both 
these UK contract announcements 
reinforce the clear competitive benefits 
our solutions deliver to leading retailers.
In March 2017, the Company signed 
a strategic partnership with TCC, a 
world leader in creating retail marketing 
programmes and long-term loyalty 
schemes, allowing Eagle Eye to 
extend its digital promotions offer into 
the European loyalty market. TCC 
works with many of Europe’s largest 
retailers, making them a valuable 
partner, and enabling the Company 
to accelerate growth outside the UK.
2. Transact
Redemption volumes, which are a 
key measure of usage of the AIR 
platform and of the success of our 
“transact” strategy, have grown by 
58% year-on-year to 60.4m (2016: 
38.4m). Volume growth was primarily 
driven by the full year benefit of Asda 
volumes, the first phase roll-out for 
Sainsbury’s in the fourth quarter of 
2017 and increased brand activity 
through redemption outlets.
Using Asda as a nationwide redemption 
channel, from July 2016 to October 
2016, Coke Zero Sugar ran a 
promotional campaign across the AIR 
platform that generated a redemption 
rate of over 10%, compared to the 
typical redemption rate of a traditional 
analogue campaign of 0.5%–2% 
(Shopper Technology Institute/Juniper 
Research). This meaningful uplift in 
redemptions is proof that Eagle Eye can 
successfully drive higher redemption 
rates through the power of digital. 
As part of this campaign, Eagle Eye 
formed a new partnership with the 
life cycle social advertising company, 
Driftrock. This unique partnership 
now enables the success rate of 
advertising on social media channels to 
be measured through to redemption. 
During the year we have successfully 
powered digital campaigns for leading 
drinks brands through the food and 
beverage network. These brands 
include Diageo, AB InBev, Pernod 
Ricard, Heineken and Suntory. Working 
with each brand and their media 
agency the Company has coordinated 
a number of promotions targeted by 
region using a combination of web 
landing pages, programmatic display, 
traditional advertising, game and 
dating apps plus social media lead 
ads. The redemption outlets benefited 
from the increased footfall and spend 
per head and fraud is reduced as all 
the campaigns have used unique 
Chief Executive’s review
I was delighted to take 
the opportunity to become 
the Company’s CEO in 
September 2016. I had 
already spent a significant 
part of my career looking 
at how data can change 
consumer marketing, and 
immediately recognised the 
great potential for Eagle Eye 
to revolutionise the way that 
businesses engage with 
consumers. 
Traditional and analogue forms of 
promotions, rewards and loyalty 
programmes have lost their lustre 
with consumers who are increasingly 
looking for relevant, timely and 
personalised rewards that offer 
genuine value. It is Eagle Eye’s 
mission to meet this changing 
consumer demand, and I believe the 
Company has the proven, scalable 
technology to transform an industry. 
In this past year, we have established 
a new structure and ways of working 
internally to ensure we can deliver 
optimum results for both the Company 
and our customers. We have gained 
significant momentum, driven by our 
ambition to be “Better, Bigger, Faster.” 
We now have a clear vision and strategy 
in place and delivered results ahead 
of our expectations during the year.
Growing market opportunity
There are three critical themes currently 
affecting the marketplace which present 
a significant opportunity for Eagle Eye.
Loyalty and the need for  
real-time engagement
We are seeing a transition from 
the classic plastic card to digital 
distribution. Traditional methods which 
give 1% discounts and a “rear view” 
perspective on purchase behaviour are 
being replaced by digital alternatives. 
Real-time offers enable highly relevant 
The business is now more nimble, robust and able to 
clearly engage with our customers and the market… 
I am looking forward to this next stage of growth and 
the opportunity we have to be market leaders in the 
digital marketing space.

With extensive experience with 
system providers and clients, David 
has a thorough understanding of 
customer service and delivery. The 
Group will leverage his experience 
to ensure first class operations and 
delivery across Eagle Eye’s network 
of customers. We have also seen 
significant development within the sales 
team and a clear focus on the sales 
process led by Helen Slaven, having 
joined as Sales Director in May 2016. 
The past 12 months has seen rapid 
growth in our team. The average 
headcount increased from 73 to 
100, as a new office was opened in 
Toronto, Canada and as there was 
further investment in people across the 
business. We have introduced a new 
life skills training workshop based on 
the fundamental philosophy that people 
can benefit from understanding more 
about themselves, how they perform at 
their best and what triggers sub-optimal 
performance. A key way for us to be a 
stand out employer and a great place to 
work is to be able to provide benefits for 
our people benefiting them in all parts of 
their lives. Furthermore, our investment 
in people improves the capability and 
competency of the staff in the business. 
The values that we have in place 
shape our behaviour, reinforce our 
culture and determine our approach 
to recruitment. This is what we 
now call The Purple Standard. 
The skill, dedication and talent of our 
people are fundamental to the continued 
success of our growing business. 
We have made great progress over 
the last 12 months and will continue 
to make improvements to ensure we 
attract and retain the best talent. 
Looking ahead 
This past year we have recorded great 
progress against our objectives. The 
business is now more nimble, robust 
and able to clearly engage with our 
customers and the market. We have 
successfully laid the foundations for a 
great year ahead. I am looking forward 
to this next stage of growth and the 
opportunity we have to be market 
leaders in the digital marketing space. 
Tim Mason
Chief Executive Officer 
Our beliefs and values
The values that we have in place shape our 
behaviour, reinforce our culture and determine our 
approach to recruitment. This is what we now call 
The Purple Standard.
Chief Executive’s review continued
“one use only” codes. Real-time 
results have given the brand owners 
a previously unknown insight into 
which media, types of visuals and 
offers give the best ROI/ROS across 
any given campaign, allowing the 
brand owner to “dial up” or “dial 
down” on media and change or 
adapt the campaign accordingly. 
In messaging services, despite the 
Public Health England Stoptober 
campaign not including an SMS element 
this year, SMS volumes still increased 
10% to 44.4m (2016: 40.3m), as a result 
of messaging for Asurion and the cross 
selling of messaging services to the 
existing client base.
3. Deepen
We have made significant progress in 
deepening our Tier 1 client relationships 
during the year with 53% of revenue, 
£5.9m (2016: 33%, £2.1m) the result of 
an extension of our service offering with 
major clients. The embedding of Eagle 
Eye’s technology within these clients is 
a clear demonstration of the capability 
and reliability of our technology 
as a digital marketing platform. 
During the year our Tier 1 customers 
further adopted our range of 
products to drive their customer 
focused agendas and accelerate 
their digital ambitions in order to gain 
competitive advantage. This will help 
to drive meaningful transactional 
revenue growth in future periods.
Further progress in the established 
F&B sector increased revenue by 20% 
to £1.8m (2016: £1.5m). This increase 
has been driven as existing clients 
onboarded additional brands (including 
Las Iguanas and La Tasca along with 
new M&B concepts, Chicken Society 
and Son of Steak) to the AIR platform 
as well as utilising more of our services.
Casual Dining Group and Prezzo have 
expanded their capabilities through 
the implementation of staff discount 
schemes and we also enriched our 
white label mobile app across the M&B 
estate through the integration of Flypay 
to enable pay at table. Our relationship 
with Tesco Clubcard was also enhanced 
through the addition of English Heritage 
and RAC to the platform to allow 
customers to part pay for membership 
in points and top up with cash. 
Furthermore, we’ve also added 
the AA as an issuance partner to 
deliver offers to their customers 
for redemption in M&B outlets.
Revenue generated from client 
subscription fees and transactions 
over the network represented 68% 
of total revenue (2016: 80%). This 
reflects the progress we are making 
in deepening Eagle Eye’s system 
capability within major accounts, which 
will open up recurring transactional 
revenues in future periods.
Product development
In 2017 we continued to innovate and 
enhance our software platform to 
meet the demands of our customers 
and evolving consumer trends. 
Performance improvements were 
made to support our growing Tier 1 
grocery volumes, while we extended 
reporting and relationship management 
capabilities for issuance partners. 
With the addition of supplier funding 
functionality, we have created the 
ability for brands to interact with 
retailers’ loyalty schemes through 
holding buckets of points or value for 
discount that can be used in targeted 
promotions to end consumers, all 
redeemable in store or online through 
direct integration with the point of sale. 
Our enhanced wallet capabilities add 
flexibility to retailers’ loyalty offering, 
allowing consumers to be targeted 
with specific promotions. AIR has now 
been integrated to both Android and 
Apple Pay to enable payments, offers 
and rewards to be saved directly. 
We also invested in the integration of 
AIR with social platforms including 
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, 
through partners such as Driftrock 
to drive audience numbers for 
brands and retailers. The partnership 
with Driftrock allows Eagle Eye 
to track promotional activity from 
social media to store redemptions 
and extends the Company’s 
offering along the value chain.
Financial results
Group revenue increased by 71% 
to £11.1m (2016: £6.5m) for the year. 
Of total revenue, 85% (£9.4m) was 
contributed from the core AIR platform 
(2016: 72%, £4.6m). 
The Group’s gross profit was £9.8m, 
representing a gross margin of 88% 
(2016: £5.1m, 79%). The increased gross 
profits were reinvested to drive future 
growth, meaning that adjusted EBITDA 
loss was held at £1.8m (2016: £1.8m 
loss). To provide a better guide to the 
underlying business performance, 
adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based 
payment charges along with 
depreciation, amortisation, interest 
and tax from the measure of profit. 
Following the successful placing 
completed in June 2017 which raised 
£5.8m (net of costs), the Group had net 
assets of £8.9m as at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £5.9m) including cash and cash 
equivalents of £3.7m (2016: £1.3m). 
During the year the Group extended its 
currently unutilised three year revolving 
loan facility with Barclays Bank PLC to 
£3.0m (2016: £1.5m) which together 
with the funds raised in the placing 
strengthens the Group’s balance sheet. 
People 
In addition to the Board changes at the 
beginning of the year, the management 
team has been further strengthened by 
the recruitment of a new Chief Operating 
Officer, David Aylmer, in May 2017.
