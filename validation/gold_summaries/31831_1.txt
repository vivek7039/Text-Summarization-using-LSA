Chief Executive Officer’s Review  
Ronnie George
Using our knowledge to create 
excellence in ventilation. 
Overview
I am pleased to report another year of strong results as we 
continue to build on the success of the past. We completed 
two acquisitions in the year, in line with our strategy of making 
selective value‑ adding acquisitions, and also successfully 
integrated the acquisitions made in the prior year. The acquisition 
of Breathing Buildings, a natural and hybrid ventilation system 
provider to the education sector in the UK was completed in 
December 2016 and more recently VoltAir System, a Swedish 
producer of heat recovery ventilation solutions for primarily the 
commercial new build market was completed in May 2017.
The integration of the National Ventilation and Airtech brands was 
completed in the year with a significant increase in their operating 
margins through the pre‑ planned product “swap‑ out” initiatives, 
product upgrades and the closure of the small manufacturing 
assembly operation in Lasham, Hampshire. The closure of the 
Lasham facility (part of our factory relocation project) was made 
possible through a product range development initiative, which 
resulted in the integration of the product supply inside the existing 
UK manufacturing footprint. I am also pleased to advise that all ten 
factory operatives at the facility were able to find alternative, local 
employment post closure.
The Group delivered organic revenue growth of 2.1% on a constant 
currency basis, in spite of the weakness in the Residential Public 
Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) market and the 
small decline in the UK commercial sector; all of our other market 
sectors across the Group delivered organic growth in the financial 
year. Input cost inflation has been rising, largely as a result of the 
weakness of Sterling versus the US Dollar; in mitigation we achieved 
more traction on our selling price initiatives towards the end of 
the financial year.
Torin‑ Sifan, after a decline in revenue in the first half of our 
financial year, delivered a full year organic revenue growth of 
2.8% on a constant currency basis, assisted by the sales of the 
new, more energy‑efficient and quieter electronically commutated 
(EC) 3 phase motorised impeller range. 
Summary
 > Revenue of £185.1 million achieved by both 
organic and inorganic growth totalling 19.8%
 > Another year of strong financial results with 
adjusted operating profit of £35.6 million, an 
increase of 9.6% over the prior year
 > Two acquisitions completed in the year have 
further diversified the Group’s market exposure, 
which now extends to new construction in the 
Nordics and a greater exposure to commercial 
projects in the UK
 > Continuing investment in new product development 
including the upgraded offer to public housing 
refurbishment in the UK and a further extension 
of our market‑ leading residential heat recovery 
systems range
 > The completion of our second Management 
Development Programme, developing our 
managers and leaders of tomorrow Volution Group plc

Ventilation Group segment
The Ventilation Group’s performance resulted in a 21.6% increase 
in revenue on prior year (16.3% at constant currency). Organic 
growth was 7.3% (2.0% at constant currency) including the 
organic decline in revenue from the UK Residential Public RMI 
market, offset by the continuing strong organic growth in the UK 
Residential New Build market and in the Nordics.
United Kingdom
Sales in our UK Residential New Build sector were £23.4 million 
(2016: £19.8 million), growth of 18.2%, assisted in the year by the 
additional revenues from National Ventilation, acquired in May 2016. 
Organic growth achieved was 8.3% with continuing growth in 
the order book. The Kinetic Advance, initially launched in 2016, 
is now gaining good revenue traction and is now being widely 
specified in a number of residential new projects for our financial 
year 2018. This product won “Energy Efficient Product of the Year” 
at the widely acclaimed Chartered Institution of Building Services 
Engineers Building Performance Awards in February 2017 
together with “Domestic Ventilation Product of the Year” at the 
prestigious Heating and Ventilation News Awards in April 2017. 
The UK Residential Public RMI market remained challenging with 
total revenue of £15.8 million up 10.1% on the prior year assisted 
by the acquisition of Airtech in May 2016. In this market, although 
our overall share has increased as a result of this acquisition, we 
experienced an organic decline of 9.2% in the year. The Revive, 
one of the most efficient, quiet and discreet bathroom and 
kitchen fans available to the public market sector, established 
itself during the year as did the upgraded Airtech product range. 
The Revive also won an award in the Air Movement category at 
the Heating and Ventilation News Awards in April 2017. Further 
new product launches are planned for later in 2017 and we have 
now combined the public housing resources of the acquired 
Airtech business with that of the Vent‑ Axia team, to provide a 
more diverse and compelling offer to the public market sector. 
The UK private refurbishment sector performed better in the year 
with revenue of £22.7 million, an increase of 7.4% on prior year 
mainly due to the acquisition of National Ventilation. The second 
half of the financial year delivered an organic growth of 1.6% 
having declined in the first half of the year, resulting in a flat 
performance overall. Despite the market being subdued, we 
gained some significant new accounts towards the end of our 
financial year and have had greater success with price increase 
delivery in recent months. These successes, together with 
upselling our silent range of products across all our UK brands, 
give us a more optimistic outlook for revenue growth in this 
market sector for our financial year 2018. 
UK Commercial revenue grew by 51.0% in the year to 
£32.7 million (2016: £21.7 million) mainly as a result of the 
acquisition of Breathing Buildings in December 2016 and the 
full year effect of Diffusion, acquired in the prior year. Organic 
revenue declined by 0.3% in the year. Since the acquisition of 
Diffusion in December 2015, sales have performed very strongly, 
requiring us to increase the manufacturing capacity of the business 
to support the increasing demand. The acquisitions of Diffusion 
and Breathing Buildings have improved our access to the 
attractive new build commercial projects market and provide 
us with a more balanced exposure in the UK to both the new 
and refurbishment opportunities in the commercial sector.
UK Export sales were £10.2 million (2016: £7.8 million), strong 
growth of 30.8% (20.7% at constant currency), benefiting from 
the additional export sales from Diffusion with an organic growth 
of 21.0% (10.8% growth at constant currency). Sales of our 
market‑ leading residential heat recovery products and our fan coil 
range have performed particularly well in Eire with exports from 
the UK also benefiting from weaker Sterling.
Nordics
Sales in the Nordics sector were £30.8 million (2016: £25.5 million), 
an increase of 20.8% (8.8% at constant currency) with organic revenue 
growth of 16.5% (5.1% growth at constant currency). Sales of the 
Calima fan, the first app‑ controlled extractor fan on the market, 
have developed well in the year extending our leadership position 
in the Nordic RMI market for high end, near silent, energy‑ efficient 
solutions. Welair, acquired in December 2015, has provided us 
with the capability to manufacture heat recovery ventilation 
systems for the new construction market in the Nordics and our 
focus on this market has been enhanced with the acquisition of 
VoltAir System in May 2017.
VoltAir System has a capability to supply highly configurable, 
specialised solutions for heat recovery ventilation in new construction 
projects. A modular system that can be completed onsite enables 
us to supply ventilation products for applications where our 
competitors are restricted due to the size and configuration of 
their units. VoltAir System had a strong order intake following its 
acquisition and this strong forward order book provides us with 
confidence for the year ahead.
Central Europe
Sales in Central Europe were £27.5 million, growth of 15.3% 
(1.3% at constant currency). Sales in Germany grew 17.6% 
on the prior year (3.3% at constant currency) with stronger 
performance towards the end of the financial year. We have 
continued to invest in new product development, marketing and 
the sales team in Central Europe in order to support the targeted 
higher organic growth in the future. In Belgium, where we are a 
leading supplier of heat recovery ventilation systems for the new 
build market, the Kinetic Advance has started to gain traction in 
sales and further enhancements to the range are to be added in 
the financial year 2018.
OEM (Torin-Sifan) segment
Our OEM (T orin‑ Sifan) segment’ s revenue in the year was £22.0 million 
(2016: £20.4 million), an increase of 7.7% (2.8% at constant currency), 
with a stronger performance from sales in the second half of the year. 
The UK had a generally mild winter and our sales volume of traditional 
spares for gas boilers declined slightly, mitigated by a price increase 
in other products. Our new EC 3 motorised impeller range was 
launched in the second half of the year and sales to both UK 
and export customers are progressing well. The market for sales 
of EC direct current motorised impellers is expected to grow, 
underpinned by new construction growth and regulatory drivers, 
both in the UK and in Continental Europe. Strategic Report

Another year of progress with 
good organic growth and inorganic 
growth from our new acquisitions, 
and an overall strong year of results 
and cash generation.
Ronnie George
Chief Executive Officer
Three strategic pillars 
Our strategy continues to focus on three key pillars:
Our core markets were again extended in the 2017 financial year 
as we acquired Breathing Buildings in the UK and VoltAir System 
in the Nordics. Both businesses focus on the new construction 
markets and improve our product portfolio, which now has a 
more diversified mix of RMI and new construction. 
The acquisitions made in the 2016 financial year have all been 
progressing well and, although not classed as delivering organic 
growth until one year after acquisition, did grow revenue in their 
first year. The expected synergies from the acquisition of NVA 
Services (National Ventilation and Airtech brands) were largely 
delivered in the year. Further synergies are expected resulting 
from more recent changes including the closure of the Lasham 
production facility and launch of new upgraded products 
manufactured at our other UK production facilities.
These new markets, as well as the original core markets for 
Volution, continue to benefit from the favourable regulatory 
backdrop that focuses on reducing carbon emissions from 
buildings (in particular new buildings) and improving air quality, 
as well as the need to improve energy efficiency. 
The ventilation market remains highly fragmented and we will 
continue to pursue acquisition opportunities leveraging the Group 
capabilities in operations, procurement, distribution and finance, 
which we have and will continue to invest in.
We will continue to provide strong central leadership in research 
and development to facilitate the Group’s growth. Investment in 
our own sourcing team in China is delivering good value to the 
procurement efforts around the enlarged Group.
The investment we made during the year in the new production 
facility for T orin‑Sifan has helped support the organic growth during 
the year. Sales of the new EC 3 motorised impeller range are gaining 
traction and production of the range at this new facility is going well 
with dedicated space reserved for further production lines to 
underpin the expected growth of the range.
People
As our Group becomes more complex and more diverse through 
acquisition and organic growth, it is essential that we have a talent 
pool to support our development plans. In April 2017 we completed 
our second internal Management Development Programme (MDP), 
which consisted of 15 high potential managers from across the 
Group. Such has been the success of this programme that we 
have decided not to wait a further year before commencing the 
next programme and will be starting our third MDP in November 2017. 
The programme itself is always oversubscribed and this time will 
consist of 18 delegates.
During the year we completed two new acquisitions in existing 
Volution geographies. The integration of new acquisitions has 
become easier as our experience of this process grows. I am 
extremely proud of the dedication and commitment of our talented 
group of employees, who show a great deal of sensitivity when 
new acquisitions join the Group, and as a result of these actions 
and behaviour we have been able to successfully build a more 
geographically and market diverse Group since listing in 2014. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every 
one of our employees for their part in this success.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well with organic growth ahead 
of that achieved in the same period in the prior year. Our significant 
investment in new product development as well as specific initiatives 
in both public and private RMI are translating into benefits as 
anticipated. As a result, the Board is confident of delivering good 
progress in this financial year.
