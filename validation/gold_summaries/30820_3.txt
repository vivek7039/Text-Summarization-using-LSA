 Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
On behalf of your Board, I am delighted to report that we have made good 
progress on both our financial and operational metrics and delivered another 
year of growth in shareholder returns, with £451 million returned to 
shareholders in 2017 in total dividends. Group revenue for the year increased 
by 7.9% to £3,965.2 million (2016: £3,676.2 million) and we were pleased to 
report an operating profit* of £841.2 million, an increase of 10.1% year on year 
(2016: £764.3 million). More detailed information on our financial performance 
can be found on pages 42 to 45. During the year, we completed 
14,541 much-needed new homes in the UK, which represents a 4.8% growth 
on last year, whilst also continuing to make a significant contribution to the 
communities in which we operate, where we invested over £400 million 
through planning obligations. I am proud to report that since we implemented 
our strategy outlined in 2011, Taylor Wimpey has delivered nearly 87k new 
homes across the country and returned £1.2 billion to shareholders. 
The housing cycle
Trading performance and customer demand remained resilient throughout  
the year and in our core geographies. You can find more perspective on 
market conditions on pages 10 and 11. We recognise that the outcome of  
the General Election, combined with the on-going Brexit negotiations, has 
resulted in greater political uncertainty. We maintain and welcome an open 
and active dialogue with the Government and the main political parties. We 
are pleased to note that all the main parties understand the importance of 
housebuilding to the country. Whist we have not seen any adverse impact  
on the new build housing market or consumer confidence, we are monitoring 
both the consumer and political environment. We remain confident that our 
strategy, with a robust balance sheet, high-quality landbank and a highly 
experienced management team, provides the resilience and flexibility to 
enable us to deal with changing market conditions, as required, and to 
perform well through changing market conditions. More information on our 
strategy can be found on pages 20 and 21 and you will see the key themes 
reflected throughout this document, and importantly in our general approach 
to business.
Health and safety
Health and safety will always be our non-negotiable top priority and continues 
to be the first item discussed at every plc Board and regional board meeting 
throughout the business. It also remains one of the highest rated questions 
in our annual employee engagement survey, with 98% of employees believing 
Taylor Wimpey takes health and safety in the workplace seriously 
(2016: 98%). We are pleased to note our Annual Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) 
for reportable injuries per 100,000 employees and contractors was a record 
low of 152 in 2017 (2016: 211) and our efforts and level of focus on health 
and safety will of course continue. More information can be found on pages 
28 to 30, including details of our own internal review following the tragic events 
at Grenfell Tower, London, in June 2017.
Customer service
Customer service continues to be a key priority for all Taylor Wimpey 
employees. You may recall that in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, 
I advised that during 2016 we implemented several changes to our customer 
service approach. These included enhancing the structure of our customer 
service teams, through the creation of a new role of Head of Customer 
Service in each of our 24 regional businesses, which has helped our overall 
performance. During 2017, we worked hard throughout the business to instil 
A responsible

Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report and embed these new initiatives into our standard operating processes and 
culture. It is here that I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and 
every employee on behalf of our shareholders and the Board for all their efforts 
in this area. I have been impressed by the hard work and commitment shown 
by all of our teams. While we recognise that we don’t get everything right and 
there is still, of course, more work to do, it has been very pleasing to see a 
significant improvement in our customer satisfaction scores in recent months, 
which validates the investments and efforts we have made into enhancements 
in this area. We will be prioritising further improvements in customer service 
in 2018. 
It is, however, equally, if not more important, to acknowledge, reflect on and 
address situations where we have not always got it right. Following concern 
expressed by some customers, during 2017 we carried out a review of 
historic lease structures and, in particular, ten-year doubling ground rent 
clauses, which we had stopped using on new developments from late 2011. 
Whilst Taylor Wimpey implemented these leases in good faith and the terms 
were clearly set out in the relevant leases, it was clear from our review that  
the impact of these doubling rent review clauses was causing some of  
our customers understandable concern, particularly from a mortgageability 
and saleability perspective. We acknowledge that the introduction of these 
doubling clauses in 2007 was not consistent with our high standards of 
customer service and we have quite rightly apologised to customers for  
the unintended consequences and concern that we caused. In our Annual 
General Meeting trading update of April 2017, we announced that we  
would make a provision, before tax, of £130 million in the first half accounts  
to allow us to put things right for our affected customers. At the same time, 
we implemented, on a voluntary basis, the Taylor Wimpey Ground Rent 
Review Assistance Scheme, to enable us to work with the relevant freeholders 
who own the leases, in order to convert our customers’ ten-year doubling 
ground rent clauses to leases based on RPI, should they elect to participate 
in the Scheme. 
As part of our review, we also stopped selling houses on a leasehold basis  
on our new developments with effect from the start of 2017, other than in 
exceptional circumstances such as where Taylor Wimpey does not own  
the site on a freehold basis.
Charities and local community groups
We believe that as a responsible business, we must actively contribute to 
helping others whether financially, with our time, energy or expertise. We 
remain highly committed to supporting charities and local community groups 
in the areas in which we operate, and I am extremely proud to see the 
personal commitments our employees continue to make to our charitable 
partners. We aim to be an aspirational housebuilding brand that is recognised 
for the good that is given back to our local communities by both our 
employees and our business as a whole. Our primary goal is to genuinely 
improve the position of the causes that we support. The other goal is to 
engage our employees in these activities as we recognise it is good for their 
personal development and self-awareness. During 2017, it was pleasing to 
see many of our employees participate in our volunteering scheme, which 
allows employees to take paid time off to volunteer at one of our national 
charities. We hope to see an increasing number take advantage of this 
opportunity in 2018.

taylorwimpey.co.uk In addition to our planning obligations during 2017, we donated and 
fundraised over £1 million for registered charities (2016: over £875k). 
In addition, a further c.£90k was donated to other organisations (2016: 
c.£159k), sponsoring community events, local sports teams, social clubs and 
many other initiatives. More information can be found within our Sustainability 
Report 2017 which will be available on our website in March 2018.
Dividends
A key part of our investment proposition is our commitment to a reliable 
dividend stream for our investors through the housing market cycle. 
Subject to shareholder approval each year, the Company will pay an ordinary 
dividend of approximately 5% of Group net assets which will be at least 
£150 million in dividends per annum. This is intended to provide a reliable 
minimum annual return to shareholders throughout the cycle. This Ordinary 
Dividend Policy was subject to prudent and comprehensive stress testing 
against various downside scenarios, which also included a reduction of 20% 
in average selling prices and a 30% reduction in volumes. 
The payment of ordinary dividends will continue to be supplemented by 
additional significant special dividends at appropriate times in the cycle.  
Our Special Dividend Policy will pay out to shareholders the free cash 
generated by the Group after land investment, all working capital, taxation  
and other cash requirements of the business in executing our strategy in  
the medium term, and once the Group’s ordinary dividends have been met.
Subject to shareholder approval the 2017 final ordinary dividend of c.2.44 
pence per share will be paid on 18 May 2018 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 6 April 2018 (2016 final dividend: 2.29 pence 
per share). In combination with the interim dividend of 2.30 pence per share 
(2016 interim dividend: 0.53 pence per share) this gives a total ordinary 
dividend for the year of c.4.74 pence per share (2016 ordinary dividend: 
2.82 pence per share).
This dividend will be paid as a cash dividend, and shareholders are once again 
being offered the opportunity to reinvest all of their ordinary dividend under the 
Dividend Re-Investment Plan (DRIP), details of which are available from our 
Registrar and on our website. Elections to join the Plan must reach the 
Registrar by 26 April 2018 in order to be effective for this dividend. Further 
details can be found on our website www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate
In addition, on 14 July 2017, we returned £300.5 million to shareholders  
by way of a special dividend, equating to 9.2 pence per ordinary share.  
As previously announced in August 2017 we intend to return c.£340 million  
to shareholders in July 2018, equating to 10.4 pence per ordinary share, 
subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). This is 
proposed to be paid on 13 July 2018 as a cash dividend to all shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 1 June 2018. Shareholders will be 
offered the opportunity to reinvest all of their 2018 special cash dividend under 
the DRIP, for which elections to join the Plan must reach the Registrar by 
22 June 2018.
The Board confirms its intention to keep the mechanics of how the Company 
will pay special dividends, including the merits of undertaking a share buyback 
at some point in the future should it become appropriate to do so, under 
regular review. 
Corporate Governance
We are and remain committed to good corporate governance and believe 
that integrity and transparency are key to attaining this. Corporate governance 
is embedded at every level within the business and is a reflection of our core 
values and culture, policies, and relationships with all of our stakeholders. 
A key part of good corporate governance is ensuring the Board which 
governs has the necessary balance and skills which are both relevant and 
complementary, and can benefit the Board and the business with their 
experience, background and diversity. More information about each Director 
can be found within the biographies on pages 46 and 47. I was delighted to 
announce in January that after a rigorous process, we appointed Gwyn Burr 
to the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director, with effect from  
1 February 2018. Gwyn has excellent and relevant experience gained from 
both her previous executive experience, primarily focused on customer 
service, and also from her more recent non-executive roles and we very much 
look forward to working with her. We also announced that Rob Rowley will 
stand down from the Board following the AGM on 26 April 2018. I would like 
to again express both my and the Board’s gratitude for Rob’s long and valued 
contribution to the Board over the past eight years, including both as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director and as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
Dame Kate Barker will succeed Rob as the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director, following the AGM, and as planned, Humphrey Singer succeeded 
Rob as the Chairman of the Audit Committee in January 2018. 
The annual Board Evaluation is an important exercise and one that your  
Board as a whole and individually takes very seriously. In line with the UK 
Governance Code, we ensure that the Evaluation is externally facilitated at 
least once every three years, and is conducted internally in intervening years 
and formally facilitated by myself and the Company Secretary. The 2017 
Evaluation was externally facilitated by Manchester Square Partners (MSP) 
and I am pleased to report that the outcome of the review concluded that the 
Board is still functioning well, with a high degree of mutual trust, respect and 
integrity whilst being open, straight-talking and challenging in nature. It was 
also pleasing to note that MSP found that the Board operated with first class 
governance. There were inevitably some areas for improvement and additional 
focus and these are already being addressed by the Board. Further details of 
the outcome of the Evaluation and how it was conducted are set out in the 
Corporate Governance section of this report on page 61.
I would also like to touch on executive remuneration: last year, following  
our usual constructive consultation with our shareholders, our Remuneration 
Policy received very strong support at the 2017 AGM, for which we are very 
grateful. This enabled the Company, via the Remuneration Committee, to take 
into account a number of views and perspectives to put in place an 
appropriate remuneration framework having regard to a number of factors 
including: the overall economic and market environment as well as the 
Company’s strategy and targets. 
During 2017, we published our first Modern Slavery Statement in line with 
statutory requirements, and we will publish our second statement in 2018.  
We strongly support the legislation and do not tolerate any form of slavery, 
forced labour or human trafficking in our business or in our supply chain. I am 
pleased to confirm that our risk assessment found that in general the risk of 
modern slavery occurring in our business or supply chain is low. However, 
there are some higher risk areas in the supply chain and we will be engaging 
with the suppliers in these areas to make sure they have the right policies and 
strategies in place to mitigate these risks. We have a Modern Slavery Act 
working group, chaired by our Group Legal Director and Company Secretary, 
which oversees our approach.

culture, policies, and relationships

People
We believe in investing in our people and in developing our internal ‘bench’ 
and future pipeline of talent as this is key to ensuring their future success and, 
in turn, that of Taylor Wimpey. The Nomination Committee plays a key role in 
the oversight of our progress in this regard. An important part of our approach 
is a continued investment in the skills and development of our employees 
across the business, as we work to ensure that Taylor Wimpey attracts and 
retains the best people in the industry through the cycle. It was therefore 
particularly pleasing to be ranked as one of Glassdoor’s ‘Top 20 Best 
Companies To Work For’ in the UK. This is based solely on employee and 
former employee feedback and is therefore an important external benchmark. 
In 2017, we undertook an employee engagement survey with an 
encouragingly high participation rate of 72%. We were impressed with the 
overall results and very high level of engagement across the whole business. 
We were pleased to see improved scores in customer service, flexible 
working, as well as training and benefits package. Perhaps more importantly, 
it also identified areas, such as better collaboration between some functions, 
where further work is needed and we will of course prioritise these areas 
in 2018. 
As part of the Government’s welcomed employee voice initiative, during  
2017 we established our National Employee Forum (NEF) with elected 
representatives from across the business. The main objective of the NEF, 
which has already met on two occasions, will be to gather employee feedback 
on individual topics important to the business and share it with the relevant 
members of the senior management team – and of course vice versa. The 
NEF will build upon the existing regional Employee Consultative Committee 
structure to enhance the dialogue between the Board, Group Management 
Team and our employees. Kate Barker, as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, and I will be attending the Forum from time to time, in addition to 
the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary, the Group HR Director  
and other senior management.

Diversity
We value diversity in every sense at Taylor Wimpey and aim to be an inclusive 
employer attracting, retaining and promoting employees from all backgrounds. 
This contributes to creativity and innovation in our workforce, widens our talent 
pool, boosts employee engagement, helps us to better reflect our customer 
base and ultimately improves our decision-making. Whilst we have made 
great strides since setting up our Diversity and Inclusivity Steering Committee, 
we recognise there is more to do and we are committed to improving further. 
All our senior leaders have attended our Open Minds diversity training course 
and from 2018, we will extend this further and all new employees will 
complete an e-learning module on diversity and inclusion as part of their 
induction. During 2017 we also held networking sessions for senior women in 
our business to meet with Group Management Team members and share 
experiences and insights. 
Outlook
We are confident that we can adapt to changing market conditions from a 
position of strength and perform well, underpinning our value proposition to 
shareholders and other stakeholders. Reflecting on the good progress made 
in 2017 and the lessons learnt, the Taylor Wimpey team is looking forward to 
the challenges and opportunities that 2018 will bring. 
I have already thanked all of our employees earlier in this Statement, so I 
would like to end by thanking all of our customers, shareholders and other 
stakeholders for their ongoing support.
