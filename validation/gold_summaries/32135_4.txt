Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. A new look for our 
seasonal range
We have taken a new approach to our seasonal ale 
calendar this year. Each season sees one ‘Super 
Seasonal’ cask ale, two more cask ales both available 
for six to eight weeks each and, for the first time ever, 
a seasonal keg too – for spring, it was a Black IPA.  
The pump clips and keg lenses for all the seasonal 
beers have been designed with our other brands in 
mind, to ensure they are unmistakeably Fuller’s.
Great chefs in Fuller’s kitchens
We are one of the only companies where everyone from 
Kitchen Porter to Head Chef is developed through the 
Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild training programme. All levels of  
our chefs’ focus on keeping classical skills alive, cooking 
delicious fresh food and making sure that the craft and 
passion in our chefs rival that of our brewers.

“ THE STABLE IS AND ALWAYS 
WILL BE A CATHEDRAL TO 
FANTASTIC CIDER AND 
DELICIOUS PIZZA WITH 
AUTHENTIC INGREDIENTS.  
IT’S OUR CRAFT”
SEB RAY-MARTHUR 
ASSISTANT MANAGER,   
FISTRAL BEACH
LOCAL. 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
ADVENTUROUS.
T 
he Stable now sits proudly with 17 sites across 
the UK and as well as being famous for its 
incredible range of ciders and delicious pizzas, it is 
becoming equally famous for the locality of its 
ingredients and the amazing names it gives its pizzas.
Take The Headland Herbivore for instance, on the 
menu at Fistral Beach, a delicious veggie treat 
heroing Cornish Blue cheese, or The Fresh 
Hawaiian, with local ham from the West Country. 
In Birmingham, your lamb will have come from 
Dorset, but what’s not to love about The Perry 
Barr Baa or even The Smethwick Scorcher – 
although the three chilli rating might deter those 
with a weaker constitution. And if it’s chicken 
you’re after, the Bournville Bantam makes more 
than a passing nod to the area’s heritage, although 
it doesn’t have any chocolate on it.
It’s not just the locals who might be turned on  
by the menu though. The Stable is building an 
enviable reputation with the vegan community 
with a range of pizzas, salads and sides on all Stable 
menus. Finally, there is one pizza that appears 
throughout the estate – The Longhorn Jim. This  
is a tribute to Jim Armstrong, who has supplied 
beef to The Stable from his farm in Little Bredy, 
Dorset, since the first Stable was opened in 
Bridport in 2009.
