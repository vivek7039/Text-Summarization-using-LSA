Chairman’s Statement
B
loomsbury has delivered a robust 
performance over the year to  
28 February 2017. Group revenue 
is up 15% (9% at constant currencies) and 
profit before taxation and highlighted 
items after incurring the development 
costs for new digital content products 
is £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million), 
above market expectations. The Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 5.6 
pence per share to shareholders on the 
register on 25 August 2017. This represents an increase in full year 
dividend of 5% and continues Bloomsbury’s dividend growth each 
year for over 20 years.
The past year was Bloomsbury’s 30th and the 23rd year of listing on 
the London Stock Exchange. Looking back to the time of the 1994 
listing, the proposition was to be a medium–sized independent 
publisher of works of the highest literary and commercial 
quality. Although much has changed in publishing since then, 
Bloomsbury remains true to its original publishing mission. The 
current evolutionary phase is the digital resources growth strategy, 
Bloomsbury 2020. This will accelerate the expansion of the Group’s 
portfolio of high-quality digital products for academic libraries and 
for professionals. To support Bloomsbury 2020 we are investing in 
new products, technology platforms to fulfil them and B2B sales 
processes. 
Early in 2016, we simplified the organisational structure. The Group 
now has just two publishing divisions, namely Consumer and Non-
Consumer, supported by global functions for sales, marketing, 
production, technology and finance. The new Consumer division 
brings together, under Emma Hopkin, the Adult and Children’s 
trade publishing divisions. This has coincided with Richard Charkin 
reducing his time commitment to around two days a week. He 
remains President of Bloomsbury USA, Chairman of Bloomsbury 
India, and Managing Director of our Special Interest publishing. We 
are delighted that Richard will remain on the Board.
As explained in the 2016 Annual Report, the Board concluded that 
it can best support the business as it evolves through a programme 
of regular new Board appointments, while keeping the size of the 
Board fixed at eight Directors. This will ensure that, at a time of 
continual change in our markets, there is a steady inflow to the 
Board of new insights from other businesses. Accordingly, I am 
pleased to welcome Steven Hall who joined the Board in March 2017 
as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee 
and Nomination Committee. He has extensive experience of digital 
publishing and has led the development of pioneering online 
content databases, which will benefit the Board as Bloomsbury 2020 
is rolled out. At the same time, Stephen Page stood down from the 
Board. Stephen Page joined the Board in 2013 and has provided 
extensive practical insights and counsel of great value. We have 
drawn heavily on his publishing experience and thank him for the 
tremendous support he has given Bloomsbury.
Observing the approach of steady rotation of the Board, I confirmed 
in the 2016 Annual Report my intention to stand down from the 
Board at the 2017 AGM. A rigorous search process is underway for 
my successor who will be joining the Board following the 2017 AGM 
as Non-Executive Chairman, Chair of the Nomination Committee and 
a member of the Remuneration Committee.
Bloomsbury’s core business has high social value, namely 
supporting authors to publish their works of scholarship, literature 
and information. Bloomsbury’s books and content products help 
enrich the lives of millions of people of all ages. The advent of digital 
media has not replaced printed books. Rather it has provided 
exciting opportunities for Bloomsbury to fulfil its publishing mission 
in new ways. The capacity of the business to evolve with changes in 
technology and its markets and the depth of talent across the Group 
give me confidence in Bloomsbury’s future. It has been a privilege to 
have been Chairman for the past four years.
