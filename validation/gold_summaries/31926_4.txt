The tables and charts below:
 › smmarise the principal elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration in 2017;
 › provide an illustration of the application of the new remuneration policy in 2018; and
 › summarise how key elements of the new remuneration policy (as set out on pages 86 to 93 (inclusive)) will be implemented in 2018 
(subject to its approval at the AGM).
Principal elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration in 2017
The scenarios set out in the above charts reflect or assume the following:
 › ‘Fixed’ remuneration comprises:
 › base salary from 1 July 2017;
 › the estimated value of taxable benefits to be provided in 
2018 in line with the remuneration policy (based on the 
actual value of such benefits provided in 2017, using an 
average (mean) for the other Executive Directors); and 
 › a pension contribution/cash allowance equal to 20% 
of salary.
 › The ‘on-target’ remuneration assumes an annual bonus 
payment of 65% of the maximum opportunity and a 
‘threshold’ LTIP vesting (25% of the maximum opportunity).
 › The ‘maximum’ remuneration assumes maximum 
performance is achieved and therefore awards under the 
annual bonus and the LTIP pay out or vest at their maximum 
levels.
 › No share price appreciation is assumed for LTIP awards.
 › ‘Actual 2017’ applies the figures set out in the table on page 
94, using an average (mean) total single figure and 2014 LTIP 
award value for the other Executive Directors.
