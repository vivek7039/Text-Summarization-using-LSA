Chairman’s Statement 
 
Redefining the guest journey 
 
2017 was another year of growth and expansion for accesso as we integrated new acquisitions, rolled-out market-leading technology 
and won new business across the world. At the heart of our success remains our focus on the digital guest journey: helping our 
customers improve their guests’ experience and in turn driving increased revenues. From the initial online research and buying decision 
to arrival and at the attraction itself, to the feedback and follow-up processes operators use to better understand their customers, 
accesso’s technology continues to help clients upgrade the experiences they can offer. Our ambition to support the largest operators 
has taken our business to every corner of the globe and it is pleasing to see that our solutions are as applicable in different geographies 
as they are across a number of vertical markets is being proven as we expand.    
 
The year’s financial results reflect the progress being made across the business. During the year we delivered revenue of $133.4m up 
from $102.5m last year, while operating profit was $9.2m in 2017, from $10.5m in 2016, as the income statement absorbed the 
acquisition expenses of the two acquisitions made in the period and ongoing non-cash charges related to the acquisition strategy that 
the Group has followed over recent years. More importantly, adjusted EBITDA was $24.6m up from $19.1m, which is more 
representative of the Group’s underlying performance. These revenue and adjusted EBITDA numbers translate into 30.1% and 28.8% 
growth respectively, indicating our ability to deliver meaningful profit from our revenue despite ongoing investment in R&D to ensure 
our product remains the best in our industry.  We are proud to have now delivered a 7-year revenue CAGR of 23.9% and a 7-year 
adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 32.2%. 
 
Broad thinking focused on solutions 
At accesso we think in terms of solutions rather than individual product lines. Over the past years, we have evolved our offering to 
include a range of complementary technologies designed to meet a wide range of client needs, and we engage with existing and 
prospective customers on this basis. We continue to increase the number of combined deployments of accesso technologies, with the 
addition of Ingresso and TE2 strengthening our hand still further.  
 
Looking through a different lens 
The range and flexibility of our solutions also makes accesso particularly well placed to expand into new and exciting industry verticals. 
We are increasingly establishing ourselves beyond our traditional theme and water park markets, making particular progress in ski and 
snow sports, cultural attractions, museums, sports stadia, live music events and many more areas where we see the opportunity to 
expand. Gradually, we have come to see our business progress more in terms of these established, adjacent and greenfield areas than 
we have in terms of our individual products in isolation. This review of our 2017 results reflects that evolution in our thinking, and lays 
out how accesso technology is helping operators in each of these three areas meet the challenges that mean the most to them.  
 
One Team 
accesso’s people are the bedrock of the Company’s success. Our culture of self-improvement and passionate innovation delivers results 
for our customers year after year, and it is our nearly 500 dedicated employees that translate the spirit of that idea into action. On 
behalf of the Board, I thank them all wholeheartedly for their efforts.  
 
Opening 2018 
accesso has started 2018 with a number of new business wins, a significant contract extension with our long-term partner Cedar Fair 
and an exciting new partnership with the Henry Ford Health System, accesso’s initial step into a material Greenfield opportunity, 
Healthcare. We have also announced that Steve Brown will be stepping down as accesso’s CEO in April 2018 to be replaced by Paul 
Noland. Steve has made an outstanding contribution to the Group since 2012 and we wish him all the very best for the future.  We are 
delighted to be welcoming Paul to accesso.  He brings a wealth of industry experience from heading up IAAPA, the largest international 
trade association for amusement facilities and attractions worldwide, a range of senior executive roles with Walt Disney Parks and 
Resorts during a 16-year tenure and at Marriott.  I am confident he is exactly the right leader for the next phase of development for 
our company and along with the rest of the Board, I’m very much looking forward to working with him.
