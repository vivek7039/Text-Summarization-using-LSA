Chief Executive’s review
ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
ENGINEERING 
These strong results demonstrate that our focus on delivering 
essential maintenance services in regulated markets continues 
to provide robust, long-term opportunities.
Operational Review
Engineering Services
Revenue has grown to £452.4m (2016: £436.2m), including 
£2.2m from a joint venture. During the year, activity levels in 
the Environmental market have been strong, particularly on 
the current AMP6 investment programme which has seen 
clients’ programmes move from early planning and design 
phases into delivery. In Energy, revenue was lower than 
2016 as we withdrew from the loss-making small diameter, 
low-pressure gas market and a major scheme we were 
involved with at Sellafield moved into the commissioning 
phase. In Infrastructure, revenue in both Rail and Wireless 
Telecoms increased.
Our integrated multidisciplinary services are essential to 
clients responsible for delivering maintenance and renewals 
programmes in regulated markets. Our selectivity and direct 
delivery model has resulted in an operating profit prior to 
impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, of £25.1m 
(2016: £21.5m), an increase of £3.6m (16.7%). The operating 
margin on this basis improved to 5.6% (2016: 4.9%). After 
accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional 
items of £8.9m (2016: £3.0m), operating profit was £16.2m 
(2016: £18.6m) resulting in an operating margin of 3.6% 
(2016: 4.3%). 
Our Engineering Services order book grew 4% in the period 
to £438m (2016: £421m). The order book reflects our 
established position in markets which benefit from long-term, 
non-discretionary programmes supporting the maintenance 
and renewal of key infrastructure assets.
In the year, we extended our range of services in Rail with the 
acquisition of Giffen Holdings Ltd (“Giffen”). The acquisition 
broadened our offering as a major engineering services 
provider to Network Rail, as well as providing services to 
London Underground and Train Operating Companies. 
 • The Group has extensive framework 
positions to deliver infrastructure 
maintenance and renewals across a 
range of regulated market sectors
 • Engineering Services operating profit 
prior to impairment, amortisation 
and exceptional items, of £25.1m
 • We extended our range of services in Rail

STRATEGIC REPORT
Energy
We operate across the energy market for clients including 
Sellafield Ltd, SSE, Magnox, E.ON and Low Level Waste 
Repository Limited.
We are well positioned on key frameworks associated with 
high hazard risk reduction operations at the Sellafield nuclear 
site in Cumbria. We are strategically placed on all three lots of 
the ten-year Decommissioning Delivery Partnership 
Framework that has an estimated value of £500m with the 
headroom to increase to £1.5bn over the term to 2025. Our 
long-term engagement on high priority programmes provides 
good visibility and we remain strongly positioned for 
participation in future major project programmes at the site. 
As previously reported, our Gas business is now focused on 
the medium pressure market that will benefit from significant 
investment in the coming years to meet regulatory 
requirements for cast iron gas mains replacement. Working 
for Southern Gas Networks, we operate as exclusive provider 
on a regional medium pressure framework that runs to 2021. 
Additionally, we continue to work on large diameter mains 
replacements for tRIIO, the vehicle used by National Grid for 
its mains replacement programmes in the South East. Whilst 
the performance of our gas business has continued to be 
disappointing, structural and commercial measures have been 
implemented to move the business back into growth and 
profitability in the second half of 2018.
Environmental
In Water, we have seen increased activity in the current AMP6 
investment period. Major frameworks include the Sewerage 
Repairs and Maintenance Framework for Northumbrian Water 
and the Civils and EMI Capital Delivery Partners Framework 
for Wessex Water. 
For Welsh Water, we have been reappointed to the 
Pressurised Pipelines Framework. This new seven-year 
framework, which has an advertised value of £329m, covers 
all Welsh regions and incorporates the current Emergency 
Reactive Framework. Additionally, we continue to operate on 
the Major Civils Framework and the Capital Delivery Alliance 
Civils contracts.
In the period we were appointed as sole supplier on the 
national seven-year MEICA Framework for Canal and River 
Trust which will see us support around 1,000 water assets for 
this new client. Work continues as sole provider for the 
Environment Agency on the Northern MEICA Framework and 
through four national Minor Works frameworks.
In Land Remediation, we operate on frameworks to remediate 
the sites of former gasworks for clients including National 
Grid and SGN. These positions are complemented by projects 
for repeat clients and 2017 has seen another major remediation 
contract successfully carried out for Glasgow City Council.
At the Palace of Westminster, the cast iron roof restoration is 
progressing well and puts us in a good position for future 
opportunities at this World Heritage site. During the year, the 
Courtyards Conservation Framework was extended to 2025.
Infrastructure
We work as a leading provider of infrastructure services to 
Network Rail on the current investment period (CP5) that 
runs to March 2019, delivering a high volume of asset 
maintenance and renewals tasks nationally. During the year 
we worked on over 5,000 individual remits with an average 
value of £11,000 as well as approximately 300 larger projects. 
We deliver planned and reactive works across the network as 
well as emergency support responding to some of the most 
challenging emergency events on the rail network. We 
continue to develop our position in Scotland as the major 
structures renewals contractor. 
The Government recently announced an increase in funding 
to £48bn for CP6, the next period of Network Rail 
expenditure, which runs from 2019 to 2024. CP6 will focus on 
both maintenance and renewals on the rail network as key 
priorities. We believe that the Group is particularly strongly 
placed to benefit from this spending profile.
The acquisition of Giffen has increased our opportunities 
in the Rail market including London Underground. Already, 
schemes incorporating the joint skill sets of Giffen and 
Amco Rail have been secured and we expect this to 
represent an increasing proportion of our work in the 
Rail sector going forward.
In Wireless Telecoms, we continue to see profitability 
improve in a market driven by increasing demand for 
capacity and better geographical coverage, particularly 
on the 4G rollout programme.  Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8
STRATEGIC REPORT
Operational Review continued
Specialist Building
Revenue was £106.8m (2016: £90.5m) with an operating 
profit of £2.4m (2016: £2.3m). At the year end, the order 
book stood at £73m (2016: £95m). In Specialist Building, 
where we focus on the High Quality Residential market in 
London and the Home Counties, the forward order book can 
vary from period to period, dependent on the timing of client 
projects. Renew’s focus remains on delivering stable 
operating profits, whilst reducing risk through contract 
selectivity and management of contract terms. 
Summary
The Group remains committed to the growth of its 
Engineering Services business where appropriate margins 
can be delivered.
Our established strategy focuses on:
 • Infrastructure markets with non-discretionary, 
long-term funding
 • Operational expenditure budgets for renewal and 
maintenance operations
 • Utilising our directly employed workforce to develop 
relationships built on responsiveness
The UK is committed to long-term investment in its critical 
infrastructure networks. The Group has extensive framework 
positions to deliver infrastructure maintenance and renewals 
across a range of regulated market sectors which provide 
good levels of opportunities. 
The Board remains confident that our direct delivery model 
and ability to respond in markets where demand will continue 
to provide the opportunities for sustainable growth.
