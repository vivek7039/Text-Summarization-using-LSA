 Chairman’s statement
Embarking on an exciting  
chapter in our history
Dear Shareholder,
I was delighted to join the Board of Energean as Chairman in 
July 2017. Since then, I have been impressed by how much the 
Company has achieved in a few months in running the day-to-day 
business, making significant progress on both the Karish and 
Tanin project and the Prinos Basin expansion, and, most recently, 
becoming a Premium Listed Company on the London Stock 
Exchange (‘LSE’) in March 2018, the first significant European oil 
and gas E&P listing since 2014 and the largest ever primary raise 
for a Premium-Listed E&P company on the LSE. 
These achievements are driven by a strong corporate culture 
and an equally strong health, safety and environmental (‘HSE’) 
focus, backed by a professional management team. The staff 
of Energean are determined to make the Company the leading 
independent operator in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Our Board and Management are focused on this goal and are 
committed to achieving it while delivering value for shareholders 
and stakeholders.
OurBoardandgovernance
Our Board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public 
Company, Energean demonstrates best practice governance 
standards and provides sound stewardship. 
We are fortunate to have deep sector, financial, HSE and 
capital markets expertise on the Board to guide the Company 
going forward.
As a Premium Listed Company, the Board will comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have appointed audit, 
risk, governance and remuneration committees to safeguard 
shareholders’ interests and provide a strong governance 
framework. 
Our people
The depth and breadth of skills across our technical, engineering, 
geological and financial teams and wider workforce, enables 
us to be agile in our decision making and to deliver our growth 
projects while remaining open to future opportunities. 
Energean’s management team has over 200 years’ combined 
experience in the oil and gas industry encompassing a broad 
range of projects, asset types (including offshore, shallow and 
deepwater), and exploration and production technology. Our 
senior management team are also significant shareholders in 
the business and are therefore fully aligned with the interests  
of other shareholders. 
All the Company’s staff have worked with dedication and 
commitment over the last few months to deliver the IPO and  
our new projects. I am very grateful to them all for everything  
they have done.
Dividendpolicy
We are in a growth phase and our investors have bought into 
an ambitious, fast-moving Company in an exciting region. We 
therefore do not anticipate that the Company will pay a dividend 
until the Karish and Tanin development is completed. Until then, 
any earnings will be reinvested in developing the businesses 
of the Group. The Board will review how it provides returns to 
shareholders regularly and will take a prudent approach that has 
regard to the level of profit generated by the Group’s operations 
and the funding requirements for our operations and exploration 
and development programmes.
Thefuture
We have a clear and substantially de-risked pathway to 
production growth ahead of us with the Karish and Tanin, 
Prinos Basin and Katakolo development programmes. 
Our portfolio offers both near-term value delivery, significant 
mid-term value and longer-term potential upside from which 
we are well-positioned to benefit. I look forward to reporting 
on further progress over the coming year.

A sustainable growth story
Mathios Rigas
ChiefExecutiveOfficer
A new era...
When Energean was established in 2007, it was with a clear 
vision to build the leading independent E&P company in the 
Eastern Mediterranean. We saw a region which had been 
overlooked and under-exploited by the international oil and gas 
majors, and one that would inevitably need more gas 
development to cater for growing demand for cleaner energy 
in the surrounding states.
The past decade has been one of considerable growth, learning, 
investment and achievement for Energean.
We are embarking on a new era for the Company and for the 
emerging oil and gas industry in the Eastern Mediterranean – 
a region which could soon become a globally significant gas hub.
Since 2008, we have steadily expanded our operating footprint 
from one country to four; from two licences in Greece to 
13 licences in the Eastern Mediterranean; and from 2 mmboe (2P) 
reserves in our Prinos licence to 51 mmboe (2P) reserves and 
339 mmboe (2C) resources across our portfolio. In a very short 
period, we have taken the prospective Karish and Tanin gas fields, 
offshore Israel, from acquisition in December 2016, through 
a Field Development Plan (FDP) and financing, to a Final 
Investment Decision (FID). This is a remarkable achievement, 
of which we are very proud.
Advancingourflagshipproject: 
Karish and Tanin
Having signed 12 Long Term Gas Sales & Purchase Agreements 
with the leading Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and 
industrial companies in Israel, we have secured substantial 
revenues underpinning Energean’s performance over the next 
two decades and will meet the Israeli Government’s objectives  
of encouraging competition in the domestic Gas market and 
improving supply security from 2021, when we plan to produce 
first gas from Karish.
Delivering the project on time and on budget has been affirmed 
through an Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Installation 
& Commissioning (EPCIC) turnkey contract, signed with 
TechnipFMC, protecting our shareholders against risks of delays 
and cost overruns.
We have attained the necessary financing to complete our major 
development projects in Israel and Greece, which allowed us to 
take FIDs on both the Karish and Tanin project in Israel and our 
Epsilon development project in Greece.
We are embarking on a 
new era for the Company  
and for the emerging oil  
and gas industry in the 
Eastern Mediterranean.
