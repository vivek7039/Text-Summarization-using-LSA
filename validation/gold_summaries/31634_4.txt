Focused on food
Food is our core competence. We create value for our customers by providing 
a wide range of innovative and healthy dining solutions in a sustainable way.
A TRULY INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
We manage our business in three geographic regions. Our increasing scale allows us to achieve our goal of being the lowest cost, most 
efficient provider of food and support services. Scale is a benefit in terms of food procurement, labour management and back office costs.  
It underpins our competitiveness and enables us to deliver sustainable growth over time.
