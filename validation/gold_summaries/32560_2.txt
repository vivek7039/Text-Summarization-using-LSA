1 As previously guided, this year we are reporting on the 53 weeks to 4 March 
2017, with an extra week added to ensure that the year-end date stays close 
to the end of February. In order to provide a meaningful comparison with last 
year’s 52 week period, all P&L financial movements are reported on a 52 week 
basis, excluding the 53rd week, unless otherwise stated. Where applicable, 
the 53rd week’s known result has been used as the basis for the adjustment to 
provide the 52 week results, although a degree of judgement has been applied 
in deriving certain operating costs in respect of the final week. A detailed 
comparison of the 53 weeks and 52 weeks results are set out on page 44. All 
second half P&L financial movements relate to the 26 week period, excluding 
the 27th week, unless otherwise stated. All balance sheet figures are reported 
as at the year-end date and cash flow figures are for the 53 week period.
