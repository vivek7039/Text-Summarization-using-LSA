CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICERâ€™S STATEMENT
The business review on pages 25 to 36 and the finance review 
on pages 37 to 41, will provide the detail behind the significant 
increase in our KPIs during the year and a review of the 
performance and progress at the underlying operations over 
which we have royalties. As such, the following is my summary 
on the market, our focus for the year and some comments  
on the dividend.
MARKET OUTLOOK
The recovery of the mining sector has continued over the past 
year with prices generally rising. Despite being clearly in the 
upward phase of the cycle, there is still a good window for 
Anglo Pacific to make investments which will provide good 
returns in the coming years and we intend to take advantage 
of this opportunity.
Fortunately, our area of focus is also one of the most 
promising for commodity investment. The world is finally, for 
the first time in a decade, in a moment of coordinated global 
growth. The beneficiary of this will be the base and bulk 
materials which we specialise in and where demand is driven 
by GDP growth. Even more positively, the developments in 
new technologies such as electric vehicles and improved 
battery storage should create significant incremental demand 
for associated materials. In contrast to this positive demand 
picture, the supply side can be expected to be constrained for 
a number of years, first by the general lack of investment in 
new mines over the past five years but also by the continued 
relative scarcity of finance for new projects even today. The 
result should be an extenuated cycle longer than the previous 
one where Anglo Pacific, as a supplier of scarce capital to the 
sector, should be able to capture enhanced returns. 
Within this context, we will continue to focus on base 
commodities like copper, nickel and zinc where we see visible 
industrial demand and deficits which could be increased by 
new technologies. We will also focus on alloys which can be 
used for light weighting and more specialised commodities 
such as vanadium, which we already have exposure to, and 
where we believe demand will outstrip supply. 
Opportunistically, we will look at bulks where we believe the 
price and risk equation is attractive.
In contrast, we believe many commodities are already in the 
upper range of their pricing and have more downside risk  
than upside, and we will be avoiding them. This includes gold 
which, though a beneficiary of inflation, may underperform in 
a situation where cryptocurrency alternative abounds, and 
interest rates increase holding costs. In addition materials 
such as lithium, are temporarily in short supply but we will 
need to model opportunities very conservatively for longer 
term investment given longer-term supply prospects.
THE FOCUS FOR THE 
YEAR AHEAD IS FIRMLY 
ON GROWING AND 
DIVERSIFYING THE 
PORTFOLIO
Anglo Pacific delivered on its guidance 
during the year. Including the cash received 
from our Denison investment, our income 
more than doubled, the third consecutive 
year in which it has done so. With less 
organic revenue growth expected in 2018, 
the focus for the year ahead is firmly on 
growing and diversifying the portfolio.  
With a strong balance sheet and improved 
market fundamentals, we believe we are  
well placed to deliver innovative and 
accretive transactions in the year ahead.

08 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC      ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 COAL OUTLOOK
The continuing strength of coal pricing has surprised many, 
particularly in the U.K. who had believed the commodity to be 
ex growth. In fact, coal consumption continues to increase in 
absolute terms though coal's share of the global energy mix is 
slowly declining. Demand for energy coal, particularly in the 
East, is being fuelled by higher demand for grid power from 
new sources like electric vehicles.  At the same time, supply  
is being squeezed, first by the Chinese restrictions on low 
quality product which seem to be a permanent feature of the 
market, but also because of continued depletion of mines 
without any sizable investment in bringing on new capacity. 
As a result, we expect coal prices to be higher for longer than 
the market consensus (which is rising already).
Within the coal complex, we have always argued for longer-
term exposure to the higher quality less polluting material 
which, we believe, will serve to reduce pollution quicker than 
the impact which the gradual introduction of clean 
technology will achieve in the medium term. The Chinese 
policy is supportive of this trend and, in the market, we have 
observed higher discounts or premia being applied to lower  
or higher quality products. We are pleased that our exposure  
is to premium cleaner product and are comfortable with our 
ongoing strategy of reducing, exposure to this commodity.
STR ATEGY
Consistent with the above market view and our enhanced 
balance sheet, we intend to accelerate our rate of growth in 
transforming Anglo Pacific into the preferred royalty vehicle 
for twenty first century commodities. There is a gap in the 
market to be a derisked mode of providing exposure to the 
raw material for new technologies and Anglo Pacific, as the 
only truly global non-precious metals royalty company, is  
well placed to occupy this niche. We believe that as we 
continue to execute on this pivot, the rating of the Company 
should increase.  
Given our confident outlook, we are also prepared at this  
stage of the cycle to take slightly more risk and also to invest 
more in growth. We announced last year a new strategy to 
include development royalties as a new minor focus for  
our investments. We are pleased to have executed one of 
these and would hope for more in the current year. These 
investments should be largely funded through cash on  
hand. We have also decided to consider exposure to new 
geographies such as South America, Africa and Eastern 
Europe. However, we are unlikely to compound risk by 
investing in development opportunities in these countries, 
instead we will focus on operating assets.
From a financing perspective, with a strong balance sheet  
and income, we will seek to fund transactions by using our 
cash and by leveraging our balance sheet in the first instance. 
We have an undrawn revolving credit facility and believe this 
can be comfortably expanded whilst retaining low borrowing 
metrics. Should we come across larger transformative deals, 
we will consider other sources of finance.
DIVIDEND
Although our focus is on investing in growth at this stage  
of the cycle (and shareholders should thus expect ongoing 
higher due diligence costs), we will seek to balance this  
with continuing to pay a proportion of this growth to our 
shareholders in the form of progressive dividends.  
We announced an overhaul in our dividend structure during 
2017 which created quarterly payments, reduced the period 
between announcement and payment by almost three 
months, and created a flexible final quarter dividend.  
This was well received by shareholders. 
We put this policy into action with the recommendation 
(subject to shareholder approval) of a final dividend for the 
year of 2.5p per share which increased the level of total 
dividends for the year from 6p in 2016 to 7p for the year just 
gone. We have also reset the level of the quarterly interim 
dividends from 1.5p to 1.625p per share, meaning that the  
run rate for 2018 has increased from 6p to 6.5p per share,  
with any overall increase for 2018 being reserved for the final 
quarter. As such, and on a cash basis, shareholders will actually 
receive 7.375p per share in the next 12 months.
We believe this dividend policy strikes the right balance at this 
stage of the cycle between returns to shareholders and 
investing in growth.
OUTLOOK
We enter 2018 in a position of strength, having enjoyed a 
record 2017. Strong earnings have translated directly into cash 
flow, we are debt free and see many opportunities in what is 
still a capital constrained sector. We expect to generate 
significant cash as commodity prices continue to remain at 
much higher levels than anticipated even just 12 months ago. 
With less organic revenue growth anticipated in 2018, our 
focus is to accelerate the growth of our asset base by 
acquiring royalties which provide immediate cash flow or the 
potential to deliver significant growth over the longer term.
