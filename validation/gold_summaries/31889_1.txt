SRA737 – Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)
Targeting solid tumours, licensed to Sierra Oncology
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, 
orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key 
regulator of important cell cycle checkpoints and central 
mediator of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. 
SRA737 was discovered as the result of a research collaboration 
between Sareum, the ICR, and CRT. Preclinical and initial 
clinical development was carried out in a co-investment 
collaboration between Sareum and the CRT Pioneer Fund. The 
programme was licensed for further clinical development 
and commercialisation to Sierra Oncology in September 2016.
Sierra Oncology is advancing next-generation DDR therapeutics 
for the treatment of patients with cancer, and SRA737 is its lead 
candidate. This Company has a strong management team with 
a proven track record in oncology drug development and is well 
financed with US$116 million cash as at the end of June 2017. 
Under the terms of the co-investment agreement with the 
CRT Pioneer Fund, Sareum is eligible to receive 27.5% of up to 
US$328.5 million in upfront, development and commercialisation 
milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales. An upfront payment 
of US$7 million and a first milestone payment of US$2 million have 
already been paid by Sierra Oncology (September 2016 and 
January 2017 respectively), with Sareum receiving a total 
of nearly £2 million as its share of this licence income.
By blocking Chk1 function in these cases, the tumour cells die; 
this is an example of the concept known as “synthetic lethality”. 
Sierra Oncology submitted amended protocols for both trials, 
approved in May 201 7 , that aim to take advantage of this fundamental 
role of Chk1 in cancer, with the objective of enhancing patient 
selection and maximising potential responses. These innovative 
trial designs were also presented at the ASCO annual meeting in 
June 2017.
SRA737 is being evaluated by Sierra Oncology in two innovative 
Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and tumours 
identified to have genetic aberrations (mutations) that are thought 
to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. Tumour cells can have 
many genetic mutations and several of these may result in a 
strong reliance on Chk1 function for survival of the tumour.
The first trial is intended to evaluate the potential of SRA737 as 
a monotherapy in patients whose cancer has the defined genetic 
profile described above. In June 201 7 , Sierra Oncology reported that 
the dose escalation phase of the monotherapy trial had advanced 
successfully to beyond 600mg/day dosing (c. 4x the estimated 
minimum efficacious dose of 160mg/day) with a well-tolerated safety 
profile. The cohort expansion phase of this trial, now running at 
eight UK hospitals, is enrolling patients with five cancer types that 
are predicted to be highly sensitive to Chk1 inhibition: colorectal, 
head and neck, non-small-cell lung, ovarian and prostate. The trial 
will assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SRA737 and 
recommend a dose for further (Phase 2) clinical studies. T o determine 
potential patient selection strategies for further clinical development, 
the response of the patients’ cancers to treatment will also be 
measured to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737. 
The second trial is designed to explore the potentiating effects 
of low-dose gemcitabine (a chemotherapy that causes replication 
stress and DNA damage) in combination with SRA737 , also in patients 
with genetically profiled cancers. The chemotherapy combination 
study is initially enrolling patients with the aim to establish the safety 
profile, to determine the MTD and to propose a recommended 
dose for further development of SRA737 in combination with 
low-dose gemcitabine. Once an MTD and dosing schedule have 
been determined, the study will evaluate the preliminary efficacy 
of SRA737 in combination with low-dose gemcitabine in genetically 
defined subjects with bladder or pancreatic cancer.
Sierra Oncology has announced that it will provide an update 
on the SRA737 development programme in late February 2018. 
Sierra Oncology also expects to present data from its studies at 
a medical conference in the second half of 2018.
“ Sierra Oncology is advancing  
next-generation DDR therapeutics for 
the treatment of patients with cancer, 
and SRA737 is its lead candidate.“
We are very pleased with the progress made across our pipeline during the period. The licensing 
of SRA737 is an important milestone for several reasons: it places the clinical development and future 
marketing of this exciting oncology candidate in the hands of a highly experienced and well-funded 
team; the agreement has the potential to provide substantial funds to Sareum, enabling us to 
advance and broaden our own pipeline programmes; and overall it provides important validation 
of our business model and expertise for the design and early development of novel drug candidates 
that offer attractive licensing opportunities for potential partners.
STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6 In addition, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737, with potential 
clinical opportunities in 2018, in combination with targeted cancer 
therapeutics where there is a strong biological rationale for 
synergy with Chk1 inhibition. These include anti-PD- 1 and PD-L1 
therapies, which are fast becoming established as key therapeutic 
options for a range of cancers, and other DDR inhibitors such as 
PARP inhibitors. 
Sierra Oncology reported, in May 2017, the grant of US and EU 
patents, extending the protection of SRA737 in these important 
markets to 2033.
Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)
With Sierra Oncology now funding the development 
of SRA737, Sareum has increased the resources allocated 
to developing its TYK2 programmes in autoimmune diseases 
and cancer.
TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of kinases with 
roles in pro-inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases and 
tumour cell proliferation in certain cancers. Members of the JAK 
family are the targets of several marketed and clinical-stage drugs 
for cancer and autoimmune diseases, although there are currently 
no marketed products specifically targeting TYK2. 
Sareum is developing potent and selective, orally available TYK2 
inhibitors with potential best-in-class profiles that have shown 
initial proof of concept in in vivo models of:
• 
Psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis; and
• 
T -cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (T -ALL). 
Sareum has an ongoing co-development agreement with SRI 
International (Menlo Park, CA, USA) to develop TYK2 inhibitors 
in autoimmune diseases and retains commercialisation rights 
for these and other TYK2 inhibitors with profiles optimised for 
oncology and immuno-oncology applications.
Targeting autoimmune and inflammatory disorders
Sareum has conducted preclinical studies with several of its TYK2 
inhibitors, which have demonstrated promising and potentially 
superior therapeutic profiles in disease models of psoriasis, 
rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, compared with a 
marketed JAK family kinase inhibitor in the latter two cases.
These data have led the Company’s partner, SRI International, to 
investigate advanced lead molecules in disease models of lupus, 
and promising initial efficacy has been observed. These studies 
are supported by a US government research grant (US 
Department of Defense) of US$360k. 
New analogues, with improved selectivity and ADMET  
(ADME- Tox, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) 
properties, continue to progress through internal screening 
cascades. Disease model studies with these compounds are 
planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 . If these disease model 
studies are successful, the Company expects to move into the 
candidate selection phase in the first half of 2018.
Targeting cancers
Initial studies, assisted by funding from the Innovate UK Biomedical 
Catalyst Fund, to investigate the potential of Sareum’s lead TYK2 
inhibitors to treat T -ALL have concluded successfully. The study 
demonstrated good efficacy of several Sareum TYK2 inhibitors in 
disease models of T -ALL, both as a single agent and in combination 
with standard-of-care chemotherapy. In disease models, Sareum’s 
compounds demonstrate good oral bioavailability, were well 
tolerated, presented good exposure to plasma and tumour tissue, 
and showed a dose-dependent effect on a biomarker of TYK2 
inhibition and tumour reduction of up to 80%.
These data were presented by Sareum in November 2016 at 
the American Association for Cancer Research – National Cancer 
Institute – European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (AACR-NCI-EORTC) international conference and 
updated results were presented by the Company at the International 
Cancer Cluster Showcase in June 2017.
The Company is also investigating the potential of its TYK2 inhibitors 
in solid tumours and blood cancers where there is strong evidence 
in the literature that TYK2 inhibition could be effective, both as a 
single agent and in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. 
Several of these studies are being carried out in leading academic 
centres worldwide under material transfer agreements. 
Furthermore, Sareum is investigating the potential of its TYK2 
inhibitors to overcome tumour resistance to new immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapies. Initial results are promising, and additional 
experiments are in progress seeking to identify which tumour 
types and immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations might be 
expected to benefit most from TYK2 inhibition.
The Company expects to select a candidate for further development 
in the oncology field in the first half of 2018, pending the success 
of ongoing studies in any one of these cancer applications.
Aurora+FL T3 kinases
Targeting AML and other blood cancers
Sareum’s third programme is focused on small molecule 
inhibitors of Aurora and FLT3 kinases that it has identified 
as having potential to be single agent therapies for acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) and other leukaemias. A lead 
candidate is in preclinical development, funded by Sareum’s 
Chinese partner, HMUBEC.
Previous studies have confirmed the potential of this candidate 
in AML, and particularly FLT3-mutant AML. Toxicology studies are 
underway, with initial results suggesting that the candidate is well 
tolerated at the predicted therapeutic dose. Further formulation 
work, which is causing additional delays, is ongoing to complete 
the toxicology studies, with Sareum funding some studies in the 
UK to accelerate the resolution of these formulation issues.
The Company is now targeting completion of the preclinical 
studies in the second half of 2018.
Separately during the period, the Company’s intellectual property 
around its Aurora+FLT3 kinase programme was strengthened by 
notifications of patents granted in China, Hong Kong, Singapore 
and Japan. Sareum now has patent protection in all the major 
territories for this programme.
Overall, we are delighted with the progress made across our 
business and pipeline and look forward to further important 
newsflow in the coming year.
