 “OUR PERFORMANCE 
OVER THE PAST YEAR 
HIGHLIGHTS THE EXTENT 
OF OUR AMBITIONS  
AND OUR POTENTIAL  
FOR THE FUTURE” 
We are highly ambitious, not for ambition’s sake, but 
because we are clear about the need for the regeneration  
projects we create. We are proud of our ability to deliver 
them and we understand the value, both financial and 
social, that can be generated from them. 
As our business expands and develops, the combination 
of our operational focus and our financial model will 
deliver consistent, long-term value, driven by a dynamic 
blend of development, trading and investment activity.
