The Group ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance 
with IFRS where the Group’s interests in joint ventures are 
shown as a single line item on the income statement and 
balance sheet and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100%. 
Management reviews the performance of the business 
principally on a proportionately consolidated basis which 
includes the Group’s share of joint ventures on a line by line 
basis. The key ﬁnancial performance indicators are also 
presented on this basis.
Alternative performance measures are ﬁnancial measures 
which are not speciﬁed under IFRS but are used by 
management as they highlight the underlying recurring 
performance of the Group’s property rental business and are 
based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations (BPR) 
reporting framework which is widely recognised and used 
by public real estate companies. 
Therefore, unless speciﬁcally stated, the performance metrics 
and ﬁnancial results reﬂected above and in the Strategic 
report reﬂect the Group’s wholly owned assets and its share 
of joint venture assets.
Further details and reconciliations between EPRA measures 
and IFRS equivalents can be found in the Financial review on 
page 35 and in note 8 to the Group ﬁnancial statements.
