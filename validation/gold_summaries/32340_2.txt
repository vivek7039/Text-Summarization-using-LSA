At a glance 
We are one of the world’s largest investor-owned utilities focused 
on transmission and distribution activities in electricity and gas in 
the UK and the US. We play a vital role in connecting millions of 
people to the energy they use, safely, reliably and efficiently. We 
are organised into operating segments, which we describe below.
UK Electricity Transmission
We own and operate the electricity 
transmission network in England and Wales, 
with day-to-day responsibility for balancing 
supply and demand. We operate but do not 
own the Scottish networks. Our networks 
comprise approximately 7 ,200 kilometres  
(4,474 miles) of overhead line, 1,500 kilometres 
(932 miles) of underground cable and 342 
substations.
UK Gas Transmission
We own and operate the gas National 
Transmission System (NTS) in Great Britain, 
with day-to-day responsibility for balancing 
supply and demand. Our network comprises 
approximately 7 ,660 kilometres (4,760 miles)  
of high-pressure pipe and 618 above-ground 
installations.
Our role as system operator
As Great Britain’s System Operator (SO) we make sure Great Britain’s gas and electricity is 
transported safely and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. We seek to 
ensure that supply and demand are balanced in real-time and we facilitate the connection of assets 
to the transmission system. In the US, similar services are provided by independent system operators.
