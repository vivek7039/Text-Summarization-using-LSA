Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strong progress despite  
market headwinds
All of our brands increased revenues year-on-year.  
This growth was supported by the “assisted acquisitions” 
programme , which assisted our lettings agents both 
operationally and financially to purchase independent 
competitors’ lettings businesses. In the first full year of 
the programme we added 2,012 tenanted managed 
properties. I’m delighted to report that this was matched 
by an almost identical increase in our managed portfolio 
through organic growth. 
Tenant fee ban
The Government has provided a degree of clarity on its 
intention to ban tenant fees in England & Wales. A ban  
in Scotland has been in existence since 2012.
The intention appears to be an outright ban, rather than 
a cap, on landlords and their letting agents charging any 
type of pre-tenancy fee. It’s not clear whether certain 
in-tenancy fees will be allowed.
The timing of the implementation of the ban appears  
to be Q1 2019 which means that the Group’s trading for 
2018 would be unaffected by the ban. The Group is 
already taking action to mitigate the effects of the ban 
which is expected to put at risk 16% of our franchisees’ 
lettings revenue, and at a Group level 9% of total 
revenue, if annualised*. Mitigation factors include; 
through organic means and by acquisition, accelerating 
the size of the tenanted managed portfolio, developing 
income from financial services & conveyancing referrals. 
The Group will continue to closely monitor any 
developments associated with the Tenant Fee Ban  
and the associated potential impact.
Brand website redevelopment
One of our objectives when we purchased EweMove was 
to translate some of its digital marketing capabilities into 
better performance for our traditional brands. During 
2017 we re-developed each of our five traditional brand 
websites, starting with Whitegates. Although the 
technology platform is common, the look and feel of 
each site is different, to reflect the heritage and values of 
the particular brand. There is divergence on functionality, 
with Whitegates embracing all of the tried & tested 
EweMove concepts such as web pages optimised for 
lead conversion, Google “pay-per-click”, “live chat”, 
downloadable property valuations and functionality  
to book a valuation appointment. Overall, the website 
project generated nearly 17,000 new business leads  
at an average cost to our franchisees of £24 per lead.  
The Board believes that the new websites delivered  
a competitive advantage in H2 2017.
Name change
On 16 March 2017 the Company changed its name from 
MartinCo PLC to The Property Franchise Group PLC.  
It was time to recognise the transformation from a single 
franchisor to a multi-franchisor of residential agents.
Outlook
The Group’s intention is to be well-positioned for all 
eventualities and developments in the estate agency  
and letting agency space. Despite the market challenges, 
the Group delivered another strong set of results in this, 
its fourth full year on AIM.
My thanks go to the executives, their teams and my 
fellow Board members for their outstanding efforts over 
the last year.
I am delighted to announce that the Board has 
recommended an increased final dividend of 5.4p  
per ordinary share for 2017.

The consensus view of the residential property 
market was that 2017 was a disappointing year 
compared to 2016. However, 2017 was a strong  
year of growth for The Property Franchise Group, 
demonstrating the resilience of its business model 
in a challenging market.
