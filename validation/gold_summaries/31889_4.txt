 We are very pleased with the progress made 
across our pipeline. The licensing of SRA737 to 
Sierra Oncology places the development and 
marketing of this exciting oncology candidate 
in the hands of a highly experienced team. 
The agreement has the potential to provide 
substantial funds, enabling us to advance 
and broaden our own pipeline programmes, 
and overall provides important validation of 
our business model and drug R&D expertise.

What we do
Sareum is a specialist drug discovery and development 
company delivering targeted small molecule therapeutics, 
focusing on cancer and autoimmune disease, and 
generating value through licensing them to international 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies at the 
preclinical or early clinical trials stage.
Our year
June
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Sierra 
Oncology reported initial progress of the two ongoing Phase 1 
trials of SRA737, including the start of the cohort expansion phase 
of the monotherapy trial. In addition, Sierra presented two posters 
describing the innovative clinical designs of these trials.
August
Aurora+FLT3 patent grant notifications received for China 
and Hong Kong.
May
Sierra Oncology announced that patents protecting SRA737 
were granted in the USA and Europe, extending its protection 
period to 2033 in the USA
September
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737), a novel Chk1 inhibitor, licensed 
to Sierra Oncology (formerly ProNAi Therapeutics) for up to 
US$328.5 million plus royalties by co-investment partner, the 
CRT Pioneer Fund. Sareum eligible to receive 27 .5% of economics 
and received £1.5 million share of US$7 million upfront on signing.
January
Received £450k share of US$2 million success milestone payment 
as part of SRA737 licence agreement on transfer of two ongoing 
Phase 1 clinical trials to Sierra Oncology.
October
Aurora+FLT3 patent grant notifications received for Japan 
and Singapore, giving Sareum approved patent protection 
in all the major territories.
Successful conclusion to the BioMedical Catalyst funded

STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Drug development pipeline
Sareum’s pipeline is built on the drug discovery expertise of 
its founders, particularly in the field of cancer. The Company 
operates a collaborative and outsourced business model. 
All our laboratory-based research is carried out in the facilities 
of collaborators or third-party providers. This enables us 
to access drug discovery expertise throughout the world 
with a very flexible cost base.
Sareum focuses on developing new therapies against 
biochemical targets where existing preclinical or early clinical 
data are available. This data can give a strong indication that 
a therapy will disrupt a targeted biochemical process and 
improve patient outcomes without significant side effects. 
Sareum’s approach is lower risk than developing therapies 
against entirely novel targets.
Chk1 kinase – targeting genetically defined solid cancers
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally 
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of 
important cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the DNA 
Damage Response (DDR) network. SRA737 was licensed to Sierra 
Oncology in September 2016 and is in two innovative Phase 1 
clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and tumours with 
genetic mutations that predict sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. 
Tumour cells can have many genetic mutations and several of these 
may result in a strong reliance on Chk1 function for tumour survival. 
By blocking Chk1 function in these cases, the tumour cells die; this 
exemplifies the concept of “synthetic lethality.” 
The clinical studies aim to take advantage of this fundamental 
role of Chk1 in cancer and will enhance patient selection in order 
to maximise responses of SRA737 in: 
• 
 a monotherapy study in genetically defined patients with five 
solid tumour types.
• 
 a combination study with low-dose chemotherapy (gemcitabine) 
in genetically defined patients with two solid tumour types where 
gemcitabine is a standard care.
In addition, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 with preclinical 
studies in combination with targeted cancer therapeutics where 
there is a strong rationale for synergy with Chk1 inhibition. These 
include immuno-oncology approaches (anti-PD-1 and PD-L1) 
and other DDR inhibitors (e.g. PARP inhibitors).

TYK2 kinase – targeting autoimmune diseases 
and cancer
TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family with roles in 
pro-inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases and tumour 
cell proliferation in certain cancers. Members of the JAK family are 
the targets of several marketed and clinical-stage drugs, although 
there are currently no marketed products specifically targeting TYK2.
Sareum has an ongoing co-development agreement with SRI 
International to develop TYK2 inhibitors in autoimmune diseases 
and retains commercialisation rights for these and other TYK2 
inhibitors for oncology and immuno-oncology applications.
Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders
Sareum has shown with several TYK2 inhibitors promising and 
potentially superior therapeutic profiles in disease models of psoriasis, 
RA and ulcerative colitis. Advanced lead molecules have also shown 
promising initial efficacy in lupus models. Candidate selections are 
expected in H1 2018.
Cancers
Several of Sareum’s TYK2 inhibitors have demonstrated good efficacy 
and safety in disease models of T -ALL, both as a single agent and in 
combination with chemotherapy. They also demonstrate good oral 
bioavailability, good biodistribution and tumour reduction of up to 80%.
The Company is investigating its TYK2 inhibitors in several solid 
tumours and blood cancers at leading academic centres worldwide. 
Sareum is also investigating the potential of its TYK2 inhibitors 
to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and is 
evaluating combination opportunities.
Candidate selection for further development in oncology is 
targeted for H1 2018.

Aurora+FLT3 kinases - targeting AML 
and other blood cancers
Sareum has identified candidate molecules with potential to be 
single-agent therapies for AML and other blood cancers. A lead 
candidate is in preclinical development funded by Sareum’s Chinese 
partner, Hebei Medical University Biomedical Engineering Center, and 
these studies suggest good tolerability at the predicted therapeutic 
dose. Preclinical studies are expected to complete in H2 2018.
