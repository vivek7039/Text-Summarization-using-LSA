 “ I AM IMPRESSED 
WITH THE VISION AND 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT  
STILL REMAIN TO FULLY 
ACHIEVE SCAPA’S 
POTENTIAL IN BOTH 
HEALTHCARE AND 
INDUSTRIAL.”
DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
I am pleased to join Scapa at an important 
juncture in its journey that began with James 
Wallace, my predecessor. The evolution from 
an industrial tape company to a global 
adhesive technology-based company with 
two distinct businesses, each with an exciting 
strategy and outlook, has been impressive. 
During the past eight years, Scapa’s share 
price has risen from £0.095 in March 2009 to 
£4.00 in May 2017 , generating over £600m of 
shareholder value. As I review the results and 
accomplishments of the Group, I am very 
impressed with the volume and pace of the 
activities. However, I am equally impressed 
with the vision and opportunities that still 
remain to fully achieve Scapa’s potential 
in both Healthcare and Industrial. 
GREAT PROGRESS AND POTENTIAL
The Healthcare business has been 
transformed from a roll stock material 
supplier to market leader in turn-key solutions 
of adhesive based products. At an early 
stage we recognised the increasing trend 
towards outsourcing in our customers and 
positioned ourselves as the partner of choice 
to the leading global healthcare companies. 
Driven by pricing pressure and the need to 
accelerate time to market, our customers are 
looking for partners who not only provide 
materials and manufacturing but can provide 
turn-key solutions across their entire value 
chain, from product development to delivery 
of a finished product. Through continuous 
investment, including three successful 
acquisitions, the latest of which was 
EuroMed in May 2016, Scapa has built a 
comprehensive set of capabilities across the 
entire value chain. We have leveraged our 
unique proposition and developed strategic 
partnerships with global leaders such as 
Convatec and Johnson & Johnson. Today, 
we have long-term commercial agreements 
with our major healthcare customers that 
underpin £200m in revenue. We believe 
that the potential, driven by the fundamentals 
and dynamics of the healthcare market, 
is significant. The opportunities are 
demonstrated by the increasing pipeline 
of projects that we continue to build. Our 
challenge is to convert the projects into 
revenue through flawless execution. Equally, 
we must continue to develop additional 
capabilities, organically as well as through 
acquisitions, to further penetrate beyond the

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER

customers. Our goal is to continue to 
accelerate the shift to higher value added 
business with Scapa’s innovation and IP 
that will deliver higher margin and stronger 
partnerships with our customers who 
are growing and significant.
The Industrial business continues to 
deliver impressive results through focus on 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and 
operational efficiency. This year it achieved 
the long-term objective of double-digit trading 
profit margins. The pressure sensitive market 
is large, diverse and mature. Estimated at 
over US$30 billion, its growth reflects the 
GDP of the markets. We recognised that 
to deliver the double-digit profit growth we 
could not rely solely on revenue growth, 
particularly given the uncertain and endemic 
macro environment. As such we outlined 
a self-help agenda focused on operational 
efficiency and asset optimisation. Our 
methodical and exceptional operational 
execution enabled us to deliver on our goal. 
We have, along the way, accumulated 
capabilities and competencies that are 
yielding significant results. Moreover, they 
are allowing us to expand our potential. 
We have reset our profit margin target to 
mid-teens which compares to the market 
leaders. We believe we can achieve our new 
goal by continuing to execute our self-help 
agenda. Furthermore, we believe that we can 
achieve above-market growth through focus 
on specific markets where we have 
competitive advantage.
PERFORMANCE AND DIVIDEND
The continued focus on execution against 
a consistent strategy outlined above 
produced another record year for the 
Group. Group revenue increased 13.3% to 
£279.6m (2016: £246.7m) and trading profit 
increased 37.1% to £29.2m (2016: £21.3m), 
with strong trading helped by a currency 
translation tailwind. On a constant currency 
basis, revenue and trading profit grew 1.7% 
and 18.2% respectively. Group margins 
increased to 10.4% from 8.6%. Adjusted 
earnings per share increased 39.6% to 
14.8p (2016: 10.6p) and basic earnings per 
share was 11.6p (2016: 4.1p). 
This year has seen a further strengthening 
of the Balance Sheet, including continued 
actions to manage the legacy pension 
scheme deficit. The UK deficit increased 
slightly to £23.8m as a result of the reduction 
in the discount rate, and the total deficit 
of £31.4m, including a number of small 
overseas schemes, is now less than 1x the 
EBITDA of the business. EBITDA comprises 
trading profit before depreciation.
The Group ended the year with net 
debt of £16.1m (2016: £2.6m), after the 
acquisition of EuroMed for US$35m 
(£28.3m) in May 2016. The business 
continues to focus on cash flow and 
working capital management.
Given the continuing progress and improved 
performance, the Board is proposing to 
increase the final and full year dividend by 
14.3% to 2.0p (2016: 1.75p). Subject to 
approval of shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting the dividend will be 
paid on 18 August 2017 to shareholders on 
the register on 21 July 2017. The ex-dividend 
date is 20 July 2017.
GOVERNANCE
As the Group continues to grow both 
organically and through acquisition, the 
Board recognises that a strong governance 
framework and good internal controls, 
supported by common values and culture, 
are critically important. The Board remains 
focused on ensuring its own effectiveness and 
that of the governance processes throughout 
the Group. An internal review of Board 
effectiveness was conducted in 2017 . The 
corporate governance section on pages 38 
to 69 outlines our full compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
BOARD CHANGE
I succeeded James Wallace as Chairman 
in March 2017 at the end of the fiscal year. 
James has been the Chairman of Scapa 
since October 2007 and during that time 
he oversaw much of the change, as a result 
of which Scapa is well positioned for a 
bright future. On behalf of the Board and 
all the employees at Scapa, I would like 
to thank James for his strong leadership 
during his ten years as Chairman, a period 
during which Scapa was transformed from 
a business with significant challenges into 
the strong, successful business it is today. 
PEOPLE
Since becoming Chairman, I have visited 
many of our sites and had the opportunity 
to meet our people. It is evident that Scapa’s 
recent success is a result of the skill and 
dedication of our employees who have 
embraced the business unit strategy and 
the cultural changes demanded in the Group. 
The Scapa Way and our Ten Guiding 
Principles are now well embedded in the 
Company culture, which gives a common 
value system to people from a range of 
diverse backgrounds and cultures. The 
Group continues to invest in its people 
through a variety of programmes and has 
been able to make a number of senior 
appointments this year from internal talent. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all the employees for their contribution to 
an excellent year.
OUTLOOK
It has been a year of significant progress 
and I am very positive about the further 
opportunities for the Group in both 
Healthcare and Industrial. Healthcare is 
well positioned in a growth market and 
has a window to take advantage of the 
outsourcing trend. Industrial will continue 
to drive increased ROCE, with further 
opportunities identified. I am confident 
in Scapa’s ability to continue to make 
progress and deliver further value to 
our shareholders.
