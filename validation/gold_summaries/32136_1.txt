STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
A year ago, I started in my role as Chief 
Executive by posing a series of questions 
that I hoped would help unlock the future of 
M&S, giving us a platform from which to ﬁ rst 
recover and then to grow. 201 6/1 7 has been 
a year of change as we started to answer 
these questions, which I address below. 
The steps we are taking are making a 
diff erence and we are making progress. 
However, as we said when we set out our 
plan, it has resulted in some short-term 
pain. Some of the action needed has been 
costly and proﬁ ts are down. Clothing & 
Home sales were down year-on-year as we 
reduced promotions and markdown activity. 
We expected this and we still believe we are 
doing the right thing for the future of our 
business. We have seen encouraging signs 
from the increase in full-price Clothing & 
Home sales and in the sales growth during 
the key Christmas trading period. And in 
Food, we continued to grow ahead of the 
market with new stores outperforming 
expectations. 
The business has adapted well as we start to 
build a sustainable foundation for the future. 
We have laid a lot of the groundwork for 
our recovery; however, we are not there yet. 
I want to see consistent delivery over time 
and I want to see us move out of recovery. 
Even as our performance improves, we 
can’t stand still. While we are still focused 
on recovering our business and we have a 
lot more to do, I am also starting to look 
to future growth opportunities, some of 
which I outline at the end of this update.
OUR CUSTOMERS
We asked how we could put customers at 
the heart of everything we do. Due to the 
changes we’ve made, we are now a more 
data-driven organisation where decisions 
are made based on what we know about 
our customers, not what we think we know. 
We conduct more customer listening 
groups than ever before; all trading 
meetings now begin with insight into our 
customers; and, as we celebrate ten years 
of leading the social and environmental 
agenda, we have repurposed Plan A to 
make it more customer-focused. 
Our customer-focused changes are most 
keenly felt in our stores. We invested in 
customer service by recruiting additional 
colleagues into the areas we know are most 
important to our customers. We also rolled 
out our Making Every Moment Special 
in-store service initiative.

Special below
Our new Spend It Well marketing campaign – 
like our Mrs Claus Christmas campaign 
before it – focuses squarely on our 
customers’ lifestyles. It taps into people’s 
emotional connection with M&S and is 
aimed at driving a reappraisal of our brand. 
Life is short so we should Spend It Well. The 
campaign encourages customers to make 
the most of what’s relevant for them today. 
CLOTHING & HOME
We asked how we could recover and grow 
our Clothing & Home business. The answer 
lay in making a series of common sense, 
customer-focused changes to the way we 
do things. In a tough market, I am pleased 
with the progress we are making.
By listening to our customers and simplifying how we do things, 
I believe we have the right strategy in place to make M&S a relevant, 
proﬁ table and truly sustainable retailer.

STRATEGIC UPDATE
OUR BUSINESS
MAKING EVERY MOMENT SPECIAL
Our Making Every Moment Special 
employee engagement programme has 
been transformational for our customers 
and our people alike. Through it, we believe 
we’ve taken customer service to new levels. 
Last summer, we gave over 70,000 store 
colleagues interactive training with the 
objective of putting customers at the heart 
of what we do. We encouraged them to make 
real-time decisions based on individual 
customers’ needs and we removed non-
customer-facing tasks from their daily 
routines, giving them more time to spend 
with customers. The response from 
colleagues has been phenomenal and as 
positive as anything I’ve known in my 28 
years at M&S. Our ‘Customer at the Heart’ 
site on Yammer, our internal social media 
network, contains thousands of examples 
of great service by our colleagues. 
Throughout our 1 33-year history, we have 
learnt that better service leads to better 
sales. Making Every Moment Special shows 
this principle in action. It has become our 
mantra across the business. By empowering 
our people to make customer-focused 
decisions, our sales ﬂ oors are buzzing 
with a renewed sense of purpose. 09
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We made shopping simpler for customers 
by reducing the number of times we launch 
new lines from 1 4 to nine times a year. 
We cut the number of garment options 
by 10%. We are phasing out the Indigo, 
Collezione and North Coast sub-brands. 
These measures enabled us to improve 
availability across our ranges. Previously, 
we acted too much like a ‘fast fashion’ 
company, prioritising frequency over quality 
and taking too many cues from catwalk 
fashions. So we improved our ﬁ ts, fabrics 
and ﬁ nishes, we increased availability and 
we refocused on delivering contemporary 
wearable style and wardrobe essentials. 
Our ranges are now more relevant to what 
customers want from M&S. 
We started off ering better value than ever 
before by reducing prices on 2,400 Clothing 
& Home lines. We simultaneously reduced 
our promotional activity. This put an end to 
confusing pricing which meant our products 
were either too expensive or too heavily 
discounted. Not only have these changes 
given clarity to customers, but they made 
our sales more proﬁ table and boosted our 
full-price market share.
We also made our stores far easier to shop 
in by merchandising more of our clothes 
by product category rather than by brand. 
This change in emphasis reﬂ ected the 
changes we made last year to the way our 
teams design and buy products. Our shops 
are now simpler and more intuitive. They are 
based around customers’ needs. 
We are still in the recovery phase of our plan 
and getting it right is absolutely crucial to 
our success. In May this year, we announced 
a new role to lead this work. Jill McDonald 
will join as Managing Director, Clothing, 
Home & Beauty and will have overall proﬁ t 
and loss accountability for all aspects of 
our Clothing & Home business, from design 
and sourcing through to supply chain and 
logistics. The scope of this role highlights 
the importance we are placing on 
continuing to recover and starting to 
grow Clothing & Home. We are making 
encouraging progress and I believe we 
are on the right path to growth.

STRATEGIC REPORT
 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC UPDATE CONTINUED
FOOD
Convenient. Special. Diff erent. These are 
the reasons why customers love our food. 
These are also the reasons why our Food 
business is on a clear path to sustainable 
growth. We know that selling quality food 
from convenient locations is a winning 
formula: sales from the 30 owned Simply 
Food stores we opened this year are ahead 
of plan. We’ll continue to grow our Food 
business by opening 250 further Food 
stores by 2020. We’re succeeding in 
our aim of making every food moment 
special. Customers love our high levels of 
innovation – we renew around a quarter 
of our range every year – and they love 
the high quality of our products. We won’t 
accept second-rate ingredients. In a world 
where you get what you pay for, it shows. 
This year we extended Collection, our 
top tier range for customers who want 
something extra special. And customers 
know they can trust us on health. It is their 
number one concern when it comes to 
buying food, so we launched 200 new 
products aimed at helping our customers 
to eat well, and extended our Made Without, 
Balanced for You and Eat Well ranges. 
The grocery market continues to be very 
competitive but we will continue to set 
ourselves apart with superior quality, 
innovation and convenient food in 
convenient locations. As we grow our 
Food store presence, our food will be even 
more accessible to more customers. 
OUR PEOPLE
By thinking, working and behaving with 
a truly customer-centric mindset, I believe 
our people are integral to our success. 
Last year I asked what our right cost base, 
shape and structure was, and how this 
would aff ect our people. In April 201 7 , we 
ﬁ nalised the pay and pensions changes 
that I outlined last year and we now reward 
our people in a fairer, more consistent way. 
I am immensely proud that we now have 
pay and beneﬁ t parity across the business. 
Following detailed consultation with our 
National Business Involvement Group of 
elected employee representatives, we now 
off er one of the best reward packages in 
UK retail. 
In November, we outlined further plans to 
simplify the business and lower our costs. 
This resulted in a reduction of roles at our 
Head Offi  ce and the decision to reduce our 
central London offi  ce space as we move 
to more effi  cient ways of working. Some 
of these decisions had a direct impact on 
a number of our employees. But I believe 
our people recognise that we made them 
for the right reasons and that they were 
necessary for our sustainable growth.
I would like to thank all our people for their 
dedication and professionalism in a year 
of signiﬁ cant but necessary change. 
STORE ESTATE AND INTERNATIONAL
Our customers’ shopping habits are 
changing, so I asked whether our UK and 
International store estate is the right shape 
for the future. It is not. Customers’ behaviour 
is evolving, and the pace of change is 
accelerating. Rather than doing one big 
food shop a week, there is a growing trend 
of customers picking up food for now or for 
tonight. Look at how people use technology. 
They’ll browse or buy online and collect in 
store. Or they’ll buy on their smartphone 
for home delivery. Sales on M&S.com now 
account for 1 7% of Clothing & Home sales. 
At the same time, customers want to shop in 
modern stores that off er a great experience. 
Our store portfolio needs to reﬂ ect how 
people live their lives today.
So we announced plans to rebalance our 
UK space to meet changing customer 
needs. The transformation will enable us 
to grow Clothing & Home sales through 
fewer, better stores. Over ﬁ ve years, we will 
change the use of around 25% of our space, 
with more of it being deployed to Food and 
other growth areas. Clothing & Home space 
will reduce by around 10%. Approximately 
30 full-line stores will close, and 45 will be 
converted to Simply Food. 
To be clear, this is neither a withdrawal nor a 
retrenchment. Due to our ambitious Food 
expansion we will have more stores in the 
future, not fewer. But our estate will be the 
shape which meets how our customers 
want to shop at M&S. 
Our International operations have also 
changed. While our franchise business with 
our knowledgeable partners is proﬁ table, 
our owned estate is not. This is unsustainable, 
so we are focusing on our joint venture and 
franchise partnerships and our growing 
online business, and exiting ten of our loss-
making owned markets. The programme is 
on track. We have now closed all ten of our 
stores in China and completed employee 
consultations in the remaining markets. 
We remain a signiﬁ cant player on the global 
stage with a store or online presence in 
55 markets. I believe in an international 
business for M&S and remain committed 
to it.
These changes show that we’re willing to 
adapt to ensure we’re in the best shape for 
our customers.
OUR OPERATING MODEL
Simplicity and accountability are key 
to running an agile and successful 
business. We are therefore changing our 
operating model to give us two clear proﬁ t 
and loss accountabilities – one for our 
Clothing & Home business unit and one 
for our Food business unit. Both sides of 
the business are now responsible for their 
own end-to-end proﬁ t & loss. As part of 
the change, M&S.com has moved from 
being a separate business unit to being 
a sales channel, along with Stores and 
International. All three channels now 
feed into our two business units, with our 
customers at the centre. Underpinning 
these changes is the ongoing drive for 
simplicity in the way we do things.

COSTS 
Cost control remains a top priority. 
Our operating costs were up 3.8% this 
year as we put more colleagues into stores 
and absorbed the costs of our Food store 
opening programme. We funded some of 
this through our Crunch Costs initiative, 
which challenged all of our people to tackle 
unnecessary costs, and from simplifying 
our Head Offi  ce structure. Better buying 
initiatives, such as direct design and food 
packaging optimisation, mitigated the 
currency headwinds we saw on both sides 
of the business. The steps we’ve taken to 
transform M&S led to charges of £437 .4m 
this year. These were largely driven by 
charges for International store closures 
and for the changes to pay and pensions. 
While proﬁ ts were signiﬁ cantly down, 
I continue to believe in good cash 
management, a robust balance sheet and 
a progressive dividend policy. We know how 
important our dividend is to shareholders 
big and small.

OUR CHAIRMAN
Our Chairman, Robert Swannell ,has 
announced that he will step down in 
September. On behalf of all of us at M&S, I 
wish Robert well. He has overseen signiﬁ cant 
change at M&S. Our infrastructure now 
provides a strong platform for growth, and 
Robert has been instrumental in driving 
shareholder engagement, good governance 
and succession planning. He has also been 
a tremendous support to me personally 
over the last year. On behalf of the whole 
business, I would like to welcome Robert’s 
successor, Archie Norman.
LOOKING AHEAD
My priorities for the year ahead are to 
continue to recover and grow Clothing & 
Home and to grow our Food business. I will 
also establish the foundations for new 
paths to growth. In the UK, these will focus 
on areas of market share opportunity in 
Kidswear, Footwear, Home and Beauty. 
Internationally, we will explore new territories 
with our franchise partners. And I will continue 
to develop talent within the organisation. 
It continues to be a privilege to lead this 
fantastic company. Our job as a retailer is 
quite simple: we must off er customers great 
products at the right price in physical or 
digital environments that they enjoy, with 
great service. If we do this, they will come 
back to us for more. 
But to do this year-in, year-out, we must 
constantly adapt. We must adapt both to stay 
in tune with our customers’ needs and in the 
way we sell our products. Shopping habits 
won’t stop changing, so neither must we. 
As Chief Executive, I want to make M&S agile 
and ﬂ exible enough to change with our 
customers. I want to see the end of big 
transformation programmes followed by 
years of standing still, followed by yet more 
transformation. Remaining relevant should 
be a continuous process.
By simplifying how we do things and really 
listening to our customers, we’ve already 
become more agile this year. By rationalising 
our Clothing ranges and reshaping our store 
portfolio, we’ve started to put this agility 
into practice. In doing this, we’ve built a solid 
foundation for growth. We must never stop 
adapting our business for our customers.
Nothing makes me prouder of the work our 
teams do than hearing from our customers 
and what they love about M&S. Those 
customers are the reason we’re here. They 
will remain at the heart of everything we do.
