Chief Executive’s Review
An excellent 
performance and  
a strengthened 
services platform
2017 saw Keywords successfully execute  
11 acquisitions as we continue to  
selectively consolidate our market.
Andrew Day
Group Chief Executive Officer 17 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
The Group has delivered another strong 
performance, with good like-for-like growth 
from the existing businesses combined  
with successfully securing and integrating 
acquisitions that have significantly enhanced 
our services platform in line with our strategy. 
Delivering on our strategy
We continue to execute well in pursuit of our 
strategy to build the world’s leading creative 
and technical services platform focused  
on the most complex of interactive content  
– video games. 
We operate in a service provision industry 
which remains highly fragmented despite  
the scale and global nature of the major  
video games publishers and developers,  
and the trend towards those clients 
outsourcing a greater proportion of their 
games development and in-game support  
to manage the demands for increasingly 
sophisticated content whilst limiting their 
fixed costs. 
The key pillars of our strategy are, therefore, 
to grow organically and by acquisition  
to extend the Group’s service capacity, 
capabilities and geographical reach –  
where we seek to gain access to markets  
for the best talent or to be close to our  
clients. By generating synergies across our 
expanding multi-service global platform,  
we are increasingly becoming a key strategic 
partner to our customers. 
2017 acquisitions 
2017 saw Keywords successfully execute  
11 acquisitions as we continue to selectively 
consolidate our market. These businesses  
are spread across multiple geographies  
and added to all seven of our service lines 
demonstrating the strength of our leadership 
team which comprises both regional and 
service line management. All of the acquisitions 
in 2017 have been or are being integrated.
In particular, the addition of Engineering 
services as our seventh service line during 
2017 has filled an important gap in our 
palette of services and we look forward to 
continuing to build this business in 2018  
and beyond. This was initially formed by our 
acquisition of GameSim in May and expanded 
through our acquisitions of d3t in October 
and Sperasoft in December, providing the 
Group with game development, game porting 
and live operations support talent totalling 
some 400 people.
We have also successfully extended our 
geographic reach adding operations in 
Eastern Europe for the first time through our 
acquisition of Sperasoft, giving us access to 
talent in a market known for strong technical 
skills, particularly in software development. 
Sperasoft brought with it scale and expertise 
in Engineering and Art services, with a 
particular strength in co-development in 
which significant parts of or even full games 
are developed on behalf of game developers 
or publishers. This further enhances our 
positioning as a strategic partner to game 
developers and publishers who are 
increasingly relying upon co-development 
arrangements to provide them with broader 
development support for their games that  
are increasingly bigger and higher definition, 
whilst we continue to ensure we are not 
directly exposed to the commercial 
performance of individual titles. We expect  
to be able to grow this way of working with  
our clients, combining Sperasoft’s strength  
in co-development with our broader service 
range for a more integrated service delivery.
Sperasoft’s 370 talented engineers, game 
designers, artists and project managers  
are based in St. Petersburg, Krakow and 
Volgograd and we are now looking at  
seeding some of our other services into  
these locations.
VMC, acquired in October for $66.4m, 
brought the Group leadership and scale in 
functional testing and significantly increased 
our presence in player support services. It 
also brought to the Group specialist expertise 
in managing “Embedded Technical Services”, 
through which VMC provides Testing, 
Customer Support and other services in-situ 
at clients’ facilities. VMC was a carve out from 
the publicly quoted Volt Information Sciences 
Inc. Its operations are in the US and Canada 
and its integration, which is nearly complete, 
includes consolidation of facilities and of 
management teams and the migration of  
the business to Keywords’ core operating  
IT platforms. The integration is being led  
by Nicolas Liorzou, our Regional Managing 
Director for the Americas who has led the 
successful integration of two previous 
acquisitions, Babel Media (acquired in 2014) 
and Enzyme (acquired in 2016). 
Our simultaneous acquisitions of the 
Paris-based audio and localisation  
businesses of La Marque Rose, Around the 
Word, Dune Sound and asrec in August  
are being integrated with our existing audio  
and localisation business there, which we 
acquired with the acquisition of Synthesis in 
2016. Led by Michel Golgevit, CEO of Around 
the Word, these businesses are planning to 
move to custom-built, state-of-the-art audio 
recording studios in 2018. Also in the Audio 
service line, LOLA in Mexico City was acquired 
just before the end of the year and they are 
working with the management of Kite Team  
in Mexico, which joined the Group in 2015,  
to integrate the two businesses. 
In our Art Service line, which saw a change  
of leadership at the end of the year with  
the retirement of Fred Stockton and the 
appointment of Ashley Liu as Service Line 
Director, the acquisitions of SPOV in London 
and Red Hot with its facilities in Shanghai, 
Dalian, Zhengzhou, Chengdu and Yogyakarta 
have performed to expectations and are 
integrating well. 
XLoc, a technology company with a 
proprietary content management solution 
that helps clients manage and automate the 
complex process of localising games content 
across multiple languages and platforms,  
was acquired in May. There have already been 
some successes in cross selling this platform 
alongside our localisation services which  
we believe will further embed us in to the 
localisation processes of games developers. 
Organic growth and investment
We have continued to drive organic growth 
across the business, having achieved a 15.1% 
increase in like-for-like revenue in 2017 (which 
is calculated on the basis of revenues being 
included for 2017 acquisitions from the date 
of acquisition and for the equivalent period  
in the prior year in order to provide a clearer 
measure of the organic growth of all of the 
businesses now within the Group). Audio  
had a particularly tough comparator with 
Synthesis having produced an exceptional 
performance in 2016 while all other service 
lines posted strong like-for-like growth. 
Functional Testing and Customer Support 
produced particularly strong growth. We  
have seen some beneficial impact from the 
burgeoning eSports market as we respond to 
demands for translation services, marketing 
materials and customer support related to  
the events being staged and we are seeing 
demand for our services from outside the 
games industry as other industries seek  
out the skills and technology to make their 
content interactive.  18 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

Strategic Report
A combination of our organic and acquisitive 
investment meant we finished the year  
with 42 operating locations in 20 countries 
compared to 27 locations in 17 countries  
in 2016. 
The acquisitions of VMC and Sperasoft  
will result in the Group’s share of revenue 
denominated in US Dollars growing from 46% 
in 2017. Recent weakness in the US Dollars 
compared to a number of other currencies  
in which the Group trades, such as the 
Canadian Dollar, Euro, Yen, Renminbi  
and Rupee, is being monitored and some  
US Dollars denominated pricing may be 
adjusted accordingly. 
Service line review
Art Creation  
(17% of Group revenues in the year)
Art Creation services revenue grew 58%  
to €26.2m (2016: €16.6m). On a like-for-like 
basis, Art grew by 14% year-on-year, reflecting 
a year in which Lakshya Digital consolidated 
the very strong growth of 2015 and 2016 and 
the remaining studios made good progress 
including Red Hot which we acquired in May. 
Including Sperasoft, we concluded the year 
with over 1,000 artists on our payroll of which 
the majority are in India and China. Through 
Liquid Development and Volta we manage 
further pools of freelance artists numbering 
about 200 in total. This talent base makes 
Keywords one of the largest art services 
businesses in the highly fragmented global 
video games art services market.
Our Art studios are increasingly working  
with each other to leverage their respective 
capacities, to deliver top quality work to their 
global client base. Likewise, with our recent 
investments in Engineering services, these 
two service lines are working together in a 
co-development model to produce complete 
game development services for game 
developers and publishers. 
Under the leadership of Ashley Liu (previously 
CEO of Mindwalk), the objective for our Art 
Creation services line is to continue to grow 
capacity to meet demand (including internal 
demand from our co-development activities), 
whilst maintaining our reputation for quality 
and reliability of delivery to our customers’ 
timescales. In addition, we aim to extend our 
capabilities in areas such as visual special 
effects, user interface design, cinematics and 
motion graphics, which we have started to  
do with the acquisition of Spov early in 2017. 
Engineering  
(2% of Group revenue for the year)
With Sperasoft only being included since 
December, d3t from October and GameSim 
from May, our Engineering service line is 
being built through acquisition in much  
the same as we have built our Art Creation 
service line which started in October 2014 
with the acquisition of Lakshya Digital. We 
have had some very early successes with 
cross selling our engineering capabilities into 
clients who use other Keywords services and 
we look forward to continuing to build our 
Engineering service line in 2018 and beyond.
Audio  
(14% of Group revenue for the year)
Our Audio service line increased revenues  
by 20% to €20.7m (2016: €17.3m) including 
contributions from La Marque Rose, Around 
the Word, Dune Sound and asrec, all of which 
were acquired in August and LOLA which was 
acquired in December. On a like-for-like basis, 
revenues in our Audio service line declined  
by approximately 10%, in part reflecting  
the exceptionally strong performance of 
Synthesis in the prior year. Also, the video 
games voice actors’ strike which effected  
the video games voice recording market  
in Los Angeles was resolved in September 
2017 and we look forward to more buoyant 
conditions there in 2018.
We opened an audio studio in Tokyo, 
strengthened our management of the 
combined Kite Team, Synthesis and Sonox 
operations in Madrid and also that of our  
Los Angeles studio. In 2018, we plan to invest 
in state of the art audio recording facilities  
in Paris and London.

Our organic growth was driven in part  
by further strong progress with extending  
our client relationships, as evidenced by  
a 45% increase in clients using three or  
more services from 64 in 2016 to 93 in 2017. 
As announced at the half year, we also 
launched an ambitious programme of 
investments in many of our studios to add 
capacity in locations including Montreal, 
Zhengzhou, Manila, Dublin, Madrid and  
Tokyo, with new recording studios planned  
for London and Paris in 2018.

Acquisition strategy
We continue to operate in a  
highly fragmented market
As a Group we are highly selective in which companies we 
chose to acquire, and they must meet the following criteria:
• Cultural fit – our most important: 
• We don’t engage if the business is clearly not a good fit;
• However, we have acquired Groups with different 
cultures and successfully changed them.
• Valuation – we don’t overpay but are fair:
• Most targets have a financial fragility despite being 
very good suppliers; 
• Valuations have averaged 1x revenue or 5-10x EBITDA.
• Financial performance – the least important for us:
• We know how to make money from the businesses  
we operate through achieving operational excellence.
As a result, underperforming businesses represent an 
opportunity for us.

Acquisitions in 2017. Integration and driving synergies
Our approach to integration, driving synergies and 
margins is tailored to each type of business
Type one – Standalone studios: 
• With new territories and new service 
lines, we focus on business processes  
to optimise margins over time;
• Subsequently, the access to a larger 
client base improves the business’ 
pipeline and improves utilisation rates.
Type two – Studios with strong overlap:
This is used when a business is acquired near 
an existing Keywords hub, or where no new 
services are added:
• We focus both on gross margins and  
on SG&A and operational expenditure 
costs, with immediate impacts; 
• For example, in the Montreal hub, Babel 
went from making losses to achieving 
20%+ EBITDA in the second year.
As a result of this, acquired companies 
almost always grow revenues strongly under 
Keywords ownership. We encourage them,  
to grow, to be bold, and to invest, and they 
benefit from being part of well-respected 
Group with known behaviour; we are easy  
to do business with, flexible, scalable, put the 
interests of the project first, financially solid 
and transparent.

Functional Testing  
(20% of Group revenue for the year)
Our Functional Testing services grew by 248% 
to €30.0m (2016: €8.6m), including a ten-week 
contribution from VMC which was acquired in 
October 2017. The service line also grew by 
an impressive 52% on a like-for-like basis. 
Some 50% of VMC’s €47m annual revenues 
fall into the Functional Testing service line  
and the service line management team  
have been instrumental in integrating the 
functional testing businesses in Seattle and 
Montreal, slimming down the combined 
management team, standardising tools and 
processes and making efficient use of office 
space. As a result, we anticipate improved 
margins from the VMC business as signalled 
at the time of acquisition.
The organic growth of Functional Testing  
has driven demand for increased capacity  
in Montreal and New Delhi and we have 
invested during the year in additional  
space in both locations and are evaluating 
options for expansion in other locations.
During the year we also invested in Player 
Research, the play testing business we 
acquired in October 2016, with the opening  
of a purpose-built play test laboratory  
in our Montreal building.
Localisation  
(28% of Group revenue in the year)
Our Localisation activities, including 
contributions from XLoc acquired in May,  
La Marque Rose, Around the Word, Dune 
Sound, asrec and VMC which were acquired  
in August, increased revenues by 30%, to 
€42.0m (2016: €32.4m), and continued its 
excellent record of growth with a like-for-like 
increase of 20%. 
The business produced around 250 million 
translated words during the year as our 
Localisation service line continued to benefit 
from the trend towards “games as a service” 
which necessitates fresh content being added 
to the game on a frequent basis to expand 
the game worlds and keep players engaged. 
Another driver of growth has been eSports 
where our localisation expertise has been 
called upon for the production of marketing

content, customer support materials and  
“live translation” of event content. We are  
the leading localisation provider for video 
games and enjoy a strong position in the 
fast-growing mobile games segment of  
the market, where content additions to  
the many leading games that we support 
result in continuous localisation work for  
the Group in as many as 30 languages.
During the year we completed the internal 
rollout of our proprietary localisation  
project management system, BPS, and we 
continue to invest in enhancements to the 
software to improve the efficiency of our 
localisation teams. Cross selling
The largest single opportunity for 
Keywords comes from our own ability 
to guide clients who already trust us to 
other services we could provide to 
them from within the Keywords Group
The continuous nature of game development lends  
itself well to cross selling. Keywords provides services  
at all six stages of the games lifecycle, creating ample 
opportunities to refer business to other studios.  
See pages 12 and 13 for more detail.
We have a strong and clear management structure  
which encourages a culture of pursuing more and more 
cross selling opportunities. Approach is clearly achieving 
results and we are constantly working on cross-selling 
opportunities. 93 of our 646 clients now use three or 
more services, up from 64 in 2016.

Localisation Testing  
(13% of Group revenue in the year)
Our Localisation Testing operations grew  
by 22% on an absolute basis to €19.9m  
(2016: €16.2m) helped by the addition  
of revenues from VMC and full year 
contributions from Synthesis and Enzyme 
which were acquired in April 2016 and 
November 2016 respectively. On a  
like-for-like-basis, growth was a more modest 
3%. The integration of VMC’s Localisation 
Testing business is progressing well.
With secure localisation testing studios in 
Montreal, Dublin, Milan, Singapore and Tokyo 
we believe this service line is the largest 
provider of localisation testing in the video 
games market. We look forward to continuing 
to serve our clients around the world while 
optimising our production efficiency, assisted 
by our increased scale, and developing our 
talent pool of games passionate professionals 
of over 30 different nationalities.
Customer Support  
(6% of Group revenue for the year)
Revenues for this service line benefitted  
from a significant contribution from VMC  
and grew by 64% to €9.2m (2016: €5.6m).  
On a like-for-like basis, the business grew  
by 16% thanks to new client wins and 
successful cross selling efforts.
Our Customer Support business which 
includes live operations support functions  
like community management, fraud 
prevention, bot hunting and VIP services, 
continues to perform strongly and is 
achieving strong organic growth. 
Among the highlights for this business  
line has been the growth of the Manila- 
based customer support operation spun  
out from our client, Ankama in March 2016 
from the then 23 staff to over 350 today. 
We’ve also been pleased with the success  
of our customer support teams based in  
our studio in Tokyo, where they service  
both Japanese and non-Japanese clients. 
During the year we opened a multilingual 
customer support studio in Madrid alongside 
our audio and localisation businesses there 
and in 2018 we are considering establishing  
a support centre in Eastern Europe as we 
leverage our presence there following the 
Sperasoft acquisition.
Whilst our Customer Support service  
line remains a relatively small part of the 
Group, we believe our specialist teams  
offer an attractive alternative to traditional 
large customer support call centres. Our 
customers are highly focussed on keeping 
gamers in their games for longer. We believe 
our model of using teams of passionate 
gamers with deep knowledge of the games 
they are supporting provides improved user 
satisfaction and will enable us to increase  
our share of this growing market over time.
People
The Group employed an average 3,167  
people in 2017 (2016: 1,818). Well balanced 
across our three regions, we employed  
1,142 in The Americas, 609 in Europe and 
1,416 in Asia. As the growing games industry 
continues to produce more content for 
industries as diverse as retail, urban planning, 
advertising, education, architecture and 
automotive which adopt the use of game 
engines to make their content more 
interactive and engaging, so we see the 
demand for human capital increase. Our 
broad and deep pool of highly experienced 
and games passionate co-workers provide  
an outsourced resource for our clients to  
tap into as and when they need in order to 
get their content to market in a flexible and 
cost-efficient manner. 
Our culture acts as the glue that binds our 
staff around the world together. Relaxed, 
professional and humble with a focus on 
doing the very best we can for each project 
entrusted to us, this culture creates an 
environment in which games passionate 
individuals can work together with likeminded 
colleagues while enjoying the opportunity to 
work on most of the world’s leading games 
ahead of their release. Working on around 
150 games at any time in the year and  
more than 500 in total throughout the  
year, Keywords provides an excellent and 
sustainable variety of work, good career 
advancement and opportunities to work in 
many different locations. We are proud to 
serve as a stepping stone for those that go  
on to make their careers in games production 
and publishing and we are fortunate to  
have an excellent alumnus of Keywordians 
employed by many of our client companies.
Our acquisition programme also brings  
fresh talent to the Group at all levels and  
we continue to be successful at integrating 
our businesses, including providing 
opportunities for staff to move between our 
various studios. This year we have added 
game programmers, game designers and 
engineers to our ever-growing Keywords 
family. This is reflected in our senior 
leadership team, which comprises four  
people from the original Keywords business, 
seven people from acquired entities as well  
as four externally hired employees.

for games made for this platform and assist 
developers in repurposing existing games  
for the Switch. 
The astounding success achieved by battle 
arena games led by Fortnite and Player 
Unknown Battleground seem set to continue 
and we are fortunate to be providing services 
for those games too. The mobile games 
sector continues to grow faster than the 
other platform types, with much of this 
growth originating in Asia where we continue 
to expand and build upon our relationships 
with the major games publishers in China, 
Japan and Korea.
The evolution of the console gaming sector 
from packaged product, through digitally 
delivered content and into the monetisation 
models of free to play and micro transactions 
that were previously the preserve of PC and 
mobile gaming is interesting to see and brings 
with it a requirement on the part of our game 
developer and clients to continually feed their 
games with new content, the challenges of 
which we have mastered over time with our 
clients in PC, social and mobile gaming. 24 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC 
Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Augmented reality has received a lot of 
attention but, as with virtual reality in 2016,  
we feel this technology is still early stage  
and the mass adoption of both content 
formats is probably a few years off. However,  
virtual and augmented reality games and 
applications continue to generate additional 
demand for our services.
The eSports market is developing strongly 
and, while we do benefit to some extent from 
this through the provision of our existing 
services to support the games being played 
and through supporting the marketing and 
communications management of the events 
themselves, we continue to seek out ways  
in which we could participate in this segment  
in a more meaningful manner. 
Outlook
As we did in 2016, in 2017 we had a strong 
finish to the year, particularly in our audio and 
testing businesses. The typically quieter first 
quarter has seen activity levels in line with  
our expectations and the positive momentum 
in the business gives us confidence in the 
outcome for the full year. 
Early wins of co-development projects in  
2018 are encouraging signs of the demand 
from game developers and publishers for 
integrated delivery of Engineering and Art  
in the form of game remastering and game 
development. We anticipate that demand  
for co-development services will continue to 
increase as the size and complexity of games 
makes it harder for any one development 
studio to undertake all the development 
themselves. We look forward to being able  
to package more of our services into 
co-development style engagements,  Strategic partnerships
The market continues to evolve, moving towards  
adopting a Strategic Partnership Model
There are currently three main models that are adopted:
• Dedicated teams:  
In this scenario, specialist teams work 
solely on one client or project, operating 
within existing Keywords offices, 
however these are made to look and 
feel like the client’s offices but using 
Keywords platforms and expertise. 
• Spin off production centres: 
Here, the client transfers control of its 
team and offices over to Keywords as 
an outsourcing agreement, building  
on existing talent and infrastructure  
to create a broader service delivery  
hub. The benefit of this option is  
that it allows clients to focus internal 
talent on core strengths. We find that 
competitive pressures have been 
causing this to be more widely adopted.
• Strategic Partnership Model: 
This is the next step in outsourcing, 
creating deep partnerships which are 
integrated in technology, processes and 
talent. Keywords and the client have a 
common innovation roadmap, involving 
multiple service lines. We take an 
adaptive approach to create customised 
solutions, offering both regional or 
global solutions on a large scale. 
Keywords’ co-development expertise, 
unique talent, technology, knowledge 
and scale creates supplier-client 
interdependency – which we love!
25 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
including audio, localisation and testing,  
to add further value to our clients.
As a more diversified, better balanced 
business with an expanded range of services 
and locations to offer our clients, and the 
support of a global sales and marketing 
function, we see many opportunities to 
extend our existing relationships and  
become a strategic partner to major  
games companies, both through providing 
more integrated services and through  
the provision of dedicated outsourced  
or embedded services.
Each service line is pursuing a growth 
strategy formulated for its own market 
opportunity, with some including a larger 
acquisition component than others to add 
scale or capabilities that we do not currently 
have within the Group, with the aim of a  
good balance between all seven service  
lines over time. 
We have entered 2018 with a considerably 
enhanced platform and a healthy acquisition 
pipeline and we fully expect to grow our 
business organically as well as through 
selectively acquiring complementary 
businesses as we continue to consolidate  
the highly fragmented market for video  
games services in 2018.
