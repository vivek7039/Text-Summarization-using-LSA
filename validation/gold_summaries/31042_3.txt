EnQuest PLC  Annual Report 2017
Chairman’s statement
EnQuest performance overview
EnQuest delivered a number of 
commendable operational achievements 
in 2017, combined with another year 
of strong safety performance. In June, 
first oil was achieved at the Kraken 
project, a critical turning point for 
the Company in delivering improved 
operating cash flow and marking the start 
of a material reduction in the Group’s 
capital investment requirements. While 
the subsequent ramp-up in production 
took longer than anticipated following 
initial commissioning and operational 
efficiency issues, by the end of the year, 
this large and complex development 
had produced over 40,000 Bopd (gross). 
In the first two months of 2018, average 
gross production was around 38,000 
Bopd, and has reached 50,000 Bopd 
with improving operational efficiency as 
we continue to optimise performance.
Group production of 37,405 Boepd in 2017 
was disappointing, primarily caused by 
performance issues at Alma/Galia and 
lower than planned production from both 
Kraken and Scolty/Crathes.
Despite the challenges presented by the 
prevailing macro-economic environment, 
the Group undertook further steps to 
set the platform to improve the balance 
sheet. The Group delivered operating 
and capital expenditures in line with 
targets, demonstrating the team’s focus 
on cost control and managing commercial 
agreements. EnQuest also completed 
a crude oil prepayment transaction and 
executed a refinancing agreement for 
its Tanjong Baram project in Malaysia, 
which combined improve the Group’s 
liquidity by more than $100 million.
The Group continued to pursue its vision 
and advance its long-term growth plan, 
agreeing and completing the acquisition 
of interests in the Magnus oil field and the 
Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (‘SVT’) from BP. 
This innovatively structured transaction 
required no immediate cash payment from 
EnQuest and limits the Group’s exposure 
to negative cash flows from Magnus, 
capitalising on EnQuest’s strengths in 
realising value from maturing oil fields with 
large volumes in place.
This transaction adds to the material 
growth potential of EnQuest’s asset 
base. By the end of 2017, EnQuest had 
a net 2P reserve base of 210 MMboe, 
which represents average growth of 
approximately 13% per annum since 
EnQuest’s formation eight years ago 
and a reserve life of around 17 years.
Industry context
Oil & Gas UK’s Economic Report 2017 
showed that since 2014 the cost of lifting 
oil from the North Sea has almost halved, 
an improvement in unit operating costs 
highlighted as being greater than the 
improvements achieved by any other 
basin. EnQuest’s cost conscious approach 
has been central to its business model 
since its inception and the Group remains 
focused on driving innovative and 
collaborative ways of operating to deliver 
cost savings across its business. While that 
quantum of reduction in operating costs 
cannot be repeated, a focus on improving 
costs and driving efficiencies is a 
fundamental requirement in ensuring 
EnQuest is able to deliver profitable 
growth over the long term.
The opportunity for long-term growth in 
the North Sea is clear: The UK Oil & Gas 
Authority recently announced they expect 
11.7 billion barrels of oil and gas to be 
produced from the UK Continental Shelf 
(‘UKCS’) over the period 2016 to 2050, an 
increase of 2.8 billion barrels of oil and gas 
from that previously forecast; and the UK 
Department for Business, Energy & 
Industrial Strategy forecasts oil and gas 
will still be supplying around two-thirds of 
domestic energy demand by 2035, 
confirming their place as vital sources of 
energy supply.
EnQuest is supportive of the UK 
Government’s proposals to introduce a 
mechanism to transfer tax history on the 
sale and purchase of North Sea oil assets. 
We welcome the removal of a potential tax 
barrier to the conclusion of deals. EnQuest 
has demonstrated the dramatic and 
positive impact on production, production 
efficiency and field life which can be 
achieved when assets move into the right 
hands. If implemented in the right way, 
these measures will be another positive 
step by the Government in supporting the 
strategy for Maximising Economic 
Recovery for the UK.
The UKCS remains a compelling basin 
in which to invest. It has exciting 
hydrocarbon opportunities, established 
infrastructure, access to a world-class 
supply chain and a highly skilled 
workforce, all supported by a globally 
competitive fiscal regime. A similar 
investment proposition continues to 
prevail in Malaysia where the Group has 
a strong partnership with PETRONAS. 
These opportunities provide EnQuest 
with long-term potential for growth.
The EnQuest Board
With the Board’s focus on succession 
planning, and after rigorous search 
processes, I was delighted to welcome 
three new Non-Executive Directors to the 
Company since the start of 2017: Carl 
Hughes joined the Board on 1 January 
2017, having previously been an energy 
and resources audit partner of Deloitte; 
John Winterman, who has extensive 
leadership experience in global 
exploration, business development and 
asset management, was appointed on 
7 September 2017; and Laurie Fitch, who 
has worked in a variety of investment and 
corporate finance roles, joined us on 
8 January 2018. All three bring 
considerable and varied expertise to the 
Company and I look forward to working 
with them.
In July 2017, Dr Philip Nolan stepped down 
from his role as Non-Executive Director, 
having joined the Board in 2012. I thank 
Philip for his valuable contribution to the 
Company, especially in its development 
over the past five years. I would also like to 
thank Neil McCulloch, who stepped down 
as Chief Operating Officer and Executive 
Director in December 2017, for his 
unstinting contribution to EnQuest during 
a challenging period for both the 
Company and industry.
EnQuest’s people
In 2017, the Group remained focused on 
positioning the business for the prevailing 
oil price environment, whilst at the same 
time ensuring it continued to achieve its 
operational targets. Management of 
matters pertaining to the Kraken and 
Magnus projects required significant 
amounts of the Board and management’s 
time and attention, while compliance with 
debt covenants and review of liquidity 
options also remained a priority. The 
Group’s achievements against these 
objectives have only been possible due to 
EnQuest’s people. The Board and I would 
like to express our gratitude to everyone 
at EnQuest for having continued to work 
with such energy and dedication to 
In 2018, EnQuest has entered a 
new phase.

The Group has a Code of Conduct that it 
requires all personnel to be familiar with as 
it sets out the behaviour which the 
organisation expects of its Directors, 
managers and employees, and of our 
suppliers, contractors, agents and 
partners. This year, it has been updated 
with guidance on preventing the 
facilitation of tax avoidance.
EnQuest’s Company values underpin 
a working environment where people 
are safe, creative and passionate, with 
a relentless focus on results. Inductions 
for all employees transferring from BP 
were run in September to ensure that 
all those impacted understood the 
EnQuest business, how we work and 
how they can contribute to EnQuest’s 
success. Alongside this, time was 
invested to understand the culture of 
our business through an online survey 
and subsequent focus groups. Following 
a review of the results from these 
activities, the Executive Committee is 
working on identifying the next steps 
to develop the culture and ensure that 
EnQuest is an attractive place to work.
Dividend
The Company has not declared or paid 
any dividends since incorporation and 
does not plan to pay dividends in the near 
future. Any future payment of dividends is 
expected to depend on the earnings and 
financial condition of the Company 
meeting the conditions for dividend 
payments which the Company has agreed 
with its lenders and such other factors as 
the Board of Directors of the Company 
considers appropriate.
2018: A new chapter
In 2018, EnQuest is entering a new phase. 
Kraken is progressing well, the Magnus 
integration and drilling programmes are 
well underway, plans are being developed 
to enhance performance at our other 
producing assets, and the period of heavy 
capital investment is largely behind us. 
These material advances should result in 
EnQuest generating positive net cash flow 
after investment and tax, allowing us to 
continue to manage our capital structure 
and liquidity position. Despite the current 
improvement in the near term oil price 
environment, we recognise we must 
maintain our focus on financial discipline, 
cost efficiencies and managing Group 
liquidity. Consequently, it is important that 
we prioritise our resources to those key 
projects which maximise cash flow to 
facilitate debt reduction, continuing the 
Company’s progress towards a more 
sustainable balance sheet and enabling 
the long-term growth of the business.
address the challenges presented in 
recent years, ensuring that EnQuest can 
move forward, to create further value from 
opportunities in maturing oil fields.
The Board and I would also like to take this 
opportunity to thank all those who worked 
on the acquisition of assets from BP, and 
extend a particularly warm welcome to our 
new colleagues and contractor workforce 
who joined EnQuest as a result.
Strategy and governance
The Directors provide strategic guidance 
to executive management and take key 
decisions on the implementation of the 
Group’s strategy. 
During 2017, the Board reviewed and 
refined the presentation of the Company’s 
purpose, vision, strategy and business 
model (see page 04). In addition, a  
number of ‘tenets’ were developed to 
guide the Company’s pursuit of its 
strategy in accordance with the Group’s 
appetite for risk and within its Risk 
Management Framework.
Ensuring that the Board works effectively 
remains a key focus of the Company.  
2017 saw the Risk Committee, established 
in 2016, fully embedded into the governance 
structure of the Company. The primary 
purpose of the Risk Committee is to 
provide a forum for in-depth examination 
of non-financial risk areas. EnQuest’s 
governance framework also contains 
several non-Board Committees, which 
provide advice and support to the 
Chief Executive, including an Executive 
Committee, Operations Committee and 
Investment Committee.
The Board believes that the manner in 
which it conducts its business is important 
and it is committed to delivering the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance for the benefit of all of its 
stakeholders. The Board has approved the 
Company’s overall approach to corporate 
responsibility, which is focused on five 
main areas. These are, Health and Safety, 
People, Environment, Business Conduct 
and Community.
The Board receives regular information on 
the performance of the Company in these 
areas, and specifically monitors health and 
safety and environmental reporting at 
each Board meeting. The Company’s 
Health, Safety, Environment & Assurance 
(‘HSE&A’) Policy is reviewed by the Board 
annually and all incidents, forward-looking 
indicators and significant HSE&A 
programmes are discussed by the Board. 
Specific developments and updates in all 
areas are brought to the Board’s attention 
when appropriate.
