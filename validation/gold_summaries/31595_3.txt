 THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 9
STRATEGIC REPORT
 CHAIRMAN’S
 ST A TEMENT 
2017 has been a year of considerable strategic progress 
at Thomas Cook. In what remains a highly competitive 
environment – one that has contributed to the collapse 
of a number of competitors in the last 12 months – 
Management’s focus on executing its strategy for 
profitable growth has delivered good results for the year, 
and set the business on a clear path for sustainable 
growth in the years to come. 
After five years of hard work to reposition Thomas Cook, 
there is a real sense of energy and momentum in the 
business – and tangible evidence of execution. 
Despite the competitive backdrop, the Group delivered 
an £28 million increase in underlying operating profit 
to £330 million, an eight per cent increase year-on-year, 
and net profit of £12 million, the third consecutive year 
of positive net profit after tax. We also took further steps 
to strengthen the balance sheet. Debt was reduced 
by another £89 million in the year, and the business 
has signed new financing arrangements amounting 
to £975 million. This builds on the work the Group has 
done over the last five years to progressively improve 
the terms and maturity of its debt to provide it with 
greater flexibility and a more robust capital structure 
over the medium term.
The progress the business made operationally should 
be seen alongside a number of very significant steps 
the Group took in 2017 to better position the business 
for the future.
In September, the business secured what promises to 
be a ground-breaking alliance with Expedia. Meanwhile, 
a new strategic partnership with Swiss hotel property 
development company, LMEY Investments, establishes the 
launch pad to develop and grow Thomas Cook’s portfolio 
of own-brand hotels, key to the successful delivery of the 
Group’s profitable growth strategy.
Reflecting the Board’s support for the progress that 
has been made in the last year and its confidence in 
the strategy, the Board has recommended that we pay 
a dividend to Shareholders of 0.6 pence per share.
Moving onto the business of the Board, we were 
pleased to welcome two new Non-Executive Directors 
in July, Jürgen Schreiber and Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson. 
Jürgen brings a breadth of international experience 
across retail and consumer goods including Chief 
Executive roles in both a publicly-listed company and 
large private companies. Paul, meanwhile, as CFO 
of InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), brings deep 
experience of the global hotel industry to the Board.
In January 2018, we will also welcome a new Executive 
Director to the Board when Bill Scott takes over from 
Michael Healy as CFO following Michael’s decision to 
retire. I look forward to Bill supporting us through the 
next phase of the Group’s development and would like 
to thank Michael for the very significant contribution he 
has made to the financial health of the Group in his six 
years with the business. I am pleased that he has agreed 
to continue his involvement in the business through 
non-executive leadership roles in Thomas Cook China and 
Thomas Cook Money, two important areas of potential 
growth for the Group.
We are at an exciting point in the development of this 
company as we pursue our unique strategy to focus on 
our core holidays and streamline the business, while at 
the same time partnering with the best in the industry to 
offer customers a greater choice. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank Peter Fankhauser, CEO, and every 
one of the 22,000 colleagues across the business for their 
commitment and hard work in the past year. I would also 
like to thank all of our Shareholders for their continued 
support as we transform Thomas Cook for the future.
