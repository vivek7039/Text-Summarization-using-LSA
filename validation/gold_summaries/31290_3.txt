 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Chairman’s Report
When I wrote my update to accompany 
the 2016 Annual Report, Nostra Terra 
was still in the early stages of embedding 
its new strategy. The price of oil was 
consolidating and signs of recovery 
across the industry were in sight.
Twelve months later and the sector 
has rebounded strongly. Thanks to 
our efforts in 2016, Nostra Terra was 
well positioned to benefit greatly 
from this. The Company has since 
taken significant steps forward in 
realising its ambitions, delivering 
robust returns for shareholders. 
Our strategic focus switched in 2016 
to repositioning our portfolio of assets 
with the goal of growing stable oil 
production and reserves, which would 
be profitable at $30/bbl. In particular 
we sought to acquire leases, which were 
Held By Production (HBP). This ideally 
suited Nostra Terra because it meant we 
could control the pace of development 
of these assets, as conditions and our 
finances allowed.
In early 2017 we completed our 
second acquisition in the Permian Basin, 
Texas, and by April had increased the 
Company’s current proven reserves (1P) 
in the US to 522,000 barrels. As stated 
a year ago, these reported reserves 
were bankable and laid the foundation 
to enabling Nostra Terra to gain access 
to the working capital required to 
grow long term oil production.
To that end, Nostra Terra raised 
£500,000 in a placing in late April 2017 
and in September secured a hedging 
facility for future oil production with BP 
Energy Company. This was a significant 
leap forward for Nostra Terra and 
provided a ringing endorsement 
of the success of our new strategy. 
Perhaps more importantly it better 
positioned the Company to access 
non-dilutive working capital to 
fund future growth.
By the end of 2017 we were able to 
report we were in advanced discussions 
with a number of lenders. Eight days 
after the period ended, we finalised 
terms of a $5 million Senior Lending 
Facility with Washington Federal Bank, 
at an initial interest rate of 4.75% 
with an initial borrowing base of 
$1.2 million. 
Operationally, the introduction 
of new funds has meant a great 
deal to the business and has already 
yielded tangible results. In October 
we completed our third acquisition in 
the Permian Basin and by the middle 
of November started drilling the first 
new well on this lease, the Twin Well. 
We were subsequently able to put the 
Twin Well into production, a significant 
contributor to Nostra Terra becoming 
cash flow positive at the plc level, 
another major milestone for 
the Company.
In other areas, we have continued 
to work hard.
With respect to our investment in 
Magnolia Petroleum, we identified 
an opportunity where we believed our 
involvement would add significant value 
both to that company and to Nostra 
Terra. In response to the requisition 
for a General Meeting to seek change 
to Magnolia’s board, Magnolia’s existing 
directors chose to complete a highly 
dilutive deal, which we believe added 
precious little in terms of value to that 
company and was unfortunate for 
Magnolia’s shareholders. We exited 
our position at a profit. 
In Egypt we increased our stake 
in the East Ghazalat concession to 
50%, having acquired Echo Energy’s 
(AIM:ECHO) 25% stake for a $500,000 
consideration payable only upon certain 
approvals and production hurdles. For 
minimal outlay we will increase Nostra 
Terra’s assets to just over 1 million 
barrels of 2P Reserves.
We have continued to engage 
positively with various stakeholders in 
Egypt, and remain highly enthusiastic 
about the potential, but our first task 
has to be to resolve the legacy dispute 
with North Petroleum (“North”), the 
operator, which governs East Ghazalat, 
and the case has now been referred 
to international arbitration. 
In summary, I believe the future 
looks very bright for Nostra Terra. 
We have delivered on our promise 
to build secure, long-term, profitable 
production. We are now cash flow 
positive at the plc level and have 
access to significant working capital, 
fundamental attributes that are rarely 
found in companies on AIM or of our 
size. Now that we have put in place such 
a solid foundation our intention is to 
build on this through further acquisitions 
and organic growth. I would like to 
thank our shareholders for their 
continued support and look forward 
to reporting more progress in future.
