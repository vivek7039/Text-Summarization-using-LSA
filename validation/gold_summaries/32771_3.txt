Sirius Real Estate Limited
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Building momentum
In summary:
 » Sirius has continued to grow organically through its capex 
investment programme and its asset management techniques as 
well as acquisitively using the proceeds of two successful capital 
raisings in the period.
 » We have agreed the sale of two major core assets at above 
book valuation and completed the disposal of a non-core 
asset in the period.
 » The ability to invest and create income and value from the more 
difficult areas of our industrial and office portfolio has, in particular, 
been a significant contributor to the valuation and profit increases 
in the period.
I am pleased to report another strong year of trading 
for Sirius in what is my first Annual Report as Chairman 
of the Company. Sirius has continued to grow organically 
through its capex investment programme and its asset 
management techniques as well as acquisitively using 
the proceeds of two successful capital raisings in the 
period. This has significantly increased the profitability 
and value of the Company and culminated with the move 
of its shares to the main markets of both the London 
and Johannesburg stock exchanges on 6 March 2017. 
We indicated last year that asset recycling was going 
to be a major element of our continued growth going 
forward and I am pleased to say that we successfully 
agreed the sale of two major core assets at well above 
book value and completed the disposal of a non-core 
asset in the period. An additional mature asset, 
located in Kiel, was notarised for sale at €7.0 million 
after the period end. This, along with the proceeds 
of a €15.0 million private placing which completed at 
the end of the period, will provide the Company with 
substantial capital to reinvest into new assets in the 
next financial year.
This continued growth is reflected in all of the 
key metrics upon which the Company is measured. 
Adjusted profit before tax* was up by 54% to 
€35.3 million (2016: €22.9 million), basic European 
Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) EPS increased 
by 69.1% to 3.18c (2016: 1.88c). This has fed through 
to the Group’s valuations, which saw a like-for-like 
increase of 8.5% in the year contributing to an 
increase in EPRA NAV per share of 9.7% to 57.84c 
(2016: 52.72c), whilst adjusted NAV per share** 
increased by 10.3% to 58.82c (2016: 53.35c). 
The disciplined manner in which the Company has 
executed its strategy of providing conventional and 
flexible workspace whilst developing its sub-optimal 
vacant space into both conventional space and the 
Group’s range of flexible Smartspace products has 
also increased the quality of its portfolio and the 
sustainability of this increased income.
While this has been a good year for the business, 
momentum has been building for some years now as 
shown by the growth in the property portfolio which 
at the time of internalisation of the asset management 
platform in March 2012 stood at €486.1 million 
compared to the €823.3 million of property that 
is now held by the Company on its balance sheet. 
This substantial growth was one of the main driving 
forces behind the move up to the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange and to the Main Board of the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange and is indicative of just 
how far the Company has progressed over recent years. 
The move does also reflect an ambition to continue on 
the same upward trajectory and the Sirius Board believes 
that the benefits that will come from the step up will 
help in achieving this ambition.
A key differentiator for Sirius and the most 
important contributor to its success is the capability 
and effectiveness of its operating platform. The 
230-strong in-house team has continued to drive the 
key initiatives of the business such as the acquisitions 
and recycling programme, the major capex investment 
programme which transforms vacant and sub-optimal 
space, the lettings programme, as well as cost 
recovery initiatives. These initiatives are discussed in 
more detail in the asset management and financial 
review sections of this report but progress on all fronts 
has been encouraging. All of this activity has had a 
favourable impact on the value of the Group’ s properties. 
The ability to invest and create income and value from 
the more difficult areas of our industrial and office 
portfolio has, in particular, been a significant contributor 
to the value increases in the period. The Company’s 
like-for-like rent roll*** has again increased materially 
by 5.1% to €65.6 million (2016: €62.4 million) and 
this has been the main driver of the valuation increases 
mentioned above as we have only seen 32bps of yield 
compression on the core portfolio in the period.
As at 31 March 2017, we owned 44 assets with 
1.4 million sqm of net lettable area with a book 
value of €823.3 million (2016: €687.5 million), and 
total portfolio occupancy rate of 81% (2016: 80%). 
This reflects a gross yield of 8.6% (2016: 8.8%
^
) 
and a capital value per sqm of €563 (2016: €527
^
). 
We are confident that the potential to continue 
to grow the portfolio substantially further in this 
organic fashion remains strong. 9

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The move up to the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange and to 
the Main Board of the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange is indicative of 
just how far the Company has 
progressed over recent years.”
One of the most pleasing achievements of the year 
under review was being able to demonstrate the full 
cycle of the Sirius strategy with €101.9 million of disposals 
either completing or being agreed in addition to the sale 
of a land parcel for €1.5 million. A further mature asset 
was notarised for sale post period end for €7.0 million. 
In January 2017, the Company announced its most 
significant disposal to date in the sale of the 
Rupert Mayer Strasse business park asset in Munich for 
€85.0 million to an institutional buyer. The core disposals 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sirius strategy from 
acquisition, through the intensive asset management 
to profit crystallisation upon disposal. Furthermore this 
creates the opportunity to recycle capital from mature 
sites into assets with more future potential.
Additionally, the Company continued to identify 
acquisitions, with €103.3 million of new assets 
completed and €49.9 million notarised in the period 
or shortly post period end. Our asset management 
team has already identified good potential to enhance 
the income streams and capital values of these. We have 
now acquired €233.8 million of assets since we started 
our recent acquisitions programme and we expect 
this to continue into the new financial year where, with 
additional banking facilities, we will have the resources 
to acquire a further €65.0 million of assets on top 
of those mentioned above.
With the increase in the size of the business 
and the move to the main markets in London 
and Johannesburg, the Board of Sirius has expanded 
through my own appointment as Non-executive 
Chairman in September 2016 and more recently 
the appointment of Justin Atkinson, former CEO 
of Keller Group plc, as an independent Non-executive 
Director. Robert Sinclair from whom I took over as 
Chairman will not be offering himself up for re-election 
at the next AGM, having served the Company for the 
last ten years, five of those as Chairman. On behalf of 
the Board I would like to thank him for his outstanding 
commitment to Sirius during that time. In particular, 
whilst Chairman, Robert was instrumental in guiding 
the Company through the financial crisis to become the 
strong and fast growing Company that Sirius is today.
 
*  Reported profit before tax adjusted for property revaluation, 
change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and 
other adjusting items including expense relating to the Long 
Term Incentive Plan.
**  Excluding provisions for deferred tax and financial derivatives.
***  Including the Krefeld and Markgröningen acquisitions 
which completed just after year end and excluding the 
Merseburg disposal. 
^  Restated for the disposal of Merseburg and a land sale 
at CöllnParc.
The Board is currently actively recruiting for a 
replacement for Robert. Justin Atkinson, a qualified 
accountant, will take on the role of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee from Robert after the AGM.
Following on from the Company’ s growth in profitability, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.53c 
per share (2016: 1.30c), representing an increase of 
17.7% on the same period in the previous year, which 
gives a total dividend per share for the year of 2.92c, 
an increase of 32% (2016: 2.22c).
Looking forward, the Company remains well positioned 
to take advantage of operating within the most powerful 
economy in Europe and benefit from the strong occupier 
and investor demand across all subsections of the German 
real estate market. This will allow us to deliver attractive 
risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders whilst 
continuing to grow the business.
