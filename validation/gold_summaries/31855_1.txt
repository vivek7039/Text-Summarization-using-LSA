 A year of progress
We	have	led	Abcam	further	toward	achieving	our	goal	
of becoming the most influential life sciences company for 
researchers 	 worldwide. 	 We 	 remain 	 the 	 market 	 leader 	 in 	 the	
primary 	 antibody 	 market 	 and 	 have 	 grown 	 above 	 market 	 in	
all our product categories and territories, despite a highly 
competitive landscape. This outcome reflects our clear 
growth 	 strategy, 	 strong 	 product 	 line 	 and 	 dedication 	 from	
our team.
Our strategy leads to long-term 
sustainable growth
FY	2017	was	another	year	of	good	progress	as	we	continue	
to 	 build 	 on 	 the 	 growth 	 strategy 	 that 	 we 	 announced 	 in 	 2014.	
Our	customer	feedback	has	never	been	stronger	and	we	
continue 	 to 	 make 	 market 	 share 	 gains 	 worldwide. 	 To 	 prepare	
for	further	growth,	we	have	made	substantial	investments	
in our systems and processes, our facilities and our people, 
and	we	continue	to	work	hard	to	ensure	these	investments	
support	our	long-term	growth	aspirations.	Underpinning	our	
transformation	is	the	solid	financial	foundation	we	have	
established. 	 Overall, 	 we 	 believe 	 the 	 changes 	 we 	 are 	 creating	
will	enable	us	to	double	the	scale	of	Abcam	from	2016	to	
2023 in terms of the life science research influence and 
commercial scale of the Group.
It has been a year of  
progress for Abcam 
as we have once again 
delivered on our financial 
goals. We have delivered  
10% constant currency 
revenue growth, meeting  
our full year guidance,  
while continuing to invest  
in the long-term future of  
the Company.

Chief Executive Officer’s review Our strategy leads to long-term 
sustainable growth continued
We 	 have 	 delivered 	 strong 	 revenue 	 growth, 	 with 	 all 	 geographic	
areas and main product categories performing at levels 
above 	 underlying 	 market 	 growth 	 rates. 	 In 	 a 	 year 	 with 	 political	
uncertainty in large markets such as the US and Europe, our 
business	has	remained	focused	on	serving	customers	well.	
Our history and strengths in digital marketing continue to 
support	our	business	well	and	we	are	making	increasing	
use	of	data	to	enhance	our	product	selection,	website	
and	marketing	in	order	to	attract	new	customers	and	
satisfy more needs of our existing customers.
Our research use-only product catalogue revenues 
at	reported	values	grew	to	£202.5m	(FY	2016:	£159.0m),	
a 27.4% increase over the previous year. By product type, 
we 	 continue 	 to 	 grow 	 primary 	 antibody 	 revenue 	 ahead 	 of 	 the	
global 	 market 	 growth 	 rate. 	 Our 	 market 	 leading 	 recombinant	
antibodies, including RabMAb
®
 rabbit monoclonal antibodies, 
are	major	contributors	to	that	success.	Constant	currency	
revenues from RabMAb
®
	 products 	 are 	 in 	 line 	 with 	 our 	 full 	 year	
expectations,	growing	by	over	25%,	and	now	represent	
£41.5m of our total £159.8m primary research antibody 
revenue. With over 11,000 RabMAb
®
 primary antibodies 
in	our	catalogue,	10,000	of	which	are	recombinant,	these	
and other recombinant antibodies are expected to continue 
to	play	an	important	part	in	our	future	growth.
Product quality is a priority for our customers and, therefore, 
a 	 major 	 focus 	 of 	 our 	 work 	 and 	 investment 	 at 	 Abcam. 	 We 	 are	
investing to increase the standards and breadth of product
validation, 	 including 	 over 	 900 	 products 	 that 	 now 	 benefit 	 from	
market leading knockout validation. Our investments in the 
latest antibody production technology mean that our 10,000 
recombinant antibodies ensure the highest standard of 
repeatability for researchers and drug development teams. 
We	continue	to	work	closely	with	our	suppliers	to	ensure	
that they meet our high standards.
Non-primary antibody revenues on a constant currency basis 
grew	16%,	aggregated	across	several	product	categories.	
Kits	and	assays	are	the	largest	sub-category	within	this	part	
of our product portfolio, representing approximately 60% of 
the	revenue.	Following	the	mid-year	revision	to	lower	growth	
targets	for	this	portfolio,	the	products	performed	within	our	
expectations	and	all	product	categories	within	this	group	
grew	at	double-digit	levels	versus	the	prior	year.
Kits	and	assays	remain	a	very	important	growth	opportunity	
for Abcam. These products contain all the reagents researchers 
need to run an experiment and save researchers considerable 
time. For example, our SimpleStep ELISA
®
 kit reduces the time 
it takes to run the simple ELISA experiment from approximately 
four 	 hours 	 to 	 just 	 ninety 	 minutes, 	 with 	 the 	 added 	 benefit 	 that 	
the	kit	minimises	potential	variability	between	experiments.	
We are investing and innovating to move our market leading 
antibodies into these products as rapidly as possible. In the 
last 	 year, 	 we 	 have 	 created 	 new 	 assay 	 products 	 from 	 integrating 
antibody and assay technologies from our recently acquired 
companies. These combinations resulted in the introduction 
of	approximately	500	new	products	including	matched	
antibody pairs, singleplex immunoassays, and multiplex 
immunoassays using the FirePlex
®
 particle platform.

Beyond	the	research	use	product	market	that	we	serve	
through 	 our 	 catalogue, 	 we 	 are 	 working 	 to 	 grow 	 our 	 custom 	
products	and	services	by	working	with	leading	diagnostic	
and 	 pharmaceutical 	 companies 	 worldwide. 	 Forecasts 	 estimate	
that the end market value of antibody and immunoassay use 
in 	 diagnostics 	 and 	 therapeutics 	 is 	 expected 	 to 	 grow 	 to 	 circa	
$80bn by 2022. We believe Abcam can address up to $5bn 
of that total through in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products, other 
antibodies and immunoassays and biological therapeutics. 
We have an emerging reputation for successfully partnering 
with 	 pharmaceutical, 	 diagnostic 	 and 	 instrument 	 companies.	
These 	 businesses 	 work 	 with 	 Abcam 	 to 	 develop 	 antibodies 	 and	
immunoassays that they then take to market. Abcam benefits 
from the relationships through opportunities to license, and 
from 	 downstream 	 milestones 	 and 	 potential 	 royalties, 	 as 	 well	
as from the opportunity to sell the research-grade version of 
the antibody or immunoassay into our core research markets 
via	our	website.	This	is	a	model	we	are	replicating	across	
many 	 commercial 	 agreements 	 around 	 the 	 world 	 to 	 establish	
future	growth	for	our	business.

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued Underlying markets growing
We	observed	single-digit	underlying	market	growth	for	our	
products	in	all	regions	and	customer	segments	with	one	
exception 	 – 	 China. 	 China 	 continues 	 to 	 invest 	 public 	 funds 	 to	
support 	 a 	 life 	 science 	 strategy 	 such 	 that 	 we 	 are 	 seeing 	 12–15%	
annual	revenue	growth	for	the	markets	our	products	serve.	
In our largest market, the US, it has been a year of uncertainty 
around	the	funding	environment	following	the	presidential	
election. This resulted in an eventual increase in National 
Institute	of	Health	(NIH)	funding	for	2017,	coupled	with	a	
buoyant biopharma cycle. In Europe, there has been increased 
funding but Brexit has caused some disruption to the UK 
market as researchers move to replace EU research funding 
with	domestic	sources.	Elsewhere	in	the	world,	the	markets	
continued	to	grow	but	growth	remained	relatively	low	
compared 	 to 	 the 	 major 	 three 	 of 	 the 	 US, 	 China 	 and 	 Europe.
Our five strategic priorities
• Grow	our	core	reagents	business	faster	than	the	market.
• Establish	new	growth	platforms.
• Scale organisation capabilities.
• Sustain attractive economics.
• Selectively pursue partnerships and acquisitions.
Read more about our achievements against these priorities 
in the Strategic Priorities section.
The Company introduced these strategic priorities in 2014 
and the broad headlines remain the same, and they continue 
to 	 serve 	 us 	 well. 	 As 	 the 	 Company 	 progresses, 	 our 	 KPIs 	 continue	
to be updated to reflect the needs of the Company and the 
dynamic	markets	in	which	we	operate.

For	FY	2018	strategic	priorities	are	as	follows:
• Sustain antibody and digital marketing leadership.
• Expand	in	related	growth	markets.
• Invest in operating capabilities to double our scale 
from 2016 to 2023.
• Sustain attractive economics.
• Supplement	organic	growth	through	acquisitions

Delivering results from our investments
Business systems
Abcam 	 is 	 a 	 rapidly 	 growing 	 organisation 	 and 	 it 	 is 	 important 	 that	
we	have	the	IT	systems	infrastructure	and	business	processes	
to 	 support 	 this 	 growth. 	 We 	 are 	 investing 	 in 	 building 	 enhanced	
capabilities, processes and systems centred around the 
Oracle Cloud ERP system. 
We are putting significant emphasis on organisational 
preparation, training and transformation to support the 
improvements 	 that 	 the 	 ERP 	 system 	 will 	 make 	 in 	 the 	 way 	 we	
do	business	and	support	the	growth	that	we	are	working	to	
deliver. We are resolutely focused on delivering a high quality 
solution	that	is	scalable	and	will	deliver	future	efficiency	
improvements. 	 During 	 the 	 year, 	 we 	 have 	 chosen 	 to 	 adopt 	
additional functionality, including a Warehouse Management 
System, 	 and 	 we 	 have 	 successfully 	 implemented 	 the 	 HR 	 and	
certain customer service modules and are making good 
progress	towards	full	implementation	in	FY	2018.
UK facilities
We currently operate from three separate sites in Cambridge, 
which	are	not	only	at	the	end	of	their	leases,	but	also	at	the	
end of their operational lives. We have started construction 
of 	 our 	 new 	 HQ 	 facility 	 and 	 we 	 are 	 looking 	 forward 	 to 	 relocating	
to 	 the 	 Cambridge 	 Biomedical 	 Campus 	 in 	 early 	 2019, 	 following	
completion of the build and fit-out.
Leadership Team
Over 	 the 	 year 	 we 	 have 	 completed 	 the 	 hiring 	 of 	 our 	 Executive	
Leadership	Team	and	are	confident	that	we	have	the	right	
team and expertise in place to lead Abcam in our next stage 
of development.
Outlook
There	is	significant	momentum	across	the	business	as	we	
continue 	 to 	 grow 	 our 	 revenues 	 ahead 	 of 	 the 	 market 	 in 	 every	
region 	 we 	 serve. 	 The 	 investments 	 we 	 are 	 making 	 are 	 enabling	
Abcam 	 to 	 grow 	 and 	 achieve 	 the 	 stretching 	 targets 	 we 	 have	
set	for	ourselves	and	we	believe	the	Company	is	in	a	strong	
position for a successful future. Based on our clearly defined 
strategy,	together	with	our	history	of	results,	we	expect	our	
total	revenue	growth	for	FY	2018	to	be	similar	to	FY	2017’s	
total	growth	rate.
