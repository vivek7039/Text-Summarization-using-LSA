Introduction 
My first statement to shareholders as 
Executive Chairman reflects on two 
strong but contradictory themes. Firstly, 
the past year has been very challenging, 
both operationally and financially. 
Business performance has fallen short 
of expectations, we have outgrown some 
of our business processes and controls, 
and we have experienced significant 
changes to our Board.
Equally, and more importantly, it is 
already clear that the years ahead 
present significant upside opportunities. 
Strong value creation will result if we 
effectively implement our new strategy 
and successfully manage NCC Group 
through the transitional period in which 
we now find ourselves. Our business is 
not broken – indeed it has some notable 
strengths, both financial and operational. 
We still enjoy significant organic 
growth in our core markets and have 
a strong balance sheet. Furthermore, 
in a constantly evolving and complex 
market, our unique market leading skills 
and capabilities are keeping us at the 
forefront of thought leadership.  This is 
recognised by customers, who reward us 
with high levels of repeat business. If we 
improve our organisation and how we go 
to market, we will also see material value 
creation.
Business performance
The financial performance for the year 
was clearly disappointing, though in 
line with revised expectations. Despite 
delivering revenue growth of almost 
£35.4m (up 17 per cent), adjusted* EBIT 
went backwards to £27 .5m from £39.7m 
in the prior year. Operating profit fell 
from £1 1.4m in the prior year to a loss 
of £53.4m. This outcome reflected a 
number of historical weaknesses in our 
operating model.
Our business performance is shown in 
more detail in the Strategic Report on 
pages 16 to 57 .
Strategic review and 
strategic plan
Following the trading update on  
21 February 2017 , the Board 
commissioned a Strategic Review. The 
Review focused on three key areas. 
Firstly, to develop a better understanding 
of our marketplace, our competitors 
and our customers. Secondly, to assess 
the relative strengths and weaknesses 
of NCC Group in the market. Thirdly, to 
assess the  value created by the current 
portfolio of businesses. 
The Review confirmed that our markets 
remain attractive and, more importantly, 
that customers regard NCC Group as a 
very strong competitor in these markets 
with a strongly differentiated proposition. 
The strong cyber security theme (or 
“golden thread”) that runs through the 
Assurance Division represents a unique 
set of competencies and capabilities 
that we can leverage to deliver greater 
customer value in a highly complex and 
fragmented market. Our sector and 
application specific product offerings 
are leading edge and our solutions 
capabilities are highly valued and sought 
after.
The Review also confirmed the current 
financial logic of the relationship between 
Assurance and Escrow. Escrow itself is 
an attractive business and provides a 
stabilising influence on the Group.
*  This is a non-GAAP or Alternative Performance 
Measure (APM). Adjusted figures exclude the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, individually 
significant items, share-based charges, 
the unwinding of discount on deferred and 
contingent consideration, the results of the exited 
Domain Services business and any associated tax 
thereon.
NCC Group has a unique 
opportunity: we hold 
leading positions in 
growing markets around 
the world, our customers 
value us and our workforce 
is exceptionally skilled. 
However, we need to 
change how we organise 
ourselves and improve 
our internal business 
processes. Only by doing 
this will we be able to 
capture the significant 
value available to us

Finally, the Review identified two of the 
smaller Assurance businesses that sit 
outside the cyber golden thread whose 
future would be better served under 
alternative ownership. These businesses, 
Web Performance and Software Testing, 
will be disposed of in due course.
Subsequently, we initiated the 
development of a new three-phase 
Strategic Plan and revised Target 
Operating Model in order to underpin our 
“go to market” and delivery strategies. 
In the next 12 to 24 months, we intend 
to focus more of our efforts on internal 
self-help measures than has been the 
case historically.
This should ensure that we reverse 
the margin compression seen in both 
trading divisions and across most 
territories in the last two years. The 
Group will then benefit from further 
organic growth with foundations built 
on scalable products and business 
processes. These new foundations will 
also significantly enhance our ability to 
leverage acquisition related growth when 
the Group returns to being acquisitive. 
Acquisition activity, if any, is therefore 
likely to be limited during this period to 
smaller “bolt-ons”.
The results of the Strategic Review are 
set out further in the Strategic Report on 
pages 18 to 23.
Dividends
The Board has reviewed the business 
performance in the current year 
alongside our historical progressive 
dividend policy. While mindful of the 
need for investment over the next few 
years, the Board is confident in our 
prospects and hence recommends that 
the dividend is maintained at the current 
level.
A final dividend of 3.15p is therefore 
being recommended by the Board, 
making a total for the year of 4.65p, 
equal to the prior year. If approved, the 
final dividend in respect of the year 
ended 31 May 2017 will be paid on  
29 September 2017 to shareholders 
on the register as at 1 September 2017 
with an ex-dividend date of 31 August 
2017.
As a matter of note, an administrative 
non-compliance issue has been 
identified with respect to distributable 
reserves and the payment of historical 
dividends. At all times the Group had 
adequate returns within subsidiary 
companies to meet these dividends. We 
expect to remedy the position by means 
of shareholder resolutions at the AGM in 
September. 
Governance
During the year, the Board has 
undertaken a major review of some of 
the Group’s governance structures. In 
part, this was prompted by a combination 
of shareholder and employee feedback. 
In addition, there was also the realisation 
that rapid growth in recent years had 
taken the Group beyond the design 
limits of the previous operating model.
The Board remains committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. 
We are working actively to enhance 
governance as well as our business 
processes and internal controls to match 
our ambitions for the Group’s future. The 
results of the Governance Review are 
set out in the Governance Report on 
pages 59 to 60.
Board composition
There have been a number of changes 
to the Board during the year. I joined 
the Board on 6 April 2017 as a Non-
Executive Director, becoming Executive 
Chairman in April when Paul Mitchell 
stood down as Chairman. 
Last year we noted our intention to 
strengthen the team further with an 
additional independent Non-Executive 
Director. As a result, Jonathan Brooks 
joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director on 13 March 2017 . Jonathan 
brings significant valuable experience of 
the technology sector.

Executive 
Chairman’s 
statement
Brian Tenner was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer on 1 February 2017 
following a search process prompted by 
the resignation of Atul Patel on  
10 August 2016. He became Interim 
CEO on 1 March 2017 , following the 
decision of Rob Cotton to step down  
as CEO. 
The current model of an Executive 
Chairman working closely with Brian 
as Interim CEO and CFO has been 
a necessary and effective bridge to 
deliver the Strategic Review and also 
maintain stability in the management 
of the business. Recognising that this 
is not a sustainable long-term solution, 
the Board has commenced a process 
to identify a permanent CEO using a 
firm of independent executive search 
consultants.
Board effectiveness
As Executive Chairman, I am responsible 
for the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects 
of its performance. During the year, the 
Board has reviewed its performance and 
effectiveness in accordance with the 
requirements of the Code. We note that 
the recent and significant changes in 
membership and new strategic direction 
represent a transition period for the 
Board as well as the Group. 
The Board will work to enhance 
oversight of the Group’s strategic 
development, monitoring the delivery 
of its business objectives and the 
development of the new Target 
Operating Model. We will also work  
hard to ensure that we maintain 
an effective, corporate governance 
framework that keeps pace with the rate 
of growth and change inside and outside 
of NCC Group.
Employees
Our staff are the foundation for most 
of the value inherent in NCC Group. In 
developing and implementing our new 
Strategic Plan and Target Operating 
Model we will work to ensure that we 
create a working environment that 
values the individual and allows each one 
of us to contribute to our full potential. 
This will include creating organisational 
values and clearer structures, roles and 
responsibilities. The coming financial 
year will also see a greater focus on 
personal development and training.
I would like to record my own and 
the Board’s sincere thanks to all of 
the Group’s employees, who have 
maintained their focus on delivering 
excellent service to our customers. 
This has been achieved against a 
backdrop of uncertainty caused by 
the Group’s volatile financial and 
share price performance, particularly 
in the latter quarters of the year. Our 
business is entirely reliant on the skills 
and experience of our staff. We are 
fortunate to have them choose to build 
their careers with NCC Group, and I look 
forward to working with all of them as 
we take our business forward.

Current trading and outlook 
All businesses go through transitional 
phases as they grow and mature. NCC 
Group is no exception. Where we are 
different, and at a significant advantage 
to many, is that change has not been 
forced upon us by mounting losses, a 
stretched balance sheet, technological 
obsolescence or a sudden shrinkage 
in our markets. We are operating in a 
rapidly growing international market in 
which our core skills and competencies 
will allow us to lead rather than follow. 
Our challenge is to manage the 
transition from one business model 
to another, as the growth in scale and 
complexity has made our early stage 
model ineffective.  We now need to 
create structures and products that 
allow us to benefit from our scale and 
deliver additional value for our customers 
while never losing sight of our core 
competencies and strengths, most 
notably represented in our staff, their 
energy and their commitment.
So while there is a lot of work to do to 
implement new processes, systems and 
structures, the outlook for NCC Group 
remains very positive. In fast growing 
international markets with a range of 
innovative products and services, the 
challenge is to execute effectively 
the planned changes in strategy and 
operating model. The Board is confident 
that the Group can deliver sustainable 
earnings growth and enhanced 
shareholder value once it has  more 
robust foundations in place. We are not 
only “securing tomorrow, today” for our 
customers, but for all of our long-term 
stakeholders.
In terms of trading for the current 
financial year, the Board expects 
Escrow to return to low single digit 
revenue growth and see some margin 
improvement. The Assurance business is 
expected to see high single-digit organic 
revenue growth as we build from the 
low point of the second half of last year. 
Assurance gross margins will improve as 
we implement our new operating model 
over the course of the new financial year. 
Set against these gains in gross profit 
are some cost headwinds arising from 
higher overheads linked to property 
costs and the amortisation and 
depreciation of capital spend in 2017 . 
Finally, the disposal of the Web and 
Software Testing businesses will reduce 
EBIT on a pro rata basis by £2.7m based 
on 2017 results. Overall, the Group’s 
expectations for adjusted EBIT in 2018 
are unchanged.
