 KEY AREAS OF FOCUS 
With the commissioning of our inaugural project 
in Plymouth in November 2016, I am delighted 
to report that we generated a maiden profit at 
the half year and a trading profit at the year end, 
before write offs with regard to irrecoverable 
disbursements for sites that are not going ahead 
for various reasons. Such reasons include planning 
permission not being achieved, overly expensive 
or impractical connections for a variety of reasons 
such as location expense or likely construction 
difficulties. Nevertheless, at the time of writing we 
now have all nine sites with Rockpool in various 
stages of development; one of which is operating, 
a further five are currently being built and should 
be operating by the New Year, with the balance to 
be built out in 2018. Our primary operational focus 
has therefore been on the continued execution and 
delivery of the nine sites equity funded by Rockpool 
Investments LLP of which we have a 44.5% interest 
in each. 
As a complement to our green diesel projects, the 
group is now diversifying into gas fuelled power 
generation and battery powered energy storage 
projects, which may also be used in conjunction 
with SolarFlex and gas-powered generation sites. 
The management team has been working to 
develop and progress a pipeline of gas powered 
sites in which we intend to hold majority stakes 
of typically 80% but may also be joint ventures. 
We retain complete flexibility in financing projects 
going forward but aim to ensure that all future 
gas sites operated via new companies, typically 
holding 20MW each as before, are able to be 
consolidated in our accounts. With this in mind, we 
recently launched a £50 million bond advised by 
Bedford Row Capital, to be listed in Frankfurt, that 
is about to be marketed to investors. The bond is 
to fund the ‘equity’ portion of each site; each site 
has a typical capacity of 20MW, is held in a special 
purpose vehicle, and will normally have 20-40% 
of equity, with the balance funded with asset or 
project finance. 
MARKET CONTEXT
There has been some uncertainty in the market 
on account of regulatory reviews from DEFRA 
and Ofgem (read more in the Market Overview on 
pages 12 and 13). 
In light of these reviews and the proposed phasing 
out of Triad payments over the next three years, 
we have remodelled the existing businesses and 
future gas operated sites. We are still able to 
achieve a reasonable IRR for FlexGen projects 
and a very good IRR (well in excess of 20%) for all 
gas projects, which will likely operate for a longer 
number of hours per annum.
The underlying drivers of overall supply and demand 
for power have not changed, however, and we 
believe that the markets for STOR and FFR, for 
example, will firm over the coming years. The power 
supply mix to the National Grid will also mean that 
there will be many opportunities to trade electrons in 
future, due to the peaks and troughs in the market. 
Over winter 2016/17, Attune Energy Ltd (our site 
in Plymouth) could have earned c.£1.5-£1.8m by 
taking advantage of market prices when these 
spiked. Because of commitments to FFR, Triad 
and STOR, we have not always been able to take 
advantage of such fluctuations, but expect to be in 
a better position to do so with gas powered sites. 
Attune Energy operated very successfully during last 
winter with an above budget operating profit.
Chairman’s Statement
In a year that saw our first site become operational, I am pleased 
to report our maiden trading profits

STRATEGY
In addition to our planned focus on installing gas 
engine capacity and the bond to finance this, 
we are looking at the use of power storage, i.e. 
batteries or capacitor technologies, in conjunction 
with our gas sites, which will open up FFR markets 
and other fast response tariffs to gas. Our strategy 
with respect to the green diesel sites is – alongside 
Rockpool – to either sell these after the end of the 
EIS qualification period or to make an offer for the 
55.5% we do not already own. Our relationship 
with a leading Big Six multinational utility company 
to fund up to 20% of any 20MW renewable fuel or 
gas powered flexible energy projects going forward 
fits ideally with the Company’s strategy to deliver 
projects in which it holds an 80% interest, and this 
relationship is envisaged to provide sufficient equity 
to allow PPG to develop majority owned assets 
while maintaining its policy of limiting dilution to 
shareholders as far as possible. It also gives us 
additional flexibility in funding our various project 
types going forward including Gas, SolarFlex and 
Battery Power Storage. 
DIVIDEND
We do not propose to pay a dividend as we plan 
to reinvest all internally generated funds for the 
foreseeable future.
OUTLOOK 
At the end of a busy and productive year, I wish 
to thank the staff and Directors for their valued 
contributions, as well as our partners and advisors, 
who provide invaluable support in developing our 
operations. In February 2017, we appointed Cantor 
Fitzgerald Europe as Nominated Advisor and Broker 
to the Company with whom we also look forward to 
a long and fruitful relationship. 
We have a robust pipeline, with 240MW in the active 
pipeline (building, planned and expected planning) 
and a total pipeline of all types of generation and 
storage of around 700MW. In light of the foregoing, 
we view the year ahead with confidence, and look 
forward to securing planning permission on our 
pipeline of gas and battery sites and building out 
that portfolio over the coming years.
