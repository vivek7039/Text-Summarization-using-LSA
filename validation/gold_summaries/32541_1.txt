16 Landsec Annual Report 2017
Landsec is in a great position. We have a 
portfolio of first-class assets combined with 
historically low levels of operational and  
financial gearing at a time of geopolitical  
and economic uncertainty. 
We’ve largely completed and let our 
speculative development programme. Despite 
being net sellers in the previous year, revenue 
profit is up 5.5% to £382m and adjusted diluted 
earnings per share are up 5.7% to 48.3p. Our 
adjusted diluted net asset value per share is 
down marginally to 1,417p. Our Combined 
Portfolio is valued at £14.4bn and, with adjusted 
net debt broadly unchanged over the year 
at £3.3bn, our loan-to-value is 22.2%. We’ve 
reduced our cost of debt and have access to the 
funds needed to buy when opportunities appear. 
Despite uncertainty in the outside world, we 
remain confident of our core strengths inside 
the Company and we’re recommending a final 
dividend of 11.7p – raising the dividend for the 
year by 10.1%.
Market environment
Put simply, our markets remain in good health 
but they’ve paused for breath.
In the London office market, we expected 
the occupational balance to shift from demand 
to supply during the course of 2017. The Brexit 
vote brought that inflexion point forward. In last 
year’s report, I said a vote to leave the EU would 
create business uncertainty, leading to lower 
occupational demand, falling rental values and 
a reduction in construction commitments. This 
is happening, though less than we expected. 
Overall, the UK economy continued to perform 
well during the year.
In the retail market, the effect of the 
referendum was less clear-cut although, faced 
with pressure on disposable income, shoppers 
have started to show more caution. Retailers 
were a little slower to take up new space during 
the year but we continued to see opportunities 
to meet the ever-evolving needs of the most 
successful brands.
We won’t be sure of the long-term 
effect of Brexit on our markets for some time. 
Negotiations with the EU can only begin in 
earnest after the general election. Although 
the business community remains in uncharted 
territory, that doesn’t mean we should wait 
for change to happen to us. We’re taking 
this time to prepare the business for the 
opportunities and challenges we see ahead.
We hope the new government can give 
businesses as much certainty as possible on 
areas including tax, regulation, access to skilled 
labour and public spending such as investment 
in infrastructure – including desperately needed 
homes. A clear and ambitious strategy for 
improving digital connectivity would have 
a particularly powerful impact.

Strategic Report
First class portfolio 
The foundations of the business are rock solid, 
underpinned by our resilient portfolio and low 
leverage. 
In London, our modern, well-located assets 
are well let, with a weighted average unexpired 
lease term on offices of 10.3 years. Having 
already scaled back speculative development 
activity before the year started, the last 
12 months saw us put the finishing touches 
on over 1 million sq ft of space, including high-
profile developments at 1 New Street Square, 
EC4; 20 Eastbourne Terrace, W2; and Nova, 
Victoria, SW1, which completed shortly after 
the year end. Of the 3.1 million sq ft programme 
we started in 2010, we have let or sold all but 
283,000 sq ft.
Our Retail Portfolio is a collection of vibrant 
destinations that attract dynamic brands and 
are well-matched to consumer trends. During 
the year, we built and let a leisure extension 
at White Rose, Leeds. Our newest destination, 
Westgate Oxford, is on schedule to open in 
October and is 80% spoken for. Since the year 
end, we’ve acquired a portfolio of three outlet 
centres, establishing our position as the leading 
owner-manager of outlets in the UK.
Strong relationships
Throughout the year, we pursued our vision of 
being the best property company in the UK 
in the eyes of our customers, communities, 
partners and employees. Ultimately, their 
experience drives our performance. We’re 
responsible for ensuring that Landsec can 
thrive for many years to come. That’s why we 
set ourselves even higher expectations this year 
on issues we share with our customers and 
communities, such as local employment and 
place-making. We’ve also improved the way  
we address our climate impacts and risks.
Great people
In January, we completed the move into new 
headquarters at 100 Victoria Street, SW1. This 
is one of our buildings and it expresses the 
best of who we are and what we do. We’re on 
one floor of open-plan workspace supported 
by innovative technology. Thought has gone 
into everything from the way we collaborate 
to how we minimise energy and waste. It’s the 
UK’s highest rated office fit-out according to 
sustainability assessment scheme BREEAM.

We go forward

when the time is right.”
Evolving market conditions require role changes 
in our teams as our emphasis shifts from selling 
and development to management and buying. 
Our people relish these challenges. We are 
also enriching our culture, recruiting more 
from outside our industry so we gain fresh 
perspectives and new capabilities. During the 
year, we introduced stretching targets on gender 
and ethnic diversity and fairness.
Outlook
We’ve achieved our plan to have minimal 
development exposure and longer lease terms 
in London offices, a transformed Retail Portfolio 
and low gearing at this point. Over the next 
12 months, we’re unlikely to see rental values 
grow in London unless we have more certainty 
on movement of people and the UK’s terms 
of trade with the EU and the rest of the world. 
In the retail sector, the extent to which higher 
supply chain costs are passed on to customers 
remains to be seen. Whatever the outcome, 
higher costs tend to reduce take up of space.
In the short term, with significantly reduced 
risk and a portfolio of first-class assets, we 
go forward in excellent shape, ready to make 
acquisitions when the time is right. Longer-
term, we remain confident in our market and 
our ability to deliver sustainable growth. We’ll 
continue to address the trends that shape 
our business in coming years. For example, 
the combination of an ageing population and 
technological progress will have a huge effect 
on the way we live, work, shop, play, travel and 
are cared for. In turn, this will affect the way we 
design, construct and manage buildings, and 
how we attract the best talent.
The importance of thinking ahead and 
acting early was brought home to me by our 
completion of Nova in April. Design on this 
project started in 2003, when the iPhone was 
still an idea in Steve Jobs’ head. We must 
continue to anticipate change so that we  
can keep providing the right space for our  
customers and communities whatever their 
future demands – helping businesses and  
people to thrive.
