 OVERVIEW
I am delighted to present the Polypipe 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts 
following another excellent year for the 
Group. Despite the continued economic 
and political uncertainty that has prevailed 
since the EU Referendum and a mixed UK 
construction market performance, our end 
markets continue to perform well, with the 
Group growing UK revenue significantly 
ahead of the UK construction market. As 
well as managing this growth, the Group 
has also seen a number of key leadership 
changes during the year, including the 
retirement of David Hall in October 2017 
following 12 years as CEO, and the 
promotion of Martin Payne from CFO to 
CEO following David’s retirement. Glen 
Sabin was promoted to the role of Chief 
Operating Officer and appointed to the 
Board in October 2017, and the Company 
Secretarial function was also brought in-
house following the appointment of Emma 
Versluys as Company Secretary. Paul James 
joined the Company and Board as Chief 
Financial Officer on 5 March 2018, and I 
believe that the executive management 
team is now at full complement following 
this period of change and well placed to 
drive the Group’s strategy forwards.
In this regard, the Group announced on 
31 January 2018 that it had entered into 
advanced negotiations to dispose of its 
French subsidiary following a review of 
the strategic overlap between the UK and 
French business. Given the French business 
operates in lower margin product areas, 
it was agreed to dispose of the business. 
Completion is expected in the first half of 
2018 and, once completed, will allow the 
Group to focus on its higher margin  
product areas. 
RESULTS
Performance throughout 2017 has been 
very strong, with a 6.3% increase in 
revenue to £411.7m and a 6.0% increase 
in underlying operating profit at £72.6m. 
UK revenue growth of 8.1% was ahead 
of the market, primarily as a result of 
strong growth in the UK residential sector 
driven by new housebuilds. Underlying 
operating margin was robust at 17.6%, 
despite continued input cost inflation, 
and underlying diluted earnings per share 
increased by 10.1% to 27.2p per share. 
Net debt continued to reduce to 1.6 times 
EBITDA compared with 1.9 times for the 
prior year. 
DIVIDEND
We have again maintained our dividend 
policy and I am pleased to report that the 
Board recommends a final dividend of 7.5 
pence per share, giving a full year dividend 
of 11.1 pence per share for the year ended 
31 December 2017, a 9.9% increase on the 
prior year. 
STRATEGY
During 2017, the key objectives of the 
Board included:
 { Investigating and prioritising selected 
development and acquisition 
opportunities, while the Group 
continued to reduce leverage. 
 { Targeting investment to support the 
continued growth of our key businesses.
 { Investigation and development of new 
export markets.
Good progress was made against these 
objectives during 2017.
In addition to our ongoing initiatives, in 2018 
our attention will be focused upon:
 { Continuing to develop our core 
manufacturing capabilities by investing 
in further new capacity and automation 
to help grow both revenues and profit 
organically.
 { Continued progression of the Group’s 
M&A agenda.
PEOPLE
The exceptional effort and ongoing 
commitment of our employees continues 
to be a key driver of the Company’s strong 
performance. In 2017, the Board and I 
spent time visiting our sites both in the UK 
and France, and continue to be impressed 
by the knowledge, enthusiasm and 
commitment of our employees across the 
Group. Effective and efficient management 
of our key facilities is critical to the Group’s 
ongoing success, and strong leadership 
in each business unit by experienced and 
dedicated management teams is a key 
differentiator.
In November 2017, the first Save As You 
Earn (SAYE) options granted in 2014 
matured, and employees across the Group 
were able to benefit from their hard work 
in driving the Group’s growth over the last 
three years and have the option of becoming 
shareholders in the Company. The Company 
issued invitations to join a third SAYE scheme 
during the year, resulting in 600 (24%) of 
eligible employees choosing to participate. 
Across the Group, we now have 30.7% of all 
employees currently contributing to one or 
more schemes.
David Hall retired in October 2017 having 
been CEO during the Company’s prior 
ownership and through its transformation 
into a public company. I would like to 
record both the Board’s and my own 
personal thanks to David for his enormous 
contribution to making Polypipe the 
successful Group that it is today, and wish 
him well in his retirement. Martin Payne 
was appointed as Group CEO following 
David’s retirement and both I and my 
Board colleagues have been impressed 
and encouraged by the significant impact 
he has made since his appointment while 
continuing to have responsibility for the 
CFO function in the period before Paul 
James joined us. The Board changes have 
been well received within the Group as 
well as with advisers and shareholders, 
and the motivation and enthusiasm of our 
employees has been unaffected throughout 
this period of change. The Board and I look 
forward to the next chapter in the Group’s 
growth story under the stewardship of the 
new executive management team. 
SUMMARY
Once again, the Group has made significant 
progress during 2017. The strong 
performance in the year is testament to the 
strength of the growth drivers on which the 
Group’s strategy is based, namely legacy 
material substitution, tailwinds from both 
water management and carbon reduction 
legislation, and development of selective 
export markets. With a continued focus 
on investment into engineered solutions 
to meet those needs, an experienced 
and dedicated senior management team, 
committed workforce, and a clear strategy, 
I am confident that the Group will continue 
to thrive during 2018.
