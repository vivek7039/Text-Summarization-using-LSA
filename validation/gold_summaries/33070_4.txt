Notes:
1 Under UK GAAP , dividends declared are those declared in respect of the year for which selected financial data is presented. Under US GAAP , dividends declared are those formally declared within each
calendar twelve-month period. Dividends declared for 2000-2002 include UK tax credits. Dividends declared for 2003 and 2004 exclude UK tax credits. Amounts receivable could be higher for 
US shareholders who have elected to retain the benefits of the old US/UK tax treaty. For further information relating to dividends and the UK taxation of dividends see pages 85-86.
2 Dividends expressed in US$ have been converted at the actual exchange rates used in the payment of dividends to US shareholders, except that the final dividend declared in respect of 2004, 
payable to US ADS holders on 5 May 2005, has been converted at the Noon Buying Rate on 4 March 2005 for convenience.
3 Restated following the adoption of UITF17 and UITF38, and the reclassification of transaction-related regulatory fees following recently issued SEC guidance (see ‘Accounting Basis’ on page 72).
4 The Group has restated its 2003 and 2002 US GAAP financial information to give effect to differences between UK and US GAAP concerning foreign exchange gains on cross currency interest rate swaps
and the capitalisation of certain costs related to internal use software. For further explanation see ‘Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), on 
page 74. The impact of the restatement on the US GAAP financial information in 2001 and 2000 was to increase net income by £1million and £3 million respectively, and to increase shareholders’ equity
by £6 million and £3 million respectively.
