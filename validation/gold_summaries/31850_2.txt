SWANCOTE FOODS  
VOLUMES IMPROVED
+28.9%
A broader product portfolio and expanded 
customer base have helped increase  
sales volumes in Swancote Foods during 
the year. An ongoing programme of 
investment will increase the operationally 
efficiencies further during the year ahead.
SEED VOLUMES INCREASE
+6.9%
An increase in volumes in the fresh  
packing business has led to an increase  
in the volumes of seed sold. The ongoing 
varietal development programme supports 
this by bringing new, improved varieties  
to market.
INCREASE IN SALES OF  
JERSEY ROYALS
+11.6%
A combination of favourable growing 
conditions in Jersey, followed by good UK 
weather in the Spring and early summer 
resulted in an increase in sales volumes  
of Jersey Royals.
