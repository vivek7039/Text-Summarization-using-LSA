Corero revenue for the year ended 31 
December 2017 was $8.5 million (2016: 
$8.8 million) with SmartWall revenue up 
43% over the prior year whilst legacy 
product revenues declined as expected. 
Smartwall recurring revenue increased 
to $3.4 million (2016: $1.5 million). The 
EBITDA loss reduced to $5.1 million  
(2016: EBITDA loss $6.4 million). 
Revenue and the EBITDA loss for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 was impacted 
by delays in world-wide implementation 
schedules for a large digital enterprise 
customer win in Q3 2017 and an existing 
customer’s ongoing deployment (with 
the majority of the revenue from these 
two customers now expected in the first 
half of 2018).
Market dynamics
Cyber-security risks are growing, both in 
their prevalence and in their disruptive 
potential. Another growing trend is the 
use of cyber-attacks to target critical 
infrastructure and strategic industrial 
sectors, raising fears that attackers 
could trigger a breakdown in systems 
that are essential to modern society. The 
World Economic Forum Global Risks 
Landscape for 2018 ranks cyber-attacks 
as the third most likely risk in its top 10 
risk analysis, behind extreme weather 
events and natural disasters.
The head of the National Cyber Security 
Centre (“NCSC”), Ciaran Martin, recently 
commented that while the UK is fortunate 
to have avoided a so-called category one 
cyber-attack so far, it is only a matter of 
time before a catastrophic cyber-attack is 
launched on its critical infrastructure or 
election setup.
A recent report from Neustar revealed 
that many businesses viewed unsecured 
Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices as a 
major concern. This is hardly surprising, 
given the recent developments in IoT 
botnets and the huge potential for 
unsecured IoT devices to be turned into  
a botnet army and used by hackers to 
launch DDoS attacks.
IoT devices still suffer from basic 
security vulnerabilities and it is 
precisely this lack of security that 
makes them so attractive to hackers. 
But it’s not just a password problem 
anymore. Attackers understand that 
manufacturers and users are waking 
up to the problem of passwords on IoT 
devices, and so are seeking more 
complex ways to access them. As this 
trend continues, and hackers become 
increasingly inventive when searching 
for new devices and ways to enlist 
them, there is really no limit to the size 
and scale of future DDoS attacks 
driven by IoT botnets. Any device that 
has an Internet connection and a 
processor can be exploited. In an ideal 
world, all devices should be forced to 
go through some sort of network 
configuration before being used, 
rather than being exploitable from a 
default position.
Businesses and government 
departments can protect their networks 
from DDoS attacks fuelled by IoT-driven 
botnets by deploying a real-time, 
automated solution at the network edge, 
which can instantaneously detect and 
mitigate DDoS activity, thereby 
eliminating threats from entering a 
network. As with all DDoS threats, clear 
visibility is a crucial step in detecting and 
defending against attacks. The Corero 
SmartWall solution is this real-time 
automated solution providing rich 
actionable analytics.
As organisations develop their 
businesses to harness the benefits and 
power of technology, we are seeing 
companies reassess their security 
architecture, including DDoS protection, 
as traditional approaches will not be 
sufficient to protect enterprises.
Government regulations
Corero welcomes the investment and 
attention that governments are 
committing to the cyber-security of 
Critical National Infrastructure (“CNI”), 
particularly recent guidance from the US 
Government which sets out detailed 
recommendations on how to boost 
resilience and ensure suitable 
protections and mitigation systems are 
deployed. Corero recently submitted a 
response to the Joint Committee on the 
National Security Strategy’s inquiry 
‘Cyber Security: UK National Security in a 
Digital World’ and recommended the 
following actions are taken:
Chief Executive’s strategic update
Corero is well positioned to deliver on its goal  
of being the leading player in the real-time 
DDoS mitigation market with SmartWall 
solution validation from over 90 customers. 
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 06 Operating performance against strategy
Our performance against our 2017 strategic objectives is summarised below:
• Establish SmartWall as the leading solution for real-time DDoS mitigation:  
Continued progress in growing our customer base to 90 customers and the 
addition of a number of high profile customers including Corero’s first US 
federal government customer, two one million dollar customers, first 
Australian customer and first potentially significant revenue share contract 
with a Tier 1 service provider. 
• Improve Smartwall DDoS defence technology:  
SmartWall software releases in 2017 have added new attack defence and 
improved forensics and analytics capabilities.
• New products to address the evolving requirements of the target market:  
Corero further enhanced its market leading SmartWall product portfolio in 
2017 with the deliverables from a two-year development program with a new 
SmartWall 100Gbps capable product to capture growth in customer demand 
for 100Gbps connectivity and SmartWall virtual software appliance to capture 
demand for hybrid on-premises / Cloud DDoS mitigation deployments. Corero 
announced the first sales of the 100Gbps product (totalling $0.4 million) in 
early January 2018.
• Target market focus:  
Customer wins in 2017 have continued to validate the target market for 
real-time, automatic DDoS mitigation solutions; namely service providers, 
cloud providers and digital enterprises.
• Expand routes to market:  
Corero’s strategy is to work with leading IT and network technology vendors to 
make DDoS mitigation an integral component of any well-engineered Internet 
facing network design thereby increasing our go-to-market opportunities. In 
2017, Corero signed agreements with major global technology companies 
including Juniper Networks, Gigamon, and McAfee. The technology alliance 
partnership with Juniper Networks, a US based multinational corporation that 
develops and markets networking and security products, has provided benefits 
in 2017 with the opportunity for Corero to expand its market reach by 
leveraging Juniper Networks’ global footprint.
• Develop sales models to attract new target customers:  
The DDoS protection as-a-service model launched in late 2016 has gained 
traction in 2017 with 16 customers by the year end. In addition, the Service 
Portal, a turnkey solution for service provider customers to manage the 
delivery of DDoS mitigation services to their customers, has been an 
important competitive differentiator.
• DDoS attacks on CNI, particularly 
frequent low-volume and short 
duration attacks, must be a priority 
area for Government;
• Government must take advantage of 
opportunities, such as that provided by 
the implementation of the NIS 
Directive, to fulfil its ambition of 
becoming ‘the safest place in the  
world to live and work online’;
• The implementation of the Directive 
on Security of Network and 
Information Systems (“NIS Directive”) 
should not be treated as a tick box 
exercise but instead should be grasped 
as an opportunity for the UK to lead 
the world in the strength of its 
cyber-security regulatory framework;
• Government should look at 
international best practice and adopt a 
more attack-specific and specialist-led 
approach towards cyber-security, 
moving away from generic wide-
ranging statements;
• Government must set out and 
rigorously enforce detailed cyber-
security requirements for operators  
of critical national infrastructure; and
• Government should clarify 
Departmental cyber-security 
responsibilities and allocate further 
resource to the NCSC.
“We were driven to seek out a DDoS mitigation solution due to the increasing 
severity and frequency of DDoS attacks against our hosted client base.  
DDoS attacks can create service interruptions for customers and create 
unpredictable work efforts for the engineers tasked with resolving them.”

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory Fund raise
On 5 April 2018, Corero will announce a 
conditional placing and subscription to 
raise £4.0 million ($5.2 million) (“Equity 
Fund Raise”). In addition, Corero is in 
advanced discussions with a UK bank to 
provide a term loan of £3.0 million ($4.2 
million) (“Bank Loan”), contingent on the 
Equity Fund Raise. The Bank Loan is 
expected to be finalised and drawn 
down following the completion of the 
Equity Fund Raise.
Outlook
Corero enters 2018 with the 
foundations in place for continued 
acceleration of SmartWall revenue 
growth as a result of:
• strong market demand from the 
growing awareness of the threat and 
impact of DDoS attacks, and increased 
risk associated with the projected 
growth of IoT deployments;
• pending regulations in the US, UK and 
Europe, including the NIS Directive 
which comes into force for all EU 
member states on the 9th May 2018, 
are expected to positively impact 
demand for DDoS mitigation 
investment in 2018 particularly by 
Digital Enterprises (including critical 
national infrastructure providers);
• Corero go-to-market partner 
recruitment and enablement efforts 
with partners is expected to 
contribute to revenue in 2018; and
• investment in channel sales 
development to grow Corero’s routes 
to market in 2018.
This gives us confidence Corero will 
deliver revenue growth in 2018.
Ashley Stephenson 
Chief Executive Officer 
4 April 2018
“Corero enters 2018 with confidence following a year of strong growth in SmartWall revenue 
with proof points of multiple $1.0 million plus customers, a growing catalogue of industry 
awards and several disruptive contract wins against competitors. In addition, Corero also 
expanded its ecosystem of world class partners and introduced an enhanced product 
portfolio. We are excited about the prospects for the future of the business.”

IoT Botnets should be a grave concern
Despite its advantages, the Internet of Things comes with a host of security 
challenges. IoT devices are usually poorly managed, patched and secured. They 
are thus prime targets for hacker infiltration and takeover, aside from the 
personal privacy and security concerns that result from these security gaps.
The big danger is that these connected devices 
can be harnessed by hackers for a variety of 
nefarious purposes; in many cases hackers 
use them to form a botnet to carry out 
DDoS attacks.
