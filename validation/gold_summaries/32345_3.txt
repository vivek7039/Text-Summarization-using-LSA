 Chairman’s review
Aligning our business and  
supporting our people
our business to both internal and 
external stakeholders and provides 
a clear roadmap of growth for our 
leadership team.
The realignment also means some new 
members of the Executive Committee. 
The elevation of Cavendish Nuclear as 
a separate reporting sector means that 
Simon Bowen, CEO Cavendish Nuclear, 
joins the Committee, as does Jon Hall, 
Managing Director, Technology, reflecting 
our commitment to drive technology 
across the Group. Also, Kate Hill joined the 
Committee in April as Group Director of 
Investor Relations and Communications. 
I am pleased to have their expertise 
on the Committee and look forward 
to their contributions.
Our people
In the coming year, we will continue 
to strengthen our succession planning 
activities, placing emphasis on promoting 
diversity within our leadership teams. 
These efforts will become more important 
as we continue to build our international 
We remain confident in the long‑term 
future of our business and the Board is 
therefore pleased to recommend a 9.6% 
increase in the final dividend for 2017 to 
21.65 pence per share (2016: 19.75 
pence per share). This will give a total 
dividend for the year of 28.15 pence per 
share (2016: 25.8 pence per share), an 
increase of 9.1%.
Governance and the Board
This has been a year of smooth but 
important transition for Babcock. In 
September, Archie Bethel took over 
as Chief Executive, following Peter 
Rogers’ highly successful tenure in the 
post. Archie’s early priority has been 
to ensure the business is set up for 
continued growth, and to this end he 
has already begun making improvements 
to the business. The realignment of our 
divisional structure into four industry 
sectors enables us to focus on our core 
capabilities – those areas in which we 
have deep and rare expertise and which 
have the greatest scalability. It also 
allows us to more clearly communicate 
presence, which is a focus for us over the 
next several years. To achieve the level of 
international growth we are aspiring to, 
we will need leadership which reflects 
our businesses and the environments 
in which they operate. This means a 
continued focus on recruiting, developing 
and retaining top local talent from all 
demographics and across all genders 
and ethnicities.
We will also continue to focus on 
supporting young people studying 
STEM subjects and, through our 
graduate development programmes, 
apprenticeship training and CPD, 
we aim to ensure that those already 
working in our businesses feel supported, 
appreciated, encouraged and keen 
to help us achieve our goals. Once 
again, diversity is a key component 
of our success, and we will make a 
concentrated effort to be inclusive and 
open in our approach to recruitment 
and development. As ever, I am grateful 
to the entire team at Babcock, at 
every level, and am as keen to support 
them as they have been to support the 
business. I am very sad to say that one of 
our colleagues in South Africa lost his life 
after falling from a power transmission 
line and, in January 2017, an emergency 
rescue helicopter crashed in Italy resulting 
in the loss of six people on board. Our 
thoughts are with their families and 
friends; we are committed to learning 
any lessons which come from the 
investigations into the tragedies.
Looking forward
The strength of our order book continues 
to provide clear visibility of future 
revenues and, together with the bidding 
pipeline, offers further prospects for 
growth. The Board therefore remains 
confident in the underlying performance 
of the Group and expects to achieve 
good progress this year and beyond.
Mike Turner CBE, Chairman
This year the Group has continued to deliver, 
demonstrating the quality of our operations 
and the resilience of our business.

Those who have been in the Company for 
many years, or plan on joining today, can 
use the being babcock principles as a 
guide to determine what’s appropriate 
behaviour within our Company. If we all 
adopt these principles each day in our 
interactions with colleagues, customers 
and others then more people will 
experience Babcock at its best, 
more often.
In this way we can ensure that everyone 
who comes into contact with Babcock 
International has a consistent and positive 
experience, helping to grow our business 
and reinforcing the reputation that we 
are ‘trusted to deliver’.

Our culture
In an engineering services business such as Babcock International, it’s the people who really make a 
difference to how the company is perceived, both internally and externally. As individuals, we all make 
a difference to our colleagues, our customers and others who we interact with on a daily basis. If we’re 
to remain a leading engineering services company that people are proud to work for and customers 
choose to work with, then each of us must embody the eight principles set out below, day in, day out.
being babcock
8 simple principles that define 
our behaviours and actions

based on trust
This means we will:
• Be easy to do business with
• Support each other as we work 
towards a common goal
• Tell it as it is
Never compromise on health 
and safety
This means we will:
• Ensure everyone goes home safe 
every day
• Challenge unsafe behaviour
• Update and improve our 
practices, constantly
Respect people and value 
their diversity
This means we will:
• Treat everyone with courtesy 
and thoughtfulness

• Listen to others’ points of view
Trust our people to deliver

the job

everyone can excel

each other

The eight principles that make up being 
babcock aren’t new. In fact, they may 
seem rather obvious. That’s because 
they already live and breathe within our 
business. They’re what we do when we’re 
working at our best and they’ve been a 
key contributor to our successful growth 
over recent years. They’ve been gathered 
from the views of employees across the 
businesses, who were asked to consider 
the essence, or DNA, of Babcock at 
its best.
being babcock pulls together these views 
into a set of principles which explain what 
our Company stands for and what it 
expects from each of us. Whilst what we 
deliver for our customers is very diverse, 
we’re all united by a common purpose 
which spans the range of services we 
provide. The services we deliver help to 
keep nations at the top of their game.
Whether we’re delivering critical 
through‑life support for armed forces, 
operating aviation emergency services 
worldwide, training the next generation 
of engineers, pilots and firefighters or 
keeping critical fleets on the move, 
together we ensure the smooth running 
of many of the critical engineering 
services on which nations depend.
