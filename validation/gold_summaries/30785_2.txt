Housing
At a glance
We focus on long-term  
outcomes and positive social,  
economic and environmental  
impact, across our two divisions.
We carry out 6,000 repairs  
a day in Homes across the UK.
The Housing division made excellent progress in 2017
Our broader service offering, incorporating our new homes capability 
alongside housing management and maintenance, supports our involvement 
in new emerging placemaking partnerships, where our involvement extends 
beyond traditional outsourcing and is focused on creating more 
sustainable communities.
We have broadened the services we offer across the sphere of affordable 
housing. In particular , our acquisition of Omega in 2014 has unlocked a 
large number of new housing management opportunities. We will look 
to make further acquisitions to reinforce our market-leading position, 
however our primary focus remains organic growth.
Our clients are increasingly looking for partners who can operate 
strategically as well as operationally across a range of housing 
services. Mears has extended its core reactive and planned 
maintenance offering to include housing management to 
support clients in delivering more integrated solutions, 
aligned to their strategic challenges.

Care
Our key strengths
Differentiated 
service delivery
In order for customers to 
recommend us, we must 
deliver excellent service. 
We randomly conduct over 
80,000 Housing customer 
surveys each year.
Strategic relationships
We listen carefully to the 
needs of our clients and  
their tenants. As our clients’ 
needs have changed, we  
have developed a broader 
service offering which has 
increased the depth of our 
client partnerships.
Strong financial 
management
We operate in a high volume, 
low value and low margin 
environment where we have 
delivered consistent financial 
results over an extended 
period of time. This is 
achieved through works 
management systems, 
conservative accounting 
policies and a culture of 
giving attention to detail.
Social value
We lead the way with social 
value in the markets where 
we operate, delivering 
meaningful outcomes 
through positive community 
engagement projects and 
effective measurement.
We provide personal care to  
over 15,000 elderly and disabled people.
The Care division made good progress in a challenging period
We are continuing to see the emergence of new commissioning models 
that are long-term partnering orientated. We are focused on improving 
quality and cost over time and combining services into an integrated 
approach to achieve better outcomes for users at less overall cost to 
the public purse.
Whilst there has been no shortage of demand for care 
work, our limitation has been recruiting sufficient 
numbers of good quality carers. However, we 
believe the continuing funding pressure will be 
the catalyst for change.
We have a comprehensive range of domiciliary 
care and complex care services enhanced 
by the ability to deliver a range of housing 
adaptations and assistive technology such 
as telecare. We deliver broad solutions to the 
independent living challenges faced 
by so many elderly people, as well 
as younger people with physical 
or mental disabilities.
At the heart of what we do is the provision of 
quality care to those that depend on us.
