 Our performance in 2017 is our strongest on 
record. Glencore’s balance sheet has never been 
stronger and our investment case, underpinned 
by our leading marketing and industrial asset 
businesses, has never been better 
Capitalising on a strong  
operating environment
After an encouraging end to 2016, 
which saw commodities recover  
from cycle lows, positive momentum 
continued through 2017, resulting  
in prolonged outperformance of 
Glencore’s key commodities versus 
the broader markets. Concerns of 
tightening financial conditions in 
China during the second quarter 
proved to be short-lived, with 
commodities rallying once again 
through the second half of the year.
Strong economic performance 
in both major developing and 
developed markets has underpinned 
supportive commodity demand 
conditions. The electric vehicle 
upheaval continues to unfold, with 
the scale of market penetration  
and investment, by battery and 
automotive manufacturers and 
infrastructure players, adjusting 
progressively upwards. This provides 
an additional dimension of future 
demand growth for a number of our 
key commodities. Early signals of 
inflation and higher interest rates  
also bode well for commodities  
as an asset class.
Chinese supply-side reform, aided by 
consistent environmental policy and 
compliance, positively affected a 
number of commodities during  
2017, including thermal coal, zinc 
and aluminium. 
Going forward, those commodities 
where primary market balances are 
in deficit or trending towards deficit, 
such as zinc, copper, nickel and 
thermal coal should see positive  
price divergence versus potentially 
oversupplied markets.
Delivering sector-leading  
returns for shareholders
In 2017, Glencore outperformed  
all its UK-listed major diversified 
mining peers, with shares up 41%. 
Our balance sheet is robust,  
and our investment case is  
increasingly compelling. 
Financial performance was strong 
in 2017, with Adjusted EBITDA of 
$14.8 billion, up 44% and net income 
attributable to equity holders 
increasing to $5.8 billion, from 
$1.4 billion in 2016, reflecting healthy 
commodity prices and the continued 
robust earnings contribution from  
our highly cash generative Marketing 
and Industrial businesses.
Marketing resilient again
Marketing Adjusted EBIT was 
$3.0 billion in 2017, 3% higher  
than 2016, reflecting the benefits  
of continued supportive market 
conditions, volume growth in key 
market segments and a positive end 
to the year, eclipsing the $2.8 billion 
guidance provided during the 
Investor Update in early December. 
Metals & Minerals and Energy 
Products both delivered strong 
contributions while Agricultural 
Products posted a resilient 
performance when compared to 
many peers. Marketing has again 
proven its ability to generate 
consistently solid earnings with high 
cash conversion, taking into account 
its low fixed capital requirements.

Chief Executive Officer’s review

Glencore Annual Report 2017 Looking ahead, while we maintain 
our long-term Marketing Adjusted 
EBIT guidance range of $2.2 to 
$3.2 billion, a continuation of recent 
healthy marketing conditions would 
suggest a 2018 performance in the 
upper half of the range.
Industrial margin expansion 
through higher prices and relentless 
cost focus
Industrial Adjusted EBITDA of 
$1 1.5 billion in 2017 was 60%  
higher than 2016. Our asset  
portfolio continued to deliver overall 
competitive all-in unit costs which, 
despite some minor production 
challenges during the year, allowed 
the Company to capitalise on healthy 
commodity prices and generate 
higher Adjusted EBITDA mining 
margins of 38% and 41% respectively 
in our Metals and Energy operations.
Energy and mobility transformation 
forecast to unlock material new 
sources of commodity demand
Commodity differentiation is 
increasingly important, and 
Glencore’s commodity mix 
is becoming less dependent 
on demand generated by  
infrastructure related investment 
in developing markets.
Accelerating electric vehicle adoption 
requires an energy and mobility 
transformation that is forecast to 
unlock material new sources of 
demand for the enabling underlying 
commodities including copper,  
nickel and cobalt.
We recently commissioned an 
independent study to gauge the 
potential incremental demand  
for these commodities under the 
Electric Vehicles Initiative scenario 
of 30 % electric vehicle market share 
by 2030. The findings suggest an 
additional 4.1Mt of copper, 1.1Mt  
of nickel and 314kt of cobalt supply 
will be required by 2030. 
These potentially significant new 
demand sources offer compelling 
fundamentals, particularly when 
coupled with persistent 
supply challenges. 
Automaker investment in EVs:       
$90 billion and counting
The rate at which automotive and 
battery companies have scaled up 
electric vehicle investment plans 
speaks to our opportunity as a 
supplier of key metals. 
Global automaker investments now 
total more than $90 billion, with at 
least $19 billion attributed to the U.S., 
$21 billion to China and $52 billion  
to Germany. Volkswagen alone  
plans to spend $40 billion by 2030  
to build electrified versions of over 
300 models. Chinese automakers are 
ramping up focus on the EV story, 
while a number have announced 
investment partnerships with the 
likes of Ford, VW and General Motors.
Our resource base is well positioned 
to supply into this likely energy and 
mobility evolution, particularly given 
our anticipated strong production 
growth in copper (25%) nickel (30%) 
and cobalt (133%) over the next  
three years.

Information Conviction to create value  
through partnerships, M&A  
and organic reinvestment
Over the past 15 months, in our 
constant drive to create long-term 
value for shareholders, we continued 
to leverage our trading and  
strategic relationships to source  
and structure both acquisitions  
and disposals, including:
• Acquisition of 49% of Rio Tinto’s 
Hunter Valley Operations (thermal 
coal) with Yancoal retaining 51%, 
gaining access to sizeable high 
quality energy coal resources and 
marketing rights (pending)
• Sale of 51% of non-U.S. petroleum 
products storage and logistics 
business to HNA (sale of smaller  
U.S. portion pending)
• Creation of BaseCore Metals 
alongside Ontario Teachers’ 
Pension Plan, a growth vehicle  
for base metal streams, royalties 
and commercial opportunities
• Sale of our African zinc assets 
to Trevali for mix of cash and 
shares, thereby accelerating the 
development of a mid-size zinc 
growth vehicle with Glencore 
retaining 25% equity participation 
and offtake agreements
• Acquisition of Chevron’s South 
African and Botswana mid/down-
stream oil business (pending)
• Acquisition of majority of voting 
class shares in Volcan, gaining 
exposure/access to a premier 
zinc district and potential asset/
marketing synergies
• Acquisition of remaining 31% 
interest in Mutanda copper
• Increased Rosneft oil offtake, 
alongside equity partnership 
structure with the QIA
Additionally, we have an attractive 
suite of organic growth options across 
the portfolio. Key existing projects 
neared completion in 2017, including 
Katanga (copper/cobalt – now in 
commissioning), Mopani (copper – 
commissioning late 2018) and 
Koniambo (nickel, Line 2 in 
commissioning). 
A suite of low-cost, low-risk 
brownfield opportunities were 
approved or progressed during  
2017, including Integrated Nickel 
Operations (nickel), Zhairem (zinc), 
Katanga acid plant and cobalt circuit 
debottlenecking (copper/cobalt), 
Mutanda cobalt reclaim (copper), 
United Wambo Open Cut (coal)  
and Mt Owen extension (coal).
$2.9 billion shareholder distribution 
Consistent with new distribution 
policy and reflecting strong cash 
generation in 2017, we have declared 
a distribution of $2.9 billion ($0.20 per 
share) in respect of 2017 cash flows, 
to be paid in two equal instalments 
in 2018. 
This payment comprises a fixed         
$1 billion pay-out in respect of 
Marketing activities and a variable 
component of $1.9 billion, 
representing c.36% of Industrial  
asset free cash flow compared  
to our policy minimum of 25%. 
Corporate governance  
and sustainability
Our ambition to integrate 
sustainability throughout our 
business remains a key strategic 
priority for the Group and reflects  
our commitment to operate 
transparently and responsibly.  
It also encompasses our desire to 
protect the wellbeing of our people, 
our host communities and the 
natural environment, while sharing 
lasting benefits with the regions 
where we work and society  
as a whole.
Sadly, we recorded nine fatalities  
at our operations in 2017. Our goal 
remains zero fatalities and there is 
unrelenting focus on ensuring leading 
practice at all our operations.
Progress during 2017 included the 
publication of our commitment to 
preventing the occurrence of Modern 
Slavery and human trafficking within 
our operations and supply chains,  
the release of our 2016 Sustainability 
report, as well as updated reports on 
Payments to Governments and our 
Climate Change Considerations paper.

We were delighted to appoint 
Ms Gill Marcus to the Board as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director, 
with effect from 1 January 2018.  
Gill was Governor of the South African 
Reserve Bank from November 2009 
to November 2014, and her long 
record of public service coupled  
with her finance experience, geo-
political insights and non-executive 
board experience will be a great 
benefit to us.
Due to sustained low levels of 
liquidity and the general ability  
and preference for prospective 
investors to access Glencore’s  
primary exchange, we sought  
to delist from Hong Kong, which  
took effect in January 2018.
Looking forward
We look ahead with confidence, 
noting the synchronised global 
economic growth, supportive 
commodity fundamentals and  
the emerging electric vehicle  
story. We believe our unrivalled 
positioning in “Tier 1” commodities 
and “Tier 1” assets will continue  
to create compelling value 
for shareholders.
