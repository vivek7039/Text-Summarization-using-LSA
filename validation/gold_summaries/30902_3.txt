 Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholder,
We started the year as TP ICAP plc and our 
task was clear: to progress the integration 
of the Tullett Prebon and ICAP businesses 
and to maintain our focus on enhancing 
the services we offer to our clients. I am 
pleased to report that, on both targets, 
we have succeeded.
Trading and dividend
Reported revenue of £1,757m in 2017 was 
4% higher than in 2016 on a pro forma basis 
(1% higher at constant exchange rates) with 
underlying operating profit increasing by 
10% to £263m
1 
compared to pro forma 2016. 
On a statutory basis operating profit 
decreased by 44% on a pro forma basis 
to £102m reflecting the costs to achieve 
synergies arising from the integration. Our 
underlying performance reflected improving 
levels of activity in our rates business, as 
the long period of near-zero interest rates 
appears to be coming to an end, and a 
strong performance in our oil businesses. 
Rupert Robson
Chairman
Our Information and Risk Management 
Services businesses showed pleasing growth, 
and we continued to build capabilities 
and revenues in our most recently formed 
division, Institutional Services. 
The underlying operating profit margin in 
2017 of 15.0% was 0.8 percentage points 
higher than in 2016 on a pro forma basis. The 
statutory operating profit margin in 2017 of 
5.8% was 4.9% lower than in 2016 on a pro 
forma basis. Basic earnings per share was 
15.8 pence and underlying earnings per 
share for 2017 of 33.3 pence was 0.7 pence 
lower than 2016 on a pro forma basis.
The Board declared an interim dividend of 
5.6 pence per share paid on 10 November 
2017 and is recommending a final dividend 
of 11.25 pence per share to be paid on 17 May 
2018 (with a record date of 6 April 2018). 
Board and governance
The Board is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and to instilling 
the right culture, behaviour and approach 
to how we do business. 
I said in the Annual Report for 2016 that we 
were seeking to expand the Board. In the last 
six months, we have appointed Edmund Ng 
and Michael Heaney to the Board as 
Independent Non-executive Directors. 
Edmund brings many years of experience of 
the Asian financial markets having worked in 
the asset management and investment bank 
sectors in Hong Kong. He also held a senior 
position at the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority. Michael brings expertise of the 
US markets, having held senior positions 
at Morgan Stanley in New York. He is also 
Chairman of the Fixed Income Market 
Structure Advisory Committee at the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
10 Strategic report The Board has a wide range of relevant 
expertise, perspectives and insights. It has 
also recently achieved greater diversity. All 
this will prove invaluable given the greater 
complexity of our Group following the 
acquisition and the fast pace of change in 
the sector in which we operate. It will also be 
important as we look to take advantage of 
the wider opportunities available to TP ICAP . 
This latter task will rise up the Board’s 
agenda as the integration process reaches 
its conclusion.
During 2017, we held our June board 
meeting in New York and our September 
meeting in Singapore. We used those 
occasions to spend a number of days 
meeting our employees at many levels in 
those regions. This has enhanced the Board’s 
understanding of the TP ICAP business and 
I hope has also increased the visibility and 
accessibility of the Non-executive Directors. 
It has enabled us to gain greater insight 
into the behaviour, beliefs and values 
that underpin our organisation and how 
we should shape and embed our culture. 
I have addressed this matter in more detail 
on page 49.
We continued to engage with our 
shareholders during 2017 . The Board 
stays abreast of the development of 
shareholder views on governance, 
remuneration, and other key issues. 
During 2018 we will examine how the Group 
engages with the many other stakeholders 
who are part of the TP ICAP network and 
how we ensure we understand their 
perspectives in the decisions we take.
Outlook
Throughout 2018 we will continue to focus on 
achieving the synergies of the combination of 
T ullett Prebon and ICAP , and the optimisation 
and transformation of our business model. 
We will invest to ensure we can thrive  
in a changing regulatory and political 
environment, and look for other 
opportunities to deliver our objectives 
to build revenue and raise the quality 
and quantity of earnings.
