Chairman’s statement
“One of the key roles of the Chairman is to ensure that the Board 
members possess a range of complementary skills which are relevant to 
Bodycote’s business. I have spent time with all of my Board colleagues 
and am confident that I have joined a well-balanced Board that, in terms 
of governance, is functioning effectively. ”
A. C. Quinn  CBE
Chairman
I am pleased to be contributing to the annual report for the first 
time as Bodycote’s Chairman, having taken up the position on  
1 January 2018.
Overview
The Group delivered a good set of results for 2017 and I am  
very pleased that the management team, under the leadership  
of Stephen Harris, has been able to demonstrate the strength  
and strong market position of Bodycote’s business once again.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 12.1p, an increase of 
12%, which will be paid on 1 June 2018, subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting (AGM). This brings 
the total ordinary dividend for 2017 to 17 .4p (2016: 15.8p) costing 
£33.1m, which represents a year-on-year increase of 10.1%. This 
increase in the level of dividend underscores the Board’s view of 
the Group’s excellent future earnings and cash flow potential. 
Furthermore, recognising the strong net cash position of the Group 
at year end, the Board is recommending a supplemental distribution 
by way of a special dividend, also payable on 1 June 2018, amounting 
to 25.0p per share, costing £47 .9m.
Board and governance
My predecessor, Alan Thomson, stepped down as Chairman at the 
end of 2017 . On behalf of the Board, and the Company as a whole, 
I thank Alan for his significant contribution to Bodycote during his 
ten years of Chairmanship and previously as a Non-Executive Board 
member. I think that it is fair to say that Bodycote has undergone 
a wholesale transformation during Alan’s tenure as Chairman and 
the development of the Group’s share price over that period is a 
testament to the progress that has been made.
One of the key roles of the Chairman is to ensure that the Board 
members possess a range of complementary skills which are 
relevant to Bodycote’s business. I have spent time with all of 
my Board colleagues and am confident that I have joined a 
well-balanced Board that, in terms of governance, is functioning 
effectively.

The Board has been further strengthened by the appointment of 
Lili Chahbazi, who joined as a Non-Executive Director on 1 January 
2018. Lili is an experienced strategy consultant and, since 2008, a 
global partner in the London office of Bain & Company. Lili currently 
heads the oil & gas practice and consults to a range of international 
clients. Lili brings a wide range of experience in businesses 
including those in the engineering, aviation and transport industries. 
Another one of the key responsibilities of the Chairman is to 
promote effective governance across the Group, thus ensuring 
that we remain a successful and sustainable entity with good 
governance procedures practised across all 23 countries in 
which the Group operates. We are committed to conducting 
business responsibly. By maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance, we enhance performance underpinned by our business 
model. Our approach to governance is set by the Board, and our 
Executive Committee ensures that the approach is effectively 
implemented across the business. Effective and robust governance 
remains central to the ongoing success of the Group.
People
As part of my induction to the business, I have had the chance 
to visit a good number of facilities, as well as to engage with 
much of the Group’s senior executive management. I have been 
impressed by the commitment, knowledge and passion that I have 
experienced from employees across the business, and at all levels. 
I can see how the talented workforce creates a clear competitive 
advantage for Bodycote, which is so vital for the long-term success 
of the business.
Shareholders
During the year, as usual, meetings were undertaken with a 
number of Bodycote’s shareholders and positive feedback was 
received from them. I have already had the opportunity to meet 
some of our shareholders and look forward to meeting more of you 
during the coming year, as well as at this year’s AGM in May 2018. 
Summary
The Group is starting to show the results of the increased 
investment programme that has been ongoing for the last few 
years. This programme has been designed to generate superior 
growth in what until recently has been a weak macroeconomic 
environment. The results of these investments, together with the 
continued diligence in operational efficiency and a more benign 
macro environment all combined to deliver another good set of 
results for the Group in 2017 . Bodycote remains well placed to 
capitalise on the value generating investments available to it and 
the prospects for the Group are excellent. I am confident that in 
the coming years Bodycote will deliver an attractive return for our 
shareholders and commensurate reward for our employees.
