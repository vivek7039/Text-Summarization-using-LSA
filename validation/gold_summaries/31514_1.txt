CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW
The rise of awareness of fake news,  
and lack of transparency in the digital 
advertising supply chain has seen many 
larger advertisers reassessing where they 
invest their advertising spend after years  
of what has arguably been a race to the 
bottom in the blind programmatic digital 
advertising market place. Instead, they  
are now looking for trusted media 
organisations which can provide verified 
content in a safe environment. This 
rebalancing of spend by national 
advertisers will take time. At the local level, 
conditions remain difficult. Following the 
move of classified advertising to the big 
online portals (Autotrader, Indeed, ebay  
et al – the effects of which we still feel,  
with classified revenue down 29% year  
on year), display advertising has been 
shifting online predominantly to Facebook 
(resulting in, print display revenues  
being down 17% year on year). 
The focus in 2017 remained on our 
longer-term objective of returning the 
business back to top-line growth and profit 
growth, through delivery of the stated 
strategic objectives. The aim is to build  
a platform for sustainable growth and 
invest in the acceleration of digital growth 
in 2018. The corporate objectives for  
2017 were: 
1.  Continuing the success of the  
i newspaper,
2.  Digital audience and revenue growth,
3.  Sales model transformation,
4.  Publishing Model evolution (focusing on 
our biggest Cities and towns, and finding 
operational efficiencies for our smallest 
weeklies), and
5.  Growing our contract printing business,
All have shown good momentum,  
as we continue to reset the business:
1. The i newspaper delivered EBITDA  
of £9.3m for 2017,
2. Adjusted digital revenue (ex classifieds) 
was up 13%, audiences increased  
by 13% (and traffic was up by 19%), 
despite headwinds from Facebook 
algorithm changes, 
3. Adjusted total revenue excluding 
classified was up 1.8% for the year,
4. Adjusted newspaper sales revenue  
grew by 2.7%, and we grew audiences  
by 2.5%, and
5. Statutory print contract revenue 
increased by 4.2% to £13.3m.
At the same time we have been 
progressing the Strategic Review process. 
Refer to the Strategic Review of financing 
options section on page 11 for more details.
In 2017 we continued to maintain a 
complete focus on operational efficiency, 
through a combination of on-going active 
portfolio management, completion of the 
salesforce transformation, and tight control 
of the cost base. Total costs (excluding 
exceptionals) reduced by £12.1m in 2017,  
an 8% reduction on prior year excluding  
the impact of full year costs of the i.
Revenue trends from the regional business 
remain challenging, especially within 
classified advertising, which is still feeling 
the impact of the continued structural 
change within the classified marketplace, 
led by companies such as Autotrader, 
Rightmove and Indeed (Jobs). However, our 
entire classified business represented just 
16% of total Group revenue and is set  
to become a considerably smaller part of 
the business in 2018.
The regional advertising business has seen 
the growing impact of small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) using Facebook as 
a route to market to advertise local services. 
The threat posed to advertising print 
revenue by Facebook has to some extent 
been mitigated by the increasing exposure 
of our newsbrands within Facebook 
newsfeeds, alongside our own website 
growth in key markets which can now 
boast audience reach frequently in excess 
of 50% to potential advertisers. This focus 
has helped the Group deliver total 
audience growth to an average of 25.4m 
unique browsers per month, a 13% growth 
on last year. Average page views are up 19% 
on prior year, underpinning a 13% year-on-
year growth in digital advertising solutions 
(excluding the challenged digital classified 
categories, up 3%).
Following a full-year of i ownership and  
a 2% improvement in decline rates across 
the regional business, we saw total adjusted 
revenue decline by 4.5%, from £210.8m to 
£201.2m. Total adjusted revenue including 
the additional 14 weeks of i trading and 
excluding classified was up 1.8%.
Adjusted newspaper sales revenue  
grew by 2.7%, from £76.9m to £79.0m, 
benefiting from the full-year ownership of 
i newspaper. For the like-for-like 38 weeks 
for which i was owned in both periods, 
total newspaper sales revenue was down 
4.9%. Contract print revenue grew by 4.2%, 
from £12.8m to £13.3m.
Despite the positive momentum we have 
created in 2017, we have taken a realistic 
view of the carrying value of our titles, and 
have taken a non-cash impairment charge 
of £59.2m. The quoted market value of  
our bond has increased by £22.8m in 2017, 
resulting in a mark-to-market charge 
against profits. Taken together, and 
including other exceptional costs this  
has resulted in a statutory loss of £78.6m, 
compared to a loss of £247.3m in 2016,  
on statutory revenues of £201.6m in 2017, 
down from £222.7m in 2016. £9.9m of this 
revenue decline related to the sale of East 
Midlands titles in January 2017.
Net debt, excluding the bond mark-to-
market adjustment, was £195.9m at the 
end of 2017, a reduction of £8.6m on  
prior year. A reconciliation of statutory  
net debt to net debt excluding the 
mark-to-market adjustment is provided  
in the Financial Review.
Delivering against
strategic objectives
In what remains a very challenging trading environment, 
the vision of the Company remains to be at the  
heart of communities, providing accurate, relevant  
and timely news and information – free of external 
proprietorial influence. 9

Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Highlights in 2017
1. Making a success of i
Strategic Rationale: On acquisition of the 
i newspaper in April 2016, we laid out the 
strategic rationale for acquiring the title, 
which the company determined to be 
transformational for the Group. The 
acquisition significantly helped to diversify 
the Group away from a regionally based  
and local display advertising led business, 
operating in markets experiencing significant 
negative structural and consumer 
behavioural change.
Revenue derived from the i newspaper  
is marked by a greater emphasis on more 
stable circulation income, operating in the 
more predictable daily qualities market,  
at a price point we determined to have 
reasonable elasticity when compared to 
other titles within this market segment.  
It was additionally determined that the scale 
of the Group would be beneficial to the title, 
affording the title greater leverage on key 
contracts, resulting in cost savings and 
investment capacity to improve overall 
editorial quality, both in print and online.
In 2017, under the leadership of editor Oly 
Duff, the i newspaper was short-listed for  
a number of awards from bodies such as  
The British Press Awards, the Foreign Press 
Association and the News Awards, reflecting 
in part the investment in journalism made 
since acquisition.
Profit Growth: Prior to the acquisition in April 
2016, the i contributed operating profits of 
£5.2m to its former owner, Independent Print 
Limited for the year ended 27 September 
2015 (source: Circular to shareholders dated 
2 March 2016). Through a combination of 
revenue improvement actions resulting in 
both circulation and advertising (print and 
digital) revenue increases year on year, and 
targeted cost management, the i was able  
to report an EBITDA run-rate averaging £1m 
per month in the last quarter of 2017 and 
EBITDA for the 52 weeks of £9.3m (no central 
corporate cost allocated), and operating 
profit of £8.7m.
Circulation Revenue Growth: In September 
2017, the cover price of the i increased  
from 50p to 60p on Monday to Friday  
and from 60p to 80p on Saturday. The 
price increase was supported by both  
a marketing campaign and the relaunch  
of the Saturday edition (iWeekend), with 
the Saturday edition attracting 12,000  
new readers when compared to its average 
circulation pre relaunch. Daily circulation 
overall remained at 265,000 (Jan – Dec 17), 
as verified by the Audit Bureau of 
Circulation Data. Market share has risen  
to an average of some 20% for the Monday 
to Friday editions. Circulation revenue 
increased by 21.5% on the prior year,  
on a comparable 38 week period.
Advertising Revenue Growth:  
Under Johnston Press ownership, the 
i newspaper’s market share of main news 
advertisers has seen growth of 2%; from 
20% in the pre-acquisition period of 
January to November 2015 to 22% in 
January to November 2017 (source: ad 
dynamix). i print and digital advertising 
revenue grew 27% in the second half of 
2017, compared to the first half, providing  
a strong advertising revenue platform 
going into 2018. This reflects our efforts  
to establish the i newspaper brand as a 
politically unbiased, independent, quality, 
trusted brand that delivers a largely unique 
audience that all advertisers and their 
agencies should have on their media 
buying schedule.
It has been particularly pleasing that  
the i shared a number of our centrally 
coordinated investigation features,  
taking a national perspective, alongside  
a more localised angle taken by our  
larger regional and city brands.
The growth of inews.co.uk, launched  
in April 2016 following the acquisition, 
continued through 2017. During 2017,  
the website attracted an average of 1.4m 
unique browsers per month, up 45% year 
on year. In 2018 an additional investment 
in digital journalists will be made to further 
accelerate growth of the inews’s digital 
presence, mirroring the additional new 
investment being made to the digital 
offering for Johnston Press’ largest regional 
and city brands. The continued growth  
of inews.co.uk through 2017 has propelled 
the web-site into being one of the Group’s 
leading sites in terms of scale, all within  
18 months of launch.
2. Digital audience and  
revenue growth
In-line with the announced publishing 
strategy that focuses on markets with  
the greatest growth potential, the digital 
strategy for the Group has also been 
aligned around the same core principles 
and brands, helping to concentrate 
resources in markets with the greatest 
digital audience potential. In 2017, unique 
browsers grew to an average of 25.4m  
per month, a 13% increase on prior year. 
Overall page view growth across the 
Johnston Press network has been driven by 
a number of the biggest brands; the Belfast 
News Letter’s monthly page views were up 
48% year-on-year, Yorkshire Evening Post 
(Leeds) up 45%, Sheffield Star up 29% and 
the Edinburgh Evening News up 40%. 
Digital classified revenue, especially in the 
Jobs category, remain a drag on overall 
digital revenue progression, impacting 
publishers across both regional and national 
markets. The total regional print classified 
advertising market (principally jobs, property 
and autos) has declined from £1.9bn  
in 2007 to £320m in 2017, with the 
corresponding increase in Digital classified 
growing from £624m to £1.3bn over the 
same period. In addition, only a relatively 
small percentage of the growing digital 
income has flowed to publishers such as 
Johnston Press, with the majority shifting  
to on-line platforms such as Autotrader, 
Indeed, Linkedin and Rightmove. 10
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Adjusted digital revenue, excluding 
classified grew by 13% in 2017 (total 
adjusted digital revenue grew 3%). We 
delivered 16% growth in our national digital 
advertising, including the 1XL network 
formed and in partnership with Newsquest 
and Mediaforce, and through partnerships 
with companies like Taboola and Facebook.
Growth in some new digital revenue areas 
did not build as fast as we expected. Both 
Video and Facebook advertising required  
us to improve recruitment and training,  
in order to fully exploit the opportunity. We 
have also not completed the development 
and rollout of our full range advertising 
product, which will be an important part  
of maintaining profit margins (third party 
products typically offering significantly  
lower margins).
3. Sales model transformation
Total advertising revenue, on a like-for-like 
basis and excluding classified (like-for-like 
advertising revenue, excluding classified  
has been calculated by comparing the  
38 week period in the current year from 
9 April 2017 to 30 December 2017, to the 
equivalent 38 weeks of the prior year from 
10 April 2016 to 31 December 2016, allowing 
comparability year on year as a result of the 
acquisition of the i on the 10 April 2016) was 
down 4.0% for the year (including classified, 
down 13.5%). Classified advertising 
represented some 15% of total revenue  
in 2017 and are expected to represent 
around 12% of total revenue in 2018. 
Our sales operation has been through  
a significant transformation in 2017 to 
ensure there is the right mix of local  
and central resource and to maintain  
a significant presence of highly qualified 
and well trained experts in the field to 
serve customers face to face, offering  
print advertising solutions and increasingly 
digital advertising services. In 2017  
we invested in our Media Sales Centre 
(tele-sales facilities), moving over 300 sales 
staff into a new city centre location in 
Sheffield, alongside the modern offices 
premises in Leeds and Edinburgh.  
The shift to a centralised call centre 
environment follows the route taken  
by other market leading companies  
within the wider advertising arena such  
as Autotrader and Facebook. Our USP is 
that we have retained highly local market 
knowledge and we lead on our local 
brands. A centralised sales environment, 
supported by leading edge technology 
from Saleforce and Miles33, allows for 
better training and control, ensuring  
all telephone based sales staff are kept 
abreast of the latest market and product 
information in a rapidly evolving SME 
focused, digitally led media landscape. 
Alongside the salesforce transformation, 
we have additionally enhanced sales  
routes to market with improved self-serve 
solutions for SME customers who want to 
interact and manage their needs online.
The large scale transfer of advertising 
customer accounts and rebalancing of 
sales resource (from field to tele-sales) 
impacted sales revenue during the 
transition period. However, we estimate 
that the revenue loss was outweighed  
by the scale of cost savings realised.
4. Publishing model evolution
Through 2017, the business aligned around 
distinct publishing groups, helping to align 
operating plans in editorial, sales, digital 
and the functional support areas. The 
publishing strategy is a natural evolution 
from the disparate and locally managed 
publishing operations, to a centrally 
operated and vertically aligned business. 
However, local editorial decision making 
remains in place, ensuring local character 
and insight is maintained.
The editorial strategy can be summarised 
as; ‘think nationally and act locally’,  
as evidenced by the centrally created 
content produced by advanced content 
hubs, central lifestyle team and central 
investigation team, all aligned to the 
publishing strategy. All the content created 
from the central teams is flowed through 
all the national, regional, city and larger 
weeklies titles, helping to drive audience 
engagement in both print and digital.  
The investment in central teams has driven 
greater efficiency in content production 
and is carefully balanced with an 
imperative of keeping local news reporters 
local and relevant. Johnston Press employs 
849 journalists, with the vast majority 
aligned to individual news brands, focused 
on local news gathering. During the  
latter part of 2017, and into 2018 we have 
commenced hiring more journalists as  
a result of three significant initiatives: the 
BBC Local Democracy Reporters initiative, 
our Digital ‘Powerhouses’ project (that sees 
31 new staff being hired in London, Leeds, 
and Edinburgh), and a ramping up of  
our apprentice programme.
5. Growing our contract  
printing business
The contract printing business once again 
delivered annual revenue growth year  
on year, posting a growth of 4% in 2017, 
increasing revenue to £13.3m, which 
represents 7% of total Group revenue.  
An encouraging performance, particularly 
in light of the contraction in the overall 
market, and achieved through a 
combination of maintaining existing 
contracts and winning new contracts  
to print (amongst others) the Daily Mail 
and the Metro, both at our modern 
Portsmouth plant.
Current trading and outlook
The Group has traded in line with the 
board’s expectations in the first quarter  
of 2018, with Q1 adjusted EBITDA higher 
than prior year. The i is continuing to deliver 
the exceptional growth seen in FY 2017, 
with revenue up 21% year on year in the 
first quarter. 
The first quarter of 2018 has seen us  
deliver increased adjusted EBITDA year  
on year, driven by the i’s continued strong 
performance (especially the relaunched 
Saturday edition, up 4% year on year  
in newspaper sales) and our strategy of 
focusing on our largest Cities and titles. We 
are pleased with the acceleration in growth 
from the i’s website inews.co.uk which, 
having delivered sustained growth in 2017, 
has ramped up further in the first quarter 
of this year (with unique users up 89% year 
on year).
Across our regional portfolio of titles 
national print advertising tracked in line 
with prior year in the first quarter of 2018, 
with advertisers starting to increase spend 
in regional print. This trend is driven by  
a somewhat stronger overall advertising 
market, our ability to precisely target 
audiences using ‘big data’, and improving 
sentiment towards quality print publishers 
in the wake of the Fake News and social 
media trust concerns. 
Classified advertising remains weak, but  
is now a significantly smaller portion of the 
group accounting for just 13% of revenues 
in the quarter, following our investment  
in digital and the i.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED 11
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
‘The first quarter of 2018 has seen us deliver 
increased adjusted EBITDA year on year, driven  
by the i’s continued strong performance.’
The trading environment remains 
challenging, notwithstanding early signs  
of some improvement in the national print 
advertising market. Comparatives do get 
harder, and we expect to see continued 
pressure on revenues, and the requirement 
for cost savings. Against this difficult 
backdrop we are focused on maintaining 
our strong margins, driving additional 
growth from i and realising further 
operational and financial synergies.  
During 2018 we will continue to selectively 
invest in the business, with a focus on 
digital, journalists, and content generation.
Whilst operationally the business is 
performing well in challenging markets, 
addressing the Group’s capital structure 
remains a key priority. The Strategic Review 
of financing options is ongoing and 
discussions with our various stakeholders 
are progressing. We will update on this 
matter as we progress through 2018. 
Net debt and liquidity
In January 2017, we reported the sale  
of 13 titles to Iliffe Media for consideration  
of £17m, with the disposal informed by  
the wider publishing strategy of focusing 
on big cities and digital growth towns.  
The improved liquidity derived from the 
disposal has assisted us in reducing net 
debt, though equally critically, afforded us 
investment capacity in our largest brands 
to further increase overall reach in targeted 
markets. Net debt at 30 December 2017 
was £195.9m, a reduction of £8.6m on prior 
year (2016: £204.5m).
Strategic review of  
financing options
Operationally the Group is performing  
well in difficult market conditions. As  
an industry, we have seen the classified 
advertising market suffer enormous 
structural change over the last decade,  
and more recently the display advertising 
market has come under pressure from 
new competitors, particularly Facebook 
and Google. Despite the resulting revenue 
decline, we have maintained an adjusted 
operating margin of just under 17%,  
whilst delivering strong growth from  
the i newspaper. 
We currently face the challenge of 
addressing issues with the Group’s  
capital structure. The major acquisition 
programme in 2005 and 2006 saw peak 
debt levels hit £751 million at the end of 
2006. While net debt at 30 December  
2017 (excluding mark-to-market) stands at 
£195.9 million, this level of debt is now too 
high given the current size of the business 
and represents a constraint on its ability  
to return to growth. 
Last year, the Group announced it had 
commenced a strategic review to assess 
the financing options available to the 
Group in relation to its Bonds which 
become due for repayment on 1 June  
2019. As a key part of this strategic review 
process, the Board has engaged with its 
major stakeholders, including shareholders, 
holders of the Bonds, Pension Trustees and 
The Pensions Regulator. 
The Board subsequently announced that  
it was approaching its largest bondholders 
regarding the formation of an ad hoc 
committee of bondholders which was 
then formed in November 2017. 
Discussions with advisers to the ad hoc 
committee and our other stakeholders  
are in progress. Any proposal that results 
from these discussions will remain subject 
to negotiation and consent of relevant 
stakeholders, and there can be no certainty 
that a formal proposal will be forthcoming. 
In the event that consensual amendments 
to the Group’s capital structure cannot  
be agreed with relevant stakeholders, 
alternative options for the restructuring or 
refinancing of the Bonds prior to June 2019 
will be explored as part of the ongoing 
strategic review process. Resolution of this 
matter remains a key priority for the Board 
as it is currently creating significant 
uncertainty for the business and its 
stakeholders, and detracting from the 
good operational performance of the 
business in 2017 and the strong recent 
progress we have made against our 
strategic objectives. 
Refer to the Viability Statement section  
for further details.
