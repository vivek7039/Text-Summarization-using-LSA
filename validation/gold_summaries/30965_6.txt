COMPONENTS OF DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
HOW IS THE REMUNERATION POLICY ACHIEVED? 
COMPONENT RATIONALE
SALARY Setting base salary levels for Executive Directors or key management at an appropriate 
level is key to managerial retention in Mexico. Salaries are positioned within the range 
according to experience and length of service.
Ordinarily, the same basis for change (e.g. salary increases) will be applied 
across the Company to senior management and employees alike. 
BONUS The annual bonus rewards the achievement of financial and strategic business targets 
and the delivery of personal objectives. Annual bonus is capped at six months’ salary 
and is paid on the basis of metrics set out in the remuneration policy. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic 
objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of 
our business rather than being seen as something extra. 
BENEFITS Benefits are provided in line with the Group’s policy on employee benefits. 
PENSION The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Executive Directors and key 
management are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme. 
SHARES The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because this 
continues not to be a common form of remuneration in Mexico. 
Additional features of Fresnillo’s Remuneration Policy
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES In the absence of share-based incentive schemes, there is no need to adopt shareholding 
guidelines for executives. 
RECOVERY OF BONUS 
(MALUS/CLAW-BACK)
The absence of long-term incentives makes it difficult to adopt claw-back and malus 
arrangements. There is however scope within the bonus scheme for bonus awards to  
be adjusted downward at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
REMUNERATION POLICY OBJECTIVE
WHAT DOES THE POLICY SEEK TO ACHIEVE?
The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management 
incentives to the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.
