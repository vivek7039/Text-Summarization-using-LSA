40,000 Bopd
Completion of acquisition of assets from 
BP in December

Kraken production increasing; project 
capital expenditures reduced
• Gross production averaged 38,000 Bopd 
in the first two months of 2018 and has 
already reached the targeted 50,000 Bopd 
(gross) as planned
• Drilling rig contract renegotiation has led 
to full cycle gross project capital 
expenditure being further reduced to 
$2.3 billion, more than 25% lower than 
originally sanctioned
Extensive near-field drilling programme 
planned
• Kraken DC4 wells to be drilled in the second 
half of 2018, with first production in 2019
• Three-well programme at Magnus 
underway, expected onstream later in 2018
• Two wells to be drilled at PM8/Seligi, 
EnQuest’s first drilling campaign in these 
fields
• Heather H-67 sidetrack well drilled and 
onstream in Q1

2 EBITDA is calculated on a business performance basis, and is calculated by taking profit/(loss) from operations before tax and 
finance income/(costs) and adding back depletion, depreciation, foreign exchange movements and the realised gain/(loss) on 
foreign currency derivatives related to capital expenditure. 
Key risks for 2018
• A materially lower than expected production 
performance at the Kraken field
• Unexpected shutdowns on producing assets 
for an extended period of time
