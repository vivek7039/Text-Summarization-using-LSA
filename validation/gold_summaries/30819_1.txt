CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Russell Atkinson
Chief Executive Officer
Results
We have delivered continuing underlying operating 
profit of £14.5m from underlying revenue of £51.0m.
The formation of our two ABS ventures, whilst 
working with a smaller number of more efficient 
panel law firms (PLFs), has been the main driver 
of improving our ability to manage demand. Whilst 
the traditional panel model remains core to our 
strategy, the increased flexibility provided by our 
new arrangements has enabled us to invest in the 
brand with confidence. The initial KPIs from the 
ABS ventures have been encouraging and we 
continue to manage and monitor these carefully.
Having reduced investment in the National 
Accident Helpline brand in 2016 we have been able 
to successfully relaunch the brand during the year. 
The new campaign is generating positive results 
with brand metrics improving strongly. Research 
indicates that our trust scores are almost 2.5
1
 
times better than our nearest competitor. 
Additionally, the investment in improving our digital 
functionality has resulted in growing numbers of 
enquiries generated via these new capabilities.
Our Critical Care (CC) division made progress in 
2017 although the final quarter was slightly more 
challenging as a result of a slower than expected 
rollout of some commercial initiatives. However, 
despite this, we have continued to grow market 
share and developed a solid pipeline of contract 
wins. Our credibility as brand leader has been 
further enhanced by winning Lawyer Monthly 
magazine Rehabilitation Provider of the Year.
The Group’s RP business faced further market 
headwinds during 2017 with Land Registry figures 
indicating a decline in annual volume of 25%
2
. 
However, our focus on website conversion, margin 
management and cost control enabled us to report 
profits for this division in line with those of 2016 - a 
robust performance.
Market overview 
The Group continues to operate in the large and 
fragmented Consumer Legal Services (CLS) 
market, remaining focused on PI and RP and we are 
proud to be the UK’s leading marketing services 
provider in the personal injury sector.
“All the key elements of our strategy 
are being successfully implemented 
and we continue to make strong 
progress as we adapt the business.”
Overview
2017 was an important year for the Group as we accelerated the process of 
re-engineering our Personal Injury (PI) division and navigating challenging 
market conditions in Residential Property (RP).
Despite the twin challenges of regulatory uncertainty and market 
headwinds, the Group traded well during 2017 delivering underlying 
operating profit in line with expectations. 
As we have previously indicated, the funding of work within PI impacts 
short-term profit recognition and cash conversion and this is reflected in 
year-on-year comparisons.
Having managed that aspect of our business as planned and whilst 
satisfied with the early contribution of our new ABS ventures, we believe 
that these structures offer a valuable opportunity to leverage the Group’s 
core skills in the PI market to drive future returns still further. 
It is encouraging that all the key elements of our strategy are being successfully 
implemented and we continue to make strong progress as we adapt the 
business to take advantage of the opportunities provided by change.

Governance Strategic report
The PI market has been broadly static in recent 
years at just under one million claims per annum
3
. 
However, we anticipate there has been a softening 
in the overall market during 2017 as a result of a 
reduction in Road T raffic Accident (RT A) claims 
caused by the cumulative impact of prior legislative 
change which has resulted in reduced marketing 
activity. Whilst data from April 2017 onwards is not yet 
available, our belief is that non-RT A volumes will 
remain largely unchanged and, coupled with our 
enquiry rate increasing year -on-year
4
, we will, 
therefore, have increased our market share. 
The number of Claims Management Companies 
(CMCs) has dropped from a peak of 2,500 in 
2011/12 to approximately 670
5
. The effect of 
previous legislation combined with a continuing 
lack of clarity surrounding the timing and impact  
of regulatory reforms has driven many smaller and 
mid-sized firms to question ongoing profitability 
causing uncertainty in decision making about 
future investment. This has depressed demand in 
the market as a whole for the traditional panel 
model and we expect this trend to continue, albeit 
we plan to mitigate the effect of this through our 
combined ABS and PLF strategy. 
Critical Care focuses exclusively on the catastrophic 
injury market, where we provide expert witness and 
case management services. Whilst not directly 
impacted by the proposed regulatory changes, the 
contagion effect felt by law firms from lower value 
claims, as well as the impact on insurers arising from 
the Ogden Reforms (changes to the discount rate), has 
resulted in some small changes in solicitor and insurer 
behaviour.
The Group’s third business, RP , is focused on lead 
origination and survey and search process 
management in residential property transactions and 
the challenges in this market are well documented. 
Poor availability of housing stock, 30 year lows in home 
ownership, continuing falls in new mortgage approvals 
and low levels of consumer confidence characterise 
the current climate. The Government has taken action 
to stimulate first time buyer transactions but this will 
take time to feed through. The market overall, 
therefore, remains challenging.
PI Regulatory update
In February 2017 the Government published its 
response to the consultation into, amongst other 
things, PI related soft tissue cases and small claims 
which it first announced in November 2015. Over a 
year later, despite the visibility provided by the 
consultation response, there is currently no 
definitive timetable for the introduction of 
legislation. Clearly the political turmoil caused by 
the 2017 general election combined with the 
continuing focus of legislation related to Britain’s 
proposed exit from the European Union means that 
progress has been slow. We anticipate that these 
changes will be implemented no earlier than Q2 
2019.
Strategic development in PI
Our PI division has been making significant 
preparations in anticipation of regulatory change. 
In particular we are now processing our own work 
through ABS ventures. Whilst these are in their 
early stages, we are encouraged by current levels 
of settled income from case successes (or accrued 
income for cases where liability has been admitted, 
though which remain unsettled). 
Our first ABS, now in its eighth month of operation, 
is already profitable month-on-month and has 
covered its projected fixed costs for its first full year 
of operation. Importantly though, we are also 
identifying ways of improving ABS profitability 
through a range of initiatives to improve processes 
and, ultimately, returns. We have consequently 
further refined our business models and we are 
now confident that we understand how to manage 
the financial impact that changes to the small 
claims limit and whiplash reform will have on  
our business. 
The success of our 2017 strategy, continued panel 
demand uncertainty and increased clarity in our 
post-reform business models lead the Board to 
conclude that we are best served to accelerate our 
investment in processing capability. Our strategy 
will continue to evolve and we plan to focus our 
investment in the following areas: 
• extending our ABS capability by creating a third 
ABS that allows NAH deeper involvement in the 
process in preparation for small claims;
• further developing our commercial models  
with PLF partners;
• evolving the National Accident Helpline brand  
to build on the impact created by our new 
campaign; and
• building our digital capability to enable  
a better experience for consumers.
This investment creates a platform for growth  
that will enable us, over time, to transform the 
consumer’s journey from initial contact to 
settlement, modernising the experience and 
offering a more efficient digital proposition 
combined with the service approach for which we 
are already acknowledged. We believe that the 
platform will also enable us to transition into 
processing small claims on an efficient and 
cost-effective basis.
Increased investment means a continuing 
deferment of profit and cash flow that is realised in 
future years as cases settle. However, as the model 
matures, both profit and cash flow will normalise 
enabling us to absorb the impact of regulatory 
changes and grow our market share without 
further significant disruption to the business.

Brand
During 2017 we made an exceptional investment of 
over £1m in relaunching our PI brand, National 
Accident Helpline. The creative approach has been 
developed to reposition the brand and broaden its 
appeal to a wider segment of the market. The 
campaign has been successful and allowed us to 
adjust our media strategy to be more efficient 
using a lower weight of TV advertising than in 
previous years, enabling us to optimise other 
elements of our marketing mix. 
Our focus on enhancing our digital offering has 
seen consumers able to start their claim online. 
This initiative has seen us achieve significant 
growth in such enquiries. Further investment in this 
area will be critical to enable us to support small 
claims and modernise the claims process.
Critical Care, operating under the Bush brand, has 
always had an enviable reputation for clinical 
excellence. Throughout 2017 we continued to 
invest in building this reputation. This has led to 
significant recognition with four important industry 
award wins during the year. Once again, our highly 
successful clinical conference was the centerpiece 
of our marketing activity positioning us as an 
industry thought-leader and further underpinning 
our proposition.
In RP we have continued to evolve our portfolio of 
brands as they focus on a localised organic search 
approach. Particularly pleasing, in a challenging 
market, were the improvements that we made to 
website conversion. Our ability to plan ahead was 
demonstrated by the introduction of our First Time 
Buyers’ Hub the day after the Government 
announced changes to Stamp Duty.
Ongoing focus on the brands that underpin our 
business will always be a core feature of the Group.
Customers
Central to the Group’s strategy has been serving a 
cross-section of claimant, defendant and 
conveyancing law firms with a range of services 
and products. Our customer base is broad, 
currently standing at 697 firms. 
In PI 2017 has seen us begin the process of 
supporting consumers directly, through the 
introduction of Your Law and National Law 
Partners, our ABS ventures. In this way, we now 
earn a proportion of our revenue from successfully 
processing a consumer’s claim. Our PLFs, however, 
continue to play a critical role for us and we have 
evolved our commercial models to provide more 
flexibility and choice.
In CC we continue to grow our customer base and 
this has been crucial in supporting our market 
share growth. Particularly satisfying has been the 
development of larger more strategic relationships 
with key insurers and law firms. In addition we have 
established a contractual relationship with The 
Child Brain Injury Trust (CBIT). This is an important 
charity that helps severely injured children and 
young people and we look forward to supporting 
them.
In RP we optimised our conveyancing panel and 
continue to grow our customer base in Searches.
Operations
The Group operates from four offices across the 
UK and has contact centres in two of these - 
Kettering and London.
Our PI contact centre added new capability during 
2017 in support of our National Law Partners ABS 
and we now progress the call directly through to 
verbal retainer for this proportion of our work. 
Additionally, our ABSs commenced operations 
from the offices of our partners in Bristol and 
Cardiff with specific staff seconded to our 
operations. 35 new jobs were created as a result.
Our Daventry office remains the operational hub of 
CC and, once again, we have continued to grow our 
clinical capability through the introduction of new 
operations managers who support our consultants 
in their interactions with clients.
Our RP division has focused on sharpening our call 
handling processes and adjusting our consumer 
offering to better reflect the nature of the service 
we provide. The impact of these initiatives will be 
seen in better conversion from first contact by the 
consumer, which will be an important part of our 
growth going forward. 
People and values
Our people make us who and what we are and we 
employ a talented and motivated team of 220 staff 
across the Group. In addition, we work with a 
further 164 Expert Witnesses and Case Managers 
who form the cornerstone of the service we provide 
in CC.
Throughout 2017 we have been building our 
capabilities in our PI contact centres which has 
resulted in us employing a further 15 staff. 
Additionally we have strengthened the operational 
management team in CC where we have been 
awarded silver status by Investors in People.
The development of our people continues and we 
have instituted a series of management 
development days and a Group-wide leadership 
school to supplement the on-the-job training that 
we have always provided.
We were encouraged by the outputs from our 
annual employee engagement survey with overall 
engagement scoring over seven times the UK 
national average (see page 28 for further 
information), performing strongly in the areas of 
trust in leadership, feeling valued and 
recommending the Group as a great place to work. 
Additionally staff turnover dropped by 6.8 
percentage points year-on-year.

Investment case
Our key competitive advantages position us  
well to meet near-term challenges and realise 
long-term opportunities.
1.  Nationally recognised market leader in 
Personal Injury
2. Strong value set 
3. Trusted brands 
4. Multi-channel fulfilment model
5. Technology-enabled proposition
6. Experienced leadership team
7. Careful financial management
Group and employee support enabled us to 
contribute over £65,000 to our chosen charities 
across the business. This once again reflects the 
caring culture of our organisation and the high  
level of engagement from our teams.
Outlook
Within PI the pace of regulatory implementation 
has been frustratingly slow, causing continued 
market uncertainty, but we have been very active  
in adapting and developing our business model in 
preparation for the changes. 
Our policy remains to increase investment in self 
processing. Whilst this results in some profits and 
cash being returned over future years as cases 
settle, it inevitably impacts returns during the next 
18 to 24 months as the initial investment continues 
to be made. However, we remain firmly of the view 
that the PI market, despite the well publicised 
regulatory changes of the last few years, remains a 
valuable market to operate in, particularly so for 
NAH with its long history, brand strength and deep 
understanding of the marketplace. 
Properly served, the PI market is still able to 
generate attractive returns provided the operating 
model is cost-effective and case screening is 
rigorous. Increasing our own involvement in the 
end-to-end economics of a PI case enables us to 
leverage our know-how to maximum advantage 
and allows us to absorb the potential impact of the 
small claims and whiplash reforms without 
significant disruption to the business.
Critical Care has established an excellent pipeline 
of business with some significant new contract 
wins. Whilst work continues to convert the 
opportunity into instructions we remain confident 
in the outlook for this division.
Residential Property has managed the headwinds 
of a downturn in the market well. In the short term, 
it is difficult to see the market improving, therefore, 
our focus is on growing market share through a 
number of business development initiatives.
Due to a lack of opportunities aligned with our 
business strategy, we paused our acquisition 
strategy in 2017 but continue to monitor the market 
for suitable small-scale, earnings accretive 
acquisitions to bolster our existing operations.
Whilst there is, undoubtedly, much work to do I am 
confident that we have the strategy and team in 
place to achieve our aims and I am excited by the 
challenge of the year ahead.
