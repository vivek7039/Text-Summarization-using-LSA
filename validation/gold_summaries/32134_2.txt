A great British food company
As one of Britain’s biggest listed food companies 
we’re committed to the UK, employing over 4,000 
dedicated colleagues at 15 manufacturing sites 
and offices up and down the country. More than 
97% of what we sell is made in the UK from quality 
ingredients, wherever we can sourced sustainably 
from British suppliers and farmers. We’re also working 
hard to expand internationally by finding new markets 
for our brands around the world.  
Expanding internationally
Our International business is expanding rapidly.  
We’re finding increasing consumer interest in our  
Mr Kipling and Cadbury cake brands and Sharwood's 
cooking sauces in a number of markets including 
Australia, the USA and the Middle East. And we 
continue to focus on building momentum closer  
to home in Ireland.  
Strategic partnerships 
Since we entered into a co-operation agreement 
with Nissin Foods in 2016 we've launched Batchelors 
Super Noodles in a new pot format using Nissin’s 
noodle technology and manufacturing expertise, 
taken on distribution of Nissin’s Soba brand of 
noodles in the UK and we’re now working with Nissin 
to expand international opportunities for our brands 
using Nissin’s global network.
In May 2017, we signed a non-binding Heads of 
Terms with Mondelez International for a Strategic 
Global Partnership for Cadbury cake. Once finalised, 
this agreement will extend the Group's long-standing 
partnership for at least another five years and be 
expanded to cover a total of 46 countries with the 
potential to use additional brands.
Our key customers are the major UK supermarkets but we also serve a wide 
range of other channels including: discounters; convenience stores; online; 
wholesale and food service.
