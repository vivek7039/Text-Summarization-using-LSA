Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
The year to 30 June 2017 was transformative for GBGI, with 
the strategic progress made by the business over the years 
reflected in a successful listing on AIM in February 2017.
The Group has successfully carved out a differentiated 
niche in the global benefits market, offering the global 
reach of the multinational insurers combined with the 
flexibility and customer responsiveness of local brokers 
and managing agents. This differentiated proposition, 
underpinned by our international network of distribution 
partners, has propelled the ongoing growth of the 
business. We are careful to ensure that the levels of 
customer service exceed expectations and by operating 
across the value chain we seek to maintain close control 
over the service.
Over the past year we have benefitted from our focus 
on niche markets underserved by our competitors, 
and remain the only insurer quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange that derives all of its revenues from 
the international medical, life, disability and travel 
insurance markets.
Strong financial performance
Gross written premiums (“GWP”) grew 19.4 percent to  
$183.5 million, driven by moderate rate increases and 
growth in policy count. An increase in the business we 
retain on balance sheet, underpinned by our consistent 
loss ratio track record, drove higher net earned premiums, 
up 29.3 percent to $91.4 million. Overall net revenues grew 
24.2 percent to $134.3 million.
Our commitment to delivering underwriting profit to our 
reinsurers enabled by the quality of our underwriting 
operations and data history, led to continued strong 
insurance profits for the year. With the business growing 
rapidly we are focused on ensuring the appropriate level 
of investment in the operational infrastructure of the 
business. Investment in operations, including in staffing 
levels and training, led to the expense ratio increasing to 
29.6 percent (FY 2016: 28.6 percent). This investment in 
growth will enable our growth plans to be undertaken 
from a position of platform strength. EBITDA in the year 
was $13.6 million, a growth of 10.6 percent during the year. 
Profit before tax increased 29.8 percent to $13.9 million 
(FY 2016: $10.7 million). Profit attributable to the Group 
after tax increased 29.8 percent to $13.5 million (FY 2016: 
$10.4 million).

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our underlying basic EPS was $0.18. This is a strong 
performance achieved against a backdrop of the 
successful IPO project. It is pleasing to deliver good returns 
for our shareholders whilst allowing for future investment 
and growth.
A more detailed commentary can be found in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 07 to 09.
A landmark year
The year to 30 June 2017 marked a number of important 
strategic milestones for the business. The Group was 
admitted to trading on AIM in February 2017. We increased 
our global reach by adding territories and deepening 
our operations in existing territories. We built out our 
managed service offering, a new revenue stream for us, 
and underpinned our risk profile via our strategic 
reinsurance agreement with AXA.
Admission to AIM
Our admission to AIM was an important milestone for 
the business. GBGI was originally founded in 1981. The 
Group has evolved in this time, growing in a controlled 
manner and establishing an international footprint 
without incurring a global fixed cost base. 
Obtaining a public listing was important for us on a 
number of different levels, not least via the £32 million of 
capital raised to support expansion opportunities, but 
more fundamentally, as recognition that GBGI is a leader 
of standing and substance in the international benefits 
market. The listing has improved our corporate governance 
procedures and transparency of performance and 
position, factors welcomed by our regulator, ratings 
agency and commercial partners. Finally we were able 
to welcome new shareholders onto the register and 
I look forward to maintaining a close dialogue with our 
shareholders going forward.
Maximising our reach
In April 2017 we announced a new strategic partnership 
with a new Georgia-based insurance company. This new 
business, JSC Risk Management and Insurance Company, 
will target corporate insurance sectors both in Georgia and 
across Central and Eastern Europe. Whilst GBGI is already 
active in over 120 jurisdictions, we continually assess 
and conduct due diligence in territories where we are 
not currently active to determine if it’s appropriate for 
shareholders to allocate resources and capital. I’m pleased 
with the progress made in Georgia and it is a market 
demonstrating real potential.
In addition to entering new regions we also seek, where 
appropriate, to maximise opportunities in existing 
markets. The Group reaffirmed its position in Latin 
America and the Caribbean as a leader in the IPMI 
(International Private Medical Insurance) market. In 2017, 
the Group experienced solid revenue growth and 
profitability in the region, its largest geographical market. 
Building upon our established brand and track record, 
GBGI has expanded its product footprint, targeting the 
corporate market in particular. We can clearly see the 
opportunities for further product and territory penetration 
in Latin America and we will seek to deliver on these 
opportunities whilst delivering a consistently high level 
of service to customers. 
New income streams
Extending the product offering also presents a strategic 
growth opportunity and the Group acquired Quality 
Health Management (QHM), a Florida-based third party 
administration (TPA) firm in January 2017, as a complement 
to its GBG Assist business. The latter was launched in July 
2016, providing worldwide customer support with access 
to assistance on a wide range of medical services, from 
basic enquiries to emergency medical situations, 24 hours 
a day and in over 180 different languages. Whilst GBG 
Assist services Group customers, it also offers its services 
to third parties under the QHM brand. The business has 
performed very well in its first year of operation and offers 
tangible growth opportunities, with low capital input.
Strategic partnership with AXA
In Q4 2016 the business signed a strategic partnership 
agreement with the global insurer, AXA. AXA is now the 
sole quota share reinsurance provider for the business. 
In addition to a fundamentally sound balance sheet 
position, AXA also presents GBGI with a number of new 
business opportunities notably by providing access to 
fronting arrangements, broadening the Group’s footprint. 
I’m pleased to report that the partnership has started to 
yield positive results and is testament to GBGI’s standing 
in the market.
The listing on AIM has improved our corporate 
governance procedures and transparency of 
performance and position, factors welcomed by our 
regulator, ratings agency and commercial partners. GBGI Annual Report 2017 06
Strategic Report
TieCare International
The Group’s educational division continued to perform 
well, cementing its positioning as a market leader in its 
segment. In the fiscal year, TieCare hit a new high in annual 
premium ($27.1 million) after completing its largest 
international school account sale. The division currently 
works with more than 150 international educational 
groups, a record for the Group. TieCare works primarily 
with U.S.-centric international schools, and is planning 
to redeploy marketing resources to move into additional 
educational segments and offer a broader product 
portfolio in 2018.
Benefitting from underwriting excellence
Over recent periods the business has sought to leverage 
its underwriting approach, agility and proven track record 
by retaining more of the risk it writes on balance sheet. 
In the year to 30 June 2017 we retained c. 84 percent 
of the medical, life and disability business we wrote. 
Our underwriting performance is such that this has been 
a significant driver of profit growth, with our underwriting 
result contributing significantly to our operating profit. 
We are careful to maintain the diversified nature of the 
book by both distributor and geography and we envisage 
a stable retention level of 84 percent looking forward.
Commitment to our customers
The foundations of our business have been built on 
ensuring we always deliver the highest levels of customer 
service. Our claims services are often needed at times of 
stress and hardship, and we remain committed to ensuring 
our customers are supported and cared for wherever 
in the world they may be. The growth of our in-house 
GBG Assist operations and our acquisition of QHM are 
testament to our investment in and commitment to 
ensuring the best possible outcomes for our customers. 
Regulation and compliance
Our view is that the regulatory oversight across all our 
markets will continue to evolve. We monitor and evolve 
our risk and compliance activities to ensure we operate 
effectively and correctly.
Our people
As GBGI has expanded we have welcomed many new 
colleagues. Our aim is to attract and retain the best talent. 
We now have some 302 colleagues and a culture that 
prioritises diligent, results-driven and collegial working 
practices. I would like to thank all our colleagues for their 
efforts during the year and subsequently.
Outlook
As increased globalisation and migration foster the 
long-term growth of the international benefits insurance 
sector, we have a number of strategic initiatives in place 
to build on our position. We see the opportunity to expand 
our Life and Disability business, and have recently hired 
a new vertical leader for this product. We continue our 
expansion plans in the student, travel and short-term 
medical markets which demonstrate strong demand 
characteristics. We are very well placed to leverage our 
flexible international operating base and strong funding 
position to continue to write profitable business. We 
approach 2018 and beyond with confidence in our ability 
to continue to deliver for our shareholders.
Summary
We will continue to enhance our position as a leading 
provider of global benefits insurance, globally. We start 
FY 2018 from a position of strength. We have a proprietary 
network of multi-year relationships with distributors 
worldwide, proven underwriting capability and 
performance and the balance sheet strength to grow 
the business whilst maintaining our dividend policy. 
We are continuing to invest in the operations of the 
business to ensure we can deliver on our growth 
aspirations in an efficient, compliant manner. Our 
profitable, cash generative model continues to deliver, 
giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on our targets.
