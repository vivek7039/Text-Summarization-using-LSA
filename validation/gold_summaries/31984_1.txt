CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Caroline Connellan Chief Executive
Introduction
Having taken over as Chief Executive 
of Brooks Macdonald in April 2017 , 
I am delighted to present my first 
report covering a year when we have 
continued to deliver strong 
underlying Group performance, 
although statutory profit has fallen 
principally as a result of the 
previously announced provision for 
legacy matters . As a result of the hard 
work and dedication of all our staff 
under Chris Macdonald’s prior 
leadership, I have joined a business 
that is well positioned in the market 
and I intend to build on this 
strong foundation .
Since my arrival I have had the 
opportunity to visit each of our offices, 
meeting many of the advisers we 
partner with as well as spending time 
with our people, listening and learning 
about the business first-hand . I have 
been particularly impressed by our 
culture with its strong emphasis on 
client relationships and service . This 
has been fundamental to our growth 
to date and it will remain central to our 
success going forward . I would like to 
thank everyone at Brooks Macdonald 
for making me feel welcome and Chris 
for his support during the handover .
Discretionary fund management is 
our core business and we will be 
looking for opportunities to grow it 
further, including enhancing our 
offering and service levels, as well as 
continuing to adapt – given the fast 
changing external environment – to 
retain our strong market position . We 
have already announced additional 
investment in our regulatory and risk 
management capabilities to build a 
stronger platform both now and for 
delivering sustainable growth in the 
future . Pursuing greater efficiency in 
the business is another of my priorities 
in order to continue to improve our 
margins . This focus on our core 
offering and our drive to improve 
margins has also led to the agreed sale 
of Braemar Estates, our property 
management business, expected to 
complete by the calendar year end .
Growth in funds under 
management and 
underlying profit
A conducive market environment for 
risk assets continued through the year 
with interest rates across the 
developed world at highly 
accommodative levels and inflation 
subdued . There were bouts of 
volatility stemming from political risk 
including the negotiations around 
Brexit, and the UK, US and French 
elections, although any equity market 
sell-off was short lived . Bond returns 
were more mixed with the US Federal 
Reserve’s decision to increase 
US interest rates weighing on 
sentiment . Within the UK, equities with 
As we continue to invest in the Group, I look forward 
to building on our success to date and positioning the 
business to deliver growth into the future.  04  |  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 continued
Growth in funds continued
international earnings benefitted from 
sterling weakness whilst those with a 
domestic focus underperformed as 
real wages fell . With heightened 
valuations across equity markets, 
geo-political risks and central banks 
tapering asset purchases, we reduced 
our overweight position in equities 
and rebalanced client portfolios 
accordingly . Within the non-equity 
space we have reduced our bond 
holdings given the uncertainty over 
future interest rate levels and central 
bank policies . 
Against this backdrop, the Group 
maintained momentum throughout 
the financial year, achieving annual 
growth in our discretionary funds 
under management (“FUM”) of 25 . 9%, 
to stand at £10 .5bn at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £8 . 3bn) . Of the £2 . 2bn increase, 
£1 . 0bn (11 .5%) was net new business 
and £1 . 2bn (14 .5%) was investment 
performance . As a comparison, the 
FTSE UK Private Investor Balanced 
Index increased by 10 .5% over 
the year .
Underlying profit before tax for the 
year was £18 . 4m (2016: £15 .5m), an 
increase of 18 . 6% on the previous 
year, representing an underlying 
profit margin of 20 . 1% (2016: 19 . 1%) . 
Underlying earnings per share also 
increased by 31 . 7% to 115 . 76p (2016: 
87 . 92p) . While this is a strong result for 
the underlying business, statutory 
profit before tax for the year fell by 
49 . 3% to £8 . 0m (2016: £15 . 9m) 
predominantly due to the provision 
for legacy matters detailed below, as 
well as amortisation and an 
impairment to the goodwill recorded 
for the Levitas business, although the 
latter is more than offset by a 
reduction in deferred consideration . 
A full reconciliation of underlying and 
statutory profit can be found in the 
Strategic Report, and segmental 
information on underlying and 
statutory profit is given in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements .
Review of business 
performance and development
UK Investment Management 
continues to be our largest and most 
profitable segment . We have 
maintained strong new business 
flows, largely driven by our close 
relationships with advisers . We 
remain confident in the growth 
opportunity and believe there 
continues to be significant scope to 
increase the breadth and depth of our 
adviser relationships and benefit from 
the continuing trend of professional 
intermediaries outsourcing 
investment management .
We continue to add value through our 
centralised investment process, with 
portfolios across all risk mandates 
achieving above-benchmark returns 
according to Asset Risk Consultants 
(ARC) private client indices over one, 
three and five year periods . In 
November we were, for the second 
consecutive year, awarded the 
prestigious industry Gold Standard 
Award for service in discretionary 
fund management and we were once 
again proud to receive five star ratings 
from Defaqto for each of the main 
discretionary offerings: our Bespoke 
Portfolio Service (“BPS”), direct 
Managed Portfolio Service (“MPS”) 
and our platform MPS . We were 
successful at the Citywire Regional 
Star Awards in 2017 , with professional 
advisers voting for our Leamington 
Spa and Tunbridge Wells offices as 
winners of their respective 
geographical categories . We thank 
our adviser partners for their 
continued support .
Our UK BPS, a premium and fully 
personalised offering to private 
clients, charities and pension funds 
now represents £6 .5bn (62 . 3% of FUM) 
and remains our principal offering . 
The pension opportunity, in particular 
Self-Invested Personal Pensions 
(“SIPPs”), continues to be significant, 
as does the growth of ISAs and our 
AIM Portfolio Service . We expect to 
be able to offer Lifetime ISAs to 
clients shortly .
Our UK MPS, consisting of ten 
portfolios with distinct risk profiles 
and objectives, is available to those 
investing smaller amounts and allows 
our investment management 
capabilities to be accessed by a wider 
range of individuals through their 
financial advisers . Assets now exceed 
£1 . 2bn (11 . 6% of FUM), held either 
directly with us or through a platform . 
Our MPS proposition has seen rapid 
growth throughout the year, a trend 
that we expect to continue as the 
popularity of model multi-asset 
portfolios continues to grow .
As a Group, we have maintained the 
focus on our Strategic Alliances which 
form a major part of our approach to 
the adviser market . We are pleased 
that we have completed two further 
Strategic Alliances, including our first 
international partnership with Abacus 
Financial Consultants based in the 
UAE . In the UK, we were co-founders 
of the DFM Alliance, a joint initiative 
with other leading discretionary fund 
managers offering advisers a platform 
for improving client outcomes 
through information, education and 
collaboration . We have also continued 
to invest in our geographic footprint of 
offices across the UK to deliver high 
service levels to our local adviser 
partners and I am delighted to confirm 
that we opened a new office in Cardiff 
in July 2017 , allowing us to access new 
growth opportunities in a region we 
have not previously been able to 
serve fully .
Our Funds business passed the £1bn 
milestone of FUM, enjoying its most 
successful year to date and generating 
a profit for the first time . It remains our 
intention to complete the previously 
announced move of the Funds 
business into Investment 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW

Chief Executive’s review
 continued
Review of business continued
Management this financial year, subject 
to regulatory approval . The IFSL Brooks 
Macdonald Defensive Capital Fund, 
within the targeted absolute return 
sector, celebrated an impressive 
seventh anniversary year, with FUM 
reaching £393m as at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £223m) and now over £425m . 
The fund received several positive 
ratings in 2017 , including an Elite Rating 
by FundCalibre and Five Crowns by 
Financial Express (FE) Crown Fund 
Ratings based on its performance . Our 
Multi-Asset Funds also saw significant 
growth during the year . Earlier this 
year, the partners of North Row Capital 
LLP, in which the Group held a 60% 
stake, decided to terminate the fund, 
resulting in an impairment loss of 
£0 . 2m (2016: £0 . 4m) .
Our International business based in 
the Channel Islands delivered good 
growth, with discretionary FUM 
increasing by 13 . 4% from £1 . 3bn to 
£1 .5bn over the past year and having 
doubled since acquisition in 2012 . 
Whilst we have seen local professional 
intermediary relationships impacted to 
some extent by the legacy matters 
referred to below, the successful 
restructuring of BM Retirement 
Services International (“BMRSI”) to a 
restricted financial planning business 
in the Channel Islands, the expansion 
of our distribution efforts to include 
international advisers and our work to 
build business flow from South Africa 
have all borne fruit this past year . 
We have now largely completed the 
move away from advisory work and 
our discretionary fund management 
offering has performed well, winning 
the award for Best International 
Discretionary Fund Manager at the 
International Fund and Product 
Awards . Together with the actions we 
are taking to deal proactively with the 
legacy matters, we start the coming 
year in a stronger position .
Financial Planning also had a strong 
year, driven in part by a number of 
one-off pension advice opportunities, 
generating record revenue and profits . 
We continue to focus on delivering a 
comprehensive independent financial 
planning service to private clients and 
on seeking new opportunities to 
support future growth .
Sale of our Property 
Management business
We recently completed a review of 
Braemar Estates and have taken the 
decision to sell the business, enabling 
us to focus more closely on our core 
offerings . This will allow us to operate 
with a more streamlined business and 
will contribute over time to improved 
margins . We exchanged contracts on 
20 September 2017 and on completion 
of the sale, which is expected by the 
calendar year end, the Group’s property 
management division will cease to 
exist . Investment management of the 
Ground Rents Income Fund will be 
retained by Funds .
In the financial year completed, 
Braemar Estates represented 3 . 2% of 
the Group’s revenue (£2 . 9m), 0 . 7% of its 
underlying profit (£126,000), 1 . 4% of its 
statutory profit (£112,000) and -0 . 6% of 
its net assets (Braemar has net liabilities 
of £0 .5m) . The sale price is £1 . 9m, with 
an initial 50% to be paid on completion 
and the remainder deferred, payable 
over a two-year period from the 
completion date .
Legacy matters arising from the 
former Spearpoint business
As announced in July, following a 
detailed review, we decided to deal 
proactively with certain legacy matters 
arising from the former Spearpoint 
business which we acquired in 2012 . 
These matters relate to a number of 
discretionary portfolios formerly 
managed by Spearpoint, now managed 
by our International business, and a 
Dublin-based fund, for which 
Spearpoint acted as investment 
manager . While we accept no legal 
liability, we have a deep commitment to 
treating customers fairly and seeking 
to protect our clients’ best interests . 
We believe that by taking this action it 
will assist us in building stronger 
relationships with professional 
intermediaries in the Channel Islands 
and their clients . We are now in contact 
with the relevant parties . We anticipate 
that this action will cost £6 .5m and 
have made a provision for it 
accordingly . As this is an exceptional 
cost it is not included in our underlying 
profit for the year . 
Investment in our infrastructure
Our IT system development was 
delivered as planned at the end of 
June 2017 . This involved the migration 
of data from two legacy systems in the 
Channel Islands on to a common 
platform shared with our UK portfolio 
management business . As part of this 
process we consolidated our two back 
office functions into one, based in the 
City of London, to serve all clients of 
the Group moving forwards . As a 
consequence, our Guernsey-based 
back office will close in September, 
resulting in the redundancy of the 
impacted staff . The redundancy costs 
were provided for in the financial year 
completed . Some further post 
migration work remains, which will 
complete by the calendar year end .
We are continuing to review the 
opportunity to align and simplify 
processes and take further actions to 
deliver economies of scale as the Group 
grows . We will continue to invest 
further in our infrastructure to support 
our investment teams, to enhance 
our service to clients and to facilitate 
the ease of interactions with the 
intermediaries we work with, as well 
as delivering broader efficiencies . 
The appointment of a Chief Operating 
Officer will be an important step in 
ensuring we can grow our business 
materially and sustainably, whilst 
pursuing greater efficiency and 
progressively improving our margins .

Investing in our risk 
management framework
The investment management industry 
is currently experiencing a period of 
significant regulatory change and the 
Group has been preparing for the 
introduction of MiFID II, Senior 
Managers and Certification Regime 
(“SMCR”) and the General Data 
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), 
amongst other changes . Extension of 
the SMCR to investment firms is 
expected in 2018, with the Group 
included within the ‘Enhanced Regime’ 
as we are now categorised as a 
significant investment firm for 
prudential purposes under FCA rules . 
This categorisation has also increased 
the regulatory reporting requirements 
for the Group more broadly .
Given this context and to position 
the business for future growth, it is 
important that we now invest more 
broadly in our regulatory and risk 
management capabilities . We 
announced in July an increase in our 
capabilities, including the appointment 
of a Chief Risk Officer, to provide the 
support needed to our investment 
teams and ensure that we can continue 
to meet and exceed the expectations of 
our clients and regulators, as well as the 
aforementioned plan to appoint a Chief 
Operating Officer . This will result in a 
much stronger platform for delivering 
sustainable growth in the future . 
These investments are expected 
to result in additional operating 
expenditure of approximately £4m 
in the next financial year, of which 
approximately £2m will recur in 
subsequent years .
Outlook
As we continue to invest in the Group, 
I look forward to building on our 
success to date and positioning the 
business to deliver growth into the 
future . To achieve this, our principal 
focus will be on delivering value for our 
clients and partners through enhancing 
the services we provide, improving 
business efficiency and continuing to 
adapt to the fast changing competitive 
and regulatory environment .
During the financial year we have seen 
further consolidation across the sector 
given the need for investment in 
technology and in response to 
regulatory changes . We expect this to 
continue as companies seek scale and 
cost savings . We strongly believe in our 
future as an independent discretionary 
fund manager and will continue to look 
at acquisition opportunities when they 
arise, to complement our organic 
growth plans .
We have started our new financial 
year with positive momentum and 
we look forward with confidence 
notwithstanding our relative caution 
around markets and client sentiment .
I would like to reiterate my thanks to 
everyone at Brooks Macdonald for their 
welcome, and for their hard work and 
commitment to the business .
