We will continue to build the 
foundations for future dividend 
progression.
Chairman’s statement
Whilst political and economic 
uncertainty was a signiﬁcant distraction 
for the markets in the year, the attraction 
of secure income continued to grow. 
Not only are we living in a low growth, 
low interest rate environment but ageing 
demographics are accentuating the 
search for income and alternatives 
to low yielding government bonds. 
This need has already risen substantially 
and will grow further in the years 
to come. High quality companies 
offering well-covered and growing 
dividends ought to become ever 
more highly prized.
Our signiﬁcant and increasing 
investment in distribution is delivering 
excellent returns, sustainable income 
growth and long term value for our 
shareholders. The sector is beneﬁting 
strongly from structural support as 
UK consumers continue to migrate 
to online. Conversely, physical retail 
continues to face signiﬁcant challenges 
from this online shift with the inevitable 
space overcapacity this brings to the 
retail market. 
This ongoing structural demand for 
distribution and lack of meaningful 
supply has given us the conﬁdence 
to increase our investment across 
all distribution sub-sectors of mega 
box, regional and urban logistics. 
We continue to see good investment 
and short cycle development 
opportunities, particularly in urban 
logistics, and we have now fully 
committed the proceeds of our recent 
equity placing into sensible, accretive 
assets. Our distribution exposure is 
expected to exceed 70% within the 
current ﬁnancial year.
Exposure to the best real estate sectors 
is driving demand for our space 
resulting in high occupancy, good like 
for like income growth and strong ERV 
uplifts. Our sector leading portfolio 
metrics have been maintained thanks 
to our strong occupier and property 
relationships. Over the last four years, 
through management activity, our 
occupancy level has been above 
99% and our unexpired lease term has 
remained at 12.8 years with only 1% of 
our leases due to expire within the next 
three years. 
Our predictable, repetitive and growing 
income streams have allowed us to 
progress the dividend again this year by 
3.4%. An attractive dividend needs to 
be adequately covered by operating 
earnings and I’m pleased that we have 
maintained the 1.1x dividend cover we 
achieved last year. 
We will continue to build the 
foundations for future dividend 
progression. Contractual rental uplifts 
are embedded in over 50% of the 
portfolio, we are achieving strong rent 
review uplifts and are adding new 
income from short cycle developments. 
LondonMetric is well placed and I 
am genuinely excited by its outlook 
and look forward to the year 
with conﬁdence.

Our objective is to own good assets with strong 
real estate fundamentals. They must generate 
income in excess of our dividend and have 
a higher value in ﬁve years’ time.
