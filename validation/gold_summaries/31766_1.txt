 ASOS PLC 20
ASOS is delighted to report record sales 
and profit for the year to 31 August 
2017 in line to marginally ahead of 
expectations. The Group retail sales growth 
of 34% to £1,876.5m (2016: £1,403.7m) 
was once again driven by strong product, 
proposition improvements and further 
price investments across major markets. 
As previously noted, the continuing FX 
tailwind enabled reinvestment at a faster 
rate than initially planned. 
Retail gross margin increased by 10bps to 
48.6% (2016: 48.5%) as price investments 
in the US, Europe and some RoW territories 
were offset by a higher full price mix. 
Delivery receipts grew 18% aided by 
higher next-day delivery usage and the 
expansion of Premier globally. 
Continuing profit before tax and 
exceptional items grew by 26% to £80.0m 
(2016: £63.7m). 
The successful rollout of ASOS’s new 
technology platform delivers micro-service 
architecture with fully native mobile 
experience in android and iOS apps and 
a vastly improved all new checkout. The 
platform allows for significantly greater 
transaction volume at enhanced levels 
of stability. A critical benefit of the new 
platform is the increased ability to deliver 
technical change and innovation at pace; 
the number of technology releases this year 
surpassed expectations at 1,300 vs. 490 
in the prior year. The coming year will see 
a further acceleration in velocity, delivering 
many more customer enhancements, new 
payment methods, new language sites and 
stronger customer engagement. 
ASOS continued to increase capacity 
and efficiency at Barnsley, successfully 
transitioned to phase 1 of the new 
Eurohub 2 fulfilment centre with ongoing 
work to further double its capacity and 
automate its operations. In August ASOS 
signed a lease for a new fulfilment centre in 
the US, which is expected to be operational 
by Autumn 2018. The investments ASOS 
is making across logistics will lay the 
foundations for a c.60% increase in unit 
capacity and c.£4 billion of net sales. 
Our global potential 
ASOS continues to see considerable 
opportunity across key markets. The global 
apparel market continues to undergo 
significant channel shift, with growth online 
outstripping the overall market. Online 
penetration will continue to increase and 
ASOS is well placed to capitalise on this 
shift in customer behaviour. 
In the UK, the online apparel market has 
grown at more than twice the rate of the 
overall apparel market across the last five 
years. ASOS’s consistent double-digit sales 
growth has continued to surpass growth  
in the online apparel market in all of our 
key territories.
ASOS’s market share of online sales 
remains modest particularly in international 
markets. ASOS will continue to invest 
to grow the business at pace to take 
advantage of the global opportunity.
Our unique product — 
Creating and curating the most 
relevant product for fashion-loving-
20-somethings
ASOS offers customers the greatest, most 
relevant choice of fashion at the right price 
whatever their shape, size or style. The 
ASOS Brand is positioned alongside a 
curated edit of the best third party brands, 
sourced from across the globe. Sales of 
ASOS Brand account for c.41% of sales. 
Newness is important to our customers 
and is a key differentiator of the ASOS 
offering. Each week c.5,000 new styles are 
launched with c.85,000 products in stock 
at any one point in time. 
The brand portfolio continues to evolve. 
Almost 200 new brands were introduced 
during the year whilst a similar number 
where edited out. The combination of 
ASOS Brand and exclusive collaborations 
with brands leads to c.60% of ASOS 
product only being available to customers 
through the ASOS sites, an additional point 
of differentiation.
Building on last year’s launch, ASOS 
is accelerating its activewear offering, 
with football and golf ranges now 
accompanying a greater choice of true 
sports performance wear including gym, 
run and yoga. The ASOS 4505 activewear 
range will launch in 2018 along with range 
extensions into snow and surf.
Last month ASOS relaunched ‘Face + Body’ 
which establishes ASOS as a destination for 
all things face, body, skin and hair. Initial 
reaction has been very positive in a market 
that is predicted to be worth £450bn p.a. 
globally by 2020. 
ASOS’s longstanding ‘Fashion with 
Integrity’ initiative encompasses nine 
principal aspects of ethical trading. This 
initiative is ambitious and is driving 
behaviour across the business. This covers 
fundamental human rights and ASOS has 
published a statement on modern slavery, 
become a signatory to the UN’s Women’s 
Empowerment Principles and recently 
signed a global framework agreement 
with IndustriALL, the world’s largest trade 
union organisation representing 50 million 
workers in the retail sector. Publication of 
ASOS’s full factory list for the first time also 
improved transparency of the supply chain. 
‘Fashion with Integrity’ ultimately aims 
to ensure that the production of our 
products minimise negative impact on the 
environment. ASOS joined the Sustainable 
Apparel Coalition, giving ASOS insights 
CEO’S OPERATIONAL REVIEW ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 21
into environmental management systems 
across water and chemical management. 
The Group reached 70% full traceability 
across the viscose supply chain, allowing 
ASOS to identify risk hotspots associated 
with certain viscose producers. ASOS 
signed the Cotton Communique with the 
Clarence House International Sustainability 
Unit, committing to 100% sustainably 
sourced cotton by 2025 and are on track 
to hit a sustainable cotton target of 70% for 
2017. ASOS also signed the Commitment 
to a Circular Fashion System (Global 
Fashion Agenda, Copenhagen) to support 
in the transition to a ‘circular business’.
ASOS views its commitment to ‘Fashion 
with Integrity’ as a critical investment in the 
future of the business. Our twentysomething 
customers care deeply about ethical and 
environmental issues as does ASOS.
Our best-in-class proposition — 
Offering a friction-free experience 
at every stage of the journey
Brand experience
Significant investments during the year 
have driven strong engagement levels 
across ASOS’s customer base. Site visits 
increased by 24% year-on-year; average 
order frequency improved by 5%; average 
basket value increased by 2% alongside a 
20bps improvement in conversion. Active 
customers are now at 15.4m, representing 
a 24% increase since last year. ASOS 
continues to invest in and evolve its UK 
loyalty programme which is successfully 
driving increased purchase frequency and 
reduced rates of churn.
ASOS is continually striving for new ways 
to engage with its customer demographic, 
such as a focus on students with a calendar 
of acquisition and engagement activity 
aimed at growing penetration of this global 
population. ASOS’s ‘hero’ campaign 
successfully reached students on campus and 
online in the UK, USA, France, Germany, 
Australia and Italy. The student discount 
proposition was extended into eight new 
markets with plans to further develop this 
programme during the current year.
ASOS maintained investment in relevant, 
emerging content formats like cross-channel 
video. Our videos were viewed more than 
66 million times, a doubling on the prior 
year. ASOS continues to experiment with 
pioneering advertising trials across key 
international markets, on the platforms that 
matter most to fashion-loving-20 somethings. 
This activity is already driving heightened 
engagement across multiple territories.
ASOS is continually finding fresh ways 
to engage with both new and existing 
audiences, including two initiatives, 
‘Fashion Discovery’ and ‘ASOS Supports 
Talent’. ‘Fashion Discovery’ is an annual 
competition to discover and nurture the 
freshest UK fashion talent. ‘ASOS Supports 
Talent’ helps up-and-coming creatives to 
realise an important, culturally significant 
project by giving them funding, mentoring 
and a platform to showcase their skills. 
Delivery and returns
ASOS continually enhances delivery and 
returns options, maintaining a best-in-
class customer proposition with over 200 
improvements implemented over the last 
twelve months.
ASOS’s Click & Collect delivery proposition 
has now been expanded globally, UK total 
coverage increased to 9,000 locations 
with an improved Next Day order cut off of 
7pm, whilst Click & Collect launched into 
Italy and the United States in September, 
giving an additional 11,000 collection 
points across those two territories.
During the year improvements were also 
made to Next Day and Standard Delivery 
propositions. Internationally, ASOS now 
offers tracked Standard Delivery services 
to a total of 61 countries across the world, 
and within the UK, Saturday was added 
as a Standard Delivery promise. Next Day 
Delivery weekend ordering cut-off has been 
extended to 8pm in the UK and a Saturday 
order cut off for Monday delivery has been 
introduced into a number of key European 
territories, giving the customer an extra 
24 hours for Monday delivery. 
For the year ahead, an Evening Next Day 
Delivery service will be launched into 
Germany’s major cities whilst ASOS Instant, 
ASOS’ same day delivery service, has just 
launched in London, with further UK cities 
to follow. Nominated Day Delivery will also 
be launched throughout the EU, allowing 
customers to select their preferred delivery 
date. There will be continued expansion of 
Click & Collect points globally, targeting 
the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, 
Sweden and Australia. 
Customer care
A key differentiator for ASOS is providing 
best-in-class service for customers 
throughout their entire ASOS experience. 
ASOS offers customer support 24/7 365 
days a year across email, live chat, social 
media and telephony in nine languages. 
ASOS continues to maintain strong service 
levels, responding to all emails within one 
hour, all social media communications from 
customers within 15 minutes and all live 
chats or telephony calls within 30 seconds.
ASOS recently moved to a new 80,000 
square feet Customer Care site in 
Leavesden, North Watford and are on 
track to complete the site during the 
first half of the new financial year. This 
investment in infrastructure and technical 
capability cost £11m and supports the 
ever growing customer base and allows in-
sourcing of all Customer Care operations, 
improving the quality of the service and 
also reducing cost.

Warehousing
Investment in our site in Barnsley continues, 
with a fifth packing module currently being 
commissioned. Live testing is now underway 
and it will be fully operational for the 
start of the peak trading period. This will 
provide additional capacity for Black Friday 
volumes as well as supporting future growth. 
Planning permission for a small office 
extension has been granted and building 
works will commence in the next few weeks. 
Eurohub 2, our warehouse in Berlin, 
was opened at the beginning of March 
and has quickly grown its volumes, now 
fulfilling c.95% of all EU orders. The local 
stockholding is now over 7.5m units and 
will grow to around 9m units in readiness 
for peak trading this year. The Phase 2 
extension of Eurohub 2, which will double 
the square footage of the fulfilment centre, 
is on track with first deliveries of automation 
equipment expected shortly. The first phase 
of Automation is expected to go live by the 
end of 2018.
In addition to the existing US operation in 
Ohio, ASOS signed a lease for an existing 
1 million square foot building located 
near Atlanta, Georgia. Fit out commences 
shortly and the facility is expected to be 
operational by Autumn 2018.
Technology
During the year, ASOS significantly 
ramped up the pace of both technology 
investment and implementation. At the start 
of the year ASOS completed the roll out of 
a new digital platform across all territories. 
This new platform is the backbone of the 
ASOS customer experience on both sites 
and apps. The new platform delivers 
micro-service architecture with fully native 
mobile experience in android and iOS 
apps and a vastly improved, all new 
checkout. The new platform handled 
record volumes of transactions during 
peak trading period, which at one point 
reached 33 orders per second. 
A critical benefit of this new platform is the 
enhanced ability to deliver technological 
change and innovation at pace. During 
the year, ASOS developed and rolled out 
over 1,300 individual releases across the 
platform compared to 490 in the previous 
year. The pace of change has exceeded 
expectations, demonstrating the flexibility of 
the new platform and the power of ASOS’s 
growing engineering teams. During the 
year, ASOS added 120 engineers and 
technologists and plans to add a further 
c.200 over the next 12 months as velocity 
and momentum continue to accelerate.
During the first half of the year, ASOS 
completed the development of the global 
fulfilment software changes and technology 
required to open the Eurohub 2 fulfilment 
centre. This new fulfilment software 
was a major change, controlling which 
country sites have access to which stock 
pools, enabling further improvement of 
the delivery proposition for each of these 
countries. During the second half of the 
year this fulfilment logic was used to point 
the German, French, Spanish and Italian 
sites at the Eurohub stock pool. Improved 
conversion aided by better local inventory 
availability was achieved as a result.
Throughout the year ASOS delivered new 
capabilities for customers. Within the last 
six months these have included rolling 
out ApplePay globally; a fully rebuilt and 
refreshed My Account section on sites and 
apps; extension of product recommendation 
algorithms to international sites; a size and 
fit recommendation tool, and a new image 
search capability (Style Match) within 
the iOS app. The migration of content 
management to a cloud based solution has 
also delivered a richer and more efficient 
editorial experience as well as delivering 
content to customers quicker. 
ASOS has just developed and rolled 
out fully refreshed site navigation and 
search as well as category and brand list 
pages. These will improve how customers 
search, browse and explore products 
to support conversion and will further 
improve page download speeds globally. 
Looking forward, ASOS is continuing to 
leverage machine learning and experiment 
with augmented reality, in addition to 
progressing with a ‘Customer Privacy 
Programme’, focussed on delivering an 
open and transparent way for customers 
to manage their privacy needs, ahead of 
regulation that comes into effect in 2018. 
Good progress has been made with major 
transformation programmes including 
the new end-to-end merchandising and 
planning system ‘Truly Global Retail’ 
(TGR) and a new finance system, both of 
which will support ability to buy, sell and 
account for stock in multiple locations 
and currencies. The first output from these 
programmes has already been seen, with a 
new clearance optimisation tool deployed 
to the first wave of categories, in readiness 
for summer sale period. The new people 
and finance systems are expected to go live 
in the first half of 2018. 
ASOS will continue to evolve and innovate. 
Currently ASOS has seven country-specific 
websites. For the first time in four years, 
ASOS will add new local foreign sites, up 
to 13 by the end of FY18, ultimately giving 
the potential to cover all of ASOS’s 200+ 
markets. Additionally ASOS will extend 
its premier proposition to new countries, 
further personalising customers’ experience 
across sites and apps, improving the 
returns and refund experience, extending 
the student proposition to new countries 
and offering online gift vouchers to 
international customers. 
Finally, to further drive global growth, 
ASOS will also launch additional payment 
methods, new language sites and delivery 
propositions.

Power of our people —
Supporting our customers, our  
team and our partners to realise 
their potential
ASOS works hard to protect its special 
culture where colleagues feel valued, 
respected, enjoy their work, understand 
that they make a real difference each day 
and also have some fun along the way. 
ASOS aims to lead the way as a diverse, 
inclusive and inspiring place to work which 
attracts the very best talent. Being true to 
the ASOS values of being Authentic, Brave 
and Creative is at the heart of how the 
business works. 
Everyone who works for ASOS is central 
to the Group’s success. As at 31 August 
2017, ASOS employed 3,579 people, with 
the majority based at our headquarters in 
Camden, North London and the Customer 
Care site in Leavesden, with smaller teams 
in Paris, Birmingham, Berlin, New York 
and Sydney. In FY18 ASOS plans to add a 
further 1,000 people to its team to support 
its accelerating pace of growth.
Attracting talent and investing in 
our people
Attracting, developing and retaining 
the best talent that will thrive in ASOS’s 
fast-paced environment remains a number 
one priority. Over the past twelve months, 
ASOS has strengthened the senior team in 
critical areas with key appointments and 
promotions in Technology, Finance, People 
Experience Team, Supply Chain, Content 
and Engagement, Brand Experience, 
Corporate Responsibility and Legal. More 
widely across the business, apprenticeships 
and internships remain important ways of 
attracting and developing talent and ASOS 
continues to build partnerships with a 
variety of universities and colleges.
Once the best talent has been brought 
on board, the focus is on developing and 
retaining people by offering opportunities 
that match both their professional and 
personal aspirations. ASOS has a robust 
learning offer to support its people 
through their journey at ASOS, offering 
them support to achieve professional 
qualifications, as well as role and 
departmental-specific training in a variety 
of coaching, classroom, psychometric, 
informal and social learning opportunities 
specific to the ASOS culture. 
Investment 
ASOS’s investment in technology and 
logistics is delivering great results and 
is key to sustaining the strong growth 
momentum within the business. ASOS 
anticipates capital expenditure in FY18 to 
be between £200-£220m compared to the 
£168m invested during the year just ended, 
the second year of accelerated capex. As 
always, this investment will be funded from 
internally generated cash alongside existing 
robust cash balances. Whilst the group is 
likely to be free cash flow negative post 
capex in FY18, we expect the group to 
return to positive free cash flow post capex 
from FY19 onwards. 
This accelerated spend will include 
substantial investments into the warehouse 
portfolio including further optimisation 
of Barnsley, automating and extending 
Eurohub 2 and fitting out the US site. These 
investments will lay the foundation for 
c.60% more unit capacity and c.£4bn  
of net sales per annum.
Additionally ASOS will complete 
the implementation of a number of 
transformational technology programmes 
including the new retail and planning 
system TGR along with the finance and 
people systems. The extension and refit of 
the head office in Camden will continue, 
increasing space from 180,000 ft
2
 to 
243,000 ft
2
 which, when combined with 
the very latest technology, will provide 
sufficient flexibility to accommodate future 
headcount growth. 
The rollout of ASOS’s new technology 
platform has enabled deployment of 
enhancements to the customer experience 
at ever greater velocity. The number of 
technology releases this year and the 
positive customer impact it has generated 
has surpassed expectations and ASOS 
will continue to accelerate investment in 
this area over the coming year, delivering 
many more customer enhancements, new 
payment methods, new language sites and 
stronger customer engagement. 
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Our increased sales guidance is 25-
30% for FY18 inclusive of a modest FX 
tailwind, with EBIT margins stable at c.4% 
in line with market consensus. Medium 
term reported sales guidance of c.20%-
25% is unchanged. ASOS expects EBIT 
margins to remain at a similar level into the 
medium term, with operating leverage in 
payroll and distribution offset by ongoing 
investment in technology and warehousing 
infrastructure to support continued growth. 
We are confident we are positioning ASOS 
to be the world’s number one destination 
for fashion loving twenty-somethings.
