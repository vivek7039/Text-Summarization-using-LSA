been a decade of consistent and successful progress 
and we remain on track to achieve the demanding 
targets set at the time of the IPO. Our continuing 
success is a tribute to the long-term nature of our 
strategy, the skills and dedication of our people  
and the ongoing support of our stakeholders.
