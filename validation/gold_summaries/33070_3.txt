 It is a privilege to follow in the footsteps of Sir Christopher Hogg. I am 
grateful for the warm and open welcome I have received from Tom Glocer and
his team and my Board colleagues. I hope to justify their confidence. 
Reuters is one of the world’s great brands. The principles which govern the
company are special. The people who work here are a unique blend. And yet
the business stumbled. But a resolute team has fought back, focused again 
on the core and rebuilt confidence and strength. The benefits of Fast Forward
are clear and will grow. Momentum will be maintained in 2005 but we must
also put in place a strategic framework for sustained growth in the years ahead.
There is growth potential in our core business, in adjacent markets and in new
sectors and geographies. Our task is to identify opportunities which play to
our competitive strengths and encompass risk which we understand. 
In doing so we must start with the extraordinary brand that is Reuters. What
does it stand for today and to what can it realistically aspire? How do we grow
the company to fill the space occupied by the brand? Where are the multiple
skills and special values of Reuters people best deployed? When can this
deliver value to our shareholders and worth to society?
As Chairman, my role is to lead the Board in a manner that allows the CEO 
to run the company effectively. This requires the correct balance between
detachment, thereby avoiding interference, and being sufficiently engaged 
to know when to intervene. Our Board discussions should always be open,
candid and trusting. We must be prepared to challenge, confront, disagree
and probe. But always in a way that is constructive and supportive of the
business agenda. As a Board we should be judged through the sustained
success of the business. I am excited by the challenge, yet humbled by 
the responsibility.
