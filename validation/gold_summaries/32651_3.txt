Chairman’s 
Statement
Results and strategic progress
Crawshaw Group has experienced a challenging 
year but, once the causes of the declining like-for-like 
sales were established, management made rapid 
changes that clearly resonated with customers. As 
a result, we have finished the year with some really 
encouraging sales and margin momentum. As noted 
in our Interim Results, during our period of rapid 
growth, the number of proposition changes we asked 
customers to embrace and a combination of the well 
documented external factors caused a significant 
drop in the trading momentum of the core business 
from the end of H1 and start of H2. The management 
team acted quickly and carefully to restore this 
momentum. This was achieved with a programme 
of broader and deeper promotions and giving back 
the store managers more flexibility to trade their local 
shop to suit their local customers. We are pleased with 
the recent improved trading performance and are 
very encouraged by the momentum that has been 
built up throughout H2, which was reflected in our 
Christmas T rading Update.
The level of sales performance in our like-for-like 
estate necessitated a reduction in the rate of new 
store openings, to both free up management time 
to recover sales in the legacy estate and to maintain 
the strength of the balance sheet. We opened 11 new 
stores in the year (9 in H1 and 2 in H2) and this takes 
the total organic growth so far to 17. In the period,  
one of our legacy market shops closed as part of a 
council town centre regeneration scheme resulting  
in an estate of 49 stores at 29 January 2017.
 
In the period under review, the Group delivered total 
sales of £44.2m, an increase of 19%. This converted to 
an Adjusted EBITDA of £1.3m (2016: £2.6m) as lower 
sales and subsequent margin investment temporarily 
reduced the EBITDA generation of the legacy business. 
The Group made a loss before tax of £1.4m (2016: loss 
of £0.3m).
Cash
The cash position of the business continues to be 
robust with £2.1m cash on hand at the year-end (2016: 
£4.9m) with the pace of new store rollout and levels of 
central resource all being balanced with maintaining a 
strong balance sheet. The reduction in cash is entirely 
growth plan driven with £2.9m of capital expenditure 
invested in new stores in the year. The cash generated 
from operations funded payment of the final dividend 
declared last year.
“The performance of the business has now 
been stabilised, having restored the level  
of sales and customer numbers”
Outlook
I have been very impressed by the way Noel and 
the management team have carefully but swiftly 
taken the appropriate corrective actions during this 
challenging period. For this reason, the performance 
of the business has now been stabilised, having 
restored the level of sales and customer numbers 
respectively. Coupled with the expected recovery in 
margin and the full benefit of the cost saving actions 
flowing through, the business has returned to positive 
cash generation.
Crawshaw has demonstrated its ability to manage a 
major change agenda in parallel with evaluating the 
ongoing potential of our store rollout programme. 
We therefore remain encouraged and confident in 
the scalability of the model, and with the business 
returning to a cash generative position, we look to 
continue with a disciplined opening programme.  
As noted in our Interim Results, of particular interest 
and significance is the strength of performance of  
our fresh meat factory shops. Whilst we remain 
completely committed to the high street, shopping 
centre and market location stores, the factory shop 
concept is proving to deliver significantly better 
financial returns with its higher sales, lower operating 
costs (no hot food-to-go offer) and lower fit out costs. 
The two new factory shops that opened in the year 
have further demonstrated the success of the concept 
which has helped shape our thoughts for the rollout 
strategy for the year ahead. And so our store rollout 
program will focus on this concept.
Since the end of the financial year, the business has 
continued to improve, with Group sales up 9% and 
LFL sales of -4.6% in the first ten weeks. We have also 
signed the lease on another factory shop unit which 
we expect to be trading by the end of May, and have 
a number of opportunities in the pipeline to open 
across the rest of this financial year.
The Board are committed to ensuring cash is available 
to fund the growth strategy and maintaining a strong 
balance sheet. In line with this, the Board has decided 
that no dividend payment will be made at this time
