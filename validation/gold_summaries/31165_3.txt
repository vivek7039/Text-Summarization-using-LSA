Empresaria Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
The Group has delivered 
another record year of profit. 
Our business model and 
strategy is delivering 
consistently, with 18 quarters 
of year-on-year net fee 
income growth for the period 
to December 2017 . 
As well as the growth in profit, our 
diversification across sectors and geographies 
helps to reduce risk and insulate the Group 
from difficulties in individual markets.
Empresaria is a global business, operating 
from locations in 20 countries. Whilst global 
reach is clearly important, local focus is key 
with our management teams running their 
businesses in alignment with local market 
conditions and opportunities.
As part of our strategy to develop leading 
brands, we invest to help them develop and 
take a leading position within their niche 
sector area of expertise. It is important that 
each brand has the potential to develop 
within the Group and where changes are 
needed, we identify and implement them. 
In line with this ethos, we ended 2017 with 
18 brands, having merged two brands and 
exited from another. The Board sees good 
opportunities for growth across the Group 
and we will continue to invest in our brands 
to build capacity and coverage.
The market
As we enter 2018 the worldwide economic 
conditions are largely positive, with 
synchronised growth forecast for the 
first time since the global financial crisis. 
The main markets that we operate in are 
expected to grow, and this includes the 
UK where we continue to operate under 
a cloud of Brexit uncertainty. We are seeing 
candidate shortages across our markets 
and regions. We play a vital role in helping 
client companies find the right resources 
they need to grow.
The positive economic outlook suggests 
a good year ahead for the staffing sector, 
with “Staffing Industry Analysts” forecasting 
6% growth in the global staffing sector in 
2018. Against this is ongoing geo-political 
uncertainty, which could derail growth in 
any territory, as well as the impact of new 
legislation in our markets, with particular 
changes in Germany and Japan impacting 
the temporary staffing markets in 2018. 
Our diversity puts us in a good position 
to both manage the impact of localised 
issues and make the most of positive 
market conditions.
People, values & culture
The Board has over 100 years of combined 
experience in the staffing industry and 
during the year we took steps to strengthen 
the board with Spencer Wreford taking 
on the role of Chief Operating Officer. 
We look forward to welcoming Tim Anderson 
to the board as Group Finance Director 
by the end of March 2018.
As we have continued to invest in our 
brands, the average number of staff across 
the Group in the year has increased to 
1,367 (2016: 1,282). The success of the 
Group is down to the hard work of every 
one of them and the Board would like to 
thank each individual for their contribution 
to our success.
A key part of our business model, and 
one that aligns key operating company 
management and Empresaria shareholder 
interests, is subsidiary management equity, 
where management hold shares in their 
operating companies. This approach helps 
Empresaria to attract and retain the best 
people. At the end of the year we had 
51 management shareholders owning 
shares in the operating companies they 
are responsible for.
It is important for businesses to have a clear 
vision to help frame all decision making and 
identify priorities for investment. We operate 
in a people business and our purpose is 
to help people to achieve their potential, 
whether this is our internal staff who can 
develop meaningful careers within the 
Group, our candidates who we help to find 
work, or our clients who we help to identify 
the best candidates.
We operate with a decentralised structure, 
with local management responsible 
for running their businesses but clear 
governance and control oversight from 
the centre. We believe in a strong and clear 
governance approach and expect high 
standards and compliance across the 
Group. Our culture is based on shared 
ownership and reward. We are a Group 
of like-minded people with a passion for 
helping people realise their potential.
We take stakeholder engagement seriously. 
We have regular communication with 
Group companies and staff through our 
newsletters, we present to investors to 
explain our strategy and results, both 
to institutional investors and private 
shareholders and we engage with 
regulators and Government agencies 
both directly in response to consultations 
or proposals and through our membership 
of worldwide trade associations.
Shareholder returns
The Group has delivered six consecutive 
years of double-digit growth in adjusted 
diluted earnings per share as we look 
to build a sustainable business for the  
long-term benefit of shareholders and other 
key stakeholders. The adjusted measures 
exclude amortisation, exceptional items, 
profit or loss on business disposals and 
fair value charges on equity instruments. 
We use the adjusted measures as we 
believe they reflect the underlying trading 
results and are measures typically used 
by investors and the analyst community. 
The Board has reviewed the dividend and 
in line with our progressive dividend policy, 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, 
we propose an increase of 15% to 1.32p 
per share (2016: 1.15p per share) to be 
approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. The dividend will be paid 
on 31 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register on 4 May 2018.
