CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Dear fellow shareholder
During the year we have made great progress on our three-year vision 
and are now well positioned to deliver the key aim of accelerated 
growth in all three business divisions.
Food intolerance
 – Expansion of Foodprint
®
 in key market segments is going to 
plan with new accounts expected to start delivering significant 
revenue streams over the next few years. Our R&D team in Ely 
are also making great strides in terms of implementing process 
improvements to allow us to handle the increasing demand 
and deliver key improvements to our customers.
 – Partners in China have been identified and work on the lengthy 
registration process will commence in this financial year.
Allergy and autoimmune
 – Allersys
®
 – 41 allergens CE-marked and we are making substantial 
progress with the next phase of development with a further eleven 
allergens optimised. We believe we have now agreed the main 
outline terms which should enable the formal contract 
negotiations with IDS to proceed.
 – Allergodip
®
 – 80 allergens have now been optimised and 
ongoing work continues with the development of a mobile 
phone app ahead of the initial launch of panels later this year. 
Infectious disease
 – VISITECT
®
 CD4 – Achieved our key milestone of design freeze 
by the end of March 2017 and it has now entered the validation and 
verification phase which is currently progressing to plan. 
 – Pune facility has CE-marked three malaria rapid tests and first 
commercial sales in both India and export have been achieved. This 
is a great example of everyone involved in the project – from India, 
South Africa and the UK – all working together to achieve the 
project goals.
Core business
Segmental revenue performance
Food intolerance
The Food intolerance division has again performed well, producing 
double-digit growth. For this year, total Food intolerance sales 
increased by 13% to £8.00 million (2016: £7.06 million).
Sales of Food Detective
®
 reduced by 10% in the year to £2.06 million 
(2016: £2.29 million). As noted in the half-year results, we took 
a conscious decision to reduce pipeline stocking in two of our 
key markets.

Strategic Report
Sales of Genarrayt
®
/Foodprint
®
 reagents grew by 34% to £4.67 million 
(2016: £3.47 million), with strong performances in Europe, North 
America and the Middle East. The Group sold a further eight 
instruments in the year, taking the cumulative number of installations 
to 176 instruments in 40 countries, and revenue per instrument 
(excluding Spain) increased by 29% to £23,442 (2016: £18,175). 
The higher percentage growth rate of reagent sales (as compared 
to the overall growth in revenue per instrument) reflects the investment 
that was made into newer North American and Southeast Asian 
markets in the previous year and these markets are seen as an 
increasingly important area for long-term growth. 
Our CNS laboratory service showed an increase of 7% in sales to 
£0.62 million (2016: £0.58 million). Sales were still dominated by 
the markets in the UK and Ireland and we produced and sold 
7,167 patient reports in the year (2016: 7,008), maintaining an 
average price of £86.44 per report (2016: £82.73).
Food intolerance will continue to be a key growth driver and 
contributor to the bottom line. This has been reflected in the 
increase in operational and marketing resource to provide high 
level scientific and technical support for the CNS product range. 
The growth trajectory is expected to continue, with this core business 
supported by increasing the range of products and services in the 
health and well-being market, which now extends to 80 countries.
Allergy and autoimmune
Sales for the Allergy and autoimmune division are comprised 
of Allergy sales of £3.03 million (2016: £2.57 million) and sales 
of Autoimmune products of £0.56 million (2016: £0.59 million), an 
overall increase of 14%. The Allergy sales continue to be derived 
almost exclusively from our Omega Diagnostics GmbH business 
in Germany, where our domestic sales increase of 3% in euro 
terms is a positive contrast to a recent history of decline due to 
reimbursement pressures. In reported sterling terms, the increase 
was 15% due to the weakening of sterling against the euro 
throughout the period. 
Allergy development
Following the CE-marking of 41 allergens in October 2016 we have 
continued to develop further tests to increase the available menu. 
A further eleven allergens have been optimised, so we are on target 
to deliver another 20 allergens this year.
In addition to the Allersys
®
 programme, four new Allergodip
®
 
panels have now been optimised. The introduction of a mobile 
phone app that allows quantification of the test result will assist 
in the marketing of the test to resource-poor countries with limited 
laboratory facilities. 
Infectious disease 
Infectious disease sales increased by 5% to £2.65 million 
(2016: £2.52 million) with the increase due to the weakening 
of sterling against the euro and dollar throughout the period.
We were pleased to announce the launch of the VISITECT
®
 
Malaria range of rapid diagnostic tests:
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf (detection of HRP2 antigen 
in P. falciparum);
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf/Pan (detection of P. falciparum,  
non-P. falciparum or mixed infections); and
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf/Pv (detection and differentiation 
of P. falciparum and P. vivax).
30 years 
of Omega  
Diagnostics 
This year marks the 30-year anniversary since I formed the 
Company. It has been a real mix of excitement and challenges 
and some disappointments, of course, but over the 30 years 
it has been an absolute pleasure to experience Omega 
corporate life and the science that we use on a daily basis, and 
to create and investigate new opportunities and interactions 
with so many people around the world. We are now moving 
into an accelerated growth phase and we have some very 
exciting times ahead of us.

Infectious disease continued
In the development of the VISITECT
®
 Malaria range we have a 
defined strategy to provide affordable but high quality tests that 
are designed with the user in mind. The devices are easy to use 
and come equipped with all the necessary components to run the 
tests effectively at the point of care. The range is generating good 
interest via business-to-business channels and at the same time we 
continue to work on in-country product registrations and successfully 
achieving global regulatory standards that will enable us to include 
the range in high volume public sector tender exercises.
In addition to the malaria rapid tests we are also evaluating additional 
rapid tests for dengue, syphilis, leptospira, brucella and S. typhi.
Global health update
The past year has seen significant progress in the development of 
VISITECT
®
 CD4, the world’s first semi-quantitative, instrument-free 
rapid test for assessing CD4 baseline status in people living with HIV. 
Having achieved design freeze we have moved the test into validation 
and verification to ensure we can manufacture the device in a robust 
and satisfactory manner. This work will be supported by external 
evaluation testing at HIV laboratories in Glasgow and London that, 
if successful, will allow us to commercialise the product.
The landscape for CD4 testing has changed over the past 
six months; amongst key opinion leaders and policy makers 
there has been a shift in the strategy for utilising CD4 testing 
in the care of people living with HIV. This has resulted in a series 
of regional workshops being held across the African continent 
that Omega Diagnostics has been invited to attend and participate 
in. The resulting output from these activities will see an increasing 
emphasis being placed on CD4 testing to help those people who 
present for care in the advanced stages of the disease with very 
low CD4 cell counts. This group of patients represents more 
than 30% of the overall HIV epidemic. In the advanced stages 
of HIV, patients are increasingly at risk of developing opportunistic 
infections that can dramatically reduce life expectancy. We are 
evaluating opportunities to bring other rapid tests to the market 
that will complement VISITECT
®
 CD4 in helping public health 
practitioners combat HIV in low and middle-income countries.
In our efforts to make Omega Diagnostics a key supplier in the 
global health arena, we have worked hard over the past year 
to redefine our marketing materials with this audience in mind. 
In addition, we continue to develop simple but effective training 
tools that will benefit our customers who use our products in 
remote settings.
Outlook
Food intolerance continues to keep up its good performance 
and we expect to see this continuing in the year ahead with the 
strategic marketing initiatives being planned and executed as 
part of our accelerated growth strategy.
With renewed effort with regards to our ongoing relationship 
with IDS we are looking forward to the eventual launch of the 
initial range of CE-marked Allersys
®
 tests. Expanding the test 
menu as currently envisaged will only help to increase sales 
of these products in the new financial year and beyond. 
We are looking forward to reporting good sales progress over 
the coming year, together with our continuing goal of delivering 
VISITECT
®
 CD4 to the market by the end of this calendar year.
I would like to thank all the Group employees who have made 
great efforts throughout the year in delivering progress in our core 
areas of activity. We are all looking forward to a year of growth 
and further progress.
