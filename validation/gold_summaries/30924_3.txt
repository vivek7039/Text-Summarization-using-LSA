ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
CHAIRMAN’S REPORT    
I am pleased to present this Annual Report to shareholders for the financial year ended 31 December 2017, 
which was a critical period in Allied Minds’ development.
In March 2017 the Board appointed Jill Smith as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Jill’s extensive 
leadership experience, including most recently as CEO of DigitalGlobe where she led the business to growth 
and a successful IPO, is well-aligned with our overarching priorities at Allied Minds: to deliver shareholder returns 
by driving commercialisation and monetisations at our key subsidiaries, and building a growth engine of new 
investments. The substantial and decisive actions undertaken since her appointment position the Group well to 
deliver against these priorities.
In the first half of the year, the decision was made to rationalise the portfolio of subsidiary companies. This was 
completed after careful review of the capital requirements, competitive position and market opportunities facing 
each company. Since then, capital and management resources have been redirected to the most promising 
subsidiary businesses in the portfolio. Greater discipline is being exerted in the management and support of 
the portfolio, through more effective boards and greater accountability and transparency. The result is that our 
subsidiary businesses are operating with substantially greater focus, energy and urgency and are well-positioned 
to achieve the goals set.
After a year of focusing primarily on driving value from the existing portfolio, in 2018 we look forward to returning 
to opportunities to build and support new businesses. The same discipline brought to company operations is 
being applied to our new investment strategy. It is designed to seek out technology and innovations aligned to 
investment theses that are grounded in Allied Minds’ depth of experience and access, in particular with medical 
institutions and federal laboratories, and working in regulated industries and with the US Government.
Together with the Board, I am satisfied that as a result of actions undertaken in 2017 to rationalise the portfolio, 
improve capital allocation and operational discipline and bring renewed focus on commercialisation and 
monetisation, Allied Minds is in a stronger position today than it has ever been.
Non-Executive Director Rick Davis will retire and not seek re-election at the AGM to be held in May 2018 
after completing over seven years of service to the Company. We have greatly appreciated his dedication, 
experience, wealth of knowledge and insights he brought to Board deliberations over his years of service on the 
Board.
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our management team and staff for 
their hard work and commitment.
