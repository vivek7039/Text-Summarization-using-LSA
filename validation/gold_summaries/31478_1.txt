 Chief Executive Officer’s Review
A strategy that 
delivers real results
“ We believe it’s the Tiny 
Noticeable Things that 
our people do which 
make the difference 
to our customers’ 
experience”
Our Strategy
2017 has seen the Group make great 
strides in delivering on our strategy and 
vision to be “The Best Place to Watch 
a Movie”. 
Our strategy is to:
Æ Æ deliver the best cinema experience 
for all cinemagoers every time – give 
our customers a choice of how to 
watch a movie, with a range of retail 
offerings, all underpinned by the best 
customer service;
Æ Æ be technological leaders in the 
industry – to offer the latest audio 
and visual technology;
Æ Æ expand and enhance our estate – 
to provide consistent, high quality, 
modern cinemas; and, 
Æ Æ drive value for shareholders – by 
delivering our growth plans in an 
efficient and effective way.
An overview of our key achievements 
in 2017 is provided below.
Customer Experience
We want to provide our customers with 
a choice of how to watch a movie. Our 
cinemas offer up to six different formats 
of how to watch movies: regular screens, 
3D, 4DX, IMAX, Superscreen and VIP 
offerings. Through both our expansion 
and our refurbishment programme, we 
are focused on ensuring as many of our 
sites provide a range of these formats for 
our customers.
We believe it’s the Tiny Noticeable Things 
that our people do which make the 
difference to our customers’ experience. 
We want to ensure our customers return 
to our cinemas again and again. We are 
very proud of our internal training 
programmes. We are committed 
to ensuring our people have the 
opportunity to develop themselves and 
reach their full potential. We continue to 
nurture our talent and promote internally 
wherever possible.
Integral to our people strategy is our 
fair wage policy – we are among 
the highest payers in the industry 
and we pay more than our statutory 
obligations, across all age groups and 
in all territories.
As well as developing our exhibition 
offerings and ensuring first class 
customer service we continue to pay 
particular attention to our retail products 
and services. Our on-site concessions 
aim to be best in class, providing a 
variety of food, drink and snack options. 
During 2017, the Group has opened five 
new Starbucks coffee outlets in the UK, 
in Hemel Hempstead, South Ruislip, 
Solihull, Basildon and Leeds, taking the 
total number to 29 at 31 December 2017. 
We have expanded the number of VIP 
locations where customers experience a 
premium offering from the moment they 
walk through the door. A VIP ticket 
includes access to a private lounge 
ahead of the movie screening where 
customers can enjoy unlimited buffet 
food, popcorn and soft drinks before 
watching the movie in a dedicated 
auditorium with luxurious reclining seats. 
Three new VIP locations were opened 
during the year in Zichron (Israel), 
Chodov (Czech Republic) and Wroclaw 
(Poland). At 31 December 2017 we had 
12 VIP locations across the Group.
Our membership schemes, the most 
significant being the Cineworld Unlimited 
programme, continue to provide our 
customers with a range of benefits, and 
are one of the pillars of our strategy for 
growing revenues and admissions. The 
schemes also bring operational benefits 
by encouraging repeat visits, often at 
off-peak times. The Unlimited 
programme was launched in Poland at 
the end of 2015 and has performed 
strongly during 2017.
Our wider communities are also 
important to us. Every year we 
undertake a range of activities and 
initiatives with charities, schools and 
community groups. We were proud to 
partner with the BBC’s Children in Need 
fundraising initiative for the second year, 
where we raised over £450,000.

p23 Resources and Relationships
Technology and Innovation
We continued to invest in the latest 
audio and visual technology to ensure 
we remain fit for the future. In 2017 
we opened a further 11 4DX screens, 
seven in the UK and four across the 
ROW, two IMAX screens, one in the 
UK and one in the ROW, and two 
Superscreens in the UK. Many customers 
have now experienced 4DX in the UK 
since we launched the first screen in 
Milton Keynes in 2015. The 4DX 
experience is constantly evolving to 
give cinema-goers an even more 
immersive experience. 
In the UK, more tickets are now 
purchased online than in our cinemas, 
with 20% of the online purchases being 
made on mobile applications. 
Expansion and Refurbishments
We opened nine additional cinemas, a 
total of 109 screens, during 2017, four in 
the UK and five in the ROW. 
One year on from the acquisition of the 
five Empire cinemas we have completed 
the refurbishment of Hemel Hempstead, 
which now includes a Starbucks, and 
Basildon, which now has a 4DX screen 
and a Starbucks, and we have started 
work on the Leicester Square and 
Bromley sites. 
We have continued to proactively 
manage our existing estate through our 
refurbishment and selective site closure 
programme. During 2017 we completed 
four refurbishments in the UK and two 
in Poland. At the year end there were a 
number of refurbishments ongoing, 
including two in London, in Leicester 
Square and The O2. 
During 2017, we closed three sites, two in 
the UK (Chelsea and Stockport) and one 
in the ROW (MOM Park, Hungary) as the 
lease terms expired and it was not 
commercially beneficial or feasible to 
renew these leases. We also handed over 
the Haymarket site in the UK to Empire 
as part of the agreed 2016 Empire 
acquisition consideration. 
We have a further 75 screens scheduled 
to open in 2018. New sites will be opened 
across both the UK and ROW. 
Value for Shareholders
The cash generative nature of our 
business underpins our business model. 
Our priorities for the use of our cash 
have remained consistent: to invest 
in the business to support growth in 
revenue and earnings, for selective 
merger and acquisition opportunities 
and to grow the dividend. During 2017 
we have been able to reward 
shareholders with growth of 12.3% in 
the rights adjusted, adjusted diluted 
earnings per share. The Group 
maintained its dividend pay-out ratio 
for another year, increasing the full 
year cash dividend paid by 14.5%. The 
proposed final rights adjusted dividend 
is 3.1p per share.
Future Outlook
Towards the end of 2017 we announced 
the Regal acquisition which completed 
on 28 February 2018. Cineworld Group 
is now the second largest circuit in the 
world operating over 9,500 screens in 
almost 800 locations in ten countries. 
Although a huge challenge, we as 
management are confident that our 
team together with the Regal team will 
successfully lead the Group to new 
achievements. Through our success and 
experience in the UK we have learnt and 
proved that the potential in a mature 
market is at least as big as in the 
emerging markets.
The US is the biggest cinema market 
in the world and we believe that by 
combining new sites with refurbished 
sites to enhance the “cinema experience” 
for our customers this new addition will 
be a great success. In addition we are 
finalising our integration plan which has 
already started, and we are confident 
in achieving our goals on both sides of 
the Atlantic.
Through the year the media paid a lot 
of attention to the early P-VOD release 
period, known as the “window”. Despite 
many rumours and much speculation 
it seems now that most of the big 
players in the industry support and 
believe in the importance of the cinemas 
being the platform to exclusively release 
movies. I believe the studios will continue 
to provide great content, while our 
commitment is to provide the 
infrastructure and the great service that 
will keep the big screen as the best way 
to watch a movie. 
There is a strong movie slate for 2018, 
which includes “Jurassic World: Fallen 
Kingdom”, “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes 
of Grindelwald“, “Avengers: Infinity War”, 
“Incredibles 2”, “Mamma Mia! Here We 
Go Again”, “Solo: A Star Wars Story”, 
“Deadpool 2”, “Fifty Shades Freed”, 
“Mary Poppins Returns” and many more.
Without our motivated and engaged 
teams we would not be able to achieve 
our vision to be the “Best Place to 
Watch a Movie”. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank the whole 
Cineworld team for their continued 
hard work and dedication across all 
departments and territories during 2017. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
alongside the existing and enlarged 
team in 2018.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Market Drivers
Addressing our biggest 
opportunities and challenges
Market drivers What is happening? The impact How our strategy is optimised to respond
Technology and 
innovation
Developments in technology have brought new innovative 
audio and visual experiences to the cinema industry.
Technology impacts the whole customer journey from 
booking tickets to purchasing concessions as well as the 
audio and visual experience. 
The digitalisation of cinemas has resulted in both a greater 
range of films being offered and also the streaming of live 
events such as opera, theatre and ballet.
Investment in technology is key pillar of the Group’s strategy – we want to be 
leaders in this field. The Group was the first to launch 4DX in the UK in 2015 and 
continues to invest and open more 4DX, IMAX and Superscreens every year. 
The Group is continually reviewing and analysing the latest technology available 
to ensure the right technology is selected. 
The Group is also evolving its IT systems to provide customers with the ability 
to book online more easily and through mobile applications.
Property market 
and development
The rate of new cinema openings is often dependent upon 
local market conditions. Planning laws, the economic 
environment and the ability of developers to finance their 
projects are factors which impact on cinema location.
The local market conditions impact the rate and feasibility 
of new openings as well as which sites which can be 
refurbished. 
The Group has been successful in opening 17 new sites over the past two years. 
As the estate is generally older in the mature markets, refurbishment of existing 
cinemas, in particular in the UK, is a key focus for the Group. Where there are site 
closures, especially of older sites in the UK, this also provides further opportunities 
for new investments.
Market maturity Where a market is in the maturity continuum this impacts 
the level and trend of cinema admissions per capita.
The more mature markets such as the UK and Israel tend 
to be characterised by higher admissions per capita, higher 
average ticket prices and a lower population per screen 
ratio. Growth markets have the opposite characteristics 
and provide great expansion potential for the Group. 
The geographic spread of the Group provides diversification benefits and 
opportunities across both the more mature and growth markets. This includes the 
opportunity to open new sites as well as refurbish older sites, particularly in the 
more mature markets where the estate is generally older.
Competing 
media and 
leisure activities
Throughout the decades the cinema industry has always 
faced competition from other forms of media delivering 
content, for example video, DVD and Blu-ray.
Although online streaming and downloading of films at 
home is increasingly popular, an outing to the cinema 
provides a unique experience which cannot be replicated 
at home, especially with superior experiences offered by 
technologies such as IMAX and 4DX. A trip to the cinema 
is a social occasion and watching a movie on a large screen 
with superb sound is attractive to all age groups. Visiting 
the cinema remains a convenient, affordable out-of-home 
activity, especially when compared with other leisure 
activities such as concerts and sporting events.
The Group continues to invest in new technology to ensure the experience is unique 
while remaining an affordable activity for the whole family. Going to the cinema has 
also become more than just watching a movie, and that is why the Group has 
invested in its retail offerings such as Starbucks and our VIP offerings.
GDP and the 
economic 
environment
The cinema industry is dependent on the customer 
choosing to spend disposable income on watching 
a movie.
Value for money remains an important factor and cinema 
has tended to be a less expensive form of entertainment 
in the wider leisure market in which the cinema industry 
competes. Historical trends and patterns show that cinema 
attendance is most closely related to the quality of the 
movies rather than the gross domestic product (GDP) 
of a country.
The Group monitors local and national markets to ensure ticket and concession 
prices remain a competitively priced form of entertainment. The Group invests in 
both the estate and technology to ensure customers receive a positive experience 
during every visit while getting value for money.
Consolidation 
of the industry
The cinema industry globally has recently seen an increase 
in acquisition activity and consolidation within the market. 
In 2016 AMC Entertainment acquired Odeon in the UK and 
the Nordic Cinema Group in Stockholm. In Europe, outside 
of the top four chains, the rest of the market is represented 
by smaller multiplex operators which only operate in one 
or two territories, and independent operators which are 
specific to local markets.
The Group’s strategy includes identifying potential profitable opportunities to grow 
and expand the business. This has included the acquisition of five Empire cinemas in 
the UK in 2016 and the Empire Newcastle cinema in 2017. 
Following completion of acquisition with Regal post year end the enlarged Group is 
now the second largest operator in the world (by number of screens). 
Cinematic 
window
There have been ongoing discussions for a number of 
years about the cinematic window, the period between the 
release of a film in a cinema and on any other platform.
A material reduction in the cinematic window could reduce 
the cinema admissions per capita.
There is no expectation that the current cinema window will significantly change 
in the near future, however, the Group continually monitors the status of this and 
regularly engages with the distributors to discuss this subject.
