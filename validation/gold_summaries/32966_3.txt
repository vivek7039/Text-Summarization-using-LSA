 08 Chariot Oil & Gas Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Overview
While we have seen some recent stabilisation 
in the oil markets, during 2017 the industry 
continued to encounter challenging and 
unpredictable conditions resulting in a reduction 
in global oil and gas Capex and Opex spending 
for a third year in succession. Given Chariot’s 
focus on capital preservation and the steps 
taken in 2015 and 2016 to ensure a robust cash 
position, the Company was again positioned 
to utilise these turbulent times to its strategic 
advantage. Specifically, by investing in the 
technical development of the Company’s assets 
with the acquisition of substantial 2D and 3D 
seismic campaigns at the bottom of the oil 
services market, and in looking to capitalise  
on unprecedented low rig rates for its near  
term drilling campaign. 
The recent disappointing well result in Rabat 
Deep demonstrates the importance of the 
management team’s continued determination 
to build a balanced and sustainable drilling 
portfolio, offering multiple opportunities for 
transformational value. Following the transfer  
of operatorship to Eni in the Rabat Deep acreage 
where the Rabat Deep 1 well was recently 
drilled, Chariot had no financial exposure, having 
achieved its aspiration for zero cost exploration  
in this region. The current market for partnering  
is tougher, but this is balanced by a reduction  
in oil services costs, meaning that Chariot can 
look to retain a greater equity in its assets at  
the point of drilling, especially in light of the 
recent fundraise.
Chariot is now fully funded to operate the drilling 
of Prospect S in Namibia where partnering 
programmes and preparations are underway 
to deliver this high impact well in Q4 2018, with 
optionality to add another two prospects to the 
exploration programme, depending on well 
results and partnering progress. This additional 
prospectivity was secured in 2016 and 2017 with 
further new ventures in Morocco as part of the 
team’s focus on risk diversification and aim to lock 
in additional potential from improved technical 
understanding of near term drilling. This strategy 
was also put into effect in Namibia with a back-in 
option in legacy acreage in the Southern Blocks 
secured in Q3 2017. 
It is with this continued focus on the de-risking 
strategy, governed by a diligent team, supportive 
partners and an effective Board that we hope 
to achieve our goal of discovering material 
accumulations of hydrocarbons.
Robust Financial Position
The Company ended the year with a robust 
balance sheet, with no debt and a cash balance 
of US$15.2 million as at 31 December 2017. This 
was achieved through the management team’s 
continued efforts to protect the Company’s 
strong cash position, supported by prudent 
decisions on expenditure, back costs received 
from its partners, and a reduction in its annual 
cash overheads for the fourth consecutive 
year – now less than half of what they were 
when current management first came to the 
helm. This, in part, has been possible owing to 
the continued impact of the 50% Board salary 
decrease since 2015 as well as the Company 
restructure of 2016. In maintaining capital 
discipline at the centre of our business we are 
able to apply our strategy from a position of fiscal 
strength and have the optionality to invest in 
opportunities as they arise.

Taking a Lead
We have focused core 
commercial, financial and 
technical capabilities within our 
team, ensuring the continued 
growth and forward progress 
of the Company.
Engaging with Shareholders
Communications with 
shareholders are given a high 
priority. We offer regular meetings 
to institutional investors and 
annual general meetings to our 
broader investor community. 
We also host conference calls 
following the announcement 
of interim and final results and 
at other appropriate times.
Managing Risks
We carry out in-depth technical 
reviews in accordance with our 
financial position and portfolio 
direction at quarterly meetings, 
and our committees meet 
regularly to support the delivery 
of best practice corporate 
standards in everything we do.
Supporting Management
We have a small and effective 
Board that provides strong 
leadership – engaging and 
challenging both the executive 
and senior management teams 
across the business in regular 
dialogue and face to face 
meetings.
Our Governance Principles
Successful Placing
Post period we were pleased to receive interest 
from both institutional and private investors  
who expressed a desire to make further 
investment in the Company, and in Q1 2018 a 
placing and open offer raised an additional net 
US$16.5 million. We see this as a sign that equity 
market observers are growing in confidence 
in the oil and gas sector and view Chariot’s 
resilience in the downturn and future exploration 
programme as a robust opportunity for growth. 
Chariot is now funded to operate the drilling 
of Prospect S, Namibia, in the latter part of 
this year, which has a gross mean prospective 
resource of 459mmbbls and a potential upside of 
2.2Bnbbls in other prospects within the licence. 
As a result this investment gives us more fire 
power in our decision making and commercial 
strength in negotiations, particularly with regard 
to capitalising on historically low rig rates and 
ongoing partnering discussions. 
Our Values
Throughout the year and despite a smaller 
headcount, we have maintained our skills 
and knowledge base by retaining the core 
commercial, financial and technical capabilities 
of our team, ensuring the continued growth 
and forward progress of the Company. This 
has been accomplished by having an effective 
Board that provides strong leadership, engaging 
and challenging both the executive and senior 
management teams across the business. 
We carry out in-depth technical reviews in 
accordance with our financial position and 
portfolio direction at quarterly meetings, and 
our committees meet regularly to support the 
delivery of best practice corporate standards 
in everything we do. This is further supported 
by our external advisors with whom we retain 
strong relationships and regular reviews.
This diligence at Board level creates a culture 
that emanates through the rest of the team. 
Long term growth and profitability is enhanced 
when businesses behave in a sustainable 
and responsible manner, with respect to the 
environment, health and safety, and to all their 
stakeholders. In particular, we recognise the 
importance of the work carried out by and 
the continued co-operation, correspondence 
and input of our in-country partners. Regular 
meetings to share technical and operational 
developments within each region facilitate 
communication and processes at all levels –  
from government to local empowerment 
partners and service companies. It is thanks 
to the continued support of these entities, 
particularly the Governments and Energy 
Ministries and their respective national oil 
companies, that Chariot has been able to  
mature its portfolio and seek partnerships  
for the next stages of exploration. We look 
forward to continuing to build on these strong 
relationships as we enter the drilling phase.
Outlook
We will continue to adhere to our core values 
as we look to execute the primary objective of 
creating value for our shareholders by delivering 
the highest quality exploration opportunities. We 
believe that we have built a strong platform for 
long term growth at the same time as offering 
near term, material value triggers. 
Chariot’s continued investment in the portfolio 
during a downturn in the industry means that 
this year the Company will have been exposed 
to two giant-scale wells whilst capturing the 
bottom of the cost cycle for drilling. Although the 
outcome of the Rabat Deep 1 well in Morocco 
was disappointing, Chariot’s risk management 
strategy and recent successful equity fundraise 
means that it is on track and fully funded to drill 
Prospect S in Namibia in Q4 2018 and continue 
the development of the Company’s broader 
portfolio in Brazil and its other Moroccan permits. 
It is an exciting year ahead but, as always, the 
Company will continue to apply risk reduction 
strategies throughout the portfolio due to the 
high risk – high reward nature of its exploration 
programme, as well as the unpredictability of 
the financial and resource markets. With our 
recently bolstered financial resources, supported 
by steps we have taken to ready our business for 
growth, we remain well prepared to capitalise on 
opportunities as they arise.
