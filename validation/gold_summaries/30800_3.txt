 Outlook
It is early days. Our year-end came just 
six weeks after our IPO and as such 
we cannot say much other than that 
we are where we expected to be at 
IPO and that 2017 continued a string of 
successful years. I am encouraged by 
our ability to post such strong results 
despite the major undertaking for 
the IPO. We are on track with the 
commitments made to the market as 
part of the IPO process – in health 
and safety, power plant operations and 
growth through proprietary greenfield 
development and acquisitions. In the 
new year, our announcement of the 
acquisition of a large portfolio of 
Concentrating Solar Power assets in 
Spain reinforces our expectation that 
we are ahead of our target to double 
EBITDA in five years with no new share 
issuances and our pipeline of greenfield 
and acquisition opportunities supports 
this expectation. We move into our first 
full year of operating as a public 
company with confidence about our 
ability to deliver promised results.
The Strategic report on pages 04 to 
47 have been approved by the Board 
of Directors and signed on its behalf 
by Joseph C. Brandt.

and inside the renewable division, 
and are starting to see positive results 
from these measures in early 2018.
Capacity Factors were high in our 
solar fleet, which enjoyed much 
higher irradiation levels than normal 
and overproduced by 11%, while 
capacity factors in our hydroelectric 
facilities were below plan and wind 
performance was close to plan in 
Peru, slightly above plan in Austria 
and below plan in Brazil. 
In 2017, our financial results were better 
than target and displayed the resilience 
of an operations centric business 
model that diversifies risk across 
multiple geographies and technologies. 
By design, ContourGlobal’s financial 
results do not depend upon any one 
geography, technology or weather 
resource. We believe that this 
resilience creates a higher quality risk 
adjusted cash flow for shareholders. 
These diversification benefits were 
on display in 2017 as we were able to 
outperform our adjusted EBITDA target. 
Financial results were strong in all 
areas: revenue topped $1bn for the first 
time ever, an increase of 13% year-on-
year. Adjusted EBITDA and Funds from 
Operations (“FFO”) were $513m and 
$256m, an increase of 17% and 23% 
respectively. As targeted, liquidity and 
year-end net leverage ratio (4.1x) were 
within targeted levels.
Market Outlook and Growth
Our business is international with a 
concentration in three primary regions: 
Europe, Latin America and, to a 
lesser extent, Sub-Saharan Africa. 
We operate in the market for 
electricity generation infrastructure 
and participate in that market through 
our own development (“greenfield” 
development which involves creating 
an asset by taking it through the 
permitting, financing and construction 
processes) as well as the acquisition 
of existing power plants. We operate, 
develop and acquire power plants 
using conventional fuel-based 
technologies as well as those using 
renewable technologies (currently 
wind, solar and hydro). Within both 
categories, we focus on two broad 
categories of customers: national 
grids and the utilities that supply 
these grids, and commercial and 
industrial customers with substantial 
energy needs who prefer to procure 
their electricity supply directly from 
on-site facilities. 
Today’s electricity space is dynamic, 
with new technological and 
commercial approaches creating 
opportunities and challenges in both 
developed and developing markets. 
Within established markets such as 
Western Europe, incumbents have 
embarked upon broad reviews of 
strategy leading to a redefinition 
of their core businesses and 
accompanying divestitures of 
power assets, many of which are 
in markets that we know and like. 
Within developing markets, energy 
demand growth continues to outstrip 
supply and in certain world regions 
such as Sub-Saharan Africa energy 
supply remains woefully inadequate, 
leaving most of the population 
without electricity and its indirect 
benefits (such as clean water and 
stable infrastructure).
Intriguingly, one of our early 
development initiatives has become 
trendy. “Corporate PPAs” have been 
a recent focus of a renewable industry 
in search of new creditworthy 
counterparties to enter into long-term 
offtake contracts to facilitate the 
development of new projects. 
These agreements are generally 
financially settled long-term 
arrangements in which a corporate 
buyer pays a renewable generator 
for electricity delivered to the grid. 
Many corporations are increasingly 
procuring electricity with such 
structures and have grown 
significantly in the past three years. 
A decade ago, our ContourGlobal 
Solutions business was an early 
pioneer of the corporate PPA market. 
Working with Coca-Cola HBC 
(“CCHBC”), we first used thermal 
fuels and then renewable generation 
technologies. We developed highly 
efficient and innovative energy 
production facilities within Coca-Cola 
HBC’s bottling facilities in Europe and 
Africa that supply all of CCHBC’s 
energy needs for electricity, hot water, 
chilled water and, through innovative 
CO 2 capture technology incorporated 
into these power stations, carbonation. 
Later we worked with CCHBC to install 
substantial solar “fields” in Italy on 
the large rooftops housing their 
production and storage facilities, 
installing approximately 4.5 MW in 
five locations, using what today 
would be known as a “Corporate PPA”.
Last year we extended our Solutions 
business into Latin America where we 
acquired four cogeneration facilities in 
Brazil which directly supply commercial 
customers. Through this acquisition, we 
are extending this “what is old is new 
again” business from Europe and Africa 
to Latin America.
As we explore new growth, we 
remain impressed with the number 
of opportunities we see to make 
accretive acquisitions in Europe and 
Latin America, while at the same time 
remaining cautious about the prospects 
to build new generation in these same 
markets. Historically low and extended 
interest rates has led to capital 
deployment decisions in our industry 
that have driven returns on new build 
below that of acquired assets, resulting 
in an historic anomaly in the power 
sector. One should get paid more to 
take the development, permitting and 
construction risk to build a new asset 
than to acquire an already functioning 
business. Such anomalous pricing 
between new build and acquisition, 
renewables and thermal, is not justified 
by technology or cost improvements 
but rather reflects other more strategic 
imperatives. We continue to believe 
that this dynamic creates its own set 
of opportunities. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where we 
have long been active and successful, 
we are cautious outside of the 
industrial space. Despite much of the 
continent making impressive strides 
in governance and reform, the post 
financial crisis collapse in commodity 
prices has pressured the continent 
despite helpful interventions by the 
international development community. 
Although headline investment in new 
electricity capacity seems promising, 
projects across the continent struggle 
to make their way from signing to 
closing to full operations and, once 
operational, pressure on public 
finances challenges fragile states to 
meet their contractual commitments. 
With such a market backdrop we are 
very selective about new investment 
in this region.
Four important projects managed to 
reach critical milestones in the past 
several months. In Austria, the 
repowering of our wind farms began 
with two projects receiving feed-in-
tariff approval enabling them to begin 
repowering – a process that involves 
replacing older wind towers and 
turbines with newer technology. 
These two projects offer a startling 
illustration of the dramatic 
improvements that have been 
achieved in wind turbine technology 
in the thirteen years that have passed 
since these wind farms first entered 
operations. Using the same physical 
footprint as before, new tower and 
turbine technology will enable us to 
capture more wind and thereby 
produce 80% more energy annually 
than what was achievable just over a 
decade ago. We increasingly see the 
opportunities of repowering as a way 
to add value to our own and others’ 
existing assets. 
Elsewhere, across Austria’s southern 
border in Italy, we made good progress 
continuing to consolidate operating 
solar fields in the market, adding 43 MW 
through two acquisitions. We’ve been 
active in Italy for over eight years, 
seven of them in the solar sector and 
have a strong operating team which 
has improved availability, performance 
factor and fixed costs in every single 
acquisition to date. 
Finally, after many years of effort and 
close cooperation with the Government 
of Kosovo and international 
stakeholders, we achieved the critical 
milestone of “commercial close” for the 
Kosovo E Re power plant, a critically 
needed infrastructure project for a 
country that suffers with Europe’s worst 
pollution from two old lignite fueled 
power generation facilities. We will 
replace these facilities with efficient 
facilities, which will provide the 
necessary capacity to enable the 
Kosovarian energy market to develop 
and thereby catalyze economic growth 
in this poor, landlocked country. We do 
not take lightly our decision to sponsor 
a coal fired power plant. It is not our 
preferred fuel. But the needs and 
resources of Kosovo argue 
overwhelmingly in favor of developing 
this plant with this fuel now. Kosovo is 
Europe’s poorest country and its 
current installed electricity generation 
base is Europe’s largest single source 
of pollution including dust, other 
particulate matter, NO X, SO X and CO 2.
ContourGlobal has always viewed 
itself as an investor first – allocating 
capital to attractive opportunities in 
the contracted wholesale power 
generation space. As such, our 
strategy has been highly opportunistic, 
preferring to maximize risk-adjusted 
returns rather than invest in assets or 
development projects that meet some 
pre-defined, qualitative or strategic 
criteria. This has served us well over 
the years and we continue to see 
significant opportunities that will 
enable us to benefit from this 
approach. As an established, and now 
public, operator that has managed 
investor capital in the power business 
for over a decade, we have also 
received interest from institutional 
investors to acquire stakes in our 
existing assets. As we continue to 
grow our business, we see increasing 
opportunities to be the asset manager 
of choice in the global power sector.

Power generation
The electricity value chain has 
four main segments: generation, 
transmission, distribution and retail.
We focus on the wholesale power 
generation segment, both centralized 
and distributed.
We generate power using both thermal and 
renewable technologies.
Thermal and Renewable
On thermal technologies our portfolio includes 
natural gas, liquid fuel and coal. On renewable 
technologies it includes wind, hydro, solar 
photovoltaic and methane.
Contracted
Power generation can be defined as either 
merchant or contracted. Contracted plants 
have minimal exposure to market prices for 
the duration of the underlying contract because 
the price is negotiated and fixed upfront. This is 
done either through long-term power purchase 
agreements (PPAs), which typically have higher 
margins than market platforms, or prices are set 
under a regulatory regime. PPAs also typically 
de-risk the generator from demand volume 
volatility and other changes in market 
conditions such as inflation and changes 
in laws and regulations. Merchant plants 
sell electricity into market platforms at the 
prevailing energy price and are therefore 
subject to price volatility.
We concentrate on contracted 
power generation.
The demand for energy continues to grow 
and the underlying trends characterizing this 
growth fit well with our strategy of focusing 
on long-term contracted power generation 
in key markets around the world.

According to the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 
2017, global electricity demand will 
increase by approximately 45% 
between 2015 and 2040, from 
23.4 TWh to 34.0 TWh, at an 
annual growth rate of 1.5%.
1
The majority of this rise in demand will 
occur in developing markets, especially 
in Asia, Latin America and parts of Africa 
that are experiencing urbanization, 
increasing electrification rates and 
economic and population growth.
Lower growth in electricity demand is 
expected for developed markets such 
as Europe and the United States, due 
to lower economic growth, energy 
efficiency policies and stabilized 
energy consumption patterns.
We expect to benefit from changes 
in global demand, particularly the 
accelerated growth in developing 
markets, as our footprint includes 
developing markets in Latin America 
and Africa. 
We also have the necessary in-house 
operational experience and the know-
how to capitalize on the wide range of 
opportunities in different technologies.
By 2040, global installed capacity is 
expected to increase from 6,383 GW 
to approximately 8,819 GW, with coal 
dropping to approximately 25% of 
the capacity mix as a result of 
decarbonization policies and the 
further increase in renewable 
installations. Renewables are 
expected to account for 42% of 
the global capacity. Natural gas is 
expected to account for 24%, nuclear 
for 6% and liquid fuels for 3%.

Key power market trends
We see certain trends running through the power market that favor ContourGlobal’s disciplined and opportunistic 
growth strategy:
In emerging markets, rapid 
electrification and expanding 
demand result in significant need 
for investment across all types of 
generation, providing interesting 
opportunities for power 
generation players.
Especially in Africa and 
Eastern Europe, there are few 
international operators actively 
pursuing opportunities and we 
expect to grow in these regions 
given our strong operational 
presence, track record and 
ability to creatively structure 
our projects both financially 
and contractually.
In these markets we will continue 
using Political Risk Insurance 
(PRI) to protect our investment.

The generation sector 
in some jurisdictions 
can be micro-cyclical 
driven by economic 
fluctuations, availability 
of domestic capital 
and financing/capital 
markets volatility. The 
fluctuations can create 
a downward or upward 
pressure on returns. 
Remaining flexible 
around geographies, 
associated presence 
in and knowledge of 
high growth markets, 
and creativity on 
structuring projects 
create above market 
returns when 
cyclicality pressures 
returns upwards.
The value of generation assets varies 
over time depending on numerous factors 
including size, geography, technology and 
the differing strategies of potential investors. 
The opportunity set constantly evolves and 
the areas where the best risk-adjusted returns 
appear in the future are likely to be different 
from where they are today.
This gives advantage to investors, such as 
ContourGlobal, with the flexibility to invest 
opportunistically across markets and 
technologies. Our disciplined investment 
framework allows for internal competition 
for capital and the ability to deliver high 
value growth by remaining selective, 
in a very active M&A environment.
Markets periodically 
suffer micro-cyclicality
The changing relative value of 
different generation assets 
creates new opportunities 
for flexible investors
