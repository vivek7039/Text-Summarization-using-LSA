ALAN AUBREY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
2017 has been a significant year for IP Group.  
The underlying business has performed well and there 
have also been a number of individually important 
strategic transactions. The Group completed two 
corporate transactions: the combination with AIM-
listed Touchstone Innovations plc in October and 
the acquisition of Parkwalk Advisors Ltd in January. 
Touchstone Innovations creates, builds and invests in 
technology companies and licensing opportunities 
developed from scientific research from the ‘Golden 
Triangle’, the geographical region broadly bounded 
by London, Cambridge and Oxford and Parkwalk is 
the UK’s leading university spin-out focused EIS fund 
manager. In addition, IP Group completed a placing 
to raise £181.0m of new capital and extended its 
model into Australasia, signing a landmark agreement 
with nine of Australasia’s leading universities: the 
University of Adelaide, Australian National University, 
the University of Melbourne, Monash University, 
UNSW Sydney, the University of Queensland, the 
University of Sydney and the University of Western 
Australia in Australia, and the University of Auckland 
in New Zealand. The Group now has operations in 
three major geographic territories – the UK, US and 
Australasia, a stronger balance sheet and a large and 
diversified portfolio of exciting opportunities.
What are the main benefits of 
the combination with Touchstone 
Innovations?
Our vision is to create an international leader in IP 
commercialisation with an enlarged platform for 
growth and investment. The three most significant 
benefits to the Group of the combination with 
Touchstone are: (1) increased scale and critical mass; 
(2) further diversification of the Group’s portfolio 
in terms of maturity and business sector and (3) 
further access to world-class research, including 
London’s Imperial College and University College 
London. As a result of the transaction, the Group 
now operates the ‘technology transfer operation’ 
known as ‘Imperial Innovations’. It also brings with it a 
number of experienced team members. We continue 
to believe that an ‘industry champion’ will be better 
placed to attract the best university partnerships; 
the best scientific and commercial talent; and a 
broader and deeper pool of investors. By creating 
a stronger, better-resourced company, we can help 
more scientists develop commercial businesses, 
and help prevent the flight of commercially viable 
enterprises that so often has to leave the UK and/
or seek takeover before they have achieved what 
they set out to do. The transaction was declared 
wholly unconditional in October and Touchstone is 
consequently being integrated into the Group.
What is Imperial Innovations?
Imperial Innovations is Imperial College, London’s 
‘Technology Transfer Office’ or ‘TTO’ for short. 
University TTOs are dedicated to identifying 
research which has potential commercial interest 
and to then helping commercialise it. Following 
the Touchstone transaction, Imperial Innovations 
is now a wholly owned operating unit of IP Group 
and effectively gives the Group a direct pipeline to 
the research being carried out at one of the world’s 
leading technical universities until mid-2020. Imperial 
Innovations works with researchers at Imperial 
College London to help develop their novel research 
into new businesses, products or services, supporting 
the process of taking an idea from the lab into the 
market. Imperial Innovations assesses inventions, 
protects intellectual property through patents and 
other appropriate forms of IP protection, provides 
advice on establishing proof of concept and may 
provide development funding or support inventors in 
their applications for funding from other sources. Its 
‘Venture Support Unit’ establishes new businesses, 
finds mentors and management and provides access 
to preferred suppliers, similar in a number of ways to 
IP Group’s existing IP Assist function.

Integration is often a challenge 
with acquisitions. How have the 
first few months worked out with 
Touchstone?
We have been really encouraged by the level of 
engagement and commitment shown by employees 
in both IP Group and Touchstone Innovations. After 
an initial review last Autumn, it was clear that staff in 
both companies felt strongly that it was important 
to start working together as one team as quickly as 
possible and we therefore focussed on making this 
happen. The integration process was overseen by a 
team comprising individuals from both IP Group and 
Touchstone and is now substantially complete. We 
have simplified and streamlined our organisational 
structure by moving to a two-sector model of Life 
Sciences and T echnology and will operate both 
divisions from one central London office. Both the TTO 
and Parkwalk continue to be run as separate entities.
Are there any changes to  
IP Group’s divisional reporting 
following the integration of the 
Touchstone portfolio?
As part of the integration we decided to move 
to a simpler 2-sector model of Life Sciences and 
Technology rather than our previous four sector model 
of Healthcare, Biotech, Technology and Cleantech. 
Going forward, both the Life Sciences and Technology 
sector will be managed as ‘partnerships’, comprising 
a Managing Partner responsible for its overall 
performance with a structure of partners, investment 
directors and managers and analysts specialising 
in particular fields and companies. In Life Sciences, 
the Managing Partner is Dr Sam Williams and in 
Technology, the Managing Partner is Dr Mark Reilly.
How has the Parkwalk acquisition 
helped IP Group’s access to capital?
Founded in 2009, Parkwalk is the largest EIS growth 
fund manager focused on university spin-outs, 
having raised over £175m to date with the majority 
of funds coming from leading private wealth 
platforms and having backed over 80 companies 
across its managed funds since inception. In 2017 
alone, Parkwalk committed over £70m to UK 
university spin-outs investing alongside IP Group, 
Touchstone Innovations, Oxford Sciences Innovation 
and Cambridge Innovation Capital. Parkwalk, which 
recorded a net contribution of £1.6m for the period 
since acquisition, has significant assets under 
management, an experienced team and strong links 
to many of IP Group’s existing university partners. Its 
investment vehicles include the evergreen Parkwalk 
Opportunities Fund, the University of Cambridge 
Enterprise Funds, the University of Oxford Innovation 
Funds and the University of Bristol Enterprise Funds.
What benefits do you expect  
from the recently established 
Australasian operations?
One of the main reasons for selecting Australasia in 
terms of expansion was that it scored very highly in 
meeting our criteria of long-term partnerships with 
leading research institutions alongside access to 
significant pools of local capital with a potentially 
long-term investment horizon. It is still early days in 
the region for us but we now have a team in place, led 
by Dr Mike Molinari, who has been appointed to the 
position of Managing Director. It’s a return to IP Group 
for Dr Molinari who was previously a Director of IP 
Group’s IP Capital business in London. He re-joins 
from Brandon Capital, one of Australia’s leading life 
science investors with >$500M under management, 
where he was an Investment Manager. Alistair 
McCreadie has been appointed Chief Investment 
Officer, Asia Pacific, and Dr Peter Grant, who is IP 
Group plc’s Managing Director for New Business and 
Partnerships, is Chairman of the Australian subsidiary. 
This team will focus on building up the Australian 
and New Zealand operations as IP Group deepens 
its engagement with its nine university partners in 
the region. We have been encouraged by investors’ 
response to the move with new investors including 
Temasek and Telstra both joining IP Group’s share 
register through our fundraising last Summer and 
an AU$100m global co-investment mandate being 
agreed with Hostplus. The team has identified an 
attractive pipeline of opportunities and anticipates 
making initial investments in 2018.
