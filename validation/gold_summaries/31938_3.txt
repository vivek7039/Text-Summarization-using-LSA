Excellent progress, reflected in our 
financial performance 
This financial year has been a year of 
significant progress. We have invested 
in the right activities that best utilise our 
assets and strengths, divested of non-
core activities that lack strategic fit, and 
right sized the operational base of the 
business. We are now seeing the positive 
impact of these actions on our financial 
performance.   
Our focus on investment in our core 
broadcast and telecoms infrastructure 
markets has supported continued growth 
in revenue. Over the last three years we 
have spent more than £500m on capital 
programmes to strengthen and extend 
our infrastructure in support of existing 
and emerging technologies. Much of this 
investment has been up-front, reflected 
in greater investment in assets and 
working capital; however as some of 
these major capital programmes near 
completion, and recurring contracted 
revenues gain significance, we are 
showing strong growth in the operating 
cash generated from the business. During 
the year we completed the divestment 
of our WiFi business which did not form 
a core component of our strategy for 
growth. 
We continue to look to drive efficiencies 
in operational delivery to further increase 
our earnings potential.
‘FutureFit’ programme 
The Group’s ‘FutureFit’ programme, 
launched early in the year, is a 
comprehensive programme changing the 
way we work. It is designed to achieve 
streamlined processes and modernising 
and making our systems more robust, 
resulting in improved customer 
service and operational delivery. In 
addition, with a focus on third party 
expenditure, it will achieve significant 
cost efficiencies and savings with the 
target of gross savings of circa £60m 
per annum by 2020. This is incremental 
to those savings already achieved in the 
previous two financial years. To date, 
good progress has been made and the 
FutureFit programme has delivered over 
£20m of gross annual savings. Further 
discussion of financial performance is 
continued within the financial review on 
page 21. 
Refinancing 
In November 2016 we completed 
the refinancing of our bank facilities 
which included a £353.5m bank term 
loan; capital expenditure and working 
capital facilities, all of which were due 
to mature in February 2018; together 
with our liquidity facility. We extended 
the maturity of our facilities and 
simplified our financing arrangements 
by establishing replacement facilities 
with maturities ranging from June 2020 
to December 2029. In line with the 
financings that have taken place since 
2013, we restructured the interest rate 
swaps linked to the £353.5m bank term 
loan to remove the breaks and match the 
profile of the new debt instruments. 
S&P and Fitch confirmed their rating of 
Arqiva’s senior debt at BBB following the 
establishment of these new facilities.

During the year we welcomed Paul 
Dollman and Neil King to the Board 
and, after close to four years with us, 
Clive Ansell has left to pursue other 
opportunities. We thank Clive for his 
valued counsel. Paul, who is a Chartered 
Accountant and has a wealth of 
experience in senior finance positions, 
joins us as an independent non-executive 
director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Neil was appointed to 
the board by Frequency Infrastructure 
Communications Assets Limited, and 
runs the European Infrastructure business 
at Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board.
Shareholders strategic review  
Earlier this year, Arqiva’s shareholders 
informed the Board that they are 
jointly undertaking a strategic review of 
their investment, which may lead to a 
transaction involving their interests in 
Arqiva. There is, however, no certainty 
that the strategic review will result 
in any transaction. We will make 
further announcements as and when 
appropriate.
Outlook 
Our focused investment in the right 
project has resulted in the Group 
benefitting from another year of 
impressive growth in revenue, earnings 
and cash generation. This, combined with 
the refinancing exercise undertaken in 
the year, leaves us stronger as a business.
With the timing and nature of Britain’s 
exit from the European Union still 
uncertain, I would like to reiterate 
the sentiment from my statement in 
our 2016 annual report. Whilst we 
have an overseas presence, Arqiva’s 
assets, operations and markets are 
predominantly within the UK and our 
business is driven from this region. We 
have minimal exposure to international 
markets and foreign exchange. We 
believe that the critical national 
infrastructure that we provide will 
continue to be in demand; people will 
continue to watch television, listen to 
radio, use mobile devices and consume 
increasing amounts of data. 
Recent Government strategy recognises 
the importance of this critical national 
infrastructure and aims to position 
the UK as a global leader in the next 
generation of mobile technologies and 
digital communications. We fully support 
this vision having, earlier this year, 
announced a partnership with Samsung 
to pioneer the first UK 5G field trials, now 
in operation at Arqiva’s London offices, 
using Fixed Wireless Access in the 28 GHz 
spectrum owned by the Group. 
This is an exciting time for Arqiva and 
I would like to thank all our employees 
across the business for their dedication 
and hard work, which has been central to 
our continued growth and success.
