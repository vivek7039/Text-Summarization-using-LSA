Simon is a big fan of music – and especially 
live music. He has a particular love of U2, 
who he has seen at least six times in four 
different countries. He was present at the Live 
Aid concert, Wembley 1985, and his original 
ticket is one of his most precious possessions.
It has been another good year for Fuller’s with a 
strong set of results for the Company. Food and 
accommodation have driven like for like sales 
growth in our Managed Pubs and Hotels and the 
targeted investments we have made in both new 
sites and redeveloping our existing estate have 
generated excellent returns. We have purchased 
five new sites and completed 25 major 
refurbishments in the last 53 weeks.
Although The Fuller’s Beer Company and our 
Tenanted Inns have had a more demanding year, 
both divisions have made excellent strategic 
progress, developing new plans and laying the 
foundations for future growth. This is not about 
fixing problems, it is about building a clear vision 
with achievable goals to drive these businesses 
forward. We have strong teams in place and 
while this is a long term process, these are 
exciting times for both of these key parts 
of the Company.
When I took over as Chief Executive, I made 
a clear commitment to enhance the way we 
develop our most talented people and build 
succession plans for the future. As a result of the 
great work of our training team, this year 66% 
of our appointments were internal promotions. 
This included the appointment during the year 
of three divisional directors – Liz Peck as Sales 
Director, Paul Dickinson as Director of Food 
and Jane Jones as Director of Marketing. In 
addition, Georgina Young, who originally joined 
Fuller’s as a junior brewer under the tutelage of 
John Keeling, was promoted to Head Brewer. 
We are seeing significant changes to our business 
and the way many of our customers run their day 
to day lives – and we have to adapt accordingly. 
This includes embracing and increasing the way 
we use the digital space to amplify and bring to life 
our long term, consistent strategy. To that end, 
we have a number of different projects underway 
within the business. We are improving the way 
we collect, collate and use the data we generate to 
enrich our distinctive customer experience. Other 
digital led projects will help us build a leaner cost 
base – including investing in a comprehensive, 
far-reaching enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
system. All parts of our business and each element 
of our strategy must accommodate and embrace 
the digital world and the new technologies that 
form a major part of our consumers’ lives, while at 
the same time it is imperative that we do not lose 
the personal touch and excellent face to face 
relationship we enjoy with our customers.
It is important to remember that while our 
strategy is consistent, our business also has the 
flexibility and capability to evolve and react quickly 
to the external environment. We are facing 
unprecedented cost pressures with a sharp 
increase in business rates (an additional £2 million 
in the next full financial year), the impact of the 
National Living Wage and increasing competition 
for key skilled team workers such as chefs. This is 
compounded by the uncertainty around Brexit 
and the future for the EU nationals that are a key 
part of our business, particularly in London. 
However, we have robust plans in place, a superb 
team of people and we are ready to tackle these 
future challenges and seize the opportunities 
they present.

While food has continued to show strong like for

the standout performer over the last 12 months, 
with like for like sales rising by 6.4%. This was 
driven by a strong rise in occupancy rates, 
benefiting from both an increase in inbound 
tourists, many of whom like to stay in a traditional 
British pub, and a rise in the popularity of the 
staycation. We are continuing to upgrade our 
hotel stock and this year added a further 71 
bedrooms through the acquisition of new 
properties and building more in our existing 
estate. This brings the total number of bedrooms 
in our Managed Pubs and Hotels division to 706.

London Porter Smoked Salmon
We’ve talked about it before – and we’ll talk 
about it again, but we are just so proud of our 
excellent London Porter Smoked Salmon. As 
well as serving it with scrambled eggs or in 
Eggs Royale for a delicious breakfast, it is also 
the hero of our Salad Nicoise, just one of the 
lighter dishes we have added to our menus.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Our total food sales have risen 11%, while like for 
like food sales have risen by 4.5% during the 
period. This is an area where we continue to invest 
in our kitchens, as well as developing our team 
members and building sustainable, mutually 
beneficial relationships with our suppliers. During 
the year, we held our inaugural Chef of the Year 
competition, with over-25 and under-25 
categories. The two winners, Gavin Sinden of The 
Stonemason’s Arms in Hammersmith, and Luke 
Emmess of The Still & West, Southsea, were 
rewarded with a trip to Dubai, including the chance 
to cook in some of the Emirates’ top restaurants.
The successful Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild continues to 
deliver excellent results and is one of the ways we 
are mitigating the problems of chef recruitment. 
We have increased both the number of chef 
scholars undertaking one of our training 
programmes and the frequency of the training 
cycles, with six cycles per year, each lasting five 
and a half months. In addition, we are in the 
second year of our Chef Apprentice programme, 
aimed at entry level kitchen positions. This has 
proved successful and we have provided 
permanent jobs for all those who completed the 
apprenticeship programme. These trainees will, 
we hope, be the Head Chefs of the future.
Our food journey continues and we are currently 
investing in systems to underpin the fantastic 
work we have completed around supplier 
partnerships, training and development. This 
includes a new food recipe, margin and stock 
system which will enable us to improve food 
margin and consistency of our freshly cooked 
dishes, while maintaining the quality, originality 
and provenance of the ingredients we use. We are 
also expanding our healthier options and in the last 
12 months have markedly increased the number 
of vegetarian and vegan dishes on the menu.
During the year we relaunched and refreshed 
the wine offer in our pubs. We redesigned our 
lists around styles, giving customers a choice 
of wines of different origin and price, while 
retaining our focus on provenance and quality. 
The lists now have unfussy descriptions of the 
flavours and the move has resulted in customers 
trading up to more premium wines. Our efforts 
have also been noticed outside of Fuller’s and we 
have just taken the title of Pub Merchant of the 
Year at the Sommelier Wine Awards. Craft 
beers also continued to perform well across the 
Managed estate, with sales increasing of both 
Fuller’s own range and those from other brewers. 
In addition, our Managed Pubs now have access 
to an even wider range of brands through 
Nectar. All of these trends have helped invested 
like for like drinks sales to grow 3.1%.
With customers looking for new, exciting and 
experiential reasons to visit the pub, we look to 
provide many and varied interesting events. The 
popular Shakespeare in the Garden programme 
featured Twelfth Night last summer and once 
again, we had a full house at each performance. 
We will be re-running the My Dad’s Pub 
competition that we created last year, whereby 
one lucky father wins his own pub for the day, 
including personalisation of the pub’s hanging 
sign. Our Fuller’s Kitchen campaign continues, 
seizing the opportunities presented by Instagram 
to share photos of delicious dishes through social 
media to whet our customers’ appetites. Fuller’s 
Kitchen has also been focusing on monthly 
offers that combine food and drink and over 
12,000 of these were redeemed over a five 
month period, with a chorizo burger paired 
with a pint of Frontier being the most popular. 
Bedroom Business
Four of the five new pubs we have opened this 
year have bedrooms. The Half Moon’s rooms 
are all named after people who have walked 
on the moon, while The White Star in 
Southampton has had some unlucky residents 
in the past. It played host to a number of 
transatlantic passengers in 1912, the night 
before they boarded the Titanic, hence the 
reason it is named after the ill-fated ship’s 
operating company.

Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Chief Executive’s Review continued
Digital technology is allowing us to enhance 
our distinctive customer experience and deliver 
efficiency and we have a number of exciting 
initiatives in place. Our single customer view 
database was launched at the start of the year 
and has helped to drive incremental revenue 
through carefully targeted email marketing 
activity. We pride ourselves on the individuality 
of each of our pubs and our online approach is 
no different. We have upgraded over 100 of 
our pub websites with fully responsive, mobile 
optimised sites where photography is at the 
heart. We place huge value on the feedback that 
we receive from our customers and launched a 
new online feedback system which has so far 
generated over 40,000 individual responses. 
Over 60% of our managed pubs and hotels now 
have a superfast WiFi connection and we are 
continuing to invest to improve the experience 
for the 400,000 customers that use the service 
each month.
During the year, we purchased or opened five new 
Managed Pubs, including The Gun, a pub in South 
Quay, Docklands, with panoramic views across the 
bend of the River Thames to the O2 and an 
enviable reputation for food, and The Half Moon 
in Herne Hill, an iconic pub in South London, an 
area in which Fuller’s is underrepresented. It is a 
Grade II listed building and our scheme restored 
many original features and added 12 stylish, 
individually-designed bedrooms. It is truly 
wonderful to see this grand old lady of Herne Hill 
once again proudly dominating the local scene. 
We also purchased The White Star in 
Southampton, which comes with 14 bedrooms, 
The King’s Arms in Woodstock, which has 15 
bedrooms, and The Albert Arms in Esher, an 
affluent area perfect for our premium fresh 
food offer. The Albert Arms has six bedrooms, 
is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment 
and we plan to reopen it in the second half 
of the year.
During the year, we have invested £20 million in 
our existing Managed estate with a number of 
high profile refurbishments that have resulted 
in a record number of 155 closure weeks (2016: 
121 weeks). These included adding additional 
bedrooms at sites such as The Princess Royal in 
Farnham and The Head of the River in Oxford as 
well as developing sites to broaden their appeal, 
such as The Three Guineas at Reading Station. 
This traditional station pub has been completely 
repositioned, with an excellent food offer and the 
innovative conversion of a large disused cellar 
area into a superb function space. The Three 
Guineas is in a perfect position to benefit from 
the forthcoming arrival of Crossrail.
Ultimately, the success of our Managed 
Pubs and Hotels is due to the excellent team 
of people who work in them, and we continue 
to invest wholeheartedly in their training and 
development. We are fortunate to have some 
incredible team members from throughout 
Europe and beyond working in our pubs and in 
the light of Britain’s forthcoming departure from 
the EU, we are investing in and supporting our 
people by covering the cost of applying for a 
permanent residence card for any eligible EU 
or EEA nationals who have worked for us for at 
least one year.
After opening four new sites for The Stable in 
the first half – two in London at Whitechapel 
and Kew Bridge and two closer to the brand’s 
heartland in Bournemouth and Exeter – we are 
pausing for breath in our opening programme. 
Since acquiring The Stable just three years ago, 
it has trebled in size, and now stands at 17 sites. 
During the year we increased our stake in this 
business to 76% and we have the option to 
acquire the remaining 24% in 2018.
In order to focus on The Stable’s position 
as the  home of great cider, we have rolled 
out a Cidermaster programme, creating cider 
sommeliers in each restaurant. We have also 
created a house cider, Rapscallion, produced at 
Cornish Orchards and collaboratively blended by 
The Stables’ Cidermasters and the talented cider 
makers at Duloe. In the latter part of the year 
we appointed David Gough, another internal 
promotion, to the role of Operations Director. 
We have moved the back office and systems to 
Chiswick to allow The Stable to benefit from 
being part of the Fuller’s family, while the retail 
offer remains wholly under the control of The 
Stable team. The Stable is still a very young and 
exciting brand and it continues to offer a point 
of difference to the Fuller’s portfolio.
The Astronomer, 
London E1
The Astronomer was just one 
of the refurbishments we carried 
out during the last year. Formerly 
The Shooting Star, this fantastic 
pub pays homage to the great 
astronomers and has a downstairs 
bar known as The Hubble Room. 
TV presenter Dallas Campbell 
came and opened it for us and 
even brought a real space suit 
with him.

Tenanted Inns
£13.2m
Operating profit
1
 (-1%)
Our Tenanted business has had a challenging year 
with like for like profits, our main KPI, decreasing 
by 1% (2016: +2%). The division generated £13.2 
million of profit
1
 during the year (2016: £13.4 
million) and average EBITDA per pub increased 
by 2%. During the year, we completed a strategic 
review of the business and identified 20 pubs that 
we did not feel belonged in the Fuller’s portfolio. 
Prior to the period end, we sold four of these and 
another 16 are either held for sale or have been 
sold since the year end. In addition we sold two 
Tenanted pubs in the first half of the year.
A Fuller’s branded pub should always be a 
hallmark of high standards and great quality with 
regards to beer, wines and food, irrespective of 
whether the site is managed or tenanted. The 
strategic review of this part of our business has 
given us an opportunity to identify and clarify 
the standards we expect for our customers and 
ensure they are evident in all pubs. 
Investment in our Tenanted pubs has always 
played an important part in our journey and in 
light of the strategic review we have undertaken, 
we have implemented a plan to grow our annual 
rate of investment in our Tenanted pubs by over 
50% to around £3 million per year. This investment 
will be back and front of house, in the right pubs, 
in conjunction with the right entrepreneurial 
Tenants. We have completed 15 projects during 
the year that have enhanced the nature of the 
business including The Prestonville in Brighton, 
The Globe in Brentford, The Bear & Swan in 
Chew Magna, which included adding boutique 
bedrooms, The Oak at Stanstead Abbotts and 
The Buckingham Inn, Buckingham. All of these 
projects were jointly funded by Fuller’s and 
the Tenant.
As part of this programme, we have put in place 
a new agreement based on a turnover rent, 
benefiting both the Company and the Tenant, 
including better transparency of trade and 
trading patterns and giving the Tenant greater 
flexibility in how they grow their business. In the 
future, Tenants will have access to the excellent 
Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild and we will be improving 
access to our food supplier base.
It is early days, but we are delighted that among 
our first turnover agreement signatories are a 
former Fuller’s Managed Pub Manager and 
Head Chef – completing the career path from 
front line team member to business owner. We 
have also had two internal promotions within 
the team, with one of our first set of graduate 
trainees and a former Fuller’s Managed Pub 
Manager both taking up Business Development 
Manager positions. Finally, we now have 92% of 
our estate on substantive agreements, up from 
85% a year ago. 
There is much work still to be done, but we have 
a number of workstreams in place to further 
develop the new agreement, enhance the look 
and feel of our Tenanted estate, improve the 
quality of the food and, as a result, recruit 
talented, entrepreneurial Tenants. 
“ In light of the strategic 
review we have 
undertaken, we have 
implemented a plan 
to grow our annual 
rate of investment in 
our Tenanted pubs by 
over 50%”
Our Tenants have access to Brewer Street 
coffee and its special blend of beans, chosen 
by our Head Brewer. Brewer Street is available 
Only at Fuller’s and we support those Tenants 
that take it on by helping with a promotional 
starter kit.

The Fuller’s Beer 
Company
£8.0m
Operating profit
1
 (+5%)
Revenue in The Fuller’s Beer Company rose 
by 17% to £147.9 million (2016: £126.8 million), 
principally due to the full year effect of the 
Nectar acquisition, although volumes (excluding 
Nectar) were down by 2%. Operating profit
1
 
rose 5%, to £8.0 million (2016: £7.6 million). 
We continue to see a shift to higher margin 
beers and ciders and it is only the impact of 
Nectar, our specialist craft beer wholesaler, 
that has caused the overall margin to fall. 
One of the top performers during the year 
was Frontier Craft Lager, which saw volumes 
increase by 27% and capped off the year by 
picking up the 2017 International Beer and 
Cider Award for Champion Draught Lager. 
This prestigious award reinforces the appeal 
of this fantastic beer, which continues to gain 
new fans across the UK and beyond. 
Cornish Orchards has performed well with 
volumes also rising by 27%. Cornish Orchards 
has released some well received new products, 
such as the refreshing seasonal cider Keeper’s 
Meadow, and launched three of its range – 
Cornish Orchards Gold, Cornish Orchards 
Blush and Alcoholic Ginger Beer – in 
330ml cans.
The year saw the launch of London Pride 
Unfiltered. This new beer takes the original 
London Pride recipe with the beer being 
centrifuged but not filtered. The beer is then dry 
hopped with additional Target hops. The result is 
a delicious, slightly hoppier, beer with all the 
balance of original London Pride. It still has a 
full flavour and is served colder, which appeals 
to today’s craft beer drinker. Early signs are very 
positive and we are confident the beer will bring 
London Pride to a whole new audience. London 
Pride cask still remains the grand master of our 
beer portfolio and we will be unveiling exciting 
new plans for it later in the year. 
London Pride has been supported by a number 
of exciting marketing initiatives during the period, 
particularly in the social media space. Drop of 
Pride, whereby offices can compete on Twitter 
using the hashtag #DropOfPride to have a 
one-off delivery of London Pride to their office 
on a Friday afternoon, has been shortlisted for 
an Institute of Promotional Marketing award. 
Meanwhile, #whenitrainsitpours, a combined 
Twitter and Periscope activation featuring 
weatherman Michael Fish, received over four 
million views. Consumers could receive a voucher 
for a free pint of London Pride when the live 
Periscope feed showed it was raining outside 
our pub The Hydrant at Monument. The site 
generated a fantastic response with the 
supporting ads reaching 11.2 million people 
and over 1,200 pints being given away over 
a three week period.

 Operating profit excluding separately

20 We continue to invest in our brewery, with the 
new cross-flow filter coming into action, helping 
improve the quality and range of our keg and 
bottled beers. We have made a number of other 
improvements that have resulted in a positive 
impact on our efficiency, such as new electric 
forklift trucks with lower carbon emissions and 
changes to our loading bank to create more 
space and easier stock movement. The Brewery 
team participated in our first ever Brewery 
employee engagement event, promoting and 
improving health and safety through an 
impactful, innovative and fun day. We are 
looking forward in the new financial year to 
improvements in the cask racking line and we will 
be building a pilot plant to allow our brewers to 
experiment and be even more creative.
Maintaining a wide portfolio of interesting 
brands is key to our success and while smaller 
brands may not generate huge volumes, they 
keep Fuller’s top of mind with the beer 
cognoscenti and provide interest and excitement 
for our consumers. During the year, we have 
changed the look and feel of our seasonal 
portfolio, ensuring that the range is a perfect 
complement at all times to our core selection. 
Finally, it has been a busy year for both Cornish 
Orchards and Nectar with notable infrastructure 
investments in both businesses. A new 
warehouse and new offices have been built at 
Duloe, where production has trebled since our 
acquisition in 2013. Meanwhile, at Nectar we 
have built a new warehouse which will double 
capacity. Both of these business are generating 
good returns for The Fuller’s Beer Company and 
we look forward to helping them continue to 
grow in the future.
Current trading 
and prospects
We are only nine weeks in to the new financial 
year but we have had a very strong start, albeit 
against our softest quarter last year, with like 
for like sales in Managed Pubs and Hotels up 
6.6%, like for like profits in our Tenanted Inns up 
5% and volumes in The Fuller’s Beer Company 
rising 7%.
There are a number of headwinds that will have a 
significant financial impact on both Fuller’s and 
the industry as a whole, but we face the future in 
a strong position. Our Managed Pubs and Hotels 
are in good shape and although there is a lot of 
work and a long way to go, we have a clear vision 
and solid strategy for both our Tenanted Inns and 
The Fuller’s Beer Company.
We will continue to build and develop our 
business and have plans to invest £25 million, 
before allowing for any pubs we find to acquire. 
A further £5 million, which we will expense, has 
been allocated to the implementation of the 
once in a generation replacement of our core 
systems, which will equip us for further success 
in the coming years.
The projects that we have started today give us a 
solid digital foundation and a clear vision for the 
future. We will use integrated technology to get 
to know our customers and our teams better and 
form the best possible personal relationship with 
everyone who comes into contact with Fuller’s.
In short, while we are cautious and realistic 
about the future, we are well-placed to continue to 
delight our customers, recruit and develop the best 
team members and reward our shareholders.

London Pride Unfiltered
In February, we launched London Pride

It is colder, hoppier and hazier and it is proving 
very popular with both new drinkers and 
traditional Pride drinkers looking for extra 
refreshment on a hot day. Delicious!

T
he team down at Cornish Orchards have been 
busy this year, with new products, new offices 
and a new warehouse. The additional capacity that 
went in during the previous financial year is all now 
up and running and we have trebled production 
since we acquired the business in 2013. 
During the last year, we have expanded the range of 
drinks produced at Westnorth Manor Farm in Duloe 
to include Sparkling Apple, a soft drink made with 
Cornish spring water taken from a spring in our own 
orchard, and we’ve taken our popular Rhubarb and 
Vanilla Sparkle and made it available all year round. 
In addition, we have added Cornish Orchards Blush, 
with a hint of fresh raspberry, to our draught portfolio.
The new year has seen the arrival of even more new 
products and new formats with Gold, Blush and our 
Alcoholic Ginger Beer now available in cans and a new 
draught and bottled cider, Keeper’s Meadow. This 
apple and pear-based cider has a hint of elderflower, 
creating a highly refreshing drink and making it 
appealing to the prosecco brigade. 
The key ingredient at Cornish Orchards is fresh fruit 
– from our own orchards, from local people who sell us 
their apples and from other fruit growers in the South 
West. All the fruit is then pressed at Westnorth 
Manor Farm and we never, ever use concentrate. It’s 
that commitment to fruit, to quality and to the skill of 
our blenders that means you can taste the nature in 
Cornish Orchards ciders and juices.
