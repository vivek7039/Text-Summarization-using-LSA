CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRA TEGIC REVIEW
WHILST CONDITIONS REMAIN CHALLENGING IN 
OUR CORE OIL & GAS AND MARINE MARKETS,  
OUR BUSINESS HAS SEEN EXCELLENT SUCCESSES  
IN OUR KEY GROWTH INDUSTRIES.
As expected, AVEVA’s financial 
performance was resilient despite the 
challenging conditions in our core end 
markets. In addition to delivering solid 
results, we made good progress in 
delivering against our strategy during 
the year and in structuring the business 
to enable future growth. Revenue 
increased 7 .1% to £215.8 million (2016 
– £201.5 million), assisted by a currency 
translation benefit of 11.4%. Profit 
before tax grew to £46.9 million (2016 
– £29.4 million), supported by a strong 
focus on cost control. On an adjusted 
basis, profit before tax grew 7 .4% to 
£55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million).
On a regional basis, revenue in the 
Americas grew due to a strong 
performance in North America, partly 
offset by difficult market conditions 
in Latin America, specifically in Brazil. 
AVEVA’s performance in EMEA and Asia 
Pacific was robust in the context of the 
subdued Oil & Gas and Marine markets. 
Overall Group revenue declined in 
constant currency terms by 3.8%, 
although we did see an improvement 
in the second half. Excluding Latin 
America, Group revenue declined only 
2.3% in constant currency terms for the 
full year, and was flat in the second half.
We made good progress in executing 
our strategy. On a constant currency 
basis, we delivered good growth with 
More Than 3D (MT3D), Owner 
Operators and sales to the Power 
sector.
The strength of our product offering 
was demonstrated by several key 
new business wins during the year. 
These included wins in both markets 
that offer growth opportunities 
for us and in our more mature 
product and geographic areas.
During the year, I took over as CEO and 
David Ward transitioned to the post of 
CFO. We have both been in the 
business for many years and were core 
to formulating AVEVA’s strategy. We 
plan to continue to pursue this strategy, 
with a sharp focus on execution and 
getting closer to our customers. As 
part of this, I have simplified AVEVA’s 
management structure with greater 
decision-making capabilities and direct 
accountability for performance being 
allocated to our regions. I have also 
added more customer-facing people to 
our Executive team, including a recently 
recruited Chief Revenue Officer, who 
will take overall responsibility for 
leading Global Sales, Partnership 
Management and Marketing.

Delivery against our strategy 
AVEVA’s strategy is to increase 
revenues by growing the addressable 
market for its products as the concept 
of the Digital Asset is more widely 
adopted; to sell a wider range of 
products; and to grow in industry and 
geographic verticals where the Group’s 
market share is underweight, versus 
the strength of its product offering.
Notwithstanding the cyclical headwinds 
in end markets that AVEVA has 
experienced in the recent past, we 
expect our strategy to deliver solid 
organic growth in the long term, across 
end market cycles.
The building blocks of this strategy  
are as follows.
• More than 3D: We see a major 
market opportunity in leveraging our 
customer base and market position 
by selling additional engineering 
software tools, extending beyond 
our core 3D design platforms. 
Further to this, information 
management tools such as AVEVA 
NET, can generate revenue 
throughout the operation life cycle 
of assets, therefore expanding the 
market that we address. 
• Owner Operators: OOs such as 
energy and power generation 
companies currently only account 
for approximately 16% of our 
revenue. However, a significant 
market opportunity is developing as 
OOs increasingly adopt the Digital 
Asset concept to help them manage 
their physical assets throughout 
their life cycles. 
• Growth markets: AVEVA generates 
approximately half of its revenue 
from EMEA. This largely relates to 
our heritage as a UK-based 
company. Over time, we intend to 
grow our revenues in key markets 
such as the USA and China, using 
the competitive advantages that our 
products offer. 
• Broaden market exposure: We  
aim to grow our market share in 
industries beyond our core Oil & Gas 
and Marine markets, with a particular 
focus, in the short term, on Power, 
by applying the strength of our core 
technology and the rich knowledge 
of our people in these markets. 
• Software as a Service (SaaS) and the 
Cloud: We intend to unify all of our 
applications onto a common Cloud 
platform to provide greater value to 
our customers and address a wider 
customer base.
CASE STUDY
GROWTH MARKETS
AVEVA is an established global company with 50 offices in 
30 countries. As such, we can provide customers with local 
sales and support in all of the world’s major economies. 
Notwithstanding this, AVEVA was not the first mover in 
some of the world’s key growth markets and therefore  
has underweight positions due to the ‘stickiness’ of 
customers to incumbent providers. 
We believe that our products offer a strong advantage  
over competing offerings, due to their inherent integration 
based on our leading object-modelling technology, which 
reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership 
for our customers. Our strategy is therefore to apply our 
competitive advantage to gain share in key target markets. 
We are enjoying considerable success in North America, 
where our strategy of leading with sales to Owner 
Operators, often with innovative MT3D product offerings,  
is delivering strong results.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
More than 3D ‘MT3D’
AVEVA’s MT3D sales grew during the 
year, increasing 2.1% on a constant 
currency basis. MT3D products 
represented 26.5% of total revenue, 
increasing from 25.2% in the prior 
year. Sales of our wider product suite 
have been a feature of this year’s key 
customer wins, with for example 
the AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage 
information management tools helping 
to strengthen our offer to OOs.
We are also achieving success 
in leveraging our existing EPC 
(Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction) customer base to sell 
MT3D products. We have developed 
our technology to help deliver 
Building Information Management 
(BIM) projects in Infrastructure – 
not only to help satisfy any BIM 
mandate, but also to support faster, 
more effective project execution 
and handover through improved 
data management. A good example 
is Jacobs, who have used AVEVA 
technologies (AVEVA NET, AVEVA 
Engineering™ and AVEVA Information 
Standards Manager™) to meet their 
client’s information management 
and BIM level 2 requirements, and 
to achieve efficiency improvements 
for a UK highways project.
Owner Operators
AVEVA’s sales to OOs also grew during 
the year, increasing 5.4% on a constant 
currency basis. OOs represented 
16.2% of total revenue, increasing 
from 14.9% in the prior year. We had 
particular success in North America and 
Asia, where we won contracts in the 
Petrochemical & Chemical and Power 
sectors. These included KEPCO E&C, a 
leading global energy solutions provider 
based in South Korea, which chose 
AVEVA for a full range of 3D and MT3D 
design and information management 
products for its new nuclear power 
plant projects. Similarly, another leading 
power generation OO, Southern 
Company, in the USA, selected our 
design and information management 
tools to help improve project execution 
efficiency and asset information 
access. Meanwhile, we strengthened 
our relationship with Eastman, a 
global speciality chemical company.
Growth markets
We enjoyed success in North 
America, where our local strategy 
of leading with sales to OOs and 
of MT3D products is working well, 
and we achieved significant new 
business wins. The business grew by 
18.9% during the year on a constant 
currency basis. We continue to see 
growth potential in China, where 
successes during the year included 
expanding our business with Sinopec 
Engineering Group, which adopted 
AVEVA’s Integrated Engineering and 
Design solution for effective design, 
collaboration and improved efficiency. 
However, overall our business there 
was broadly flat during the year, 
being impacted by tougher market 
conditions, particularly in shipbuilding.
Broaden market exposure
We made good progress during the 
year in broadening our market exposure 
away from the cyclical Oil & Gas and 
Marine end markets. We enjoyed 
particular success in Power where 
revenue increased 11.4% on a constant 
currency basis during the year. Our 
software is well suited to creating and 
managing large complex projects, 
such as gas powered and nuclear 
power stations. During the year, we 
achieved several key wins within the 
Power market with Southern Company 
and TerraPower in the USA, KEPCO 
EPC in Korea and Japan Nuclear Fuel. 
We also achieved success in Paper & 
Pulp, where Valmet, the leading global 
developer and supplier of technologies, 
automation and services for the pulp, 
paper and energy industries, signed a 
multi-year agreement for AVEVA E3D.
AVEVA also enjoyed success in the 
steel fabrication market where sales 
increased by 10.0% on a constant 
currency basis as we continue to 
integrate and leverage the Bocad 
and FabTrol acquisitions. STRATEGIC REPORT

CURRENCY BASIS,

SaaS and the Cloud
While AVEVA’s business model 
already has the high level of recurring 
subscription revenues typically 
associated with Cloud delivery, we 
aim to be technologically ready to 
offer our products on a SaaS model 
in response to customer demand.
For the industries we serve, there 
are several challenges facing our 
customers which need to be overcome 
before there is a full transition to 
Cloud. However, over time we do 
expect that customers will want 
to explore ways of using the Cloud 
to drive efficiency and improve 
collaboration through the supply chain 
and operating cycle of their assets.
We launched our Cloud platform 
AVEVA Connect together with our first 
SaaS offering, Asset Visualisation, at 
the AVEVA World Summit in October 
2016. AVEVA Connect is our SaaS 
ecosystem for Engineering, Design 
and Information Management 
solutions. Asset Visualisation is 
our new Information Management 
as a Service offering. There is a 
willingness from the OOs to move 
towards SaaS for the provision of the 
Digital Asset and we expect these 
products to gain traction with major 
customers in the medium term.
In April this year, we launched a second 
SaaS offering on AVEVA Connect, 
Information Standards Management. 
The Sales team has now been equipped 
to sell these solutions and we have 
brought on board several major oil 
Owner Operators as early adopters. 
Both Asset Visualisation and 
Information Standards Management 
provide entry points for our Owner 
Operator customers to access Digital 
Asset-as-a-Service solutions flexibly 
and cost effectively.
Our technology
Our software is used by customers 
as they design, build and operate 
large capital-intensive assets, mainly 
in the Process, Power and Marine 
industries. Our vision is for the 
widespread adoption of constantly-
evolving Digital Assets, enabling 
our customers to manage continual 
change as they design, build and 
operate some of the world’s most 
complicated physical assets.
We believe that our products offer a 
strong advantage over competing 
offerings, due to their inherent 
integration based on our leading object 
modelling technology, which reduces 
complexity and lowers the total cost of 
ownership for our customers.
AVEVA’s heritage is in 3D design, where 
our core products are AVEVA PDMS 
(Plant Design Management System), 
AVEVA E3D and AVEVA Marine 
products. These products represented 
73.5% of 2016/17 revenues. AVEVA E3D 
is the latest generation 3D product 
which carries a price premium 
reflecting its higher productivity and 
advanced feature set.
AVEVA E3D grew strongly during the 
year as existing customers continued 
to migrate towards it and new contracts 
were won. It contributed almost 13% of 
total revenue, up from below 10% in 
the prior year.
Within More than 3D, the largest 
product sets are schematics 
applications such as Piping and 
Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID), 
Instrumentation & Electrical 
applications and our unique multi-
discipline AVEVA Engineering solution; 
together with information 
management applications such as 
AVEVA NET. These areas grew during 
the year with strong growth in 
information management sales 
particularly to the Owner Operators. 18

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Our markets and our customers
AVEVA’s key end markets are  
Oil & Gas, Marine, Power and 
Petrochemical & Chemical. Other 
markets we serve include Architecture, 
Construction & Steel Fabrication, 
Mining & Minerals Processing, 
Paper & Pulp and Pharmaceuticals. 
Oil & Gas accounts for 40–45% 
of revenue, Marine 20%, Power 
15–20%, Petrochemical & Chemical 
10% and the remainder 10%.
AVEVA has four main groups 
of customers. These are EPCs, 
shipyards, OOs and Fabricators.
 
EPCs primarily use AVEVA’s software 
to design and build industrial assets, 
such as oil platforms, power stations 
and process plants for OOs. Demand 
from EPCs for AVEVA’s products is 
therefore impacted by end market 
demand and particularly the level of 
capital expenditure on new installations 
and brownfield projects. AVEVA has 
strong long-standing relationships 
with many leading EPCs. The large, 
global EPCs are managed as strategic 
partnerships through AVEVA’s 
Global Accounts programme. 
OOs are key to achieving AVEVA’s vision 
of a constantly-evolving Digital Asset. 
Whereas historically the Digital Asset 
was core only to the design phase 
of physical assets, it is now widely 
accepted that Digital Assets can help 
OOs to drive efficiency and reduce 
risk through minimising downtime 
and unplanned outages, while 
complying with ever more stringent 
environmental and safety legislation.
We won 9 new OO customers 
during the year and significantly 
expanded our business with 
several existing OO customers.
Oil & Gas
In the Oil & Gas industry, end-market 
demand was weak, with global industry 
capital expenditure falling by over 40% 
between calendar 2014 and calendar 
2016 (Sources: Barclays, Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch).
This decline had a significant impact on 
the workloads of our EPC customers, 
with the more complex (and therefore 
design-intensive) greenfield upstream 
and offshore projects being impacted 
most significantly. This impacted 
demand for our software.
EPC customers tend to favour a rental 
model for software, meaning that their 
spend with AVEVA adjusts to market 
demand relatively quickly and some 
EPCs have reduced their seat count 
reflecting lower activity. There was 
also some consolidation amongst 
EPCs and in the oil services sector 
more generally. However, as OOs seek 
to extend the life of existing assets, 
we saw an increase in revamps and 
modifications (known as brownfield 
projects), which helped to sustain a 
level of demand from EPCs, although 
these projects are typically shorter 
in duration and lower in value.
Due to the downturn in the Oil & Gas 
industry, OOs are putting pressure 
on EPCs to reduce the cost of capital 
projects, often by up to 50%. This is 
putting pressure on the margins of the 
EPCs and they have been forced to look 
at how they become more efficient and 
reduce the cost of projects. EPCs are 
also increasingly looking to technology 
to help drive efficiency in projects. 
Our integrated engineering and design 
approach, which helps manage the 
engineering data across the different 
engineering disciplines, is receiving very 
positive feedback, enabling customers 
to reduce the total cost of ownership 
compared to our competition.
An area of focus for EPCs has 
been around reducing the cost 
of supporting, maintaining and 
developing in-house systems by 
looking to third-party vendors such 
as AVEVA to replace these with 
commercial software products.  STRATEGIC REPORT
19
This is particularly pronounced 
around materials procurement and 
construction management, given 
that many still use in-house systems 
in these areas. As such we are seeing 
significant interest in our Enterprise 
Resource Management product.
We are also seeing EPCs start 
to consider standardising their 
engineering technology strategy 
on one toolset and we believe 
that we are well positioned to 
capitalise on that trend.
Oil & Gas industry capital expenditure 
is forecast to increase in future years 
as investments are made to maintain 
production and reserves. There are 
early signs of improvement in the 
market, however the exact timing of a 
market recovery is difficult to predict.
Marine
AVEVA is a market leader in Marine 
design software, with customers 
including 90% of the world’s largest 
shipyards. The Marine market is in a 
cyclical trough, with a relatively low 
number of new ship builds ongoing. 
Shipyard customers typically prefer an 
Initial Licence Fee model, because they 
view software as a longer-term 
investment rather than being project 
specific. This results in annual 
maintenance payments continuing 
even in tougher market conditions.  
Our recurring revenue from the Marine 
market was broadly flat during the year.
We are also winning significant new 
business in the sector, with new wins  
in Europe, including a customer 
focused on cruise ships, and in Asia, 
where we won a major South East 
Asian customer focused on Marine and 
offshore capital projects. 
As with Oil & Gas, the Marine market is 
forecast by commentators such as 
Clarksons Research to recover from the 
current trough conditions. We expect 
activity to increase as overcapacity in 
the world fleet reduces and demand for 
specialist ships such as Floating 
Production, Storage and Offloading 
vessels and naval vessels grows, 
although again, the exact timing of a 
market recovery is difficult to predict.
CASE STUDY
BROADENING 
MARKET EXPOSURE
AVEVA has a high proportion of recurring revenues at  
76.9% in 2016/17 due to our ‘right-to-use’ licensing model. 
Notwithstanding this resilience, some 65% of our revenues 
are generated in the Oil & Gas and Marine markets. To an 
extent therefore, the Group’s growth prospects have 
historically been materially influenced by end market 
conditions within these markets (e.g. the number of oil 
installations and ships being ordered, designed, built and 
operated). Both Oil & Gas and Marine have grown over the 
long term, but have been subject to short-term cyclicality.  
As such, our strategy is to broaden our exposure to other 
industries, which are growing, offering the opportunity to 
achieve market share gains in areas that are less cyclical  
than our core markets. 
Our focus in 2016/17 was on obtaining share gains in  
the Power industry. We achieved great success in this 
endeavour, developing our business with multiple OO 
customers as well as with companies involved in the  
design and production of generation technology.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Power
We had significant success in the 
Power market during the year, winning 
several new contracts with both utilities 
and power systems design companies.
Longer-term trends in the Power 
market are positive as the world’s 
emerging economies invest in their 
power generation requirements and the 
ageing infrastructure of the developed 
world is maintained and replaced.
In the shorter term, AVEVA benefited 
from market share gains and 
requirements from operators in the 
sector for both design and information 
management tools, as they seek 
to improve asset efficiency.
Petrochemical & Chemical
We saw ongoing investment in the 
sector during the year, particularly in 
Asia, with stable market conditions on a 
global basis. AVEVA enjoyed success in 
winning new OO customers in Asia 
during the year in the refining sector.
Other markets
Conditions in AVEVA’s other markets 
are less subject to cyclical volatility, 
meaning that AVEVA can grow in a 
more linear fashion through the 
execution of its strategy. Notable 
developments during the year included 
solid constant currency growth in sales 
to fabricators and a new OO customer 
win in the Pharmaceutical sector.
In the Fabrication sector, AVEVA 
provides integrated end-to-end 
solutions for 3D modelling, detailing 
and fabrication of structural steelwork. 
This enables rapid, high-quality 
fabrication and construction for 
on-time, on-budget, integrated project 
execution for customers specialising  
in the engineering, manufacturing  
and assembly of advanced steel 
structures. In 2016/17 our revenue  
from Fabricator customers increased 
10.0% on a constant currency basis.
Outlook
We believe that AVEVA has both 
the market opportunity and the 
right strategy to deliver substantial 
growth over the longer term.
In the short term, demand cycles 
within our end markets have had an 
impact on growth. Our core markets 
of Oil & Gas and Marine, which 
together account for over 60% of 
Group revenue, have been in a cyclical 
trough over the last three years.
There are early signs of improvement 
in Oil & Gas. Although the timing 
of a full recovery in demand is still 
uncertain, we expect that as the 
headwinds lessen, the growth resulting 
from our strategic initiatives will 
begin to show at the Group level.
The Board remains confident in 
the long-term strength of AVEVA’s 
business model, the deliverability 
of its organic growth strategy and 
its positioning to benefit from a 
recovery in our end markets.
