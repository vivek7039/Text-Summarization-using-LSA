 Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 5
STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman’s statement
SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION
—
In my first statement a year ago, I stated that Greene King was a strong 
business with an excellent track record which, following the Spirit acquisition, 
was at an exciting time in its development. A year on, this remains the 
case. The team has worked extremely hard over the last two years on the 
integration, which has completed one year ahead of schedule. This means 
we can now give all our focus to pursuing opportunities to grow and take 
share, prioritising long-term value creation, while delivering continued strong 
cash generation and maintaining a robust balance sheet. Ours is a strategically 
strong and well managed business which is positioned to address the 
tougher trading environment forecast for the next few years. 
Overview
We achieved another year of record results and market outperformance, 
driven by a good performance from the underlying business and an 
additional seven-week contribution from Spirit. Group revenue grew 6.9% 
to over £2.2bn, while operating profit before exceptional and non-underlying 
items
1,2
 increased by 4.9% to £411.5m. Profit before tax, exceptional and 
non-underlying items
1,2
 grew 6.6% to £273.5m, leading to a 1.3% increase 
in adjusted earnings per share
1,2
 to 70.8p. 
Dividend
Reflecting this performance and confidence in our long-term prospects, 
the board has recommended a final dividend of 24.4p, giving a total dividend 
for the year of 33.2p. This represents growth of 3.6% compared to last 
year and continues the long-term track record of progressive dividends. 
The board continues to target minimum dividend cover of around two 
times earnings. 
People
We have 44,000 talented and hard-working team members. The continued 
success of the business during the Spirit integration demonstrates the effort 
they have put in over the last 12 months. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone who has worked so hard during the last year helping us 
to deliver these results at the same time as completing the integration of 
Spirit ahead of schedule. 
Board changes
At the AGM in September 2016, Ian Durant retired from the board after 
nine years, latterly as chairman of the audit committee. Rob Rowley took 
over as audit chair at the same time. In December 2016, Gordon Fryett 
joined the board bringing a wealth of experience of both retail and property 
through his career at Tesco. I should like to record the board’s thanks to 
Ian for his contribution to Greene King over such a critical period.
Looking ahead
We are excited about the opportunities we see in our core pub retailing 
brands, where the results from our brand conversions are showing very 
positive sales uplifts. We will continue with the programme over the coming 
years, ensuring our pubs remain attractive and relevant to our customers 
as they face into the challenges that the economic uncertainties will 
undoubtedly bring. 
Within the pub sector, Greene King’s combination of brands, teams and 
assets leaves us well placed to deliver long-term growth and returns to 
shareholders. Uncertainty affecting both business and consumer confidence 
is likely to continue following the recent election and the unknown length 
and outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Alongside the rest of the industry, 
we are experiencing significant cost pressures but Greene King’s scale and 
the consequent cost efficiencies, not least from the Spirit integration, should 
enable us to mitigate much of the cost increases. Our aim is to ensure that 
Greene King emerges from the near-term period of uncertainty stronger 
than ever and I look forward to reporting on our progress towards this 
goal in a year’s time.
