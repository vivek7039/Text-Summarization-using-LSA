 BUILDING A  
BRIGHTER FUTURE
We believe in pushing the boundaries of 
innovation to maximise the capability of  
our customers through the use of our 
products and services and thereby 
differentiate ourselves from our peers.
We have developed an updated forward-looking strategy  
for the Group with three main strategic priorities:
•  grow the core by maximising organic sales growth  
from our current product portfolio
•   pursue selective organic product development  
to maintain our innovation leadership position
•  target value enhancing acquisitions to complement 
our existing businesses and add additional growth 
opportunities for the Group

Creating value  
through acquisitions
The strong performance of milkrite | InterPuls 
in growing revenue and profit with improved 
margins confirms the successful integration of 
the InterPuls business into the Group following 
its acquisition in late 2015. InterPuls has 
provided an enhanced product range whilst 
broadening routes to market and demonstrates 
our ability to successfully identify, acquire and 
importantly, fully integrate value enhancing 
businesses into our existing operations.

margins and cash conversion in line with  
our strategic growth objectives
• Return on investment exceeding our  
weighted cost of capital
• Post-acquisition net debt to EBITDA

THE CORE
GROWING THE CORE
We have established ourself as a technology and service leader 
in our chosen markets, with a range of innovative products and 
an established global customer base. We see opportunities 
to generate further, profitable growth from our core business 
through a number of initiatives:
• Leveraging the product and customer base. As a leader in 
a number of related technology areas, there is considerable 
scope to cross sell the wider product portfolio to our 
existing customers. We have seen with the acquisitions 
of argus and InterPuls that strong brand positions in 
complementary markets provide an opportunity to 
accelerate multi-product sales. 
• Responding to customers’ growing needs. Through 
our focus on innovation we are constantly enhancing 
the functionality and capability of our product range. 
As our customers grow, we see a clear opportunity to 
migrate them to our premium product offerings as their 
requirements increase. 
• Offering new models and solutions. The success of our 
Cluster Exchange and more recently launched Farm Services 
programmes have demonstrated the benefits of combining 
our leading product technology with a service that the 
customer values. We see alternative ownership models  
and value-added services as an additional differentiator  
that has scope to open up a broader market. 
• Expanding our reach through distribution. We participate 
in growing global markets with a large and diverse base 
of potential customers. Expanding our distribution 
network of agents and dealers will allow us to access 
wider market opportunities more quickly, in both new 
and existing territories.
• Enhancing our commercial effectiveness. As we target 
a wider market with increasingly sophisticated technical 
offerings, we are investing in our people to improve 
the effectiveness of our sales teams to ensure that we 
optimise the relationship with our global distribution 
partners and customers.
• Continuing focus on operational excellence. We have 
invested in a global manufacturing capability and supply chain 
to meet the high quality requirements of our products and 
customers. We pursue a continuous improvement culture to 
further reduce costs and enhance product margins and will 
benefit from improved operational gearing as we optimise the 
utilisation of our global operations.
SELECTIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
As the established leader, we are committed to remaining 
at the forefront of technology evolution in our markets. 
To generate the best return on our innovation investment 
we need to ensure that our development is closely aligned 
with our customers to enable us to deliver the performance, 
capability and efficiency that they are looking for:
• Moving up the value chain in respiratory protection. 
Whilst we will continue to expand the portfolio of mask 
platforms, variant systems and consumables to cater for the 
specific needs of particular customers or applications, we 
are actively developing more advanced systems such as  
the Powered Air and Magnum SCBA ranges targeted at 
more specialist customer groups. 
• Enabling technologies and integrated systems. The 
equipment of the military fighter of the future is expected 
to be increasingly sophisticated, with seamless integration 
of protection and technology systems. We are investing  
in our expertise in enabling technologies, following  
an Internet of Things principle, to allow greater integration 
of respiratory protection systems with data and 
communications technology. 
• Building the Dairy portfolio around the service proposition. 
We are expanding the Farm Services product portfolio  
to include Cluster Exchange, Pulsator Exchange and  
Tag Exchange to leverage the unique value of this  
product range.
VALUE ENHANCING ACQUISITIONS
Through growing the core and selective product development, 
we believe that we can sustain attractive and profitable organic 
growth into the future. However, we also see the potential to 
complement this growth and accelerate our strategy through 
carefully selected value enhancing acquisitions within both 
Avon Protection and milkrite | InterPuls. These acquisitions have 
the potential to give us access to new technology and market 
segments. Our recent track record demonstrates our ability to 
generate real value by bringing complementary products onto 
our market leading platform:
• InterPuls (2015): significantly expanded the product 
portfolio of the Dairy business. Consistent with our 
‘Growing the Core’ principles, integration focused on 
combining the brands and maximising the cross selling 
opportunity for the expanded product range. The 
acquired best-in-class manufacturing footprint in Italy was 
established as the lead development location allowing it to 
accelerate the ‘Selective Product Development’ phase of 
the strategy to widen the portfolio for the global market.
• argus (2015): followed the ‘Growing the Core’ principles 
when consolidating the thermal imaging camera production 
into our UK manufacturing facility, whilst adding sales and 
marketing infrastructure to support organic growth with 
the traditional argus customers and launching a cross selling 
initiative with the existing North American SCBA Fire 
network. Over the mid term we will follow the ‘Selective 
Product Development’ principles to develop product 
upgrades to further enhance the product portfolio.

The FM61 uses pioneering conformal filter technology for closer 
integration and is designed with bayonet quick fit for use only with 
the M50 mask. 
The MILCF50 filter has a unique conformal shape providing a low 
profile close fit with the mask. The filter design minimises snag and  
pull hazards as well as reducing neck loading.
The NH15 Escape Hood range is the smallest NIOSH-certified 
CBRN/CO air purifying escape respirator on the market and is ideal 
for police, emergency medical services and fire officers seeking 
immediate or emergency respiratory protection in a CBRN/CO 
escape scenario.
MCM100 is a state of the art underwater rebreather range for 
military diving use. During 2017 we obtained the CE European 
safety approval for the product and post year end we have secured 
the first orders for this product from military customers. Our 
underwater product range also includes the MDC150 dive computer 
designed for military use.
Our fire range is comprised of the argus 
thermal imaging camera and the Deltair 
SCBA. We are in the process of upgrading 
our SCBA system to comply with the new 
NFPA fire safety standards and will market 
the upgraded range under the Magnum 
brand name.
