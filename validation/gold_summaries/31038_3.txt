by expanding our network through organic growth and acquisition, 
we look forward to achieving this objective.

OUR HERITAGE AND MAJOR MILESTONES
When Kevin Hollinrake and John Waterhouse established Hunters 
in 1992, their vision was to develop the brand to become the 
largest estate agency group in the UK. 25 years later, they and their 
founding vision remain active within the Company and instrumental 
to its success. Hunters grew organically, offering sales and lettings 
through 10 owned branches. 2005 saw the beginning of a new phase 
with the development of its franchising expansion which, together 
with strategic acquisition, has seen the network grow to its current 
size. The services offered cover residential sales; lettings; buy-to-let 
and investment; residential block management; land and new homes; 
franchising and other property related services.
Hunters has won more than 30 awards; maintained Investor in 
People certification for more than a decade; twice been voted  
Best UK Estate Agent by the Home Sale Network (now the 
Relocation Agent Network) and featured in the Sunday Times  
Best 100 Companies.

Proven  
track record
of organic and acquisitive growth
Opening its first franchising branch in 2006, the Group acquired a 
network in 2011 whose branches have increased their respective 
annual revenue by 84%.
Hunters has driven growth organically, opening 114 branches in 
four years to December 2017 on top of its acquisition of Hunters 
Midlands in 2014, its acquisition in 2015 of the Country Properties 
franchised network and its acquisition in 2017 of the Besley Hill 
franchised network. Gross income of the Group’s Franchisee  
and owned branch network ("Network Income") increased 
between 2008 and 2017 by a compound annual growth rate  
of 27% (2016: 26%).

STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Overview
Chairman’s statement
We are pleased to report that the Group has delivered a strong result in 2017. Network 
Income has increased by 10% despite subdued market conditions. The Group continued 
its expansion towards becoming the nation’s favourite estate agent. Organically, we believe 
we are the fastest growing listed business in our sector having opened 114 branches over 
the last four years and a further 46 branches through acquisition in that period.
In the year we added 37 (2016: 30) new branches to the network, 
including 15 (2016: 20) independent businesses, reaching 213 (2016: 
186) branches by the year end. This included the addition of the Besley 
Hill franchised network, expanding our coverage in the South West. 
We are pleased to report we have already rebranded those branches 
as Hunters, ahead of schedule, and we look forward to helping them to 
grow their business. We continue to attract good quality independent 
businesses who see the benefits of a support network, reduced 
operating costs and opportunities to improve their income. 
Gross income of the Group’s Franchisee and owned branch network 
(“Network Income”) reached £38.9 million in 2017 (2016: £35.4 million) 
a 10% increase on the previous year. Our average branch revenue 
is £182,000 (2016: £190,000). This was a tremendous achievement 
against the background of national sales activity having reduced by 15% 
for the year
1
. We have out-performed the market each year over the 
last three years by on average 10%. Our adjusted EBITDA reached 
£2.23 million (2016: £2.06 million) an increase of 8% on the previous 
year. Adjusted EPS is 5.84p (2016: 5.92p). 
We have out-performed the market each year over 
the last three years by on average 10%. 
Our model is about both the number and the underlying performance 
of our branches. We invest a great deal of time and resource helping 
to improve each branch’s revenue. Our outperformance against the 
market per branch reflects that investment, those improvements and 
then the underlying increased strength of the component parts of our 
network. This is not just a short-term success but a long-term strategy. 
Independent agents that converted to the Hunters brand during the 
three years to December 2015 have produced revenue in 2017 that 
is 29% higher; illustrating that our well known national brand, quality 
and good reputation has delivered improved revenue for our network

partners, even against a challenging backdrop as well as significantly 
reducing their cost of key operating costs, such as portal subscriptions, 
through our economies of scale and purchasing power. 
Customer satisfaction is always a key measure and at 95% customer 
satisfaction rating over the year (2016: 96%) is our sixth year in a row at 
over 90%, which remains significantly higher than the industry average 
of 73%

. Our business and our network partners commit to deliver 
for our customers. This underpins our belief that business owners will 
work harder and deliver better results than a network of employees, 
self-employed operatives on short-term contracts or those engaged to 
simply list a home rather than actually selling or letting a property. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone in the network who 
has worked so hard to deliver these excellent results and our customer 
service teams for working with our clients to help us “get them there”.
CURRENT TRADING & OUTLOOK
We expect the current subdued levels of transactions to continue 
in 2018. Hunters’ performance to date in the year is in line with the 
Board’s expectations, given our more limited London exposure 
we are not expecting to be as affected as other players have 
reported already

 although we have built in an increase in churn 
for consolidation within this sector. We would expect this market 
to provide us with an enhanced opportunity to expand our 
branch network further and strengthen our brand. The case to 
encourage independent operators becomes even more persuasive 
in providing a way to be part of a stronger group that can also offer 
significant cost reductions, particularly in terms of portal charges for 
Rightmove, Zoopla and OnTheMarket. 
We are already seeing an improved level of enquiries from high 
quality independent businesses. Our robust balance sheet and 
relatively low level of gearing will enable us to both expand our 
network and reward shareholders with an attractive dividend. 
Our pipeline of new outlets remains healthy and I look forward to 
updating you as the year progresses.
DIVIDEND
The Company is committed to a progressive dividend policy and 
proposes an increased final dividend of 1.50p per share, making 
2.20p for the year, an increase of 16%.
