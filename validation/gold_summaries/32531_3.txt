 04 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017
This is my first review as Chairman of Oxford 
Instruments plc, a position I am delighted to 
have taken on at our AGM in September. 
It has been a year of structural, operational 
and strategic transition for the Group. We 
have a new and energised senior executive 
team led by Ian Barkshire and Gavin Hill. 
They have acted with impressive decisiveness 
in embedding a number of changes in our 
operating teams to raise the talent bar across 
our business.
We have also made good progress in 
developing and implementing the new 
Horizon strategy to reposition our Group 
for long‑term sustainable growth. This has 
seen some significant actions to manage 
our portfolio of businesses with the aim of 
accelerating our delivery of shareholder value. 
In November, we announced the disposal of 
our underperforming wire business, Oxford 
Superconducting Technology, and since the 
year end, we have announced the agreed sale 
of our Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi 
High‑Technologies. 
Chairman’s Statement
As Ian Barkshire sets out in his Chief 
Executive’s Review, the management 
team is now implementing the next phase 
of the Horizon strategy to continue the 
transformation of Oxford Instruments. This is 
focused around the two anchors of returning 
to sustainable growth and improving margins 
by concentrating on market segments with 
long‑term growth drivers where we have 
the potential to become the market leader.
The business delivered a stable performance in line  
with our expectations against an extremely challenging 
market backdrop.
We have made good 
progress in developing 
and implementing the 
new Horizon strategy.

Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 05
Against this background of strategic 
activity, the team maintained the focus 
on short‑term performance. The business 
delivered a stable performance in line with 
our expectations against an extremely 
challenging market backdrop of slower 
academic funding in the US and Europe and 
the anticipated deterioration in the financial 
performance of our OI Healthcare business. 
Our NanoTechnology Tools sector performed 
strongly and we saw good returns from the 
servicing of our own products. These growth 
businesses provide the platform for our 
future growth.
Adjusted basic earnings per share on a 
continuing basis grew by 5.5%. However, 
taking into account the impact on the Group 
of business disposals, currency effects and 
our progressive strengthening of the balance 
sheet, the Board has proposed to hold the 
dividend at last year’s level. This results in a 
final dividend of 9.3 pence (2016: 9.3 pence) 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 
13.0 pence (2016: 13.0 pence).
I am pleased that Stephen Blair will join the 
Board on 1 July 2017 as Senior Independent 
Director. He brings with him a wide range of 
international experience and sound technical 
understanding that was gained during his time 
at a number of top technical companies, such 
as e2v and Spectris. 
Finally, I would like to thank the Board for their 
ongoing support during this time of change 
and for their commitment to repositioning 
Oxford Instruments to deliver long‑term 
profitable growth, providing sustainable 
value for our Shareholders.

Chairman
