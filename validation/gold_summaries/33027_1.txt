we do and how we do it.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 8 Chief Executive Officer’s Review
AstraZeneca has a proud tradition of 
developing great medicines that make  
a meaningful difference to patient health. 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to 
developing innovative and valued medicines 
that improve the health of people around  
the world, benefit society and provide an 
acceptable return for our shareholders. 
In my review I want to outline some of the 
steps we took and decisions we made in 
2011 to secure our future business success.

A trusted partner
We cannot secure our success if we do not have good relationships 
with those with whom we do business. Trust is critical to achieving 
this: we need to connect with our stakeholders, including patients, 
physicians, regulators, governments and payers, if we are to 
understand their needs and challenges. We also need to earn and 
maintain the trust of our customers, partners and other stakeholders. 
This requires us to do things in the right way and to behave in 
accordance with our core values. 
That is why I set such store by our Global External Interactions Policy, 
launched in April 2011, which provides a single, common, principle-
based approach to all our interactions worldwide with public officials, 
healthcare professionals and community organisations. The introduction 
of the policy drove changes in the way we market and sell our products 
and I believe we now lead the industry in this area of business.
Our commitment to acting responsibly and the sustainable 
development of our Group was further reinforced in 2011 by the 
publication of our new Responsible Business Plan, which is closely 
aligned to our business strategy and its priorities.
The growing importance of compliance and ethics to our reputation 
and business operations was demonstrated during the year by the 
appointment of Katarina Ageborg, our new Chief Compliance Officer, 
to the SET.
World class Research and Development
At the core of our strategy to be a focused, integrated, innovation-
driven, global, prescription-based biopharmaceutical business is  
the need to have an R&D function with world class productivity. In his 
Chairman’s Statement on page 6, Louis Schweitzer outlined how we 
are redoubling our efforts to deliver this through the use of innovative 
and collaborative ways of working. Our focus is on ensuring more 
effective and efficient delivery of our research objectives across our 
therapeutic portfolio. 
Our results in 2011 were mixed. We were pleased by the FDA’s 
approval in July of Brilinta, our treatment for acute coronary 
syndromes. Brilinta, or Brilique, its trade name in Europe, is now 
approved in 64 countries, launched in 37 and under review in a further 
39. Also on a positive note, Caprelsa (vandetanib), for the treatment of 
thyroid cancer, has been launched in the US and received a positive 
CHMP opinion in the EU. Axanum, for the prevention of cardiovascular 
events, Komboglyze
TM
, for diabetes, and Fluenz, our influenza vaccine, 
were also approved in the EU. In Japan, both Nexium and Faslodex 
were launched following approvals earlier in the year.
During 2011, two of the Phase III trials for TC-5214, our neuroscience 
collaboration with Targacept, did not meet their primary endpoint.  
In December, we also announced that our investigational compound 
olaparib (AZD2281) for the treatment of ovarian cancer will not 
progress into Phase III. As a result of these two events we recorded  
an impairment charge of $435 million.
We were also disappointed during the year by the withdrawal of 
zibotentan (for prostate cancer). Axanum was also withdrawn in the 
US. In January 2012, we received a Complete Response Letter from 
the FDA for our submission for dapagliflozin. We, together with BMS, 
remain committed to this treatment for diabetes and will work closely 
with the FDA to provide additional clinical data.
Increased collaboration
Our focus on developing in-house capabilities is matched by our 
desire to develop a more outward-looking organisation committed to 
accessing the best science, regardless of its origin. Indeed, six of our 
nine projects in Phase III/Registration and 12 out of 24 in Phase II were 
sourced externally. 
During 2011, we completed a number of transactions to strengthen 
our long-term development. These included the in-licensing of 
tremelimumab from Pfizer, and our groundbreaking collaboration  
with the UK Medical Research Council providing academic 
researchers with access to over 20 AstraZeneca compounds.  
Our plans for R&D will see us build further on this collaborative  
way of working.
Global orientation
Our future success requires us to develop global strategies to 
commercialise our products effectively. These need to be tailored  
to local needs in both mature and emerging markets. 
As part of that drive, we announced our decision to invest $200 million 
in a manufacturing facility in China and our agreement to acquire a 
Chinese company that will give us access to a portfolio of medicines 
used to treat infections. In Russia, we invested $150 million in a 
manufacturing plant and announced plans to establish a new 
predictive science centre.
We are also committed to playing our part in the global challenge  
of providing sustainable access to healthcare for all those who need  
it. Our strategy recognises the complexities surrounding the issue 
which range from the affordability of medicines to the availability of 
healthcare systems and the resources to make them effective. 
Stronger customer orientation
As the Chairman noted, there is no let up in sight on the downward 
pressure we face on the price of medicines. More than ever, we need 
to demonstrate their value to those who buy them. Our collaborations 
with HealthCore and IMS will help us undertake ‘real world’ studies to 
understand how to treat disease most effectively and economically. 
We also need to undertake more studies such as the Brilinta PLATO 
study demonstrating that, even at a higher price, it is a more cost 
effective treatment than the generic alternative.
Equally, we need to recognise the changing shape of healthcare 
systems. Those who work in them are working more intensively and 
with less time to research medicines. We are therefore piloting new 
ways of working to meet their needs. These include the use of digital 
channels which offer information that is available when it is needed, 
and without having to leave the office.
Operational efficiency
Our continued drive for operational efficiency is typified by the  
design and construction of our new plant in China, which is using 
‘Lean’ production principles from the outset. We are also streamlining 
processes and moving to a more flexible cost base in order to  
remain competitive.
As we reshape our business to meet the needs of our customers 
efficiently, we are seeing reductions in the workforce across much of 
our organisation, particularly in our mature Established Markets and in 
our R&D organisation. This reshaping includes plans for further R&D 
site consolidation. These are difficult decisions as they go to the heart 
of AstraZeneca, our people. Where possible, we seek to redeploy staff 
or assist with outplacement and, together with my colleagues, I remain 
committed to managing these changes in the right way, in accordance 
with local employment laws, our standards and core values.
A confident future
Our industry is undergoing a period of fundamental change. If we are 
to be one of the winners in the sector we need to make the necessary 
changes both to what we do and how we do it. I am confident that 
within AstraZeneca we have people with the skills to do that and pay 
tribute to their continued efforts in 2011 to ensure we deliver on our 
commitments to patients, society and our shareholders. I look forward 
to working with them to build on those efforts in 2012.
