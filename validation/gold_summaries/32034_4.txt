 EVOLVING OUR BUSINESS
Frontier’s objective of transitioning to a business-to-consumer video game 
developer with multiple self-published revenue generating franchises has 
been successfully completed. The launch of our second franchise, Planet 
Coaster, combined with continued strong performance from Elite Dangerous 
drove a step-up in all financial measures. Our third franchise, based on the 
Jurassic World movie franchise, is on track for launch in summer 2018. 
After successfully proving our ability to launch franchises, our ambition is to 
continue our evolution to create a self-publishing multi-franchise success story. 
Ongoing investment in our people, organisation and facilities, supported by the 
proceeds from the £17.7 million strategic investment by Tencent completed in 
July 2017, will enable the business to continue scaling up.
