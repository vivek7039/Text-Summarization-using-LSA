 “Our objective is to become one of the leading 
hotel groups in the Caribbean in order to 
deliver sustainable investor returns”
Simon Sherwood 
Chairman
T
he Group has 
delivered a solid 
performance 
in the financial year 
ended 30 September 
2017 against a 
background of changed 
market conditions. 
We were encouraged 
to see occupancy 
recover in H2 2017 
which, together with the 
addition of Waves Hotel 
to the portfolio, led to a 
revenue increase of 5% 
over 2016.
The team remains firmly focused 
on delivering our strategy, and we 
are pleased with the operational 
progress that has been made during 
the year. We have continued to strive 
for day-to-day excellence, investing 
in our people and systems to ensure 
that our hotels continue to provide 
exceptional guest experiences, as 
well as successfully expanding our 
sales and marketing presence in the 
US in order to drive further growth in 
visitor numbers from that market. 
We have also continued with 
our programme of refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing elements 
of the existing portfolio. This has 
included enhancements to The 
House, which re-opened in October 
2017 after being closed for six weeks, 
and the addition of new food and 
beverage outlets at two of our 
all-inclusive properties – Crystal 
Cove and Turtle Beach. Daphne’s, 
our beachfront restaurant, was also 
closed for renovation for six weeks 
in H1.
During the year, we expanded 
outside of Barbados through a 
management contract for Hodges 
Bay Resort & Spa (Hodges Bay) in 
Antigua and a sales and marketing 
contract for The Landings Resort 
& Spa (The Landings) in St Lucia. 
The Landings contract is progressing 
well and enables us to expand our 
sales and marketing footprint.
The construction of Hodges Bay 
is currently taking longer than 
expected but we’re pleased that the 
owners are ensuring that this product 
is built to the highest standards. 
We continue to believe that 
management contracts and sales 
and marketing agreements represent 
compelling opportunities.
In April we were pleased to acquire 
Treasure Beach hotel, a 4-star 
35-suite hotel next to our existing 
Tamarind hotel. On its re-opening 
towards the end of 2017, Elegant 
Hotels’ properties account for a 
continuous 300 metre stretch of 
the prestigious “Platinum Coast” 
of Barbados.
I was pleased to welcome two new 
additions to our Board this year. 
Jeff Singleton joined the Group as 
Chief Financial Officer in December 
2016 and was appointed to the 
Board in March 2017. Jeff brings 
significant industry and listed-
company experience and since his 
arrival has focused on restructuring 
the finance function and improving 
risk management, internal controls 
and management information. 
Luke Johnson joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director in May 2017, 
adding his significant hospitality 
experience and business skills to 
the Board.
Details about how the Board and its 
Committees have discharged their 
corporate governance duties during 
the year are outlined in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 26 
to 27. As the business matures, the 
Board is focussing on the continued 
development and dissemination of 
our corporate culture throughout 
the Group, and looks forward to 
reporting on this further in the 
coming financial year. 
4 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW Elegant Hotels Group set out its 
dividend policy at the time of IPO in 
May 2015. Since then, we have paid 
cumulative dividends of 14 pence 
per share, while seeing a significant 
shift in the market largely due to the 
devaluation of Sterling compared 
to the US dollar. We have also taken 
advantage of multiple expansion 
and strategic opportunities 
including Waves Hotel & Spa and 
Treasure Beach.
Our objective is to become one of the 
leading hotel groups in the Caribbean 
in order to deliver sustainable 
investor returns. To achieve this, 
the Group must reinvest in its 
business model and ensure that it 
is well placed to capitalise on the 
numerous opportunities that we see 
for expansion. 
Given the current market 
opportunities and the need to 
reinvest in our properties in an 
increasingly competitive market, the 
Board is recommending a reduction 
in our final dividend to 1.75p for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 from 
3.5p in the prior year. This equates 
to a full-year dividend of 5.25p for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 
versus 7.0p in the prior year. 
Going forward, the Group intends 
to pay a full year dividend of 
4.0p for the financial year ending 
30 September 2018, split into a one 
third interim payment and two thirds 
final dividend payment. As always, 
the payment of dividends will be 
subject to the discretion of the Board 
and to the Company having sufficient 
distributable reserves.
Finally, the Board and I would like to 
thank our customers, management, 
staff and shareholders for their 
continued support and contributions 
to the Group’s success.
