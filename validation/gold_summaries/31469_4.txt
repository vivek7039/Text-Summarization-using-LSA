 SECURITY SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY (77%)
Market
G4S operates an integrated security business in more 
than 90 countries across the globe. The global security 
market has structural growth qualities (see page 8 for  
a description of the growth drivers) and is highly 
fragmented; there are few international suppliers and 
our competitors are typically smaller local and regional 
companies. The security industry is seeing growing 
demand for technology-enabled and integrated security 
solutions (which combine people and technology)  
to deliver cost-effective security, especially in  
developed markets.
Our approach
Against the backdrop of growing demand, we design, 
market and deliver a wide range of security and related 
services and our global footprint provides valuable 
access to a highly-diversified customer base in markets 
around the world. Some traditional security markets are 
commoditised and significant price competition exists 
– we aim to differentiate G4S by providing industry-
leading security solutions that are innovative, reliable and 
efficient. Our scale and focus on productivity support, 
our cost competitiveness and our sustained investment 
in professional staff, technology, software and systems 
enable us to provide innovative and reliable solutions  
for our customers on a stand-alone or integrated basis.

G4S at a glance
SECURING YOUR WORLD
G4S is the world’s leading global, integrated security 
company specialising in the delivery of security and 
related services across six continents.
We offer a broad range of security products and 
services on a single, multi‑service and integrated basis. 
We have been investing in technology, software and 
systems. The Group’s technology‑related security 
revenues were £2.45 billion* in 2017 (2016: £2.2 billion).  
OUR BUSINESSES
Market
G4S Care & Justice Services are concentrated in the  
UK and Australia. The market for the private provision 
of care and justice services is fairly consolidated with a 
small number of large providers. Larger companies are 
usually better equipped to deliver the highly specialised 
services in this sector, working with a diverse supply 
chain including the voluntary sector. In the UK the 
market environment is mature with limited growth 
opportunities. In the short to medium term we expect 
the environment to be more positive in Australia.
Our approach
We aim to achieve positive outcomes for those in the 
care and justice system. G4S will only offer custody, 
detention, rehabilitation and care services where we  
can access a qualified talent pool and where the  
political, legal, human rights and regulatory framework 
is consistent with our Group values and results in 
acceptable operational, commercial and reputational risk. 
Market
G4S Cash Solutions is one of a small number of large, 
global cash businesses and is the market leader or 
number two in 40 of its 42 markets. Each market is 
highly regulated, often by central banks, and the business 
requires significant infrastructure and expertise. G4S 
competes with local, national and a small number  
of international competitors. Cash volumes in most 
developed markets are flat or gradually declining at an 
aggregate market level. Cash usage continues to increase 
in emerging markets (see page 8 for cash usage trends). 
The Group sees significant revenue-growth opportunities 
in providing technology solutions to reduce the cost and 
increase the ease of using cash for banks and retailers.
Our approach
We transport, process, recycle, store securely and 
manage cash, and provide secure international logistics 
for cash and valuables. Our strategy is designed to 
enable us to aggregate cash-handling volumes through 
cost leadership and product and service differentiation.
We invest in technology and sell proprietary  
cash-management systems which combine skilled 
professionals with software, hardware and operational 
support in an integrated, managed service. To support 
cost leadership we strive for a consistent operating 
model and use shared services to maximise efficiency.
We operate around the globe, focusing on markets 
where we are able to build and sustain a material 
market share in our key service offerings. Outside  
the traditional cash market, there remains significant 
opportunity for retail cash and bank branch automation 
– services that have mainly remained in-house until now.
