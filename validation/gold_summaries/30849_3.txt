Chairman’s statement
In 2018 we celebrate 25 years since the 
launch of the company in January 1993. The 
core of the company’s success remains the 
distinctive Admiral culture which drives 
the way that our people work and serve our 
customers in the UK, Italy, Spain, France and 
the US.
2006
“ On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all the 9,600 people at Admiral for  
their continued hard work and contribution to a record-breaking set of results  
for the Group in 2017.”
I am delighted and honoured to have taken 
over the helm as the Chairman of Admiral 
at the AGM in April 2017. My predecessor, 
Alastair Lyons, who ably steered the ship for 
over 16 years, has left some large shoes to 
fill. I would like to thank him for his service 
and enabling a smooth transition.
As Chairman of the Group I will focus my 
efforts on: 
• Continuing to build on the remarkably 
special Admiral culture and in so doing 
putting our people and customers at  
the heart of what we do
• Continuing the history of growth, 
profitability and innovation
• Investing in the development and  
growth of our people
• Ensuring excellent governance 
and the highest standards.
2017 Overview
Admiral Group has delivered another record 
set of results in 2017: record turnover and 
profit, strong return on capital, strong 
solvency ratio and record customer numbers.
The Group has continued to grow strongly 
with turnover increasing by 15% to £2.96 
billion. Customer numbers increased 11% to 
over 5.7 million.
The Group’s share of pre-tax profit increased 
by 43% to £405.4 million. Earnings per share 
and return on equity both increased by 49% 
to 117.2 pence and 55% respectively. The 
Group’s solvency ratio remains very strong 
at 205%.
In UK Insurance, there was another strong 
performance from the Group’s core UK 
Motor business where the number of insured 
vehicles grew by 8% to 3.96 million. In line 
with usual trends, profitability benefited 
from significant prior year reserve releases.

Strategic Report: Chairman’s statement Whilst we devote time and resources to 
exploring new opportunities outside of car 
insurance we also recognise that this remains 
our core focus. We continue to invest heavily 
in improving our core skills as evidenced 
by our continuing growth in premiums and 
profit. We also have a range of innovations 
including car sharing insurance, learner 
driver insurance and we remain the largest 
telematics provider in the UK.
There is still a backdrop of uncertainty in 
our largest business, UK Car, due to the 
continued deliberations over the Ogden rate 
affecting large personal injury claims. We 
expect to see some conclusions on the way 
forward in 2018. In the meantime, we have 
taken a prudent approach and reflected the 
current discount rate in our reserves.
Household Insurance continues to grow 
apace. Turnover is now £107.1 million and 
properties insured have increased by 41% 
to 0.7 million. Customers buy from us either 
using price comparison sites, directly and, 
increasingly, using our MultiCover offering, 
building on the success of MultiCar.
2017 saw the successful launch of our in-
house underwritten van insurance product 
and, most recently, the launch of our new 
travel insurance product.
Most significantly, we have launched 
personal loans, firstly unsecured, then car 
finance as part of our new Admiral Financial 
Services business. We expect this to be an 
increasingly significant part of our business 
in future.
We are continuing to invest in our overseas 
insurance businesses, bearing fruit with 
reduced losses overall (despite the impact of 
Hurricane Harvey in the US) and another year 
of profits in ConTe. Turnover and customer 
numbers are continuing to grow materially 
by some 23% and 20% respectively and we 
now have £0.5 billion of combined turnover 
and over one million customers outside 
the UK. We believe we are on the cusp of 
delivering long term profit for the Group.
As a result of Brexit, we are exploring 
establishing an insurance company and an 
insurance intermediary business in Spain to 
support our European operations.
In our Price Comparison (PC) businesses, 
Confused.com in the UK continues to face a 
competitive and challenging market, whilst 
it implements its new Drivers Win strategy; 
this is offset by encouraging growth in 
Compare.com in the US and record profits at 
Rastreator and LeLynx, with all PC businesses 
delivering an improved customer experience. 
Our joint venture Preminen PC business 
continues to explore new opportunities 
and has recently established operations in 
Mexico and is soon to be in Turkey.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction What makes Admiral different?
Our successful model which has been 
maintained since launch is definitely worth 
a further mention. It can be distilled into  
the following areas:
• Highly talented team – David Stevens 
leads a strong, capable and experienced 
management team which engages the 
whole business
• Focus – targeted diversification building 
on our core skills
• Pricing – data analysis lies at the heart  
of what we do
• Prudent reserving – continuing our 
conservative approach to claims reserving
• Claims management – consistent positive 
feedback from customers on the service 
they receive
• Controlled test and learn – organic growth 
with measured expansion steps
• Low-cost approach – constantly 
challenging ourselves on how we can  
do things more cost effectively 
• Shareholder returns – we believe in 
returning excess capital to shareholders.
Overall we believe that people who like what 
they do, do it better.
Dividend
The Directors have proposed a final dividend 
of 58.0 pence per share (2016: 51.5 pence) for 
the year to 31 December 2017, representing 
a distribution of 97% of our second half 
earnings. This included a normal dividend 
(65% of post-tax profits) of 39.5 pence per 
share and a further special dividend of 18.5 
pence per share comprising earnings not 
required to be held in the Group for solvency 
or buffers.
This will bring the total dividend for the year 
to 114.0 pence per share, an overall increase 
of 11% (excluding the additional return 
of surplus capital in 2016) and the 13th 
consecutive year that Admiral has paid  
an increased dividend. This represents a  
payout ratio of 97%.
The business has delivered a Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of 382% over  
the last 9 years (as illustrated in the chart  
on page 79).
Corporate governance 
and Board changes
The Board recognises the need for a strong 
corporate governance framework and 
supporting processes across the Group and 
believes that good governance, with tone 
set from the top, is a key factor in delivering 
sustainable business performance and 
creating value for all the Group’s stakeholders.
The Board and I feel that the Board has 
a good balance of experience, skills and 
knowledge to support and challenge the 
management team and it is supported by 
effective governance and control systems. 
During the year the Board undertook a 
review of its effectiveness. Further details 
are provided in the Governance Report on 
pages 46 to 81.
Admiral’s incentive schemes remain 
distinctive, as every employee is a shareholder. 
They are designed to ensure that decisions 
are made by management to support long-
term growth, that the right behaviours are 
rewarded and that our people’s interests 
are aligned with those of shareholders. Our 
core belief is that over the long-term, share 
appreciation depends on delivering great 
outcomes for our customers. Further details 
are provided in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 62 to 81.
