 Chief Executive’s strategic review
Review of the year
Vodafone’s transformation into a leading 
converged operator in our developed markets 
made further progress this year, while long-
lasting tailwinds from rising smartphone 
penetration and data services adoption drove 
growth in our emerging markets. This was 
supported by our strategic differentiators – 
Network Leadership, Customer eXperience 
eXcellence, and outstanding people – 
together with improved cost efficiency. 
Overall, I am pleased to report that the 
Group’s commercial and financial performance 
has further improved, although on a reported 
basis this was masked by currency headwinds.
Network Leadership:  
building a “Gigabit Vodafone”
After the large investments made during 
Project Spring, this year our capital spending, 
measured as a percentage of our revenues, 
returned to a sustainable “mid-teens” level. 
Even so, we continued to record improved 
mobile network performance relative 
to smaller competitors in almost all of our 
markets. This performance gap is critical, 
as by providing a differentiated experience 
to our customers we can justify a price 
premium relative to discounters. We now have 
the leading or co-leading data network in 14 
out of the 21 markets in which independent 
tests are available, and all 21 for voice.
We aim to improve our customers’ experience 
even further with the introduction of “Gigabit 
LTE” – also sometimes described as “ 4G+” 
– in the coming years. In addition, we will 
upgrade our cable and fibre next-generation 
networks (which now pass 36 million  
homes, including the VodafoneZiggo JV in  
the Netherlands) to provide gigabit speeds, 
differentiating our services from those 
provided by copper-based incumbents.
Customer eXperience 
eXcellence: our formula  
for differentiation
Providing an outstanding customer experience 
is critical if we are to capitalise fully on our 
network advantage. 
We aim to ensure that all of our customers 
experience reliable Connectivity, Always 
enjoy excellent value, are Rewarded for their 
loyalty, and receive Easy access to support 
when they need it. This ‘CARE’ formula, 
systematically introduced since 2015 across 
all of our operations, is designed to provide our 
customers with an excellent experience that 
is unique to Vodafone. We measure our progress 
regularly, using the Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) 
methodology. I am very pleased that we have 
further extended our advantage during the 
past year. We are now the leader or co-leader 
in 1 9 out of 21 markets, with an average NPS 
“gap” to the third placed player of 17 points. 
A year ago, we were a leader or co-leader in just 
13 markets, with a gap of 14 points. In the UK, 
this is not yet the case; we have recovered 
a leadership position in terms of network 
performance and have significantly reduced 
customer complaints, but we still lag the 
competition in our overall customer perception. 
We are confident that our recovery ‘CARE’ plan 
will improve the situation in the UK as well.
Vodafone-Idea: a new  
champion of Digital India
The entrance of a new operator in India offering 
4G services for free has created industry 
turbulence, leading us to take an impairment 
charge of €3.7 billion net of tax. We have 
moved strategically to face the new context 
by proposing to merge Vodafone India with 
Idea Cellular, the number 3 operator in India , 
which will create a new market leader with 
the scale to invest in India’s digital future, while 
also capturing an estimated US$ 10 billion NPV 
in synergies. 
We will jointly control the new combined 
company in partnership with Idea’s founding 
shareholder, the Aditya Birla Group, a leading 
Indian-based international conglomerate. 
We will own 45.1%, the Adityla Birla 
Group 26.0% and Idea’s current minority 
shareholders will own the remaining 28.9%. 
We have agreed a mechanism with the Aditya 
Birla Group to equalise our shareholdings over 
time. The transaction is subject to regulatory 
approvals and is expected to complete during 
calendar year 2018. 
The new company will maintain Idea’s  
listing on the BSE/NSE exchanges in India, 
providing a public market valuation for this 
important asset.
Improved commercial  
and financial results
Overall, the investments made both during 
and after Project Spring are paying off, 
and I am pleased to report another year 
of improved commercial performance and 
increased organic revenue and adjusted 
EBITDA growth for the Group’s operations 
in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
We remain Europe’ s fastest growing broadband 
operator, with 1.2 million broadband net additions 
during the year, a healthy 1. 1 million increase 
in contract mobile customers, and a 0.7 million 
increase in our converged (fixed plus mobile) 
customer base. An improved overall customer 
experience allowed us to introduce “more-for -
more” propositions, in which customers received 
greater value for a higher monthly payment. 
As a result, consumer contract ARPU stabilised 
after many years of decline.
This good performance was reflected 
in European service revenue growth of 0.6%* vs. 
-0.6%* last year. All major markets grew during 
the year, except the UK. In AMAP , we enjoyed 
another year of strong growth in customers, 
usage and local currency revenues (up 7 .7%* 
in organic terms vs. 8.0%* last year). 
A stronger overall organic service revenue 
performance translated into even faster organic 
adjusted EBITDA growth (up 5.8%* vs. 2.3%* last 
year) thanks to good progress on cost efficiency, 
which Nick Read describes on page 16.
None of these achievements would have  
been possible without the talent and 
dedication of our people, supported by the 
values of speed, simplicity and trust which 
we call “The Vodafone Way”.

Building a converged 
communications leader
Our focus on delivering an excellent customer experience has 
delivered further improvements in our overall commercial and 
financial performance during the year.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 12 “More-for-more” initiatives to drive usage and revenue
Over the course of last year we introduced a series of more-for-more offers, 
which typically offer more data in return for a higher monthly fee. As an example, 
in Germany, we recently launched new plans offering more data and a data 
rollover facility, providing customers with the ability to carry over their unused 
data allowance from the prior month. In Vodacom, our innovative “micro-bundling” 
strategy allows customers to purchase data in affordable hourly, daily or weekly 
bundles. These offers typically mean customers generate a lower revenue per 
unit of data, but stabilise or increase average revenue per user.
Data
Providing the best mobile data experience
We aim to provide a leading mobile data 
experience in all of our markets, in order 
to capitalise on the huge demand for mobile 
internet connectivity from both consumer and 
enterprise customers, and to differentiate our 
service from lower quality discount providers.
During the financial year, demand for data 
continued to grow very strongly, with over 
2,700 petabytes of data carried across our 
mobile networks (including India, JVs and 
associates). This was an absolute increase 
in traffic this year of 995 petabytes, which 
was greater than the total traffic carried 
on the network last year. Growth was driven 
by continued adoption of 4G, with 28 million 
customers added during the year bringing the 
total base to 75 million at the end of March. 
This represented 33% of our active data 
users. With bigger touchscreens and faster 
speeds, the customer experience improves 
significantly (particularly for video). As a result, 
4G smartphones typically drive a two to three 
times increase in data usage compared to 3G.
Bigger bundle sizes also contributed to  
usage growth, as we successfully introduced 
“more-for-more” propositions (typically 
offering our customers larger data allowances 
for a higher monthly payment) across most 
of our markets during the year. The success 
of these initiatives was a key driver of our 
improved revenue growth momentum 
compared to the prior year.
In developing markets, which typically lack 
extensive fixed infrastructure, demand for 
internet access via mobile is a long-lasting 
driver of data consumption and revenue 
growth. Data users continued to grow during 
the year, by nine million to 153 million 
(including India), although the launch of free 
services by Reliance Jio in India dragged on our 
data customer growth during the second half. 
Consequently, the largest driver of data growth 
was increased usage levels by data customers. 
As in developed markets, new technologies 
drive higher usage: on average, a 2G customer 
uses 0.2 GB per month; a 3G customer 0.9 GB; 
and a 4G customer 1.7 GB. 
During the coming financial year we will begin 
trials of “Gigabit LTE” / 4G+ services, which will 
deliver further significant gains in data speeds 
along with lower latency (quick reaction time). 
As the new technology will be based on the 
broad and deep 4G network built during 
Project Spring, the incremental cost to achieve 
these gains is expected to be relatively 
modest. We are preparing for 5G by building 
fibre connections to over 95% of urban sites 
in Europe. Additional 5G radio investments will 
only be made once the technology is mature 
and the business case is robust.
Context
 – Smartphone penetration is growing 
rapidly, leading to increasing demand 
for mobile data. 63% of our customers 
have a smartphone in Europe, compared 
to 59% last year
 – Data usage is increasingly driven by the 
demand for high-definition video, 
which requires fast download speeds 
for a great user experience. Data traffic 
increased 65% during the year
 – Users want to use data without worrying 
about unexpected costs whether using 
their mobiles at home or abroad
What we’re aiming for 
 – We’re encouraging more data usage 
with our more-for-more initiatives that 
provide extra data-related benefits for 
a small increment to the monthly fee
 – We want our customers to have the best 
data experience, so we now provide data 
download speeds of at least 3 Mbps – 
the requirement for high-definition video 
– for 92% of data sessions in Europe
 – We are encouraging our customers 
to move to 4G, which provides data 
speeds up to 10x faster than 3G and 
lower latency (quick reaction time) 
for a better user experience. We now 
have 75 million 4G customers, up from 
47 million a year ago
 – We want our customers to use data 
wherever they want, so our 4G roaming 
network now reaches 1 18 countries
 – We are preparing for 5G in the longer 
term by building more fibre connections 
to carry more data

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Convergence
Combining fixed and mobile
In developed markets, the trend towards 
convergence – the bundling of fixed and 
mobile services within a single contract – 
continues to accelerate, aided by commercial 
offers which typically provide either extra 
value, a financial discount or sometimes 
both of these incentives to customers who 
buy multiple products. Overall, we view this 
trend as a substantial growth opportunity 
for Vodafone. We are an established leader 
in mobile and our recent investments have 
positioned us as the leading challenger in fixed, 
with scope to gain significant profitable 
revenue market share by cross-selling fixed 
products to our mobile base. Additionally, 
churn rates for customers buying multiple 
products are substantially lower – so our 
success in winning fixed relationships is also 
expected to make our mobile base both more 
secure and more profitable over time. 
Our fixed network footprint continues 
to expand, and we are now able to reach 
over 96 million NGN homes in Europe, giving 
us the largest marketable reach of any 
operator. 36 million of these homes are 
connected by our own cable or fibre networks 
(including VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands). 
The remaining homes are mostly reached 
through wholesale relationships with the local 
incumbent operator. We plan to upgrade our 
own networks to deliver gigabit speeds over 
the coming years, which will further extend the 
competitive advantage we enjoy compared 
to slower copper-based incumbents.
Our progress this past year has been strong: 
we remained Europe’s fastest growing 
broadband company, winning 1.2 million 
new customers. Our total broadband 
customer base, including VodafoneZiggo, 
is now 17 .9 million, of which 16.6 million are 
in Europe. Four million of these customers 
are fully converged, with a further two million 
taking both a fixed and mobile service from 
Vodafone, but not yet benefiting from a single 
bill and/or a cross-product discount. We are 
highly focused on converting these customers 
onto fully converged bundles. Additionally, 
in the Netherlands, just 25% of Ziggo’s fixed 
customers take a Vodafone mobile product – 
a significant cross-selling opportunity for the 
new joint venture.
Succeeding in convergence also means 
providing a best-in-class TV experience. 
This past year we launched “Vodafone TV”and 
“Giga TV”, which are best-in-class TV platforms. 
We also started our journey towards 
consolidating our TV platforms, capturing scale 
efficiencies. Including VodafoneZiggo, we now 
have 14 million TV customers, of which eight 
million pay for advanced digital services. 
We aim to distribute premium content to these 
customers, but where possible we prefer 
to avoid exclusive content deals as these 
tend to drive up costs for the industry with 
no lasting competitive benefit.
Context
 – Customers increasingly want to use 
converged services – i.e. bundle fixed 
and mobile services together under 
a single contract – to easily share 
content between their mobile phone, 
tablet, laptop or TV
 – Access to TV programmes bundled 
with fixed broadband is an increasingly 
important driver of demand for 
converged services
 – The growing demand for converged 
services drives data usage, which in turn 
requires the combination of mobile and 
fibre infrastructure
What we’re aiming for 
 – We expect fixed revenue to grow 
as a percentage of our revenues, driven 
by convergence, which should also 
lead to higher customer loyalty and 
lower churn 
 – We aim to increase our revenue 
market share profitably 
in fixed communications
 – We seek to roll out more high-speed 
broadband services by deploying more 
fibre and working with strategic partners. 
We already reach 96 million households 
in Europe, up from 72 million last year
 – We’re aiming to expand our 
TV services, to complement the take 
up of broadband. We already have 
TV services in eight markets (including 
VodafoneZiggo)

Vodafone Spain – leading our transition to converged services
To date, the fastest take up of converged services – bundles of fixed, mobile or TV – 
has been in Spain. During the year, we added nearly 250,000 new converged customers 
taking us to 2.3 million in total. We have made two important steps to drive demand 
during the year. First, we added to the existing extensive range of TV content including 
football, Netflix, and over 120 TV channels, including launching HBO Spain. Second, 
we further expanded the number of homes passed with high-speed fibre to nearly 
19 million, representing 65% of households, by both deploying more fibre and 
by securing new wholesale arrangements.

Providing network connected, global cloud services
Enterprise customers are moving data and applications to the cloud to become smarter 
and more agile, reduce costs and optimise performance. By combining our strengths 
in fixed connectivity with our Cloud & Hosting portfolio, we are well placed to meet this 
demand and can provide simple, secure IT solutions. During the year, we have expanded 
our geographic presence and our cloud services are now live in seven markets across 
Europe, Africa, Asia and the USA. Combined with our network of partner facilities, we can 
serve businesses on a global scale and offer a consistent cloud experience across 
28 countries. During the year, revenue from Cloud & Hosting services grew 15%.
Enterprise remains a key driver of our business, 
representing approximately 30% of revenues. 
During the year our enterprise revenues 
continued to grow, in contrast to leading 
European peers who experienced a decline 
in their business. This outperformance 
reflects four important differences in our 
business composition and strategy compared 
to a “typical” incumbent operator position.
First, we operate in more international markets 
than all of our traditional telecom rivals, 
and as a result we have a cost advantage 
compared to nationally based competitors 
who are forced to wholesale at a higher cost 
in order to provide services outside their home 
market to multinational clients. This advantage 
in terms of our global reach is reflected in the 
strong performance of Vodafone Global 
Enterprise, which grew 3.0%* in the year. 
Second, the trend towards convergence 
represents an important opportunity for 
profitable revenue market share gains in fixed 
services for enterprise, where our market 
share is only around 7%. We have now built 
a global IP-VPN footprint which is on par with 
the largest global competitors, reaching 272 
Points of Presence in 73 countries. In addition, 
we are developing a range of adjacent 
services such as Cloud & Hosting and security 
solutions, to further increase our share 
of customers’ spending. Our early success 
is reflected in growth of 4.4% in non-mobile 
revenues during the year, which in total now 
account for 29% of our total enterprise sales. 
Third, we remain the market leader in the fast-
growing Internet of Things (‘Io T’) segment, which 
holds huge future potential, with 54 million 
devices connected on our IoT platform. 
In particular, our performance in the automotive 
segment remains strong, with BMW, Porsche 
and many others relying on our IoT solutions. 
We launched narrowband Io T in Spain, and have 
trials running in several countries. With seven 
times the coverage reach of existing GSM-based 
services and very low power consumption 
(devices could last up to ten years with a single 
AAA battery), this technology is likely to catalyse 
a new wave of innovation and industry growth. 
Finally, the composition of our revenues 
is different from many of our rivals. We have very 
limited exposure to declining fixed voice calling, 
or segments such as the UK public-sector which 
have been under pressure from government 
spending cuts; conversely, we enjoy strong 
growth in our emerging markets operations, 
for example with Vodacom achieving 12% 
enterprise growth during the year.
It is also important to recognise that there are 
challenges ahead. Our core European mobile 
revenues remain under pressure as a result of 
intense competition, so it is important that we 
diversify into fixed and related services. In addition, 
we have a number of legacy fixed contracts 
inherited from the Cable & Wireless acquisition 
that are not sufficiently profitable, reflecting 
a large number of costly legacy networks 
and associated products. These networks are 
being phased out, and customers migrated to 
modernised solutions, over the coming years.
