 Stride Gaming plc Annual report and financial statements 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
08
Chairman’s statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to update our 
stakeholders on what has been a successful year for 
Stride Gaming. The Group’s strong financial results for the 
year ended 31 August 2017 have been underpinned by further 
progress against our strategic objectives. Stride Gaming has 
grown its market share in its core UK bingo-led online gaming 
market, continued to develop new growth opportunities 
through product innovation, enhanced its proprietary technology 
platform and appraised attractive new markets for future 
expansion opportunities.
Results and dividend
The Group delivered a strong set of financial results in the year 
with net gaming revenue (“NGR”) up 18% on a pro-forma basis 
to £89.9 million (2016: pro-forma £76.4 million and reported 
£47.8 million). Like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA increased by 24% 
to £20.2 million (2016: pro-forma £16.3 million and reported 
£12.3 million) and like-for-like Adjusted earnings rose by 29% 
to £18.5 million (2016: pro-forma £14.3 million).
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a final dividend of 1.5p per share, subject to 
the approval of shareholders at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 1 February 2018. This final dividend, 
together with the interim dividend of 1.2p per share, brings the 
total dividend for the year ended 31 August 2017 to 2.7p per share.
Strategic progress
Stride’s progress during the year has continued to be 
underpinned by the Group’s first-class proprietary technology, 
leading business intelligence capabilities and clear focus on 
operating in markets where it is legal to do so. In the fast-growing 
and dynamic online gaming industry, the Board believes that 
these are key differentiators for the Group and, together, they 
underpin the Group’s strategy to develop as a leading online 
gaming operator. 
Revenue from the Group’s proprietary Real Money Gaming 
business increased by 39% during the year (2016: reported 31%) 
demonstrating the success of our multi-brand strategy as 
well as the integration of the transformational acquisitions 
of the 8Ball and Tarco brands, which are already delivering 
earnings-enhancing synergies.
Stride Gaming continues to innovate and appraise new products 
and markets where we see opportunities to leverage our expertise 
for further growth. During the year, we launched our B2B platform, 
Stride Together, which licences our proprietary platform to other 
operators, thereby enabling the Group to explore new growth 
opportunities both in the UK and globally.

Continuing to 
build momentum Annual report and financial statements 2017 Stride Gaming plc 09
Regulation continues to play a key role in shaping the online 
gaming industry, particularly in the UK. Whilst the Group is 
facing external industry pressures such as the second Point of 
Consumption tax applied to free bets, the introduction of GDPR 
legislation and potential changes to advertising regulations for 
gambling brands, the Board is very confident that Stride Gaming’s 
scale, technological edge and multi-brand strategy mean that 
we are very well positioned to continue to grow and take market 
share despite these pressures. 
Trading in the new financial year has started very well and the 
Board looks to the future with a high degree of confidence and 
enthusiasm. As a fast-growing and agile operator with leading 
technology and a focus on only regulated and legal markets, 
the Board believes that the Group remains very well positioned 
for further progress and continued growth.

Stride Together also signed its first joint venture partner, 
Aspers Casino to launch Aspers Casino Online, giving the 
established casino brand an online presence for the first time. 
Early indications from this new venture are encouraging. 
The Group is also pleased to announce that, post the period 
end, it has made a strategic investment in Passion Gaming, a 
Rummy-focused online operator based in India. This investment 
gives the Group an entry into a rapidly growing market with 
enormous potential for profitable growth.
Team 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank each of my colleagues for their hard work during the 
year. This has been a very busy year for the Group as we have 
integrated acquisitions, launched new products and adapted to 
regulatory changes whilst still delivering strong organic growth. 
These achievements speak volumes for the skill, talent and 
dedication of the people throughout the Company.
Regulation and responsibility 
The online gaming market is fast growing and dynamic and 
the Group’s firm focus remains on operating only in product 
verticals and markets where it is legal to do so. 
The Board is resolutely committed to best practice in responsible 
gaming and providing customers with the securest and most 
enjoyable entertainment possible across Stride Gaming’s brands. 
We believe that owning and developing our own proprietary 
technology is a key competitive advantage in such a dynamic 
market, enabling the Group to be agile, respond to market and 
regulatory changes effectively and successfully capture any 
growth opportunities that are presented.
Current trading and outlook
Building on the momentum of 2017, the Group will continue 
to invest in its proprietary technology and people to support 
Stride Gaming’s further growth. We remain focused on driving 
organic growth in our core UK real money gaming market 
whilst continuing to appraise acquisition opportunities and 
developing new products and markets.
Stride Gaming’s scale, 
technological edge and 
multi-brand strategy means 
that we are very well 
positioned to continue to 
grow and take market share.
