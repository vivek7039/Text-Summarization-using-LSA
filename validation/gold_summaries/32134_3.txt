 INTRODUCTION
Chairman's statement
Dear shareholder, 
2016/17 was a challenging year for the food industry 
generally and for the categories in which we operate.   
As a consequence, we announced in January 2017, 
that our financial results would be below expectation. 
However, management have moved quickly to adapt 
to the changing environment and refine our strategy to 
deliver more balanced progress in terms of revenue, 
cost efficiency and cash generation in the future.
Performance over the year
Group underlying sales for the financial period  
were £790.4m (-1.4%) and underlying Trading profit 
was £117.0m (-9.3%). Our performance was impacted 
by a change in retailer promotional strategies which 
reduced category volumes, a time lag in recovering 
input cost inflation and a period of warmer than  
usual weather which impacted Grocery in the  
second quarter.
We did nevertheless manage to grow market share 
for most of our core brands during the year and our 
International business continued to deliver excellent 
double-digit growth. As a result we have outperformed 
the majority of our peer group in the UK ambient 
grocery market during the last six months of the period. 
I’m also encouraged with the progress we’ve 
made with Nissin Foods following the co-operation 
agreement we signed in 2016. We’ve already started 
to distribute Nissin’s Soba brand of noodles in 
the UK and recently launched Batchelors Super 
Noodles in a pot format using Nissin’s technology 
and manufacturing expertise. Early signs are very 
encouraging. I’m also very pleased that we’ve been 
able to announce the signing of non-binding Heads 
of Terms with Mondelez International to renew our 
long-standing licence to produce Cadbury cakes  
in the coming years. 
After a period of lower food prices, rising commodity 
costs, compounded by the devaluation of Sterling 
following the EU referendum last year, led to the  
re-emergence of food price inflation in the UK.   
Management have worked hard to recover these 
cost increases through a combination of internal 
efficiencies, adjustments to promotional mechanics 
and, where necessary, limited price increases 
although it’s true to say this has not been easy and 
has taken longer than expected. 
To help us adapt to the challenging market,   
management announced a cost reduction and 
efficiency programme in January 2017, including 
both operational efficiencies in the supply chain and 
our head office functions. This is targeted to deliver 
cost savings of £20m over the next two years. As a 
consequence, we’ve streamlined our organisational 
structures and this has regrettably resulted in some 
colleagues leaving the business. I would like to thank 
them for their contribution, as well as thanking all 
colleagues for their hard work and commitment  
over the year.
I’m pleased to say that despite a changing market 
environment our commitment to sustainability has 
remained strong. We’ve made good progress in 
delivering the health commitments we announced 
in 2016, for instance in removing sugar from our 
products and launching healthier options. We’ve 
also been recognised externally for the progress 
we’ve made on animal welfare and sustainable palm 
oil and, encouragingly, we exceeded many of our 
environmental targets through improving our focus 
and efficiency.
Board changes
We welcomed Tsunao Kijima to the Board as 
a representative of Nissin Foods, our largest 
shareholder. Tsunao, who is Managing Executive 
Officer of Nissin, was appointed as a non-executive 
director in July 2016. 
In March 2017 we also announced the appointment 
of Daniel Wosner as a representative director of 
Oasis, an international investment firm who are now 
our second largest shareholder. Daniel is Managing 
Director and Head of Europe at Oasis and oversees 
the firm’s UK and Continental European investments. 
Both Tsunao's and Daniel’s experience will be  
a valuable addition to the Board as we look to 
enhance the Company’s long-term value for all  
our shareholders. 
Finally, you will be aware that in September 2016, I 
notified the Board of my intention to step down as 
Chairman during 2017, having spent nine years as a 
non-executive Director and the last five as Chairman. 
The search for a successor is underway led by Ian 
Krieger, Senior Independent Director and further 
details can be found on page 29.
Outlook
The last year has clearly been difficult for the 
business and the market looks to remain challenging 
in the year ahead. I believe management have moved 
swiftly to adapt to the current situation and put in 
place a robust plan which targets to deleverage the 
business to below 3x Net debt to EBITDA in the next 
three to four years through a more balanced focus on 
revenue growth, cost efficiency and cash generation.   
I would like to thank shareholders for their significant 
support for the Company during my tenure as 
Chairman. I remain confident in the effectiveness of 
our strategy, the strength of our brands, the quality  
of our customer relationships and the experience of 
our management team. I look forward to a bright  
future for Premier Foods.
