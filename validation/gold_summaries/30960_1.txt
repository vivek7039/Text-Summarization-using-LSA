 8 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
We were pleased to secure three 
long-term contracts and two short-
term contracts in 2017 in what 
continued to be a challenging 
market for our industry. 
The prolonged downturn affected both our 
vessel utilisation and charter rates (through 
deferral of contract awards, discussed 
further below, and suppressed demand)  
and is reflected in significantly reduced 
profitability reported by GMS for 2017.  
A more stable oil price environment is 
welcomed and it is encouraging to see 
increasing levels of enquiries and tender 
activity for our services in the Middle East 
and Europe.
Group financial performance
Revenue for the year was US$ 112.9 million 
(2016: US$ 179.4 million) and adjusted 
EBITDA was US$ 58.5 million (2016: US$ 
106.8 million). The Group’s continued focus 
on cost management helped to deliver an 
adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% (2016: 60%). 
Although the Company is reporting a statutory 
loss for the year of US$ 18.2 million (2016: 
net profit of US$ 29.4 million), the underlying 
performance after adjusting items, was  
a net profit for the year of US$ 4.8 million 
(2016: US$ 50.7 million). 
During the year we made certain amendments 
to our bank facility agreement that have 
provided the Group with increased liquidity 
and financial flexibility (further details can  
be found in the Financial Review). We were 
pleased to have the full support of our 
banking partners through this process and 
appreciate their confidence in our business.
Fleet utilisation and order book
Utilisation of our core fleet of 13 SESVs was 
61% in the year (2016: 70%), delivering an 
improvement of 13 percentage points on Q4 
2016. Demand has been relatively good for 
the Large Class and Mid-Size Class vessels 
in the current market, with both classes 
achieving utilisation above 70% for 2017 
(Small Class vessel utilisation was 53%).  
This has been a validation of the investment 
in these two vessel classes through our new 
build programme, and it is reassuring to see 
this demand continuing, with contracts in 
place for six of the seven vessels for charters 
from Q2 2018 onwards. 
 
While the extended tender processes and 
delayed contract awards we discussed  
in our Interim Results are continuing to be 
experienced, we have some satisfaction  
in having secured three new long-term 
contracts in the year: a 36-month charter  
for a Mid-Size Class vessel in the MENA 
region, and two charters for Large Class 
vessels totalling 41 months in Europe. Two 
eight-month charters for Large and Mid-Size 
Class vessels were also secured in the 
MENA region. It was particularly pleasing to 
be awarded a 16-month contract extension 
for a Small Class vessel in the MENA region 
in early 2018 by one of our longest standing 
clients. These charter awards, which include 
option periods, represent in excess of  
US$ 150 million of work for the Group. 
The secured backlog is US$ 160.6 million 
(including options) as at 1 March 2018.  
We are encouraged by how the Large and 
Mid-Size Class vessels are performing and 
are seeing utilisation for these trending 
upwards. As demand continues to recover, 
particularly in the MENA region, we would 
then expect to see a return to higher levels  
of utilisation for our Small Class vessels over 
time. The Board’s view for 2018 trading 
remains unchanged, with a gradual recovery 
in market conditions expected to be reflected 
in an improvement over our 2017 results.
Operations
We achieved an excellent safety performance in 
2017, with a total recordable injury rate of zero 
(2016: 0.20) and zero lost time injuries (2016: 
one lost time injury). The total number of man 
hours worked was 4.5 million in 2017 (2016: 
6.0 million man hours). Health, safety and the 
environment continues to be a top priority. 
In 2017 we rationalised our fleet by selling 
our two non-core anchor handling tugs and 
returning a leased vessel to its owner. We 
conducted a full impairment review of our 
fleet during the year, which resulted in a 
previously announced impairment charge of 
US$ 7.3 million on a 35-year-old vessel being 
recorded in the income statement. Our core 
SESV fleet now consists of 13 vessels, with 
an average age of just seven years. This 
makes our fleet one of the youngest in the 
industry, which benefits us in the current 
market environment as clients are expressing 
a preference for modern tonnage in most of 
the major tenders.  9 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
As our new build programme is now 
complete, we have scaled down the  
number of construction personnel at GMS 
substantially, whilst still retaining a small 
complement of staff with the necessary  
key technical expertise to support ongoing 
vessel modification and maintenance 
projects. Our off-hire vessels are able to be 
kept, at a relatively low cost, in operational 
readiness for rapid deployment as new 
charters are secured. 
I would like to thank everyone at GMS for 
their hard work during the year. We once 
again achieved a very low level (less than 1%) 
of technical and operational downtime for 
our chartered vessels and this is a credit to 
our highly skilled and dedicated workforce. 
Expansion of services
We continually seek to enhance the 
capability of our vessels and the services  
we provide so we can deliver the highest 
quality cost-effective offshore support 
solutions to our clients. 
In 2017 we expanded our well services 
capabilities through the development of a 
cantilever system for our Large Class SESVs. 
The combination of a self-propelled jackup 
vessel with a removable cantilever and 
workover unit is a world-first that allows our 
vessel to supplant higher cost non-propelled 
drilling rigs on well workover projects. The 
system was installed on GMS Evolution, which 
became fully operational during the year and 
approval of its Safety Case for well operations 
has been received from the UK Health and 
Safety Executive. We are encouraged by our 
clients’ interest in this cantilever system, which 
will become available following completion  
of GMS Evolution’s long-term contract that 
commences in Q2 this year. 
During the year we also designed and 
developed an innovative crew transfer 
system that was an important element in  
the successful award of a renewable energy 
contract. The transfer system is a retractable 
access tower fitted to our Large Class  
SESV GMS Endeavour, which is providing 
accommodation for our client’s personnel at 
a wind farm project. The tower enables the 
movement of personnel to and from transfer 
vessels while they are working at various 
satellite locations; so our clients benefit from 
a safer and more time-efficient method of 
boarding their personnel than was previously 
available to them. 
Market commentary
Middle East
We are seeing increasing levels of both 
enquiries and tender activity for all our vessel 
classes in the Middle East, although the 
conversion of certain tenders into contracts 
continues to be a protracted process. 
Demand for our SESVs in Saudi Arabia  
has risen and we expanded our operational 
base there during the year to support  
our increased activities in the country.  
The majority of contract opportunities in  
the region over the past few years have  
been shorter term and originated from EPC 
contractors, so it is now reassuring to see 
our NOC clients returning to the market with 
long-term charter requirements for work that 
was previously curtailed.
Europe
While demand in the oil and gas sector in 
Europe continued to be subdued in 2017,  
we have been encouraged by the ongoing 
development of the offshore renewables 
industry in Europe, where we secured two 
long-term contracts during the year. We 
anticipate there will be more opportunities  
for GMS as this sector develops. Our SESVs 
provide a stable accommodation hub for  
our clients’ personnel working on wind farm 
installations where the sea and weather 
conditions are inherently rough. As wind  
farm projects are now being located further 
offshore, frequent personnel transfers to and 
from the shore have become impractical.  
Our vessels are ideally suited to supporting 
these projects as they can remain in-field 
throughout the project and can move rapidly 
between locations using their own propulsion 
according to our clients’ operational needs. 
Rest of World 
We are continuing to actively promote the 
benefits of our SESVs to potential clients as 
we believe there will be suitable opportunities 
in the mid to longer-term for GMS in regions 
outside our current core markets. 
Dividends
No dividend is to be paid for 2017. The Board 
believes the cash generated by the business 
is better utilised for the reduction of bank 
debt at this time. The Board recognises 
shareholder priorities and dividend payments 
will be resumed as soon as reasonable 
financial prudence allows.
Outlook
We would expect the improving oil price 
environment to have a positive influence  
on clients’ activity levels in our markets. 
While the timing of contract awards is 
inevitably linked to our clients’ own operational 
programme, we believe demand for our 
vessels will continue to improve, with utilisation 
expected to increase ahead of day rates. The 
Group will remain focused on maximising 
utilisation whilst managing costs appropriately, 
and deleveraging will continue to be a priority. 
I am confident that with our modern fleet, 
industry-leading operational expertise and 
technological capability we are well-placed 
to capitalise on a recovering market.
