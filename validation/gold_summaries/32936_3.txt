Strategic Report 
Chairman’s Statement
Eugene Shvidler
 “Unlocking the Value of a 
World Class Resource Base…”
Dear Shareholder,
It gives me much pleasure to report  
that Highland Gold Mining’s 15th year as  
a public company – Anniversary: 23rd 
May 2017 – marked a period of steady 
progress on all our strategic fronts. 
Before I chronicle such progress, I would 
like to draw your attention to the fact  
that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted 
enterprise, some 63% of your Company’s 
shares are in ‘free float’ and our shareholder 
base includes a wide range of UK, 
European and US institutional investors. 
Our commitment to good corporate 
governance remains strong. Furthermore, 
we continue to enjoy a strong dividend 
record and a conservative debt profile. 
As some of you will be aware, our recent 
presentations to the investment and 
mining communities have focused on 
unlocking the value of our assets. I utilise 
this phrase again because there can be 
few better descriptions of management’s 
primary objective which was furthered, 
throughout the year under review,  
by effective business strategies and 
carefully monitored disciplines.
Unlocking value came of age during 2017 
when the results of extensive exploration 
activity and a series of updated estimates 
from our producing mines, Blagodatnoye, 
and Kekura, our flagship development 
project, culminated in a 56% increase  
in the Company’s proven and probable  
ore reserves from 3.26 Moz of gold and 
gold equivalent to 5.10 Moz on a year-on-
year basis. 
This significant enhancement of our 
reserves, accompanied by a lowering of 
average grade from 8/0 g/t to 3.3 g/t 
reflecting lower cut-off grades and 
increased ore tonnage, underlines the 
strength of our asset base, as does  
a 6.6% increase in our mineral resources 
Steady
progress
(measured, indicated and inferred)  
to 17.2 Moz of gold and gold equivalent 
compared to 16.1 Moz as at 31 December 
2016. Further details regarding the 
extension of our resources and reserves 
are to be found in the Chief Executive’s 
Report and the subsequent Operational 
Review. 
Our business strategy, as outlined in 
recent years, is to balance a steady rate  
of production from our operating mines 
– MNV, Novo and Belaya Gora – with the 
progression of our key development and 
exploration projects, while also reviewing 
opportunities to add new resources or 
production in our regions of presence. 
In keeping with this approach, total 
production registered a 4.3% increase  
to a record 272,274 oz of gold and  
gold equivalent in 2017 compared  
with the previous year’s 261,159 oz.  
This performance exceeded our initial 
255,000 – 265,000 oz guidance range 
and our estimate in respect of 2018 
targets looks for a maintained outcome 
of between 265,000 and 275,000 oz. 
Consistent with our business strategy, 
your Company will continue to maximise 
the upside potential of our operating 
assets, namely: MNV (‘Life-of-mine’ 
extended), Novo (capacity being 
expanded to 1.3 Mtpa) and Belaya  
Gora (processing plant upgrades  
and combination with the  
Blagodatnoye deposit). 
We will also drive the development  
of assets at the Definitive Feasibility  
Study and/or Preliminary Feasibility  
Study stages encompassing Kekura, 
where Government approval has been 
received for the development of a deposit 
of ‘federal significance’ and infrastructure 
construction has commenced, and Klen, 
where we are planning additional 
exploration work. 
I would like to emphasise the importance 
we place on retaining our low cost 
producer credentials and I am pleased to 
report that our current ratios fully support 
our status as one of the most competitive 
gold mining companies in the world. Total 
Cash Costs amounted to US$507 per oz 
in 2017, while our All-In-Sustaining Cash 
Costs totalled US$664 per oz. This 
compares with US$454 per oz and 
US$652 per oz respectively in 2016. 
The average realised price of gold and 
gold equivalent during 2017 amounted 
to US$1,162 per oz compared with 
US$1,136 per oz in 2016 and should  
be seen against our All-In-Sustaining 
Cash Costs measurement. The average 
realised price of gold, in respect of MNV 
and Belaya Gora, was US$1,259 per oz 
during the year. Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
The combination of a stronger Russian 
rouble, and the resulting slightly higher 
dollar production costs, as well as our 
utilisation of low grade ore at Belaya  
Gora was reflected in a 4.4% reduction  
in EBITDA to US$155.3 million in 2017 
compared with US$162.5 million in 2016. 
In line with this, our EBITDA margin 
declined to 49.0% (2016: 53.1%). 
Net debt, as at 31 December 2017, 
amounted to US$198 million versus 
US$205 million as at 31 December 2016. 
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio remains 
stable at 1.28 (2016: 1.26). 
Your Directors recognise the Company’s 
commitment to the return of profits to 
shareholders through dividend payments 
and towards the end of last year we 
decided to clarify such intentions by  
way of adopting a more formalised 
dividend policy. 
The key aspects of the policy are as 
follows: 
• The Company aims to pay a dividend 
that takes into account its cash 
generation, profitability, balance  
sheet strength and capital investment 
requirements;
• The Company anticipates that the total 
dividend distribution for each financial 
year will be 20% of net cash flow from 
operating activities; and
• The Board may recommend the 
distribution of additional cash on the 
balance sheet through increased or 
special dividends should such funds 
not be required for capital expenditure 
or debt repayment. 
In the wake of such considerations,  
the Board is pleased to recommend the 
payment of a second interim dividend of 
£0.0542 per share (2016 final dividend: 
£0.054 per share) which will make a total 
distribution of £0.104 per share (2016: 
£0.104 per share) for the financial year  
to 31 December 2017. 
As evidenced above and in the ensuing 
sections, 2017 has witnessed sound 
progress on numerous fronts. Your Board 
has every confidence that such progress 
will serve to deliver further returns to 
shareholders in the future. 
It is with deep regret that I have to report 
the occurrence of a fatality at our Novo 
underground mine on 13 April 2017, as  
well as a lamentable increase in Lost  
Time Incidents Frequency Rate (LTIFR)  
to 4.88 in 2017 compared to 2.30 in 2016. 
A thorough review of the circumstances 
surrounding the fatality has been carried 
out, as well as a comprehensive review of 
our health and safety system, implemented 
by a new, highly-qualified HSE team. 
Among the results of this effort is a new 
set of cardinal rules of safety behaviour  
at each of our production sites (more 
details on this programme in the 
Operational Review). 
I would now like to take this opportunity, 
on behalf of the Board, to thank all of  
our employees for the hard work and 
commitment that was integral to all  
that has been achieved in our 
Anniversary Year.

Executive Chairman
