Strategic report
Walker Crips Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
This year has shown strong performances for the business, in which 
we have reached record highs and have concentrated on delivering 
initiatives to move forward with confidence into 2017 /18.
Chairman’s Statement
Overview of 2016/17 
The financial year ended 31 March 2017 can be 
split into two halves. In the first six months of 
the financial year, the uncertainty surrounding 
the run-up to the Brexit referendum and the 
subsequent challenging markets slowed 
revenue growth. This, coupled with a 
combination of non-recurring employment 
costs and growth-related development costs, 
saw our profitability fall well below our 
expectation. We saw a stronger performance,  
in the last six months, when improved market 
conditions, favourably impacted by the result of 
the US presidential elections, helped increase 
both revenues and profit. 
Importantly, our Assets Under Management 
and Administration, a key metric of 
performance, continue to grow. Whilst we have 
recently experienced the benefits of more 
upbeat market conditions, the full ramifications 
of the negotiations on Brexit, together with the 
uncertainty arising from the outcome of the UK 
general election, have yet to emerge. Therefore, 
we will be monitoring developments closely in 
the interests of both shareholders and clients. 
Dividend 
In recognition of this year’s progress, and 
notwithstanding the need to continue 
monitoring an increasing cost base, the Board  
is recommending a 1.6% increase in the final 
dividend to 1.29 pence per share (2016: 1.27 
pence per share). This increase in the dividend 
reflects the Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
long-term prospects and prudent use of 
available reserves. 
Combined with the interim dividend of 
0.58 pence per share (2016: 0.58 pence 
per share), the total dividend for the year 
is 1.87 pence per share (2016: 1.85 pence 
per share), a 1.1 % increase. The final 
dividend will be paid on 15 September 
2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 September 2017. 
Strategy 
The delivery of high quality personal investment 
advice and strong investment management 
capability remains at the core of our approach. 
As highlighted at the time of the interim results, 
we have sought to refine our client-focused 
strategy during the year to ensure premium 
service and integrity in all that we do for our 
clients. We aim to increase shareholder value  
by growing revenue, improving efficiency and 
continuing to increase our dividend payments. 
We continue to advance the delivery of our 
strategy for growth in a fast-moving sector in 
which the pace of change in regulation and 
technology are a constant. Whilst preserving 
our healthy cash balance as a buffer for 
unforeseen events in these potentially turbulent 
times, we remain committed to providing a 
complete range of services through our core 
business of investment management and 
advice, not only to high net worth and mass 
affluent clients but also to clients with smaller 
portfolios. We also remain committed to our 
financial planning and Wealth Management 
division as we increasingly look to position 
ourselves favourably with intermediary 
professionals and their clients. 
After four years of rapid expansion, including 
the corporate acquisition of Barker Poland Asset 
Management LLP in 2015, we are currently 
concentrating on successfully delivering the 
many continuing initiatives to deliver growth 
and satisfy increasing regulatory obligations. 
The Board is acutely aware of the demands our 
recent expansion has placed on our personnel, 
particularly the financial, compliance and 
operational teams in Romford, where we 
maintain investment and increase resources to 
mitigate the risks associated with growth. 
Culture, governance and the Board 
By setting the right example at the top, the 
Board has prioritised the communication of 
good conduct and the appropriate culture 
across all who represent the Company.  07

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We are even more 
committed now to increasing 
our service proposition 
through greater use of 
technology in a way that  
is relevant to clients, 
intermediaries and our  
own advisers.
We expect all personnel to exemplify good 
culture and behaviour to achieve good 
outcomes for clients and market contacts. 
Those aspects which need to be cascaded down 
throughout the organisation are identified by 
implementing a formal process of measuring 
and reporting against suitable metrics. The 
Executive Directors and senior management, 
through daily contact with employees and 
associates alike, endeavour to demonstrate 
strong leadership and to be inspiring role 
models while providing effective supervision. 
Directors, account executives  
and staff 
After another year of attracting new revenue 
generators to the Group, and absorbing their 
additional investment business through 
transfers of clients and their assets, we would 
like to thank all our fellow Directors, Investment 
Managers and Advisers, and members of our 
operations team for their hard work and 
diligence in assisting in this process. 
The Board and in particular the Executive 
Directors have undergone a year of structural 
change in the governance and oversight of the 
business. We reported last year the newly 
created role of Group Compliance Director into 
which Guy Jackson has made an effective 
contribution since joining in May 2016. After 
managing the York office profitably for over ten 
years, David Hetherton has taken retirement 
from his role as Executive Director, Wealth 
Management, and we wish him well. Last year, 
Robert Elliott advised the Board of his intention 
to retire as a Non-Executive Director and also as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and he will 
not be seeking to be re-elected to the Board at 
the forthcoming AGM. We will still benefit from 
his experience as a business leader and 
Chartered Accountant within our divisions. Clive 
Bouch, whom many colleagues will remember 
as a former partner with Deloitte LLP, has a 
long-standing relationship with the Company 
and we are delighted that he has joined the 
Board to serve as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. His guidance, based on his recent 
relevant Board experience in several sectors of 
financial services, will be an invaluable asset to 
the Group.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held 
at the South Place Hotel, 3 South Place, London 
EC2M 2AF on 6 September 2017, at 11.00 a.m. 
Looking ahead
In recent years we have achieved substantial 
growth, continuing to refine our strategy and 
business model to make further strides towards 
attaining our long-term strategic goals. We are 
now even more committed to increasing our 
service proposition through greater use of 
technology that is relevant to clients, 
intermediaries and our own advisers. Our 
willingness to innovate beyond our traditional 
business using our stable capital base is well 
established.
