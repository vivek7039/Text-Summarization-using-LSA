 Farouq Sheikh 
Chairman
Set out below is a summary of our financial 
results where:
 – Revenue has increased by 11.4% to £166.0m
 – Underlying EBITDA has increased by 7.5% 
to £39.9m
 – Underlying PBT has increased by 12.6% 
to £29.4m
 – Underlying basic EPS remained at 38.03p
 – Net Assets increased by 34.6% to £204.2m 
(2016: £151.7m)
 – Cash inflows from operating activities 
reduced by 4.4% to £32.7m
 – Full year dividend increased by 7.0% to 9.90p 
All of the above mentioned initiatives 
demonstrate a solid performance on delivery 
of both the key financial and non-financial 
metrics and put the Group in a strong 
position to target further underlying EPS 
growth going forward.
The Group has stood out from its peers as 
a company that can successfully combine 
quality, integrity and sound financial acumen 
and has consistently achieved good care 
quality ratings. Our credibility as the provider 
of choice has never been stronger and we 
continue our successful growth strategy with 
a confident outlook.
On 23 March 2017 the Company announced 
an oversubscribed placing which raised 
£37.4m (net of expenses) through the issue 
of 11,000,000 new ordinary shares. I am 
extremely grateful for the support from our 
existing shareholders and take the opportunity 
to also welcome new shareholders. A number 
of organic growth projects and potential 
bolt-on acquisitions had been identified 
prior to the placing.
In June 2017 the Company announced 
the acquisition of Selborne Care Limited 
for a total consideration of £16.6m in cash. 
Selborne Care is a high quality provider of 
specialist residential care, supported living 
and day care services for adults with learning 
disabilities and challenging behaviours. It has 
57 residential beds in eight freehold sites and 
supported living services are provided to 
30 service users.
I am pleased to present our results for the year ended 
30 September 2017. 
This has been another successful and 
exceptionally busy year, with the key 
highlights being:
 – Share placement raised £37.4m for 
acquisitions (net of expenses)
 – Accelerated organic initiatives including 
property purchases and reconfigurations
 – Completion of the acquisition of Selborne 
Care during the year which added to our 
geographic and Adults Service offering
 – Further strengthening of our management 
team and investment in IT systems
 – Benefit from the improved terms of the 
banking facilities
 – Established the CareTech Charitable 
Foundation and its registration with the 
Charity Commission
It is really pleasing to note that we have 
continued to maintain our position as a 
leading care provider with our improved 
quality ratings across the Group. Moreover, 
we have extended our care pathways through 
successful outcomes for the people we 
support. As a result we have improved our 
capacity during the year which has led to 
an increase in all key financial KPIs and our 
underlying EBITDA.

Chairman’s Statement
A successful 2017  
 creating a platform  
 for further expansion In addition, the Group has purchased a 
number of properties including Beacon Reach, 
a Children’s Residential and Education facility 
near Preston for £4m, which is a substantial 
Education and Residential facility for ROC NW 
who recently won the Laing and Buisson 
Award in Social Care for Children’s Services.
The Group continue to look at a number 
of other acquisition opportunities and are 
confident that the remainder of the share 
placement proceeds will be deployed in 
a timely manner on earnings enhancing 
businesses or projects.
During 2017, we again closed several services 
for reconfiguration which impacted the 
growth in revenue. Offsetting this, there are 
better fees following reconfiguration plus the 
impact of cost saving initiatives and the time 
and attendance system has further improved 
underlying EBITDA. The Group’s organic 
development programme will continue with 
further reconfigurations and, for 2018 we 
have a strong pipeline of development 
opportunities with two property purchases 
registered soon after the year end.
On 28 March 2017, 344,305 new ordinary 
shares were issued as part of the arrangements 
for full and final settlement of the earn-out 
agreed with the vendors of ROC North West 
which was acquired in 2015.
In the 12 years since joining AIM, the business 
has transformed from being very focused on 
supporting adults with a learning disability 
through residential and day care settings to 
one where today we cater for young people 
and children with complex needs across a 
range of settings, be it residential, supported 
living or community support. We focus on the 
most complex and vulnerable young people 
and the market for this client group stands at 
over £10bn. There is currently an undersupply 
of specialist beds in this niche area and the 
market is growing by almost 3% per annum. 
Over the years we have developed a range 
of care pathways and helped many that we 
support to live more independently. This is 
a fantastic outcome for both us and the 
individuals that we support and it also helps 
local authorities meet the ever increasing 
cost of social care provision.
Even with the significant growth we have 
achieved to date we still have less than 2% 
of this very large and fragmented market. 
With the increasing regulatory burden, 
the opportunity for further consolidation 
is even more attractive. 
Dividend
The Group policy has been to increase the 
total dividend per year broadly in line with 
the movement in underlying diluted earnings 
per share.
In 2017 there was a slight reduction in 
underlying diluted earnings per share of 
(0.01p) mainly due to the share placement 
in March 2017. The Board has proposed a 
final dividend of 6.60p (2016: 6.25p) per share 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 
9.90p (2016: 9.25p) per share. This represents 
a full year increase of 7.0% year on year. 
The final dividend will be paid, subject to 
shareholder approval, on 8 May 2018, with 
an ex-dividend date of 8 March 2018 and 
an associated record date of 9 March 2018.
Our Board
There have been no changes to the Board 
during the year. Providing the foundation for 
further growth, the Senior Executive Team at 
CareTech has been further strengthened by a 
number of senior appointments during the year.
During the year the Remuneration Committee, 
the Audit Committee and the Care Governance 
and Safeguarding Committee were unchanged.
Our people
We have completed our planned evolution 
into two well defined operating divisions, 
Children Services and Adult Services, and 
this has generated organisational efficiencies. 
Simplifying the structure has also supported 
planning and service delivery with a more 
powerful approach to development.
Our continuing growth, measurable success 
and forward-looking approach are a reflection 
of the hard work and dedication of staff and 
managers throughout the organisation. I am 
always drawn to the achievements of our 
excellent front line staff, which is inevitable as 
we are first and foremost a care organisation. 
Their care and commitment would be much 
less without the dedicated support of our 
administrators and support teams whose hard 
work and energy is critical to the success of 
our Company and the care we provide.
In March 2016, the Company announced the 
creation of the CareTech Sharesave Scheme, 
a Government supported method for any of 
our staff to have the opportunity to participate 
in the Company’s equity. In October 2017, 
we announced a second CareTech Sharesave 
Scheme and 259 members of staff chose to 
join this new saving scheme. We plan to 
introduce another CareTech Sharesave 
Scheme in 2018 as this is one part of our 
staff retention strategy.
With the launch of the CareTech Charitable 
Foundation in May 2017 I am pleased that 
we will be able to support members of the 
CareTech family even more. The Foundation 
has ambitious and clear sighted objectives 
to deliver meaningful impact to communities 
in the UK and overseas about which the 
staff of the Group and its service users feel 
proud and strongly-engaged, providing a 
unique contribution to the charitable 
marketplace consistent with the Group’s 
values and approach.
Outlook and prospects
We operate in a growing social care market 
worth over £10 billion per annum and we 
are well positioned to meet market demand. 
We have developed outcome-based care 
pathways which deliver value-based services 
for our Local Authority partners.
With the money raised from shareholders, 
solid free cash flow generated from the 
business plus access to bank funding, we 
have major investment plans for 2018 and 
beyond with key new organic developments 
and bolt-on acquisitions. Importantly, we 
have also, and continue to, further strengthen 
our management team, offering a forceful 
blend of experience, commercial wisdom and 
dedication to care. I have no doubt that the 
next few years will see continuing growth and 
care excellence which will help deliver our 
target of double digit growth in underlying EPS.
