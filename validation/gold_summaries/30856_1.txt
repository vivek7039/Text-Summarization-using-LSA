Delivering on our  
multi-channel strategy
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Q. International Personal Finance has changed in 
the six years you have led the Group. What does the 
business stand for today?
In so many ways, our business has changed enormously but in  
some very fundamental ways it remains entirely consistent with the 
business I joined in 2012. Back then, we were a provider of weekly 
cash loans delivered through agents; our competitors were mainly 
other home credit operators and the regulatory outlook was 
reasonably foreseeable.
Today, we face competition from multiple digital lenders and banks 
are taking a keen interest in our best customers. The regulatory 
landscape is almost unrecognisable in terms of the volume of new 
legislation as well as the fact that the key instigators of regulatory 
change are politicians as well as regulators. In response to these 
changes, we have adapted our offering so that we continue to give 
our customers the best service we can while protecting our business 
model. We now offer an array of products (weekly and monthly 
instalment cash loans, digital instalment loans, lines of credit, 
insurance services and small business loans) through multiple 
channels (agents, call centres, digital and distribution partners).
Notwithstanding all of this change, our vision and how we treat our 
customers remain true to our values. We aim to make a difference 
in the lives of our customers by providing simple and personalised 
financial solutions in a responsible, respectful and straightforward way. 
CEO, Gerard Ryan, discusses the operating 
landscape and progress made on 
delivering our multi-channel strategy.

Q. What are the key drivers of your strategy? 
Fundamentally, we have always been in the business of providing 
finance to customers who could be deemed to be underbanked  
or underserved. We have adapted our strategy to respond primarily 
to four external forces: strong demand for unsecured credit; 
changing customer behaviour with an increasing preference for 
digital delivery; increased competition leading to faster service  
from application to loan disbursement; and significant regulatory 
intervention leading to lower prices and restricted access to credit  
for large numbers of consumers. With the addition of our new 
products and channels, we are now broadening our appeal to 
customers and offering more access points, longer and larger  
loans, and more competitive rates.
Our strategy aims to build a sustainable and growing business  
that delivers increasing returns to shareholders. We now segment  
our businesses into 'growth' and 'returns' focused operations.  
IPF Digital and Mexico home credit are growth businesses and  
our European home credit operations are in the returns category. 
Our European home credit businesses generate the returns to invest 
in our growth businesses as well as delivering progressive returns to  
our shareholders. 
Q. Recent years have been characterised by 
regulatory change. How did it impact IPF in 2017?
We had a difficult start to 2017 from a regulatory and tax perspective. 
The publication by the Polish Ministry of Justice in December 2016  
of a proposal to further reduce the cap on non-interest charges on 
consumer loans unsettled the Polish consumer finance market.  
A new cap had been in place for less than a year and appeared  
to be working well, so it was a surprise to the market when further 
changes were proposed without warning. There has since been no 
update from the Ministry of Justice on this matter. Throughout 2017, 
we worked with our advisors and other key stakeholders in Poland  
to try to arrive at a sensible outcome that provides appropriate 
protection for consumers and, at the same time, promotes a vibrant 
and competitive marketplace. This work is still ongoing.
As previously reported, our home credit business in Poland appealed 
decisions received in January 2017 from the Polish Tax Chamber (the 
upper tier of the Polish tax authority) with respect to its 2008 and 2009 
financial years. At the time of our original announcement, we said 
that we intended to initiate a process with the UK tax authority aimed 
at ensuring that the intra-group arrangement, which is being 
challenged, is taxed in accordance with international tax principles. 
This action resulted in the Polish court staying the hearings of the 2008 
and 2009 appeals pending resolution of this process. Also in Poland, 
changes to corporate income tax legislation came into force on 
1 January 2018 which has resulted in an exceptional one-off deferred 
tax charge of £30 million in 2017. Further information on these tax 
matters is included in the financial review on pages 31 to 35.
Also in January 2017, more stringent creditworthiness assessment 
rules were introduced in Romania which reduced the number of 
customers we were allowed to serve. While we were adapting our 
business to cope with these changes, new rules were introduced in 
the final few months of 2017 which have since resulted in our business 
being supervised by the National Bank of Romania for the first time. 
This is likely to lead to a further tightening of credit criteria and a 
reduction in the volume of loans we are allowed to provide  
to customers in that market. 
We operate within price cap environments in all our European 
markets with the exception of the Czech Republic, Romania and 
Spain, and we expect pricing regulations to be implemented in 
these markets at some point in the future. A proposal to implement 
an APR cap of 18% for existing and new consumer lending is being 
debated in the Romanian Parliament and we are contributing to this 
discussion. There have been, and continue to be, numerous 
regulatory challenges to our business, but we have a proven track 
record of adapting to regulatory change and I believe we will 
continue to do so.
Q. In light of these regulatory challenges, how are 
you making your business more resilient?
I’d like to emphasise we will always adapt our business to be fully 
compliant with local regulation, no matter what regulatory change  
is introduced. A key part of our strategy is that our business should 
form an essential part of a well-functioning and competitive 
consumer finance market. To perform that role effectively, we aim  
to ensure regulators better understand the part we play in society 
and demonstrate how we protect our customer segment from illegal 
lenders and the excesses of the ‘grey’ market, while also providing 
many of these customers with their first step towards creating a 
positive credit history that will benefit them in the future. 
We also recognise it is politicians as well as regulators who are now 
likely to instigate regulatory change in many of our markets. As a 
result, we have developed a programme of increased engagement 
with those who are likely to influence how business is conducted and 
we now work more effectively through local trade bodies to help put 
the case forward for sensible and well thought through regulation. 
Internally, we are also modernising our business to make it more 
resilient, and new products and channels play a key role in this. We 
are using technology to make customer interaction with our business 
easier and more appealing. These investments include handheld 
mobile technology for agents through to seamless digital processing 
from credit application to loan repayment.
Q. How are you differentiating the business in a 
highly competitive landscape? 
Our business is unique in that we offer choices from traditional home 
credit loans delivered by agents through to a fully digital line of credit 
via IPF Digital. For customers who may not have a strong enough 
credit profile for a digital offering, we can offer a hybrid solution 
whereby they meet an agent for the initial assessment but then 
make subsequent repayments via their bank.
“We have the ability to offer choices 
from traditional home credit loans 
delivered by agents through to a fully 
digital line of credit.” 16
There are significant differences between our home credit  
and digital business models. I am aware that many of our 
stakeholders view the latter as having few, if any, barriers to entry, 
whereas the home credit business is deemed to be very difficult  
to replicate. While there is some truth to this, and we have seen 
an explosion in the number of digital providers, to be successful 
requires experienced leadership, well-developed scorecards, the 
right products, trusted brands and an excellent customer journey. 
Our digital business, having been in existence for more than ten 
years, meets all of these criteria and its results are a clear 
indicator that we are on the right path to build a large and 
complementary business to our home credit operation. 
Q. What is the global economic outlook for 
your business?
We saw reasonably stable macroeconomic conditions in all of 
our markets in 2017. In many of our European markets there were 
record levels of employment and good GDP growth. While the 
Mexican economy had a more difficult time, driven by 
uncertainty over its trading relationship with the US and the 
impact of relatively subdued oil prices, it still continued to grow.
As we look to 2018 and beyond, current indicators suggest that 
we should expect our markets to deliver positive GDP growth,  
low but increasing inflation and subdued interest rates.
Q. How would you evaluate performance in 2017? 
We delivered a solid financial and operational performance  
in 2017 and profit before tax increased to £105.6 million.  
We generated an increase in like-for-like profit before tax of 
£5.3 million primarily as a result of improved profitability delivered 
by IPF Digital’s established markets. Overall, like-for-like profit in 
home credit was broadly flat reflecting an £11.4 million reduction 
in our ongoing businesses offset largely by an £11.1 million 
year-on-year increase in Slovakia and Lithuania arising from lower 
costs of closure. Stronger FX rates resulted in an £11.3 million 
positive impact which was offset partially by incremental new 
business investment in IPF Digital of £7.0 million.
We delivered a 6% increase in credit issued as a result of strong 
growth in our Mexico home credit and IPF Digital businesses, and 
this resulted in growth in average net receivables and revenue of 
7% and 1% respectively. We managed credit quality effectively 
and impairment as a percentage of revenue at 24.4% was slightly 
below our target range of 25% to 30%. The compression of 
revenue yields, and our planned investments in driving growth 
and efficiency, resulted in a slight increase in our cost-income 
ratio, up 0.5 ppts to 45.8%. Full details of our operational 
performance are covered on pages 24 to 30.
Q. What were the operational highlights in 2017? 
European home credit businesses
We are improving the sustainability of our European home credit 
businesses by creating more modern, efficient and higher credit  
quality operations that provide a good service to customers,  
and continue to generate the cash and capital to fund growth 
opportunities and progressive returns to shareholders. We have done 
this in response to the regulatory and competitive market conditions in 
which we operate in Europe by offering customers a broader choice of 
more competitively priced products, and improving the efficiency of 
our operations through investment in technology. We continued to roll 
out our agent mobile technology which will improve the customer 
experience and make the role of the agent more efficient. At the end 
of 2017, all agents in Hungary and the Czech Republic were using the 
technology and the implementation in Poland is expected to be 
completed in the first half of 2018. I am pleased to say there has been 
no significant operational disruption as a result of these changes and 
agent feedback is supportive. To enable us to serve more customers 
with digital offerings, we are leveraging our Provident brand with a 
Provident digital offering in Poland. This has been well received and 
around 15,000 customers are being served through this channel. We 
plan to introduce this offering in the Czech Republic in the first half of 
2018. To support the changes we are making, we simplified our 
business structure and created a Northern Europe region comprising 
our Polish and Czech businesses to complement the existing Southern 
Europe region of Hungary and Romania. This is enabling our teams to 
better share best practice and is expected to support the delivery of 
cost efficiencies over the longer-term. 
Mexico home credit
Our strategy in Mexico is to expand our geographic footprint, build 
our micro-business channel, and improve operational efficiency and 
customer penetration rates in selected longer-established branches. 
At the start of 2017, we made a commitment to maintain the 
momentum we had generated in the second half of 2016. Our 
leadership team delivered on this in the first half and it would have 
been maintained in Q3 had it not been for the two earthquakes that 
hit Mexico in September. Inevitably, this impacted our agents, 
employees and customers and, consequently, we saw a reversal of 
growth in Q3 and collections deteriorated. In times such as these,  
it is important to recognise the human impact of such events and 
our focus was on ensuring that we took care of our people and 
customers. We activated our business disruption plan and I am 
pleased to say that we returned to more normal trading towards the 
second half of November.
We opened six branches in the first half of 2017 which, together with 
those branches opened in 2016, now serve around 55,000 customers 
and we plan to open a similar number of branches in 2018. We also 
took the opportunity to review our less profitable branches and 
decided to close two branches in Monterrey. Consequently, our 
results include a reduction of 16,000 customers and a charge of 
£1.9 million for the write down of the associated receivables portfolio 
and closure costs. Our micro-business channel, now available in the 
majority of our branches in Mexico, is growing well with around 
16,000 customers, and we expect further expansion in 2018.

IPF Digital
Our digital business has existed for more than a decade and has  
a leadership team that has built up considerable experience in 
product and channel development, scorecard building, providing  
a great customer experience, and creating brands that resonate 
with consumers. 
Growing our digital lending business and demonstrating that the  
IPF Digital business model can deliver a good financial return are key 
strategic priorities for the Group, and we made good progress 
against both of these objectives. Focusing on providing a superior 
customer experience through product and process innovation 
helped deliver strong demand for our credit line product. In many  
of our markets this line of credit facility has replaced instalment loans 
as our core customer offering. In our new markets of Poland, Spain, 
Mexico and Australia, we continued to refine our credit scorecards 
and delivered strong receivables growth as well as improved credit 
quality and cost efficiency. In our established markets of Finland and 
the Baltics, we delivered further credit issued growth through smarter, 
risk-based pricing strategies, enhanced customer relationship 
management (CRM) activities and increased penetration of our 
credit line product. 
Q. Would it not make more sense to focus on 
growing home credit and not diversify into digital?
For some of our stakeholders there would be a comfort factor in 
sticking to what has proved to be a very successful business model 
based around the delivery of loans via an agent. The truth, however, 
is that neither our customers nor our competitors stand still and we 
should not either.
Customer behaviour is changing and there is a growing preference 
for digital credit. In addition, we have some customers who have 
been with us for several years who would be capable of obtaining a 
loan remotely. If consumers have not dealt with us before, they may 
choose to obtain a loan from our purely digital brands. Alternatively, 
if they are an existing or past customer of Provident, they may 
choose to apply for credit through our Provident-branded digital 
channel. Either way, we aim to offer them a choice of channel and 
product that is most suitable for them.
Q. How does stakeholder engagement impact 
your strategy?
Consumer finance is an industry that impacts most people and, 
rightly so, attracts scrutiny. It is critical to have a positive dialogue 
with, and to listen carefully to, our key stakeholders, principally our 
customers, employees, agents, regulators, politicians and 
shareholders. Our aim is to ensure we design and provide products 
that our customers want, are appropriately priced and that, if 
customers find themselves in difficulty with repayments, we are 
understanding and accommodating to their changed 
circumstances. All of our stakeholders expect us to act in an ethical 
and transparent way and this is at the heart of how we conduct 
our business.
Q. How do you ensure your people stay engaged 
with your ethics programme?
I’m sure that most CEOs would say that ethics are very important for 
their business, but, in our case, we would not have a sustainable 
business without a very clear and strong ethical culture throughout 
the organisation. We have mandatory ethics e-learning programmes 
for both employees and agents and I deliver our annual international 
ethics week with the assistance of our senior leadership team. Many 
of our customers continue to have limited disposable incomes so it is 
critically important that the way we incentivise our people does not 
promote the provision of credit to consumers who are already over 
indebted or who do not have the means to repay the loan. For that 
reason, our incentives are weighted to promote the right behaviours 
and not simply to generate new loans.
Q. How do you ensure diversity in the workplace?
We value the significant benefits that having a diverse international 
team brings. In 2017, we strengthened this further by introducing 
global functional and regional leadership structures which will 
encourage further focus on diversity in all its forms as people work 
more closely together. From a gender diversity perspective, we will 
focus upon building our people strategies further to ensure that we 
attract, retain and develop people on merit. Our global people, 
organisation and planning process ensures that our talent rises in  
a fair, diverse and transparent way, and in accordance with our 
values and ethics.
Q. What are your aspirations for the Group in 2018?
As far as our core purpose is concerned, I see very little if any 
change as we go into 2018. We are a business that provides credit  
in a responsible, respectful and straightforward way to those who  
are underbanked and underserved, We are an essential part of a 
competitive and well-functioning credit market and, by acting in  
an ethical and transparent way, we can help to improve how the 
overall segment is governed.
In terms of business performance, we are focused on serving  
our customers responsibly within a regulatory and competitive 
landscape that we expect will remain challenging. We will continue 
to improve the sustainability of our European home credit operations 
by creating more modern, efficient and higher credit quality 
operations that provide a good service to customers, and continue 
to generate the cash and capital to fund growth opportunities and 
progressive returns to shareholders. We expect IPF Digital to deliver 
further strong growth and an improved performance driven by 
increased scale and enhancements in financial metrics as our  
new markets grow and mature. In Mexico, we expect to return to 
customer growth, expand our geographic footprint and micro-
business channel, and deliver improved operational efficiency in  
our established branches.
