Financial performance and dividends
The group’s revenue was £21m higher than last year, at £919m 
(2016:	£898m).	While 	Airspace	customers	benefited	from	real	price	
reductions under the RP2 Performance Plan, the related reductions in 
revenue were more than offset by additional revenue from the increase 
in	flights	handled.
This	year	we	safely	handled	an	additional	7.6%	of	flights.	This	growth 	
was much higher than assumed in our RP2 Performance Plan set when 
jet	fuel	prices	were	much	higher	than	today	and	flights	were	projected 
to	grow	by	only	2%.	We	also	generated	additional	income	from	
supporting	the	UK	military	with	Project	Marshall,	which	helped	to	offset	
lower Airports income.
Profit	before	tax	and	goodwill	impairment,	at	£137m	(2016:	£137m) 
was in line with last year. After taking into account a reduced charge 
for	goodwill	impairment	of	£11m	(2016:	£93m),	profit	before	tax	at 	
£126m (2016: £44m) was £82m better.
The Board has reviewed the group’s dividend policy. This now aims 
to	pay	a	regular	and	progressive	dividend	that	reflects	NERL’s	cost	of	
equity	(as	reflected	in	the	RP2	Performance	Plan)	and	any	regulatory	
out-performance	as	well	as	a	pay-out	of	25%	of	profit	after	tax	for	
NATS Services. In addition, from time to time the Board will consider 
the potential for, and affordability of, returning any excess capital to 
shareholders taking into account NERL’s gearing and the overall 
liabilities of the NATS group.
The	Board	paid	dividends	of	£24.0m	in	2017	(2016:	£81.7m).	In	May 	
2017,	the	group	paid	a	first	interim	dividend	of	£28.5m	for	the	2018 	
financial	year.

Progress Defined benefit pension scheme
The	Trustees’	2015	triennial	valuation	reported	an	increase	in	the	deficit	
to £459m (2012 triennial valuation: £383m). As a result, the group 
has agreed to increase its contributions to the scheme and expects 
to meet this increase through an adjustment to NERL’s prices in the 
next	Performance	Plan	period	(based	on	the	EU	performance	scheme	
regulations)	and	from	NATS	Services’	operating	cash	flows.
The Trustees intend to bring forward their next valuation to 31 December 
2017. This will help inform NERL’s Initial Performance Plan for the 
next regulatory reference period (RP3: 2020-2024) on which we will be 
consulting customers and other stakeholders from spring 2018.
UK’s EU referendum decision
While	the	outcome	of	the	UK’s	EU	referendum	decision	and	the 
triggering of Article 50 has not had an adverse impact on the demand 
for	air	travel	to	date,	it	has	potentially	significant	implications	for	the	UK	
aviation sector. 
The company has provided input to the Department for Transport (DfT) 
on	the	regulation	of	Air	Traffic	Management	(ATM)	after	Brexit.	In	our	
view	the	logical	outcome	is	for	the	UK	to	re-establish	national	economic	
regulation	of	UK	ATM	and	to	retain	control	of	this	critical	part	of	the	UK’s	
national infrastructure. This would avoid the complexity and cost of 
having two regulators (the European Commission and the CAA) 
and enable NATS to be more agile in responding to changing  
customer requirements. This would also be the most reliable means 
of	ensuring	that	NERL	continues	to	be	able	to	finance	its	operating	and	
investing activities. 
The	UK	has	played	a	leading	role	in	the	development	of	SES	since	
its introduction and has every incentive to continue working with our 
European partners to maintain high standards of safety and to optimise 
the use of airspace. 
Capital investment
We are upgrading our operation by deploying new technology, to replace 
legacy systems and introduce more advanced systems which will support 
new and modern airspace designs, once approved, as well as improved 
service	resilience	and	operational	flexibility.	The	original	investment	plan	
developed	for	RP2	was	based	on	more	modest	flight	growth.	Following	
changes in the business environment and industry developments in 
technology, we have revised our investment plan for RP2 to accelerate 
the deployment of SESAR technology which, alongside the essential and 
overdue	modernisation	of	airspace	we	expect	to	form	part	of	the	UK	
Government’s aviation strategy, will provide more capacity to meet future 
demand.	The	growth	in	flights	last	summer	(2016)	put	pressure	on	the 	
service with some sectors reaching existing design capacity, resulting in an 
increase in ATC delay. 
HM Government’s shareholding 
Last	year,	I	reported	that	HMG	would	explore	the	sale	of	its	49%	
shareholding	in	NATS.	Since	then,	HMG	has	indicated	that	while 
it has no plans imminently to dispose of its shareholding, it will 
continue to keep its investment under review.
Governance
Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, Andy Lord and Tony Tyler retired 
from	the	Board	during	the	year.	Peter	Read	stepped	down	in	May	2017 	
and Will Facey at the end of June 2017.  Brenda Dean, Andy and Peter 
all played key roles on a number of Board committees over an extended 
period of service. I would like to thank them all for their advice and 
counsel to the Board. 
I	have	been	pleased	to	welcome	Maria	Antoniou	and	Andrew	Barker	to	
the	Board	in	the	year.	Mike	Campbell	joined	the	Board	in	May	2017. 
Each brings a relevant set of skills and experience to the company. 
Outlook 
The	first	two	years	of	RP2	have	been	challenging	as	we	have	faced	
much	higher	than	expected	air	traffic.	Next	year	we	will	be	consulting	
our customers on our Initial Performance Plan for RP3. As the RP2 ATC 
environment is turning out to be quite different to the one assumed, 
we will be making the case for a Performance Plan in RP3 with more 
financial	headroom	to	respond	to	changing	industry	conditions	(e.g.	to	
adjust the level of investment and resources) and to provide enhanced 
operational resilience. We think this is in the interests of our customers. 
Martin	Rolfe,	Chief	Executive,	has	built	a	strong	management	team. 
I would like to express my thanks to them and all of our employees for 
their hard work and dedicated service to the company.
