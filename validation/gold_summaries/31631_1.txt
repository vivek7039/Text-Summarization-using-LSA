DELIVERING SECTOR-LEADING 
GROWTH FROM OUR MIXED-
TENURE MODEL
Group Chief Executive’s review
The Group continues to make progress with its strategic objectives 
of sector-leading growth, superior return on capital and building 
resilience through the economic cycle. 
Our Housebuilding model is based on an 
industry-leading strategic land bank, all of 
which is located in economically resilient 
markets in Outer London and the Home 
Counties. Over 80 per cent of our land bank 
is strategically sourced via long-term planning 
promotion, which offers Countryside over 
ten years’ visibility of future supply, together 
with an average 10 per cent discount to the 
prevailing open market value. Additionally, as 
73 per cent of this land is controlled via 
options or conditional contracts, it ensures 
both balance sheet efficiency and flexibility 
through the cycle. 
Overview of the market
Overall the backdrop for the UK housing market 
remains positive with continued strong customer 
demand, favourable mortgage lending conditions 
and good political support. During the year all 
political parties recognised the need for additional 
housing, not just because of the chronic need 
for new homes but also because of the important 
role that housebuilding plays in the wider economy. 
In February 2017, the Government issued a 
housing white paper, “Fixing our broken housing 
market”, which set out a broad range of reforms 
to help shape the housing market and increase 
the supply of new homes. One of the main 
themes of the report was a shift in focus from 
home ownership to increasing supply of all 
tenures of housing, including more affordable 
and PRS homes. In October 2017, the Government 
reaffirmed its support for housing, committing 
a further £2bn of funding to deliver more 
affordable homes and an additional £10bn of 
funding for the Help to Buy scheme, which 
currently runs to 2021. 
Group strategy
Our mixed-tenure model gives us the ability 
to build sites out more quickly, delivering much 
needed high-quality housing. We deliver this 
strategy through our two balanced operating 
divisions of Partnerships and Housebuilding, 
both of which offer strong growth through 
differentiated models that deliver capital efficiency 
and manage risk. Our developments offer a wide 
range of price points, with homes for first-time 
buyers through to larger homes from our 
premium brand, Millgate. 
Our Partnerships division operates in Outer 
London, the West Midlands and the North 
West of England. It delivers private, affordable 
and Private Rental Sector (“PRS”) homes on 
larger sites, typically public sector brownfield 
sites or local authority estate regeneration. 
The land is typically sourced via public 
procurement or direct negotiation and is 
developed in partnership with local authorities, 
housing associations or PRS providers. It is 
a low-capital model offering strong returns 
and the flexibility of long-term development 
agreements, many with phased viability and 
priority returns. The division has an excellent 
track record of winning new work, reflecting 
over 30 years’ experience on over 60 regeneration 
schemes, strong relationships with local authorities 
and expertise in placemaking. T ypically, we secure 
around 40 per cent of bids we submit, and 
with a current pipeline of approximately nine 
years, we have excellent visibility of future work. 
Supply of both private and public land remains 
good. In particular, during the period we saw a 
further increase in public sector land being released 
for regeneration giving us additional opportunities 
to secure more work. 
Labour supply continues to be constrained 
across the industry and we, along with the 
Home Builders Federation, have been encouraging 
the Government to protect the status of EU 
construction workers as a vital part of the UK 
economy and to protect future development. 
T o mitigate this risk, we are recruiting a record 
number of apprentices and management trainees 
and have expanded our graduate recruitment 
programme. In addition, our larger site profile 
allows us to retain and expand our supply chain, 
by offering greater visibility of future work and 
longer contracts. Overall, build cost inflation 
was approximately four per cent for the year. 
In order to meet the increased demand for 
housing, despite the labour shortage, the industry 
must also look at different build methodologies 
to deliver growth in output. We already utilise 
off-site timber frame construction on around 
40 per cent of our current output. We are 
examining the way that this process can be 
enhanced to include all windows, first-fix plumbing 
and electrical insulation and plasterboard in a 
closed panel system. We believe that off-site 
construction is integral to meeting our growth 
plans and securing our supply chain for the future. 
Our performance
2017 was another year of strong progress with 
both divisions performing well. Overall, the Group 
has grown strongly, with total completions up 
28 per cent to 3,389 homes (2016: 2,657 homes) 
driven by construction site starts and increased 
open sales outlets. As anticipated, growth of 
private for sale homes was particularly strong, up 
47 per cent to 1,662 homes (2016: 1,127 homes) 
as the large number of sites started in 2016 
reached full production. However, private for 
sale completions were still less than half of our 
overall delivery during the year reflecting our 
strategy of mixed-tenure development.

Countryside Properties PLC // Annual report 2017
T otal adjusted revenue was up 32 per cent to 
£1,028.8m
1
 (2016: £777.0m), with a planned 
decline in the Group private average selling price 
(“ASP”) to £430,000 (2016: £465,000) more 
than offset by an increase in affordable ASP. 
Underlying house price inflation was five per cent 
during the year and offset build cost inflation in 
both divisions. Our net reservation rate was 
above our target range at 0.84 reservations per 
open sales outlet (2016: 0.78) on an increased 
number of open sales outlets at 47 (2016: 43). 
At 30 September 2017, we had a further 
41 sites under construction. 
We continue to focus on capital and operational 
efficiency both at the divisional and at the Group 
level. Group operating margin increased by 20bps, 
which, together with increased revenue, gave 
an adjusted Group operating profit of £164.1m
2
 
(2016: £122.5m), up 34 per cent on the prior 
year. This, combined with our focus on capital 
efficiency, allowed us to exceed our ROCE target 
of 28 per cent, as set out at our IPO, a year 
earlier than planned at 30.5 per cent in 2017, up 
370bps on the prior year (2016: 26.8 per cent).
We pride ourselves on the quality of our 
product and were delighted to be named 
“Large Housebuilder of the Y ear” at the recent 
Housebuilder Awards. In addition, we were 
presented with a further nine awards during 
the year for work at Acton Gardens (London), 
Abode (Cambridge), Woolley Hall (Berkshire) 
and Englemere (Ascot). 
The standard of our business has also been 
maintained throughout this period of growth. 
Our health and safety Accident Incident Rate 
was 220 (2016: 305), significantly better than 
the Health and Safety Executive construction 
index and the Home Builders Federation 
industry benchmark. National House Building 
Council (“NHBC”) reportable items were 
0.21 per home (2016: 0.23), which was again 
significantly ahead of the industry benchmark. 
We maintained our focus on our objective of 
becoming a five-star builder during the year 
and our customer service has continued to 
improve. Our customer satisfaction, as measured 
by the NHBC Recommend a Friend score, now 
stands at 88.6 per cent (2016: 84.8 per cent). 
Outlook
Current trading has remained robust since year 
end. Low interest rates and increased demand 
from first-time buyers, supported by Help to Buy, 
continue to underpin private for sale homes, 
while the structural demand for affordable and 
PRS homes further supports our growth plans. 
We continue to successfully convert our strategic 
land bank to open more sites and, as a result, 
our Housebuilding division is on its way to optimal 
scale. This growth, combined with our excellent 
pipeline of Partnerships work, which allowed 
us to increase our targets at our interim results, 
and a record year-end forward order book, 
gives us great confidence to deliver our 
medium-term plans. We are encouraged by 
the continued political support for all tenures of 
housing with the recently increased commitments 
to both Help to Buy and affordable housing 
and we feel we are ideally placed to benefit 
from these policies.
