Adult Learning Disabilities 
CareTech has always operated at the highest 
acuity range on the social care spectrum, providing 
individual tailor made solutions for people living in 
their own homes, residential care or independent 
supported living schemes. We believe that we 
should continue supporting those with the greatest 
need and this accords with local authority 
commissioning trends.
Adults with learning disabilities are increasingly 
being provided with direct funding to enable them 
to purchase their own care and support. We work 
actively with service users and advisory bodies to 
deliver self-directed support packages and see this 
as an increasingly important aspect of our service 
model, as well as offering commercial opportunity.
For many people with the most complex 
intellectual or physical challenges, residential 
care will continue to be the preferred option 
although the services will change in their 
approach as we move toward a more enabling, 
modern type of service. An alternative to 
residential care is the opportunity for people 
to live in a home of their own, sometimes shared 
with others. CareTech is a leader in the provision 
of supported living and offers packages of 
individualised self-directed support to people 
in their own homes.

outreach
The segmental figures of the Specialist Services division 
for 2016 have been restated due to the inclusion of “ABI” 
(Acquired Brain Injury). This is the first full year of Oakleaf 
Care Limited’s results and it was decided this change 
would give the shareholders greater clarity. 
Specialist Services 
Specialist services provision continues to dominate 
the health and social care agenda. Good specialist 
services is a significant contributor to a healthy 
community and national economy, while mental 
ill health is devastating to individuals and their 
families. Most commissioners are driven by a wish 
to reduce patient time in acute care and rely on 
creative outsourcing to dramatically cut the cost 
of specialist services care in hospital and within 
the criminal justice system.
CareTech’s specialist services team works 
in partnership with the NHS and social service 
departments to ensure a successful transition 
out of acute care and the prison service, delivering 
pathways to an ordinary life. 
We also have an outstanding track record 
for diverting people away from acute care and 
supporting them in their own homes. CareTech’s 
highly effective care teams are developing new 
ways to offer community support solutions and 
we believe that this will be an important growth 
platform in years to come.
For men with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) we 
provide a range of pathways from rehabilitation 
through to long-term and end of life care. 
CareTech offers highly specialised rehabilitation 
beds as well as a step down provision of 
community-based beds.

Foster Care
Foster Care is undoubtedly the best care solution 
for most “looked after” children. Most children 
thrive in foster care where they are supported 
within an ordinary family home and with trained 
foster carers. CareTech provides for both 
mainstream and specialist foster care through 
local agencies across the UK. Unusually we 
offer a highly respected service for physically 
and intellectually disabled children as well as 
support for children with sensory impairments. 
We provide foster care family assessments and 
ongoing support to children who remain with 
their birth families and in their family home.

Young People Residential Services
For a relatively small number of children, residential 
care offers a safe and helpful solution for their care 
needs and CareTech has developed an extensive 
range of highly technical care and education 
environments where those children will thrive.
Our residential provision offers high staff ratios 
and highly skilled carers, capable of ensuring both 
safety and progression. These are high cost services 
where we aim for an intensive period of care and 
a strict timetable that delivers results at a fair price 
to commissioners. As far as practicable we aim 
to help these children through our therapeutic 
care move into a more normalised family style 
environment as soon as it is wise to do so.
These services are highly intensive operations 
with exceptional staff ratios and include on site 
or dedicated educational facilities.

Since modern apprenticeships started several years 
ago we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the way 
young people enter the adult workforce. People 
are increasingly opting for an apprenticeship as 
an alternative to or as well as attending University. 
This was especially true of the Care Sector but a 
whole new generation of young people are now 
looking at the apprenticeship model as their 
further training of choice.
Through acquisition and the development of 
established apprenticeship providers CareTech 
has embraced the opportunity to capitalise on 
this change and to work closely with government 
agencies to improve the quality and skill base of 
our national workforce. We have chosen to call our 
apprenticeship scheme a Learning Service to reflect 
the aspiration of the young people we work with.
Although Learning Services provide training across 
the whole workforce we have naturally developed 
expertise within the very extensive social care sector.
Learning services addresses an adult social care 
workforce in England of some 1.16m people, 
905,000 of whom work within the independent 
sector (Skills for Care 2013).
There are 17,300 organisations providing 
Adult Social Care in England and the majority 
of these are operating at far too low a scale 
to deliver their own training or apprenticeship 
programmes. EQL Solutions and Dawn Hodge 
Associates, which received an “Outstanding” 
from Ofsted earlier this year, have significant 
market presence in social care and are well 
positioned to support both smaller companies 
as well as corporate providers.
The introduction of the apprenticeship levy 
has caused a declined in companies offering 
apprenticeships. However, the Government has 
a target of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 and 
so far in the 2016/17 academic year the number 
of people signing up for apprenticeships was 
491,300. (Sourced from Gov.UK).
Caring every day
Since the CareTech Group came to the 
AIM market over 12 years ago, it has evolved 
through a mix of organic and prudent 
acquisitive growth that has led to our current 
position as one of the best-established and 
reputable national social care providers. 
We have national coverage across England, 
Wales and Scotland in a highly fragmented UK 
social care market. We cover the majority of 
the social care spectrum except elderly care.
The total market value is estimated (Laing and 
Buisson 2017) to be worth £7bn for children 
services and £5bn for the care of younger 
adults (below 65 years of age) in the learning 
disability and specialist services categories. 
The private sector share of this market has 
developed through successful outsourcing of 
services over the last 20 years and this trend is 
expected to continue. Local Authorities have 
largely protected their budgets for children 
and complex younger adults.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Quality and expertise
Quality is not simply compliance with the requirements of 
regulation, although that remains important. Our approach is 
to employ well qualified and skilled professionals who can ensure 
that we consistently exceed the expectation of our service users, 
their families, social workers and commissioners.
Placing people in the care of organisations that you can trust
The business of care is predicated on relationships, as much as 
it is on the practical support and guidance that we offer on a daily 
basis. Troubled children need the warmth and challenging support 
of their care workers while disabled adults make best progress 
within the trust that a great relationship brings. 
We are also mindful that social workers will prefer to place 
people in the care of organisations that share their commitment 
to optimism for service users, that they can rely on and deliver 
outstanding value.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5 We fundamentally believe in choice for all our clients and 
our determination to provide this choice in all our services 
is uppermost in our commercial thinking.
Client focused innovative care pathway approach
Care and support is characterised by optimism and a genuine 
belief in the abilities of our service users. Everyone we support 
has an opportunity to make progress in their lives and our 
professional teams work hard to help those people understand 
how to move forward. Many years ago we began to describe our 
services as a Care Pathway, making clear our intention to break 
away from the old belief that care is for life. We have delivered on 
this commitment and everyone we support, from young children 
to profoundly disabled adults, shares our approach to maximise 
their independence. This is great for service users, rewarding for 
our staff and strongly supported by those who commission 
and sponsor our services.
Innovate care pathways
One of the characteristics that differentiates CareTech from the 
average provider is our commitment to opportunity. Long before 
it became fashionable we introduced the concept of a Care 
Pathway to reflect our optimism that users of our services can 
make progress in their lives. We were never content to accept that 
someone in residential care should always be in residential care 
and developed alternatives at an early stage in our development 
as a Group.
