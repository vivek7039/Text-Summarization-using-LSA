Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
In 2017 we delivered another strong 
performance in challenging economic 
circumstances as rising inflation impacted 
both our own costs and customers’ 
disposable income. At the same time,  
we continued to make good progress with 
our business transformation programme, 
investing in new systems and processes  
as well as increased capacity and efficiency 
in our supply chain. We are successfully 
developing our product offer to meet 
customer needs and investing in improved 
customer service, in addition to  
accelerating growth in shop numbers.
Financial performance
Total sales grew to £960.0 million in 2017, up 7.4 per 
cent. Within this company-managed shop like-for-like 
sales grew by 3.7 per cent.
Underlying operating profit, excluding property profits 
and exceptional items, grew by 4.6 per cent to £81.7 
million (2016: £78.1 million). Pre-tax profit (including 
exceptional items) fell by 4.3 per cent to £71.9 million.
Market background 
Economic conditions became more challenging in 
2017, with business cost inflation rising significantly 
due to food ingredient and labour cost increases 
affecting the entire sector. We were able to leverage 
our scale and deliver productivity improvements to 
mitigate some of these pressures but, as expected, 
saw some year-on-year margin slippage. The market 
generally saw price inflation returning to the food 
sector, which resulted in a slowdown in disposable 
income growth for our customers.
Whilst the food-on-the-go sector remains highly 
competitive, a further year of unbroken growth in 
like-for-like sales demonstrates the continued 
relevance and strength of the Greggs brand.
Good growth and 
further strategic 
progress
Delivering our strategy
Greggs is a strong and trusted brand and we  
draw on our heritage in fresh bakery to compete 
successfully in the food-on-the-go market. Our 
purpose is to make good, freshly prepared food 
accessible to everyone with the aim of becoming 
the customers’ favourite for food-on-the-go.
We are committed to conducting our business  
in a responsible manner and, in doing so,  
to have a positive impact on people’s lives.
Our strategy has four pillars:
1. Great tasting, freshly prepared food
Greggs products are differentiated by the way we 
freshly prepare food each day in our shops and by 
offering outstanding value for good quality, great 
tasting food-on-the-go.
Total sales up 7.4%:

value. Sales of healthier options, including our 
Balanced Choice range offering fewer than 400 
calories and good nutritionals, continue to grow  
as we extend menu choice and take steps to 
encourage healthier food choices through 
disproportionate space allocation and promotion 
in our shops.
Alongside development of our Balanced Choice 
range we have adopted a proactive approach to 
supporting the Government’s Childhood Obesity 
Plan and making significant efforts to reduce salt, 
fat and sugar in our products and to encourage 
greater consumption of vegetables in the diet.
Hot food
Hot food is another area of growing customer 
demand, providing food-on-the-go solutions for 
all times of the day. Sales of hot sandwiches and 
hot soup are growing well and provide a platform 
for further menu development, which we intend 
will create the opportunity to extend trading  
in Greggs for longer in the day as our  
reputation grows.
Good food
Customers increasingly care where their food comes 
from and, because we make the majority of our food 
ourselves, we are well placed to deliver food they 
can trust. Unlike the majority of our competitors, 
who resell bought-in finished products, we are a 
large-scale food manufacturer in our own right 
dealing at source with base ingredients.
We have invested significantly in recent years, 
gaining independent accreditation for our sourcing 
and manufacturing credentials and have set out to 
lead the food-on-the-go sector in eliminating or 
reducing unnecessary ingredients at the same time 
as providing full information to allow customers to 
make informed choices.
Making good, freshly prepared food accessible to  
all income levels is embedded in our core purpose  
as a brand with outstanding value meal deals setting 
us apart from the competition. Our product strategy 
has been to nurture and protect our market-leading 
reputation in long-established traditional bakery 
categories adapted to food-on-the-go whilst 
developing new reasons to visit Greggs by offering 
quality and value in new growth areas.
Our traditional categories, including fresh baked 
savoury snacks, freshly prepared sandwiches and 
delicious sweet bakery treats, remain our best-selling 
products and are being supported by strong growth 
in new categories.
Breakfast
Breakfast-on-the-go continues to grow strongly  
and Greggs has established a leading position by 
focusing on offering outstanding value with our 
breakfast meal deal starting at just £2. This remains 
our fastest-growing part of our trading day and  
we continue to build increased spend and visit 
frequency through menu development. Strategically 
it plays an important role in diversifying demand 
patterns, making us less reliant on general shopping 
missions and less sensitive to weather.
Hot drinks
Led by coffee at breakfast, our reputation for quality, 
value and service in this growth category continues 
to build, enabling us to extend our drinks menu 
choice. Hot drinks feature in all of our meal deal 
offers and it is this outstanding value that 
differentiates us from our competitors.
Balanced Choice
Growing public concern over obesity is driving 
increased demand for healthier choices in food-on-
the-go. Greggs has a key role to play in encouraging 
healthier food choices, making good quality freshly 
prepared food accessible nationwide at outstanding

Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
We have a strong pipeline of new shop openings 
for 2018 and are planning to further accelerate 
our shop growth, aiming to add in the range  
of 110-130 net new shops in the year.
Looking ahead
Once again we have a strong pipeline of new 
product developments planned for the year ahead, 
strengthening traditional product areas and 
continuing to build our reputation in new  
growth categories.
2.  Best customer experience
As well as offering great tasting great value food, 
Greggs is loved by customers because of our fast 
and friendly service. Working in a Greggs shop is 
very demanding so we rely on our amazing teams  
to deliver fast, friendly service under pressure. We 
continue to invest to simplify our processes and 
increase productivity to release time for service,  
with significant gains last year from our new shop 
ordering process in addition to a best practice 
programme that we call ‘The Greggs Way’.
Our most loyal customers are signing up in rapidly 
increasing numbers to our award-winning Greggs 
Rewards scheme. The insight that this provides now 
includes satisfaction ratings and is helping to inform 
decision-making throughout the business, helping  
us to better meet customer needs every day.
Our shops 
The key consideration when customers choose where 
to shop for food-on-the-go is convenience. Being 
within easy reach for customers when they need us  
is a prerequisite and we are working hard to increase 
shop numbers in order to provide easy access 
everywhere. In 2017 we opened 131 new shops 
(including 45 franchise units) and closed 41, growing 
the estate to 1,854 shops trading as at 30 December 
2017. We opened our 202
nd
 franchise shop and 
extended our company-managed shop reach to new 
territory in Devon, in addition to opening further shops 
in Northern Ireland.
Refurbishment of our shops slowed down last year as 
we reached the end of our programme to transform 
our legacy bakery shops to our food-on-the-go format. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT CONTINUED
We completed 132 refurbishments and franchise 
partners refurbished a further ten units. We also 
successfully developed a new Drive Thru format that 
will allow us to compete effectively in this type of 
location as we seek new sites.
We have a strong pipeline of new shop openings  
for 2018 and are planning to further accelerate our 
shop growth, aiming to add in the range of 110-130 
net new shops in the year. In keeping with recent 
years, the majority of these new shops will increase 
our presence in travel, leisure and work-centred 
catchments. At the end of 2017 34 per cent of our 
shop estate was located in these catchment types.
3. Competitive supply chain 
In January 2017 we communicated details of the 
next phase of our major investment programme 
focused on increasing logistics capacity and 
consolidating our manufacturing operations into 
centres of excellence in order to support shop 
growth. Once implemented this new supply chain 
platform will deliver improvements to product 
quality, our competitiveness and, alongside 
systems investment, will complete our 
transformation from traditional bakery to food- 
on-the-go.
Overall our expansion plans will create thousands 
of new roles in retail and distribution operations 
but will result in fewer jobs in manufacturing. 
Decisions such as these, which impact our people, 
are always difficult but our teams have shown 
commitment and professionalism throughout 
these changes and we have been able to agree  
a way forward on a basis of voluntary redundancy 
in the majority of cases.
This investment phase is a complicated 
programme of work which will take until 2020  
to complete. We have made a good start in  
2017, completing the transfer of our Edinburgh 
operations to our Glasgow bakery, which has been

extended to become a centre of excellence for  
Yum Yum production, and extending our Leeds 
bakery to create a centre of excellence for cake  
and muffin manufacturing.
The year ahead will be the peak year for investment 
in the programme, including the creation of our 
centre of excellence for doughnuts in our Gosforth 
Park bakery.
Strategic change of this magnitude is always 
challenging and I am grateful for the commitment  
of our teams who have been making these changes 
whilst maintaining service standards to our shops.
4. First class support teams
We have made further significant progress in the 
fourth year of our major process and systems 
investment programme.
In 2017 we successfully deployed our largest ever 
systems roll out, replacing our traditional shop 
ordering with a new central forecasting and 
replenishment process. We have already seen 
benefits in improved product availability for 
customers and expect to see savings start to come 
through in lower wastage figures as we become 
more experienced with the system’s capabilities.
In the second half of the year we successfully 
deployed pilots in both logistics and manufacturing 
which will be rolled out alongside our supply chain 
investment programme.
Scoping work has also begun for the remaining SAP 
support modules, with human resources, payroll and 
property management to be implemented in 2018.
Having a positive impact on people’s lives
Greggs has a long-standing tradition and 
reputation as a socially responsible business and 
as such we want our actions to have a positive 
impact on people’s lives. This ambition covers  
a broad range of stakeholders and in 2017 we 
made further improvements in all areas and  
were pleased to achieve an increase to a ‘4.5 star’  
rating in the Business in the Community CR index 
in early 2018.
We encourage healthier food-on-the-go choices
As a leading bakery food-on-the-go retailer we 
recognise that many of the products we sell are 
traditional favourites best eaten in moderation.  
As such we aim to capture as much of the demand 
for these products as possible in a highly-
competitive market but at the same time we are 
taking steps to encourage customers to see 
Greggs as a food-on-the-go retailer selling a 
variety of products, including healthier options.
Our range of Balanced Choice products offers  
that choice at below 400 calories with good 
nutritional values and now represents more than 
£100 million of sales. We are committed to 
encouraging customers to make healthier food- 
on-the-go choices and are taking active steps by 
offering this range in all of our shops nationwide, 
providing access to all and allocating prominent  
and disproportionate space to bring these products  
to customers’ attention.
Alongside Balanced Choice we are working on 
sugar reduction, in addition to the salt and fat 
reductions seen in recent years. Other initiatives 
include working with New Cross Hospital in 
Wolverhampton to redesign the retail format of 
our shop there and the product range to meet  
the requirements of NHS guidance. In addition,  
in 2017 we made the ‘Pledge for Veg’ in partnership 
with the Food Foundation, through which we will 
help customers to increase their vegetable intake 
through design of our salads, soups and 
cold sandwiches.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT CONTINUED
We care where our products come from
All the tea, coffee, hot chocolate, orange juice, apple 
juice and bananas we sell are certified Fairtrade.  
We source our prawns and tuna from sustainable 
sources and have recently maintained our Tier 2  
status, despite increased requirements, in the Business 
Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare. In our internal 
supply chain the majority of our manufacturing sites 
have achieved AA standard on version seven of the 
BRC Global standard for food safety.
We share our success with the community around us
We continue to share our success with the local 
communities in which we operate. In 2017 this 
included increasing the amount of end-of-day food 
that we donated to good causes by 45 per cent and 
continuing to support the work of the Greggs 
Foundation, which celebrated its 30
th
 anniversary  
in 2017. Through the generous support of Greggs 
and other donors and fundraisers, including our staff 
and customers, the Greggs Foundation was able to 
distribute £3.1 million to support a wide range of 
initiatives that improve the quality of life in our local 
communities. These included the award-winning 
Greggs Breakfast Club programme which, with 
support from 80 partners, now provides six million 
free wholesome breakfasts each year to children  
in over 465 primary schools.
We aim to use energy efficiently and minimise waste
We hold the Carbon Trust Standard in recognition  
of our work on carbon efficiencies and our 
Environmental Management System is certificated  
to ISO 14001. We continue to trial technologies  
that could help to reduce our carbon footprint  
even further in the years ahead.
We know that coffee cup recycling is a significant 
issue and, as a responsible business, we are 
working hard to reduce our impact on the 
environment and do our bit to help find a solution. 
We are currently conducting a trial in 20 shops 
across Manchester and Liverpool city centres to 
establish feasibility for in-store recycling of hot 
drinks cups. This will give us the opportunity to 
ensure we have a robust and effective process  
in place before potentially rolling out further.  
In addition, we sell reusable hot drinks cups in  
all of our shops and offer customers a 20 pence 
discount when using a reusable cup. Greggs is 
also part of the Paper Cup Recycling and Recovery 
Group and is working with others in the industry 
towards delivering a long-term, nationwide paper 
cup recycling solution. We continue to work  
hard with our suppliers to further improve our hot 
drink cups to ensure that they are as sustainable  
as possible.
Reducing the use of plastic in society is another 
issue where we are trying to play our part. As a 
vertically-integrated business we have a natural 
advantage in making most of our products 
ourselves and controlling the way in which they  
are distributed. For example, we distribute  
food to our shops using reusable trays and have 
separation processes behind the scenes to 
support recycling. Going forward, we aim to 
reduce further the amount of plastic involved  
in our processes.

We are committed to creating a great place to work
We pay all of our people more than the National 
Living Wage, including those under the age of 25. 
We share ten per cent of our profits with employees 
and will be sharing a record £9.2 million with our 
people as a result of our strong performance in 2017.
Our Employee Opinion Survey engagement score  
has increased by five percentage points over the last 
two years; 81 per cent of our people say they feel 
committed to Greggs and to helping us achieve our 
goals. However, we are not complacent and in the  
year ahead will be working towards achieving the 
National Equality Standard as part of our commitment 
to make Greggs an even better place to work. We are 
committed to supporting the development of all our 
colleagues, in particular our talented female 
colleagues, as we work towards reducing our gender 
pay gap, which currently stands at 22 per cent. We 
have made good progress with this in recent years  
and at Board level have exceeded government 
guidelines with 43 per cent of our Board being women.
Further details of all of our actions in these areas are 
described elsewhere in this annual report.
Outlook for 2018
Whilst the UK consumer outlook remains 
challenging, with industry-wide cost pressures 
expected to moderate but continue in the year 
ahead, we are encouraged by the start to the year. 
Company-managed shop like-for-like sales in the 
eight weeks to 24 February 2018 have grown by 
3.2 per cent, and total sales are up 6.2 per cent.
2018 will be the peak year for investment in our 
supply chain as we create the platforms for further 
growth. We also plan to open a record number of 
new shops as we implement our plan to grow 
Greggs as a leading food-on-the-go brand.
