Non-GAAP measures
The Board believes that whilst statutory reporting measures provide a useful indication of the ﬁnancial 
performance of the Group, additional insight is gained by excluding certain non-recurring or non-trading 
transactions. These measures are deﬁned as follows:
(a)
Underlying proﬁt is calculated as proﬁt excluding proﬁt (or loss) on sale of ﬁxed assets, acquisition related
amortisation and external transaction costs.
(b)
Underlying earnings per share is calculated as proﬁt on ordinary activities after taxation, before proﬁt (or loss) 
on sale of ﬁxed assets, acquisition related amortisation, external transaction costs and exceptional taxation 
items (all net of tax), divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue in the period.
(c)
Cash generated from operations excludes external transaction costs.
The Group’s underlying measures of proﬁtability exclude proﬁt (or loss) on sale of ﬁxed assets, external transaction
costs, amortisation of acquisition related intangibles and exceptional items in respect of taxation. These items have
been adjusted for in determining underlying measures of proﬁtability as these underlying measures are those used 
in the day to day management of the business and allow for greater comparability across periods.
In 2017, following the commencement of amortisation of acquired intangible trade names and other crematoria 
related acquired intangibles, acquisition related amortisation of £1.8 million (2016: £nil) has also been excluded in
determining underlying proﬁtability measures. Acquisition related amortisation is deﬁned as being the amortisation
arising in respect of trade names, use of third party brand names and other crematoria related acquired intangibles.
