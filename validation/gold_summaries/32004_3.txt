Chairman’s Statement
Performance
Inland Homes has delivered another 
solid performance this year, on top of the 
significant investment that has been made 
into building the strength and expertise 
of our team, which has almost doubled in 
terms of headcount. We have recruited a 
considerable number of highly experienced 
individuals to create the right structure to 
support the future growth of the Company; 
in particular we have made further key 
appointments to the construction team 
as we move away from reliance on main 
contractors and develop this part of the 
business as an additional revenue stream.
The Group achieved a profit before tax 
and before revaluation of investment 
properties of £18.1 million (2016 restated*: 
£15.7 million) and a 4.3% increase in 
EPRA net asset value of £194.4 million 
(2016 restated*: £186.3 million). Including 
revaluation of investment properties, the 
profit before tax was £19.6 million (2016 
restated*: £33.7 million). This is lower than 
last year because of a revaluation uplift of 
£18.0 million in the previous year at Wilton 
Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. We 
continue to make significant progress at 
our flagship site of over 100 acres at Wilton 
Park where a new information centre has 
now been completed. I am delighted to 
be able to report that an outline planning 
application has now been submitted for 
350 homes and commercial space on this 
prestigious site. The site is producing gross 
annual rental income of £1.5 million and is 
a good example of how we sweat our assets 
and ensure that we maximise every income 
opportunity from our land bank. In line 
with International Accounting Standard 23, 
which requires that the cost of borrowings 
attributable to an asset like Wilton Park, 
which must, by virtue of the complicated 
planning process and substantial time 
taken to get ready for its intended use,  
be capitalised with the other costs  
relating to the project. Accordingly, we  
have capitalised the relevant borrowing 
costs in relation to Wilton Park and have 
included current year funding costs of £1.09 
million within inventories (2016 restated*: 
£0.85 million) in the Group’s balance sheet.
Our confidence in delivering 
significant further growth 
for our shareholders 
is underpinned by the 
considerable shortage of 
new homes in the area and 
price point we operate in, 
as well as the quality of our 
land assets.”

During the year, the Group sold 188 private 
units (2016: 147 units) at an average price 
of £306,000 (2016: £337,000). Whilst the 
average sales price is lower than the 
previous year, this reflects the mix of units 
sold during the year in what remains an 
attractive price point within the geographic 
areas in which we operate. This is endorsed 
by a current forward order book of £33 
million (including forward sales within 
joint ventures) (2016: £22.5 million). We 
have a record number of 427 units under 
construction (including 43 within a joint 
venture) and are expecting this pipeline 
to increase over the next financial year 
as we develop more of our sites that 
come through the planning process. Our 
enhanced construction capability has 
enabled the Group to provide ‘turnkey’ 
delivery of homes to Housing Associations, 
usually where the land has been purchased 
from Inland Homes. This allows us to 
secure a further profit beyond the land 
sale together with the benefits of positive 
cash flows from the construction revenues. 
We have £41.5 million of such contracts in 
place with three Housing Associations and 
this is an area of the business where we see 
good growth potential.

The maturity of Inland’s borrowings has also been lengthened with 100% of total borrowings being payable after one year, of which 53.5% 
are repayable between three and five years. This has resulted in a significantly stronger maturity profile for the Group balance sheet with 
net current assets increasing to £159.9 million (2016 restated*: £96.7 million). The EPRA net asset value per share and the adjusted EPRA 
net asset value per share at 30 June 2017 was 91.88p (2016 restated*: 88.22p) and 96.22p (2016 restated*: 92.34p) respectively and has 
been determined as follows:

Chairman’s Statement 
Continued
Land Portfolio
The land bank has increased over the 
previous year end following the disposal 
of 780 plots and 188 open market units. 
Our planning team has been extremely 
busy, having secured planning permissions 
for 1,856 plots during the financial year 
and a further 59 plots since the year end. 
A number of major sites within the land 
bank are proceeding through the planning 
process and I look forward to providing 
shareholders with positive news on these 
over the current financial year.
Our strategic land bank continues to grow, 
with options secured on sites with the 
potential for over 2,200 homes. Importantly, 
a number of these sites are now allocated 
into local plans and planning applications 
are being submitted. 
Dividend
In line with the Group’s strong performance 
and our progressive dividend policy, as 
well as our confidence in the outlook for 
the Company, I am pleased to inform 
shareholders that the Board is proposing 
a 33% increase in the final dividend to 1.2p 
per share (2016: 0.9p) subject to shareholder 
approval at the next Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 28 November 2017. Taking into 
account the interim dividend of 0.5p per 
share (2016: 0.4p) already declared and paid, 
this equates to total dividends of 1.7p per 
share (2016: 1.3p), a 31% increase.
Outlook
The housing market continues to be robust 
in the areas in which we operate and is 
underpinned by good demand from buyers 
and support from the Government’s Help to 
Buy scheme.
More moderate house price inflation should 
help maintain affordability in the near term 
and stabilising build cost inflation should 
underpin our margins as the benefits of 
our new direct build model start to filter 
through.
The planning system remains extremely 
slow and cumbersome with clearance 
of pre-start planning conditions being a 
major issue. Further, as widely reported 
by the rest of the housebuilding industry 
the ongoing shortage of skilled labour 
continues to be an area of concern.
Notwithstanding the above, the Board 
is confident that Inland Homes is well 
positioned to deliver strong operational  
and financial performance going forward.
