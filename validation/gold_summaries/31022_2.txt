1  The 2016 reported comparative results cover a shortened nine-month period and reflect 
the enlarged merged business for almost seven months. Therefore, in order to support 
a clear and effective assessment of the Group’s performance in 2017, the Directors 
have provided additional unaudited proforma full-year financial information for 2016. 
A reconciliation of 2016 reported results to 2016 proforma full-year financial information 
is provided in the Financial review.
2  Certain measures in this annual report, including full year comparative financial information, 
proforma financial information, underlying financial information adjusted EBITDA, and 
adjusted operating profit, are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. Underlying measures 
are reconciled back to their most directly comparable IFRS measures in the Financial review.
3  Underlying revenues exclude the impact of licensing milestones and development services 
revenues which can vary materially from period to period and excludes material royalties 
that are not recurring as a result of patent expiry or legal dispute. Underlying measures 
of profitability are calculated using underlying revenues and are adjusted for non-cash 
charges such as amortisation and share-based compensation, and exceptional items. 
A full reconciliation of reported and full year results to underlying financial results is 
provided in the Financial review.
