 Chief Executive’s review
06  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
Overview
2017 was a successful year with good performances 
from our crematoria and pre-need businesses. However,
while our funeral business continued to set the standard 
at the premium end of the market, having commented 
on an acceleration in market share decline in our 2016
Annual Report, market share continued to decline at an
accelerated rate in 2017 reﬂecting further increases in
competition. As a consequence, the Board has taken
decisive action to change the Group’s pricing strategy 
and market positioning in our funeral business.
Underlying operating proﬁt increased three per cent to
£104.6 million (2016: £101.7 million), with each operating
division trading in line with the Board’s expectations.
Alongside this, we continued to invest to support the
existing network, acquire well reputed businesses and
develop new crematoria.
Change of pricing strategy and market positioning
As the Chairman has set out in his statement, the Board
took decisive action in January 2018 to protect market
share in our funeral business and reposition the Group 
for future growth.
In addition to the pricing changes already implemented, 
we will test a range of new price points and services to 
our clients while preserving our unrivalled levels of service.
Delivering excellent client service remains a key strategic
priority and means that we can oﬀer the best quality
service at each price point and market segment in which
we choose to operate. We are now positioning ourselves 
as the best value service provider in the market, leveraging
the strong investment in the funeral business that we have
made over the years. In addition to these changes, we have
also embarked on a rigorous review to ensure that our
funeral operations are organised to run more eﬃciently
and eﬀectively.
Having delivered the market’s ﬁnancial expectations for
2017 our results for 2018 are less certain as we gauge client
response to various pricing scenarios while maintaining our
high levels of professional service and care. This has meant
rebasing expectations for 2018. The key challenge for 2018
is to ﬁnd the optimum relationship between price, service
and demand for our funeral business going forward.
The changing market
Over the last 18 months we have consistently drawn
attention to the increasingly competitive environment in
which we operate. The internet is beginning to change the
nature of competition as the funeral industry enters the
digital age. Clients are increasingly price-conscious and in
an over-supplied industry, are shopping around more. 
This continues to have an increasing impact on the Group’s
market share, with a signiﬁcant reduction in the average
number of funerals per location noted since 2015. The
average reduction in the number of funerals per location
per one thousand deaths between 2004 and 2014 was 
3.6 per cent. This accelerated to 6.8 per cent per year
between 2015 and 2017. We have assumed that this will
continue into 2018, and the revised pricing strategy and
promotional activity is aimed at reducing the rate of 
decline as the year progresses. 
We are evolving our funeral business to be
able to oﬀer a range of new price points and
services to our clients while preserving our
unrivalled levels of service. Delivering excellent
client service remains a key strategic priority
and means that we can oﬀer the best quality
service at each price point and market
segment we choose.

New pricing strategy
This increasingly competitive market was the background
against which the decision to change our pricing strategy
and market positioning was made in early 2018. In 2017,
approximately 60 per cent of our funerals were traditional
full-service funerals, seven per cent were simple funerals
and approximately 27 per cent had been pre-arranged.
The remainder of the Group’s volumes were contract and
other low value funerals. Reﬂecting the trend towards
lower cost funerals we immediately reduced the price of
the Group’s simple funeral by an average of approximately
25 per cent and froze the price of our traditional funerals 
in the majority of our locations.  
As a result of reducing the simple funeral price and 
other initiatives to be progressively tested during the year,
it is likely that this changing mix of funeral services will
continue. The Group currently anticipates that as a result 
of changes to its pricing strategy, simple funerals may
represent approximately 20 per cent of all funerals
performed in 2018. However, this is clearly an estimate 
and the precise mix will emerge during the year. 
It should also be noted that ours is an evolving pricing
strategy and other price and service level options are being
actively considered as we review client response. We have
also extended the services available from our online
business, Simplicity Cremations. In all cases, we aim to
provide the best quality and value in each segment. The
high quality of our oﬀering, more competitively priced, is
how we will diﬀerentiate ourselves, locally and nationally.
Delivering these changes eﬀectively will require tools 
and training for our staﬀ and this work is in progress. 
In order to promote the new prices and the business 
more generally, the Group expects to spend an additional
£2 million in 2018 and in subsequent years compared to
2017 on digital and other promotional activities, building 
on the work started in 2017 . This additional cost is expected
to reoccur and is likely to increase in future years.
Opportunities
In a fragmented and increasingly online marketplace we
have a signiﬁcant opportunity to leverage our existing
physical national funeral and crematorium networks and
create a powerful national digital presence in both our
traditional premium service market and other emerging
market segments. The ﬁrst example of this was Simplicity
Cremations, launched in November 2016 and currently
averaging a run rate of 1,000 direct cremations per year. 
We also continue to view selective acquisitions of 
well-established funeral businesses as an appropriate 
use of capital despite the changing market. We will also
continue to develop our network of crematoria.
Investment and development momentum
Our future development builds on strong, Group-wide
fundamentals, reﬂected in our track record of good
operating performance, continued excellent client service
results and the further acquisition of established funeral
businesses. A core strength of the management team is 
its ability to spot quality acquisitions and integrate them
eﬀectively within the business. During the year the Group
has acquired 24 funeral locations and one crematorium for
an aggregate investment of £28.3 million and has opened
14 satellite locations. 
Leadership and standards
We have continued to call for regulation in the industry,
commissioning and launching a ground-breaking report
into the pre-paid market. We have further industry-leading
initiatives in the pipeline.
We believe the funeral industry will beneﬁt signiﬁcantly
from proper regulation to ensure that clients are not 
misled into accepting below-par service and standards. 
We pride ourselves in providing industry-leading standards.
It is a thread which has run through our business from 
the beginning and we are determined to maintain this
focus while augmenting our products and improving 
our channels to market. Reaching our desired goals,
operational and ﬁnancial, will require our staying focused
on excellent service and we are committed to ensuring 
that this is the case.
Alongside this, it is increasingly important to us that all
stakeholders, including policymakers and those outside 
the industry, understand what we stand for and why 
our goal of achieving a properly regulated industry is
important. We welcome fair scrutiny of the industry 
and our business.
Delivering excellent client service in an
evolving digital age and increasingly
competitive funeral sector
We have long been known for our high quality of service
and every year we have reported on exceptionally high
levels of client satisfaction. We are determined this will
not change. This total commitment to quality of service
and client satisfaction will now be applied to a wider
range of products and price points. Our aim is to be
recognised as the company that provides the best value
funeral service, regardless of how simple or traditional.  
Adjusting pricing is relatively straightforward, but the
greater challenge is building the infrastructure and
developing the staﬀ necessary to provide excellent
service. We believe this is where the years of investment
in our facilities and staﬀ training will pay dividends, for 
us as a company, but also for our clients. It means we 
can oﬀer them unrivalled service at each product and
service level they choose and at a price that is
competitive. This is the repositioned Dignity.

Market overview
The UK funeral market is getting more complex. 
The internet is beginning to play an increasing role and
consumer behaviour is beginning to change. After years 
of declining deaths and a signiﬁcant rise in the number 
of funeral directors, although deaths are now projected to
increase in the coming years, there are around 30 per cent
fewer deaths per funeral director in the UK compared to 
25 years ago. Clients are becoming more price-sensitive 
and are shopping around more.
The Group monitors and responds to the environment it
operates in, seeking to understand the implications for the
short, medium and long-term. Outlined below are some
basic facts about the marketplace as it currently stands.
Further on I describe in more detail the key drivers in the
marketplace and what we are doing to address these
challenges.
Scale and structure of the market 
The funeral director market remains very fragmented, with
approximately two thirds of funeral directors being small
owner managed businesses. There are approximately 290
crematoria in the UK, with circa 66 per cent owned by local
authorities. It is estimated that three quarters of all funerals
result in a cremation with the remainder being burials.
In 2017, the initial publication of recorded total estimated
deaths in Britain for 52 weeks was 590,000, the same
number as the 53 weeks in 2016. Some of the Group’s 
key performance indicators rely on the total number of
estimated deaths for each period and this information is
obtained from the Oﬃce for National Statistics (‘ONS’).
Although annual deaths have declined signiﬁcantly since
the early 1990s from 640,000 to a low of 539,000 in 2011,
the last ﬁve years have seen deaths above that level. The
ONS expects long-term increases in the number of deaths,
reaching approximately 700,000 per year by 2040. Deaths
have been elevated in the last few years. Whether this
marks the start of this longer-term trend or a temporary
anomaly is too early to conclude. 
  Dignity’s funeral market share
  11.5% (2016:11.8%)
  Funeral services:
Dignity has approximately 11.5 per cent of the funeral
market. This gives the Group suﬃcient size to operate 
its locations eﬃciently in a way that shares expensive
resources, such as mortuaries and specialist vehicles,
whilst providing very high levels of service to each family 
it looks after.
  This size still gives the Group good scope to acquire
owner managed businesses in areas where it is not 
well represented.
  Number of active pre-arranged funeral plans
  450,000 (2016:404,000)
  Pre-arranged funeral plans:
Dignity’s national network of funeral locations and strong
relationships with many different aﬃnity partners has
allowed it to sell signiﬁcant volumes of pre-arranged
funerals that should represent incremental activity for 
the funeral division in the future.
  Dignity’s crematoria market share
  10.7% (2016:10.1%)
  Crematoria:
With 45 crematoria, Dignity is the largest single 
operator in Britain. The cremations performed represent
approximately 10.7 per cent of deaths in Britain. There 
is still signiﬁcant scope to expand through acquisition 
or new builds where possible.

The market share of our three businesses Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 09
Price and affordability
The increased media and political interest in
the rising cost of funerals in the last few years
has aﬀected the marketplace. Consequently,
price and aﬀordability are rightly becoming
increasingly important factors for a growing
number of clients. Combined with the
internet which allows them to shop around,
prices are coming under growing pressure.
Clients want a funeral company that can
provide a range of pricing options while
guaranteeing a high quality and value-for-
money service.
Increasing competition
Whilst our single biggest source of business
remains previous experience and word 
of mouth, the chart below demonstrates 
the ongoing decline of this traditional source 
of business in the face of competition from 
an increasing trend towards pre-arranged
funerals and other competitors. 
Connecting digitally
According to ONS’ recent analysis, 90 per cent
of households have access to the internet, 
78 per cent of consumers have accessed it 
‘on the go’ via a device and 75 per cent of
those aged 55 to 64 now buy online. Given
this, it is not surprising that there is now
signiﬁcant use of the internet to ﬁll the
knowledge gap around funerals. Data from
Google indicates over 5.2 million searches 
in 2017 compared to 4.6 million in 2016 for
funeral related advice and information. The
most popular searches were for advice when
someone dies and what is involved with
arranging a funeral with searches for local
funeral directors also very high. Signiﬁcantly,
the providers of this advice online are more
frequently consumer websites, media sites
and comparison websites rather than funeral
directors. Consumers also now expect to 
be able to check or compare funeral prices
online. We also believe more people are
shopping around, talking to more than
one funeral director before making the
arrangements. 
Changing client demands
It is clear that direct cremations represent 
a small, but increasing proportion of all
funerals. Sun Life’s 2017 Cost of Dying report
also describes how, within their surveyed
population, nine per cent (compared to seven
per cent the year before) of funerals last 
year were eco, environmental or woodland
funerals. They also report 31 per cent of
funerals being described by funeral directors
as a “celebration of life funeral”, and note a
signiﬁcant increase in these types of service
on the previous year. They should be
interpreted as a direction of travel for
consumer behaviour rather than precise
metrics about the entire market.

The brand
With a growing emphasis on price there
is a risk that the industry becomes
commoditised, with consumers initially
choosing on price and assuming that all
funeral providers are the same. In such
a market an ability to leverage a strong
brand becomes crucial.  
In addition, our marketplace is
fragmented and increasingly online.
This provides a challenge, but also a
signiﬁcant opportunity to leverage 
our scale and create a powerful brand.
In the pre-digital world, the strength 
of our local trusted businesses, trading
on reputation and high-quality service
gave us a pre-eminent position. In the
digital age there is a compelling
requirement, and opportunity, to
leverage and build a national brand 
and add that to the mix, supporting 
and enhancing our strong local market
positions. The ﬁrst step has been to
create a new brand style and to begin
to develop brand awareness online.
This work is a strategic priority for 
the Group.
New products and service levels
The brand will be supported by a
growing suite of products, product
reﬁnements and price points. We 
are working on and trialling new
propositions for cremations and 
simple funerals, as well as developing
our pre-need packages. We are also
reviewing the advantages of launching
into other segments under diﬀerent
sub-brands, including a mid-market
oﬀering. We have already launched our
aﬀordable cremation service, Simplicity,
and subsequently oﬀered three new
packages and prices. 
Strengthening the competitiveness
of our funeral locations
The combination of a strong national
brand and a range of product and price
oﬀerings to clients will strengthen the
competitiveness of our branches.
However, more can and will be done at
a local level as part of a rigorous review
to ensure our operations are organised
to run more eﬃciently and eﬀectively.
Simplicity Cremations
Simplicity oﬀers low cost direct
cremations without any initial funeral
service that are both respectful and
digniﬁed. They are an aﬀordable
alternative to a full funeral or for those
wishing to have a simple cremation.
We have recently added a pre-need
option and will also be providing the
option in future to attend one of our 
45 crematoria for a committal service.

Good progress
We want to ensure that when individuals
are searching online for a funeral
director, we are well presented and are
at the top of the list. We have made
good progress so far on this front. 
We have set up websites for over 
800 of our funeral directors and
started to strengthen the online
presence and authority of our main
site. As at January 2018, it had the
highest domain authority on websites
of any provider. 
The Group has also launched a new
service for clients that makes it easier
for them to notify family members
through email, social media and the
internet of funeral arrangements. This
service also allows families to order
ﬂowers and make donations online.
We are piloting a number of other
client-supporting initiatives and
services. If successful this will be
followed by national roll outs. We are
also planning the second phase of
developments for our funeral director
websites and are developing industry-
leading content to support all funeral-
related guidance topics. 
In truth, the industry has been one 
of the last to embrace the digital and
online revolution. There is much
catching up to do but also major
opportunities for those leading players
who get it right. We are absolutely
determined to succeed and are making
the investment in terms of technology
and people to ensure that we do. In
today’s digitally enabled and data rich
world it is essential that we equip our
people with the latest technology and
tools to support their activities and the
services we provide to our clients.
Funeral notices online
The Group has launched a new online
funeral notices service that makes it
easier for clients to notify family
members of funeral arrangements
through social media and the internet.
The service also allows families to
arrange ﬂowers and make donations.

The internet is changing the
nature of competition as 
the funeral industry enters 
the digital age. The Group 
is well placed to respond and
lead as it is the only operator
with a national network of
funeral locations and
crematoria.
Engaging with clients online
Our ongoing digital investment is
aimed at making our products and
services more immediate, intuitive
and relevant, supporting and
assisting our clients at a diﬃcult time.

12  | Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017  
While increasing competition often
leads to higher standards, in an
unregulated industry this is far less
certain and the funeral industry is a
case in point. In addition, in the case 
of a service industry, the quality of
service being provided is not known 
in advance. Consequently, the
importance of reputation and, just 
as crucially, the need for regulation 
is paramount. 
We regret very much that the provision
of funeral services is not regulated and
have continued to lead calls for this 
to change. Dignity would welcome
regulation of the funeral industry which
set out minimum standards for core
activities such as the care of the
deceased, minimum standards of
facilities and also operating procedures
in crematoria. 
We therefore continue to support
legislative changes by the Scottish
Government enacted in 2016. This
provides it with the powers to regulate
the funeral industry. Dignity welcomes
this progress and anticipates making
further contributions to the discussion
on the service standards required
within the regulations.
Dignity also welcomed changes to 
the Funeral Planning Authority (‘FPA’),
which acts as a self-regulatory body 
for the sale of pre-arranged funeral
plans. The changes removed provider
representation from the Board of the
FPA and made them independent of
those selling plans. Registration with
the FPA and compliance with its
requirements will help to provide
further comfort to clients as to the
quality of the plan they are buying.  
For our part, in 2017 we commissioned
and published research into the pre-
paid funeral market, asking whether
this market was working well for
consumers. We are continuing to
engage with HM Treasury and the 
FCA on the topic of regulation. 
With regard to crematoria, these are
subject to environmental regulations 
in accordance with “The Secretary of
States Guidance Notes for Crematoria-
PG5/2(12)”, with emission levels being
monitored by Environmental Health
Oﬃcers in England and Wales and
Scottish Environment Protection
Agency in Scotland. The abatement of
mercury emissions has improved the
environmental position with Dignity
abating more than the current
legislative requirements.
Leading the call
for regulation
and higher
standards.
The pre-paid funeral market
Working with a respected and
independent partner, Fairer Finance,
we commissioned a well-received
report which asked whether this
market was working well for
consumers.  
Ground-breaking research 
into cremations
We wish to provide our clients with
the best possible service, one which
fully meets or exceeds their needs.
To do this we need to properly
understand them and this requires
research. At present we are
exploring issues around cremations
through two research projects. 
The ﬁrst is a study on the impact of
direct cremation funerals on grief,
working with bereavement specialists
and leading academics from home
and abroad. The aim is to produce
guidance for consumers and the
industry on the decisions to be 
made at the point of determining a
cremation, and their potential impact. 
The second project looks at what
consumers most value from a
cremation service. With this insight
we will be able to ensure that our
cremation services are giving clients
what they really want and value, as
well as providing useful insights for
the industry as a whole.  
Thought leadership from Dignity
External recognition
In 2017, Dignity Funeral Plans became
the ﬁrst ever organisation in the UK 
to be accredited the BSI Kitemark for
customer service. BSI produce technical
standards for various services and
across many industries and their
Kitemark is a widely recognised
symbol of quality and trust globally.

Chief Executive’s review – Outlook Q&A
   What has happened in your
market to trigger this change 
of strategy?
As we mentioned at our Q3 trading
update at the end of 2017, we continue
to see signiﬁcant competition across
the business. A fragmented market is
becoming more complicated. The
internet is belatedly bringing change 
to the funeral market, and consumer
behaviour is beginning to change.
Although deaths are now projected to
increase, we estimate that there are
around 30 per cent fewer deaths per
funeral director in the UK compared 
to 25 years ago. Clients are becoming
more price-sensitive and are shopping
around more. 
Due to these factors, the Group has
experienced a decline in its market
share. We have seen a rise in volume
erosion. The average reduction in the
number of funerals per location per
one thousand deaths between 2004
and 2014 was 3.6 per cent. This
accelerated to 6.8 per cent per year
between 2015 and 2017. The Board
has been considering alternative
pricing and strategic initiatives over 
the last 18 months and believed that
the time was right to reposition the
business and its pricing to protect
market share.
   What are the Group’s immediate
strategic priorities?
It is very clear. We as a management
team and Board have to deliver the
new strategy. This means promoting
our new oﬀerings and positioning to
the marketplace and providing an
unrivalled and competitively priced
service, to the marketplace. It means
considering new price points and
service oﬀerings as part of our evolving
pricing and product strategy. It means
rigorously reviewing our operations 
to ensure that they are more eﬃcient
and eﬀective. It also means we have 
to carefully monitor and review the
progress we are making through this
year. Our goal is to protect market
share and reposition the Group for
future growth, recognising that our
actions will have a substantial impact
on proﬁts in 2018 and that the new
relationship between volumes and
margins will take time to become clear.
   What opportunities do you see
for the Group in the changing
market environment?
We have the scale and strength to
leverage our brand. We have the
resources to ensure that we are 
the leading provider in the digital 
and online space. We have the
management team and Board that can
and is responding rapidly to changing
client demands in terms of product
and pricing. We have the vision for
what a modern funeral service
provider should be in the light of the
changes outlined above. We have 
the ambition to get ahead of the
competitive curve and continue to
provide sustainable growth and a
healthy future for all our stakeholders.
  Going forward, what are the
Group’s strongest assets?
There are a number. We have the
required expertise and experience 
to understand the marketplace and
respond to changing client needs. We
run high quality operations and believe
we set the highest standards within 
the industry. We have the ﬁnancial
strength and quality of management 
to deliver on our strategic priorities.
Most of all, we have the commitment
of our people on the ground, who
regularly go the extra mile for clients
and are expert and compassionate in
dealing with people at an extremely
diﬃcult time in their lives.
   How conﬁdent are you about 
the future of the Group in the
medium-term?
We saw that the funeral market was
changing and have now taken steps 
to respond to the challenges. We will
be performing further tests on pricing
and services oﬀered and these will
evolve as we analyse the results.
Alongside this, we are taking a detailed
look at our operational model. 
Q

Q&A
An already fragmented market 
is becoming more complicated.
The internet is beginning to play
an increasing role and consumer
behaviour is beginning to change.
After years of declining deaths and
a signiﬁcant rise in the number 
of funeral directors, although
deaths are now projected to
increase, we estimate that there
are around 30 per cent fewer
deaths per funeral director in the
UK compared to 25 years ago.
Clients are becoming more 
price-sensitive and are shopping
around more. 
We have been alert to the
challenges facing the Group in 
this changing and increasingly
competitive environment. At the
beginning of 2018 we judged that
decisive action was needed to
address the challenges we faced.
We have taken that action and our
focus this year is on delivering our
new pricing and product strategy.  
At the same time we will continue
to demonstrate industry leadership
to seek the regulated market that
will be good for clients and society
which plays to our strengths as a
well-managed business with high
levels of client satisfaction.
