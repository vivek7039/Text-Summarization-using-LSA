 2005 has been my first year as Chairman
of Hanson PLC, having been appointed
to the role in April 2005. I am pleased to
be able to report that during 2005 the
group once again achieved excellent
progress against its primary objective,
which is to create sustainable, long-term
value for our shareholders. 
We have grown the group turnover,
earnings and margins of our existing
businesses in 2005 and have added
further value through a number of
significant acquisitions. We have
increased our dividend and share
buyback programme. 
Our operating environment has continued
to change during the year, including
further consolidation of our customer and
competitor base. Both at a strategic and
at an operational level, Hanson believes 
it is meeting these challenges. 
Returns to shareholders
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 1 4.1 5p (1 2.80p) per share.
This, together with the interim dividend,
makes a total of 20p (1 8.1 5p) for the
year, an increase of 1 0.2%. The “Investor
information” section of this report
provides payment details.
Hanson has continued the on-market
share buyback programme begun in
2004. During the year ended December
31 , 2005, we bought back 8,335,000
shares (6,350,000 shares) for £46.7m
(£26. 1m), equivalent to 1.1% (0.9%) of
outstanding shares.
Board of Directors
After the AGM in 2005, Chris Collins
stepped down as Chairman. On your
behalf, I thank Chris for his tremendous
contribution, initially as an Executive
Director of Hanson and then as Chairman.
We are also grateful for the contributions
over many years of Simon Keswick 
and Kenneth Baker as Non-executive
Directors, who also stepped down
following the AGM.
In August 2005, we welcomed John
Brady to our Board as a Non-executive
Director. John brings with him a wide
experience gained in his years at
McKinsey, latterly as a Director working
on board strategy. 
Corporate governance
Although plans to introduce a mandatory
Operating and Financial Review have
been shelved by the UK government, 
we are required to produce the equivalent
of an Operating and Financial Review 
to satisfy US regulatory requirements.
“During 2005, the group once again
achieved excellent progress against
its primary objective, which is to 
create sustainable, long-term value 
for our shareholders. ”
Mike Welton
Chairman, Hanson PLC
We have expanded this to give
stakeholders in the group an insight 
into the way in which the Board of
Hanson PLC analyses its environment
and operating activities. 
We remain fully compliant with section
404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
ahead of the requirement for foreign 
US registrants. This underlines our
commitment to strong financial control
and discipline.
Corporate responsibility
Hanson is committed to a programme 
of ongoing improvement in all areas of 
its corporate responsibility.
I am happy to report that for the fifth
consecutive year we saw an overall
improvement in our safety statistics. 
We promote a culture of continuous
improvement in our safety awareness
across all of our operations, with the
Board monitoring formally the group’s
safety performance on a quarterly basis.
The information obtained from these
quarterly reports and from presentations
to the Board is used to identify where
particular attention should be focused
and to assess the effectiveness of 
our approach.
Environmental issues are also 
reported quarterly to the Board. Our
careful management of environmental
issues is an integral part of our overall
business strategy. 
Hanson people
The Hanson team of highly motivated
people is one of Hanson’s greatest
assets. We are dedicated to delivering
increased value to all our constituents
(including shareholders, customers,
suppliers, fellow employees and the
communities in which we operate). 
The introduction, some two years ago, 
of the Hanson guiding principles for
employees is one of the drivers of a high
performance corporate culture. I have
been surprised and delighted by the 
level of expertise and enthusiasm I have
encountered since assuming the role of
Chairman and would like to thank Alan
Murray and the rest of his team for their
efforts and achievements during 2005. 
Looking forward
We expect to make further progress
during 2006 based on strong market
positions, value adding acquisition
opportunities and continued financial
discipline. I believe we have the assets
and the people to realise our objective
and create sustainable value for all our
stakeholders.
