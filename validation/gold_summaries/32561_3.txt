 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 04
Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Although the modern day 
Whitbread is very different from 
the original brewing business 
founded by Samuel Whitbread in 
1742, we are immensely proud of 
our history and it is a great honour 
for me and my colleagues on the 
Board to play our own part in the 
Whitbread story. 
The links to our heritage remain strong. 
Our base is still in Bedfordshire and  
we are delighted to be able to welcome 
members of the Whitbread family to  
our Annual General Meeting each year, 
whilst our core values of investing in  
our Winning Teams and being a Force 
for Good in our communities remain as 
important to us today as they always 
have been.
We are very aware of our responsibility 
to ensure that this great British company 
continues to thrive and, as such, we are 
focused both on driving growth and 
managing risk to an appropriate level, 
whilst exhibiting excellent corporate 
governance. We operate a conservative 
approach to the management of our 
balance sheet and this provides us  
with a solid base in turbulent and 
changing times.
Our Winning Teams are the key to our 
success and I would like to thank our 
50,000 employees for the fantastic 
work they do in giving our customers  
a great experience. 
Consistent strategy
I explained this time last year that the 
fundamentals of our strategy, which  
is to provide sustainable long-term 
value for our shareholders by growing 
our successful Premier Inn and Costa 
brands, whilst delivering a good  
return on capital, were unchanged.  
This remains true today, as we continue 
undaunted by political upheaval and 
economic uncertainty.
We have a clear plan and we have  
made good progress against the three 
strategic priorities outlined by our  
Chief Executive, Alison Brittain, last 
April. These are to grow and innovate in 
our core UK businesses; to focus on our 
strengths to grow internationally; and  
to build the capability and platform to 
support future growth. More detail on 
our strategy can be found on pages  
10 to 13 and information on progress 
against our strategic objectives can  
be found on pages 41 to 45.
We have remained on course to deliver 
our objectives, whilst at the same time, 
refreshing our Board and the executive 
leadership team. I believe that the new 
team will enable Whitbread to enter  
the next phase of its life with renewed 
vigour and confidence.

The third new appointment to the Board 
this year is that of Adam Crozier, with 
effect from 1 April 2017. Adam is Chief 
Executive of ITV plc and has been Chief 
Executive of a number of public and 
private sector organisations over the 
last 21 years, in the media, logistics  
and retail sectors. Adam is a very high 
quality business leader, with a strong 
background in business transformations, 
brands, communication and marketing 
and his expertise will be of great value 
to the Whitbread Board as we continue 
to expand our successful Premier Inn 
and Costa brands.
Wendy Becker stepped down from  
the Board on 31 December 2016 after 
nine years of service to Whitbread and 
Stephen Williams, who has also just 
completed nine years of service, will  
step down immediately after the AGM  
in June. I would like to thank both 
Wendy and Stephen for their much 
valued contribution to the Whitbread 
Board during a very successful period 
for the Company. Wendy has played a 
significant role as a member of all three 
Board Committees, whilst Stephen has 
served both as Senior Independent 
Director and, more recently, as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee. I would 
also like to thank Stephen for extending 
his membership of the Board so as to 
provide handover support to Deanna  
as she takes on the leadership of the 
Remuneration Committee.
I look forward to seeing as many of you 
as possible at our AGM on Wednesday 
21 June 2017.

Force for Good
I believe that it is important that 
companies act as a Force for Good in 
their communities as well as being great 
employers and, of course, delivering on 
financial objectives for their shareholders.
This has always been a core value at 
Whitbread and, once again, we have 
made some great progress this year.  
I reported in last year’s report that we 
had raised £6 million for Great Ormond 
Street Hospital Charity towards a  
£7.5 million target. I am delighted to  
be able to report that this target was 
met in November 2016, with the new 
Premier Inn Clinical Building due to 
open later this year. Meanwhile, a  
further £1.8 million has been raised for 
the Costa Foundation during the year, 
with 72 school projects having been 
completed so far, bringing access to 
education to thousands of children  
in coffee-growing communities.
Modern slavery is a live topic this  
year, as companies begin to publish  
a statement on the subject on their 
websites. As you would expect, 
Whitbread has published its own 
statement, which can be found  
on our website. For us this is not merely 
about meeting a requirement though.  
I can assure you that it is a subject we 
take very seriously and we are in no  
way complacent. More information  
on our activities in this area can be 
found on pages 50 to 51.
Corporate governance
You will see in our remuneration  
report on pages 78 to 98 that we  
have proposed some updates to  
our remuneration policy. The current 
policy was approved in 2014 and we  
are required to put an updated policy 
to shareholders for approval at the 
AGM. The Remuneration Committee 
has taken the opportunity to ensure 
that our policy is well aligned to our 
strategy and has re-balanced the 
Annual Incentive Scheme so as to focus 
a little more on the leading indicators of 
future financial performance and a little 
less on in-year profit. It is proposed that 
LTIP targets be re-set so as to reflect 
the business plans and, in particular, the 
cost headwinds such as the National 
Living Wage, business rates, commodity 
price inflation and foreign exchange 
rates as well as planned investment  
of non-productive capital in Germany, 
China and IT.
I believe that our approach to 
remuneration is grounded and 
conservative and that we are sensibly 
positioned relative to other companies.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final  
dividend of 65.90 pence per share, 
making a total dividend of 95.80  
pence per share, up by 6.0%. The final 
dividend will be paid on 30 June 2017  
to shareholders on the register at the  
close of business on 26 May 2017.  
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan will 
continue to operate. Details of how to 
participate in this plan can be found on 
the Company’s website. Details of the 
Group’s dividend policy can be found 
on page 56 in the Group Finance 
Director’s review.
Shareholder benefits
Last year, having taken account  
of feedback from shareholders on  
the previous electronic system, we 
introduced a new shareholder benefits 
card. I’m pleased that the new card 
appears to have been well received by 
shareholders and has, for the most part, 
worked well. I have certainly noticed  
a significant reduction in correspondence 
on the subject. Shareholders who 
received the card last year, should so  
do automatically this year, providing 
that they still hold the required 64 
shares in Whitbread. Any shareholder 
who holds this number of shares, who 
did not register for a card last year and 
would like to do so, can find further 
details on page 173.
The Board
As I mentioned earlier in this statement, 
there have been a number of Board 
changes during the year, as well as 
changes to the senior executive team, 
which Alison reports on in her review  
on page 7.
Two new independent non-executive 
directors, David Atkins and Deanna 
Oppenheimer joined the Board on  
1 January 2017. David is the Chief 
Executive of Hammerson plc, a major 
UK property business with interests 
across a number of European markets. 
Whitbread has a clear growth strategy, 
which is underpinned by an extensive 
property portfolio, and David’s 
experience in the European retail 
property sector will provide the 
Whitbread Board with invaluable 
insights as we expand both in the  
UK and overseas.
Deanna is a highly experienced 
executive, with a strong background  
in mass consumer retail, and will bring 
her experience of having worked with  
a broad range of leading edge digital 
businesses in her role at CameoWorks 
to the Whitbread Board. In addition, 
Deanna’s experience of chairing the 
Tesco Remuneration Committee  
makes her well placed to succeed 
Stephen Williams as Chair of our  
own Remuneration Committee.
I believe that it 
is important that 
companies act as a 
Force for Good in 
their communities 
as well as being 
great employers.”
