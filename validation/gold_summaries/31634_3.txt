 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
2017 was another excellent year for Compass. We continue to 
pursue our clear and focused strategy, which has again delivered 
sustainable organic growth and returns for shareholders. North 
America performed strongly, and revenues in both Europe and  
Rest of World accelerated in the second half of the year as expected.  
We improved margins by driving further efficiencies through the 
business, aided by the end of the restructuring plan in Offshore & 
Remote. Details of our operational and financial performance  
can be found on pages 14 to 33. This performance reaffirms the 
Board’s confidence in the effectiveness of our business model and 
strategy, both of which have been central to our long term success 
(see pages 14 to 17).
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
As a result of our strong performance, the Board is recommending  
a 5.7% increase in the final dividend for the year of 22.3 pence per 
share (2016: 21.1 pence per share). This gives a total dividend for 
the year of 33.5 pence per share (2016: 31.7 pence per share), 
an increase of 5.7%. The final dividend will be paid on 26 February 
2018 to shareholders on the register on 19 January 2018.
In addition to the ordinary dividend, and as a result of the Group’s 
robust cash generation, we paid a £1 billion special dividend in July 
and bought back £19 million in shares during the year. We remain 
committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings and 
will continue to return surplus cash to shareholders and to target net 
debt/EBITDA of around 1.5x.
OUR PEOPLE
At Compass, we owe our success to our 550,000+ employees all 
over the world. I would like to thank them for their commitment and 
hard work during the year. When I visit the business, I am always 
impressed by their vast experience and unrelenting focus on our 
clients and consumers. It is then easier to understand why we’ve 
been so successful and, as importantly, why we expect the success 
to continue.
This was very much in evidence when, as a Board, we visited our 
award-winning US subsidiary Bon Appétit, in Silicon Valley. It 
services the premium and high end of the market and is regarded 
by independent experts as one of the foremost ground-breaking 
companies in the food service industry. Bon Appétit works with 
some of the most demanding and innovative clients in the world and 
their success is an inspiration to all of us to keep raising our game 
across all our sectors and sub-sectors.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Our people are also central to our ability to achieve our goals in a 
responsible and sustainable manner. Two years ago, we sharpened 
our approach to Corporate Responsibility to support the longer term 
ambition of our business and stakeholders. As part of this strategic 
review, we agreed to proactively support the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and selected the goals where we believe 
that we can make the most positive social impact. There is still much 
more to do but I am pleased with the progress that we have made 
so far. See pages 37 to 41 and www.compass-group.com for more 
about our activities.
Consistent performance
I’m delighted to report another excellent 
year for Compass. We continue to pursue 
our clear and focused strategy, which 
has again delivered a strong performance 
for shareholders, and we remain positive 
about the future opportunities we see.
I’d like to take this opportunity to thank 
everyone who works for Compass for  
their hard work and dedication, which  
are fundamental to our ongoing success.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2017 12 GOVERNANCE AND THE BOARD
Integrity and trust are more important than ever in today’s business 
world. One of my key responsibilities as Chairman is to set the 
tone for the company and ensure good governance (see pages  
42 to 46). In this I have been extremely well supported by the 
members of the Board. They bring balance and a wealth of skills 
and experience to our organisation which complement the talents 
of our executive team. I thank them all for their valuable contribution 
as we continue to uphold the high standards expected of us, to 
maintain oversight of the strategic, operational and compliance 
risks across the Group and to define our path to success.
APPOINTMENT OF NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE
In September, we announced a significant change in the Group’s 
Board. Richard Cousins, who has been an outstanding Chief 
Executive for the past 11 years, will step down from his role on  
31 March 2018 and retire from the Group on 30 September 2018.  
It has been a huge pleasure to work with Richard, and on behalf of 
the Board I want to thank him for his extraordinary contribution to 
the Group. Richard has transformed Compass into a sustainable, 
industry-leading organisation that delivers excellent food services 
to our customers, attracts and develops great people and generates 
significant returns for shareholders.
I am delighted that Richard will be succeeded by Dominic 
Blakemore, our former Chief Operating Officer, Europe. Dominic 
became Deputy Chief Executive Officer on 1 October 2017, and 
will take over as Group Chief Executive Officer on 1 April 2018. 
In the ensuing period, he and Richard will work closely to ensure  
a smooth transition.
Dominic’s appointment was the result of a rigorous succession 
process. He is exceptionally well qualified to lead the business, and 
has already contributed significantly to the Group, for four years as 
Group Finance Director and, for the past two years, managing our 
business in Europe. Dominic has the leadership skills combined 
with the industry and operational experience to lead Compass to 
continued future success. He also benefits from the support of a 
very strong senior management team and together they will continue 
to build on the Group’s strong track record under Richard’s tenure. 
The Board looks forward to working with Dominic in his new role.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Compass had another strong year. North America continues to 
deliver excellent growth, we are continuing to make progress in 
Europe and in Rest of World, with trends in our commodity related 
business improving.
We continue to drive operating efficiencies around the business 
which, combined with the end of the restructuring in our Offshore  
& Remote business, resulted in margin improvement of 20 basis 
points in the period.
Given our excellent cash generation and the strength of the 
business, this year we returned £1.6 billion to shareholders via 
ordinary and special dividends and share buybacks. This reflects 
our commitment to return surplus cash to shareholders whilst 
maintaining an efficient balance sheet.

Our expectations for FY2018 are positive, with growth and margin 
improvement weighted to the second half. The pipeline of new 
contracts is encouraging and our focus on organic growth, 
efficiencies and cash gives us confidence in achieving another year 
of progress.
In the longer term, we remain excited about the significant 
structural  growth opportunities globally and the potential for further 
revenue growth, margin improvement, as well as continued returns 
to shareholders.
