 A year of 
transition
The performance of the business  
in 2017 has been in line with the 
Board’s expectations and good 
progress has been made.”

Overview
Following the sale of our Adult Services 
business to Cygnet Health Care Limited 
(Cygnet), a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
US company Universal Health Services, Inc. 
at the end of 2016, Cambian became a pure 
children’s specialist education and behavioural 
health services business, offering a full range 
of essential services from therapeutic fostering 
through to specialist schools and residential 
care. As at the end of 2017, we managed 
222 facilities and employed over 4,500 staff, 
looking after 1,920 children and young people.
2017 has been a year of transition as we 
established our platform to achieve modest 
growth and become the leading provider in 
children’s services. As part of the conditions 
of the sale of our Adult Services business to 
Cygnet, we undertook to support these activities 
through a transitional services agreement 
(TSA) on commercial terms with Cygnet, which 
required significant management and staff 
resources until the TSA completed at the end of 
June. We were not therefore able to right size 
all our cost base until the second half of last 
year. However, since then we have undertaken 
a significant cost-cutting exercise. This will result 
in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions 
on an annualised basis, half of which have 
been reflected in 2017.
We have also spent 2017 repositioning the 
business towards a differentiated integrated 
recovery model incorporating care, education 
and therapy for children with the highest needs, 
which is where we believe there is a significant 
shortage of care and education facilities. 
This transformation has led us to review all 
of our facilities and where appropriate we 
have closed certain facilities that cannot be 
re-positioned cost-effectively . We have largely 
completed this process with one facility likely to 
be closed or sold in 2018. This transformation 
has also led us to review the strength of our 
management team and its ability to deliver 
more acute services, as a result of which 
we have made a number of senior hires, 
comprising Head of Special Educational Needs, 
Head of Fostering, Director of Quality and 
Director of People. We are confident that we 
now have the right senior management team 
to successfully manage and grow the business.
Our focus during the year has been to fill 
existing capacity, increase fee levels from 
higher acuity services and reduce the cost 
base to increase margins. Good progress has 
been made on increasing average fee levels 
and average occupancy levels have been 
maintained whilst re-positioning services.

Board changes
We were delighted to welcome Anoop Kang 
who joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer 
on 12 July 2017. Anoop’s most recent role was 
as Group Financial Controller at Kier Group plc, 
having previously held senior positions in the 
construction industry . Martin Hopcroft, who 
joined the Group in late 2015, stepped down 
as Chief Financial Officer on this date. We now 
have a strong triumvirate running the business 
with Saleem Asaria as CEO, Anne Marie Carrie 
as COO and Anoop Kang as CFO.
At the conclusion of the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 5 June 2017, both Alison 
Halsey , Chair of the Audit Committee, and 
Chris Brinsmead, Senior Independent Director 
and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
stepped down from the Board.
At the same date, Dr. Graham Rich became 
Senior Independent Director in addition to his 
role as Chair of the Quality and Safeguarding 
Committee. Mike Butterworth took over as 
Chair of the Audit Committee on 1 January 
2017 and Donald Muir took over as Chair of  
the Remuneration Committee on 5 June 2017.
We would like to thank Martin, Alison and 
Christopher for the extremely valuable 
contribution they made to Cambian during  
a time of significant transition.
We also appointed Catherine Apthorpe as our 
new Company Secretary on 1 March 2017.
Following an independent Board review 
undertaken by The People Stuff towards the 
end of last year, we have decided to appoint 
an additional non-executive director with 
significant experience in children’s services. We 
expect to make the appointment during 2018.
Standards of care
We rightly judge ourselves on the high 
quality care and successful outcomes which 
we achieve for children placed under our 
care. Although this is not the only standard, 
80% of our services were rated “Good” or 
“Outstanding” by our regulators at year end 
(2016: 83%). One of our Key Performance 
Indicators is to increase this percentage in  
the medium term to over 85% and to have  
no facilities rated as “Inadequate”.
Dividends and dividend policy
Following the sale of the Adult Services 
business, the Board reviewed the future 
cash requirements of the business and 
decided to return an element to shareholders. 
Accordingly , on 15 September 2017, a special 
dividend of £50 million (27.1 pence per share) 
was paid to shareholders.
In addition following a review of the  
Company’s capital requirements for the  
next three years, on 30 January 2018 the 
Board declared a further special dividend  
of £15 million (8.2 pence per share).  
This was paid on 28 February 2018.
The Board intends to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy . Following the reinstatement of 
the dividend at the 2017 half year (0.14 pence 
per share paid on 31 October 2017) and the 
Board’s commitment to resume a progressive 
dividend policy , the Board is recommending  
a full year dividend, for the year ended  
31 December 2017, of 0.39 pence per share 
(2016: nil pence). Subject to shareholder 
approval, the final dividend of 0.25 pence  
per share (2016: nil pence) will be paid on  
31 July 2018 to shareholders on the register  
at the close of business on 6 July 2018.
Our people
Nothing of what we do to improve the lives 
of the children placed in our care would 
be achievable without the hard work 
and dedication of the front-line staff and 
managers throughout our organisation. We 
are, first and foremost, a care business and 
the quality of our work and outcomes has 
been, and will always be, our priority.
With the appointment of a new and highly 
experienced Director of People at the end of 
last year, we are reviewing our recruitment, 
training and induction processes to ensure 
that we offer rewarding and satisfying 
career prospects to all members of our 
staff, thus ensuring a stable, skilled and 
contented workforce.
Future strategy
Our aim is to be the highest quality provider 
of specialist education and behavioural 
health services for children. We are 
concentrating on those areas that have 
a high severity of need, covering the full 
range of services from residential care 
and education to day education and 
therapeutic fostering. Our focus is on those 
with autism, learning difficulties, emotional 
and social difficulties, mental health 
needs, and those suffering as a result of 
sexual abuse or exploitation. We estimate 
our target market to be 88,000 children. 
We intend to achieve this by building the 
industry’s best leadership and workforce, 
installing robust processes and systems, 
improving quality levels and occupancy, and 
driving capacity led but measured growth.
