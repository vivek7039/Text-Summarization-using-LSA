 Chairman’s Statement
Good progress was made 
over the past year to further 
improve the operational and 
financial performance of 
the Company, as well as the 
quality of customer services 
we provide. 
Enhancing customer service
In 2016/17, we met or exceeded 24 of our 26 Performance 
Commitments – the priorities we agreed with our customers, 
stakeholders and regulators at the last Price Review. For 
example, we met our annual leakage reduction target, 
reduced the number of serious pollution incidents and 
continued to deliver excellent quality drinking water.
We achieved our highest ever score in the water industry’s 
comparative assessment for customer service, Ofwat’s Service 
Incentive Mechanism (SIM). We were also recognised as a 
leader in service by being ranked second of all the utilities in 
the renowned, cross-sector, UK Customer Service Index.
Also pleasing was the fact that we achieved the maximum five 
star rating in Business in The Community’s annual Corporate 
Responsibility Index, which externally benchmarks responsible 
business practices amongst companies across the UK.
This solid performance was delivered against the backdrop of 
transformational change as we separated Yorkshire Water into 
retail and wholesale entities to make the successful transition 
to the new non-household retail market on 1 April 2017. 
Both Yorkshire Water and our new retail arm, Yorkshire Water 
Business Services, are performing well in the new 
market place. 
Investing for the future
Excellent progress was made over the past 12 months to 
recover those assets damaged by the floods of late 2015. 
We remain on course to deliver the customer and 
environmental benefits of our £3.8 billion investment 
programme in the period 2015 to 2020.
I welcomed Board approval of significant new investment 
in the Company’s sludge treatment capabilities, with major 
new anaerobic digestion facilities to be built at two of 
the Company’s key sites in Leeds and Huddersfield. This 
will ensure the more effective, efficient and sustainable 
management of sludge in the Yorkshire region for decades to 
come, as well as making us more self-sufficient in renewable 
energy generation.
Improving health and safety
We have continued to further improve health, safety and 
wellbeing across the Company, its contractor base and supply 
chain. During 2016/17, a new Director of Health and Safety 
was appointed and a new safety improvement strategy 
approved by the Board. Working closely with Trade Unions, 
ten new Life-Saving Rules were established and a range of 
initiatives undertaken to further understand and address the 
Company’s key operational and process safety risks.
Looking ahead
In the coming months, the Board will play a significant role in 
the development of the Company’s new business plan for the 
period 2020 to 2025, and beyond. As part of the Company’s 
approach to the five-yearly regulatory Price Review in 2019, 
the Board will be challenging the business to be innovative in 
delivery, and give certainty to delivering the service benefits 
our customers say they want.
The Board has also seen changes in our independent 
non-executive director representation. We welcomed Teresa 
Robson-Capps and Julia Unwin to the Board and offered our 
sincere thanks to Martin Havenhand, who retired after nine 
years of service to the Company. We have also appointed  
Ray O’Toole as senior independent director, filling the vacancy 
I left after becoming Chairman.
Over the next 18 months, we look forward to involving 
customers, stakeholders and regulators in the development 
of our next Price Review business plan with a view to further 
transforming the region’s future relationship with water and 
the environment.
