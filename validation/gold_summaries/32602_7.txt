Directors’ Remuneration policy (applied in 2016/17)
The Remuneration Policy and strategy is designed to stimulate sustainable, value creating growth and performance for the 
business and rewards Executives’ performance accordingly. 
The Company’s core principles of remuneration are to support:
• sustainable long-term value creation;
• profitable growth and strong cash generation; and
• attraction, retention and motivation of a talented leadership cadre to deliver the business strategy.
The Committee will review annually the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and the Executive Team drawing 
on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Group and taking into consideration:
• our business strategy;
• overall corporate performance;
• market conditions affecting the Company;
• the recruitment market where Saga competes for talent;
• our broader remuneration practices within the Company; and
• changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.

The Remuneration Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with 
companies of a similar size to Saga in the FTSE 250.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Remuneration Committee considers:
• remuneration practices within the Group;
• the general performance of the Group;
• salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used for remuneration 
benchmarking; and
• the economic environment.
In general, salary rises to Executive Directors will be in line with the rise to employees.
The Executive Directors receive family private health cover, death in service life assurance,  
a car allowance and subsistence expenses. They also receive employee discounts in line with  
other employees.
The maximum contribution to an Executive Director’s pension or salary supplement is 20% of 
gross basic salary.
