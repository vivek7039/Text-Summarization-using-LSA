 The year ended 30 April 2017 was a signiﬁcant year for the 
Group. On 7 September 2016 the Company and Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise (“HPE”), announced that they had agreed 
that Micro Focus would acquire HPE’s software business 
segment (“HPE Software”) by way of merger (“Merger”) with 
a wholly owned subsidiary of HPE incorporated to hold the 
business of HPE Software. This major transaction is on track 
to close at the beginning of September this year with the 
listing of consideration shares on the London Stock Exchange 
(“LSE”) and the simultaneous listing of American Depositary 
Shares (“ADS”) on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) 
(“Completion”). Micro Focus existing shareholders will also 
be entitled to receive a Return of Value which in total will be 
$500m that will be declared immediately prior to Completion.
This will create a global infrastructure software business with pro-forma 
revenues in the 12 months to 30 April 2017 of approximately $4.4 billion and 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion making it one of the 
largest dedicated software companies in the world and a leading technology 
stock on the LSE. Following Completion we will align our ﬁnancial year end 
to 31 October and will initially report an 18 month ﬁnancial period ending 
31 October 2018. This will enable us to launch the new Company’s ﬁnancial 
year with effect from 1 November 2017. 
During the year ended 30 April 2017 the Micro Focus business traded in line 
with the expectations we had set at the beginning of the year. This was 
achieved during a year of signiﬁcant change and distraction as we;
 – Completed the acquisition of Serena Software Inc. (“Serena”) together 
with three other smaller acquisitions; 
 – Integrated Serena into the Micro Focus Product Portfolio; 
 – Entered the FTSE 100 on 6 September 2016;
 – Became the spin/merge partner for HPE Software;
 – Began to work on the plan for integrating HPE Software;
 – Completed required regulatory ﬁlings in the UK, USA and elsewhere; 
 – Reﬁnanced the Company’s existing debt; and
 – Raised new banking facilities to enable the Completion of the HPE 
Software transaction and the Return of Value.
We have believed for some time that there are signiﬁcant segments of the 
infrastructure software market that have matured. The response to this is 
consolidation. To be successful in this stage of a market both operational 
effectiveness and scale are critical. We believe that Micro Focus is now 
well positioned to lead in this space.
There is a clear customer requirement for a company that can innovate and 
extend the life of mature software assets.
Like the Attachmate Group (“TAG”) and Serena acquisitions, the combination 
with HPE Software has clear business logic to extend Micro Focus’ market 
presence in mature infrastructure software segments; to increase the 
operational efﬁciency of the combined Group; to deliver effective product 
management focused on customer centred innovation and improve sales 
productivity. It is 100% consistent with the Company’s strategy which, as you 
will see in the following pages, has not had any signiﬁcant changes from the 
plan laid out ﬁve and a half years ago. Micro Focus sets out to deliver 
consistent long-term shareholder returns of between 15% and 20% per 
annum. The board is conﬁdent that medium-term low single digit revenue 
growth, industry leading margins and strong cash conversion will ensure that 
Micro Focus can deliver on that strategy. These returns can be further enhanced 
by the appropriate deployment of capital in value enhancing acquisitions.
The Company has a business strategy, a ﬁnancial strategy, an operating plan 
and an incentive strategy that all support our objective to achieve 15% to 20% 
compound annual return for shareholders. Since IPO in 2005 until 30 April 2017, 
the annual compound shareholder return over 12 years has been 29.3%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share have grown from 14.23 cents in 2006 to 
175.65 cents in 2017 and dividends per share have grown from 6 cents to 
88.06 cents with respective compound annual growth rates of 25.7% and 
27.7% respectively.
When we announced the acquisition of TAG on 15 September 2014 we set 
out the four phase plan on page 4 for the combination of the businesses whilst 
continuing to deliver sustainable shareholder returns. 
The only changes to this original plan which are reﬂected in the table on 
page 4 are that our detailed review concluded that the integration of systems 
supporting the new business will extend throughout the four year period 
and the rationalization of legal entities will extend through FY17 and beyond. 
This has now been superseded by the plan to adopt new systems being 
implemented in HPE Software. This software stack will give us one of the 
most up to date system stacks in the industry and serve as a scale platform 
for further Mergers and Acquisition (“M&A”) integration.
We have set out a new four phase plan on page 4 for the combination of 
the Micro Focus and HPE Software businesses whilst continuing to deliver 
sustainable shareholder returns.
The acquisition of HPE Software may delay the return to revenue growth as we 
consolidate the HPE Software products. As with prior transactions we expect 
HPE Software’s revenue trend to continue its historical decline until signiﬁcant 
change has been implemented. This integration will be delivered by the four 
year plan that will consolidate and strengthen the combined business, with the 
goal of delivering modest revenue growth in the medium-term as well as 
underpinning our margin improvement objectives.
We are building a strong platform with the addition of HPE Software. 
Once we achieve our target cash conversion ratio for the Enlarged Group of 
90% to 95% we will generate signiﬁcant free cash ﬂows from which we can 
deliver signiﬁcant returns of value to our shareholders and/or further highly 
accretive acquisitions.
Following our integration review in 2015 we decided that the Group should 
operate two product portfolios, Micro Focus and SUSE, and have reported the 
business this way since 1 May 2015. 
Since April 201 1, I have held the roles of both Chairman and Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer (“CEO”). In December 2015 we announced that effective from 
1 February 2016, I would be Executive Chairman and that Stephen Murdoch 
and Nils Brauckmann would become CEO of Micro Focus and CEO of SUSE 
respectively. Stephen and Nils discuss the operating performance of their 
respective portfolios for the year completed in the CEO reports.

Executive Chairman’s statement 
continued Our Business Model – strong and established 
technology franchises
As the Linux market and Open Source business have unique characteristics, 
we have a dedicated focus on the SUSE Product Portfolio. This focus is 
essential if we are to capitalize on the growth potential of these offerings and 
be responsive to the Open Source community and strong heritage of SUSE. 
In 2017 we continued to increase the headcount dedicated to development, 
customer care and sales and marketing of the SUSE Portfolio and made the 
ﬁrst acquisitions in this product portfolio. This investment has delivered 
revenue growth ahead of the market and so we will be further increasing 
this investment in 2018.
Micro Focus specializes in managing mature infrastructure software assets 
which have been delivering value to signiﬁcant numbers of customers over 
long periods of time. Our product portfolios have some or all of the 
following attributes:
1. Broad based – covering all industrial sectors
2. Signiﬁcant numbers of customers
3. Signiﬁcant maintenance streams
4. Relatively high switching costs
5. Signiﬁcant market positions
In any IT system the customers’ business logic and data remain critical to their 
competitive advantage. The key is unlocking this competitive advantage 
through exploitation of the latest technology innovation such as “OpenStack”, 
“Software-deﬁned Distributed Storage”, “mobility”, “big data”, “virtualization” and 
“cloud”. All of this needs to be done with the appropriate security to ensure 
customer data, company data and intellectual property are protected at all 
times. Typically customers would be forced into costly, disruptive and risky 
change to make this possible but with Micro Focus, customers can take a 
different approach that we characterize as bridging the old and the new. 
We focus on Customer Centred Innovation that enables customers to exploit 
new technologies without undue disruption.
By enabling our customers to link their investments in established technology 
with the latest innovation, Micro Focus helps customers gain incremental 
returns on investments they have already made and to preserve and protect 
their data and business logic. The most striking example of this is that an 
application written in Micro Focus COBOL 40 years ago – before anyone had 
thought of Linux, Windows, virtualization, cloud or wireless communications – 
will work today in all of those environments. Micro Focus has made this a 
reality. By contrast, if a COBOL application had been rewritten in another 
language, to execute in Java or .NET the customer would have to undertake 
additional incremental re-writes and incur signiﬁcant costs every time there 
was a major technology change.
Our acquisitions broaden the range and depth of our core infrastructure 
software solutions and bring outstanding new capabilities in Linux, OpenStack 
Cloud Infrastructure and security, the combination of which enables us to 
further extend the philosophy of “bridging the old and the new” across much 
more of our customer’s I.T. “footprint”.

The typical stages of a product life cycle are from new product introduction through to high growth to broad adoption and maturity, to decline and 
ultimately obsolescence.
When considering investment priorities, both organic and inorganic, we evaluate our options against a set of characteristics mapped to each stage of this 
adoption cycle enabling the categorization of our product portfolio into one of the four quadrants represented in the chart (FOUR-BOX MODEL).

Products or consumption models (cloud and subscription) that open new 
opportunities could become growth drivers or represent emerging use 
cases that we need to be able to embrace.
Growth Drivers
Products with consistent growth performance and market opportunity 
to build the future revenue foundations of the Group.
Optimize
Products with declining revenue performance driven by the market or 
execution where the trajectory must be corrected to move back to the 
core category or investments focused to optimize long-term returns.

Product Lifecycle
Introduction Growth Maturity
Micro Focus area of primary focus –  
Customer Focused Innovation
Decline
Nature of software
 – Innovative and often disruptive technologies
 – High capex and R&D
 – User base rapidly expanding products repeatedly enhanced
Investment strategy and valuation
 – Investing in growth = valuation and returns
 – Rich valuations
Micro Focus is a software company focusing on operational efﬁciency and scale  
to lead consolidation in the mature infrastructure software market
Nature of software
 – Infrastructure software: embedded products with high switching costs
 – Limited growth capex
 – Margin expansion and efﬁciency opportunities
Investment strategy and valuation
 – Returns driven by maximising cash ﬂow
 – Lower valuations Our approach to each category is summarized below:
 – New Models: here our focus is on identifying new innovation in the 
marketplace that is applicable to our core and growth driver propositions. 
This is the case where new innovation is needed to connect or leverage 
existing IT or application assets to deliver returns or open new opportunities. 
An example of this is Silk Performer Cloudburst, a cloud based 
implementation of our highly successful on premise Silk Performer product. 
This combination enables customers to execute a hybrid on premise/cloud 
solution ensuring day-to-day operations are handled effectively on premise 
but offering broadly unlimited additional capacity as and when needed to 
support business operational peaks, underpinned by the ﬂexibility and ease 
of use of a common solution in both cases. In SUSE our investments in 
OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure and Software-deﬁned Distributed Storage 
are also clear examples. 
 – Growth Drivers and Core: this represents the majority of our revenue 
and investment focus. We look to identify critical technologies that have 
delivered signiﬁcant value for customers and where the costs and risks 
of replacement or re-write are high and the returns from such activities 
are questionable. We determine how to enable these technologies for the 
latest IT innovations whether new operating environments such as Linux, 
OpenStack, JAVA or .NET or new use cases such as the cloud or mobile. 
For example, Visual COBOL enables customers to take COBOL applications 
forward with conﬁdence into the next phase of IT industry innovation, 
speciﬁcally cloud and mobile, whilst protecting their investments in 
business logic and data built up through prior investments. Security is a 
major focus area for customers as they seek to balance being open and 
accessible to their customers with the need to protect conﬁdential data 
and intellectual property. Through our suite of identity, access and security 
solutions we offer industry leading capabilities to help customers ﬁnd this 
balance. These capabilities span multiple portfolios and signiﬁcant 
opportunities for leverage and cross portfolio synergies exist.
 – Optimize: as the I.T. landscape shifts in response to new opportunities 
or challenges some technologies require repositioning or to be re-focused 
to identify and exploit remaining or new growth potential. This requires 
much more granular analysis and targeted investment. Our model forces 
this discipline. Inevitably, some technologies eventually approach end of life 
as some customers replace them with new solutions. For the remaining 
customers they still represent signiﬁcant value. Our approach is to continue 
to offer ﬂexible commercial and support models to enable customer access 
to the intellectual property and capabilities of these technologies for 
extended periods, again ensuring protection of customer investment for 
as long as possible technically and commercially.
Within this overall portfolio we have some products that are growing 
signiﬁcantly and others that are stable or in decline. Our business model 
means the way we manage the portfolio is analogous to a “fund of funds” with 
the objective of generating moderate growth over the medium-term, delivering 
high levels of proﬁtability and strong cash generation and cash conversion ratio 
with a balanced portfolio approach. We will continue to focus investment in 
growth and core products and will not dispose of declining products unless 
we can achieve greater than the discounted cash ﬂow they would generate 
in our ownership.
In addition to strengthening and developing our strong franchises across 
the product portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to help customers solve key 
challenges as they seek to be more effective, more competitive and more 
efﬁcient. Decades of technology innovation has opened up tremendous 
opportunities for companies in almost every market but typically this has 
resulted in very complex IT environments. Most organizations operate 
infrastructure and applications which have emerged over time, often years 
apart, such that core legacy platforms sit alongside distributed systems, 
which more recently have been extended further again with web, cloud 
and mobile technologies. 
This is set to continue as today’s business environment is characterized by 
unprecedented levels of change. Companies need to embrace this change 
in a way that protects their most prized assets – their intellectual property; 
their business logic; and their business data.
Our core objective is to deliver consistent shareholder 
returns of 15% to 20% over the long-term
The underlying premise behind Micro Focus’ business strategy is that the 
Company should consistently and over the long-term deliver shareholder 
returns of at least 15% to 20% per annum. To deliver this objective the 
Company has adopted an operational and ﬁnancial strategy underpinned 
by consistent and effective management and reward systems. This strategy 
is capable of execution over the long-term.
The Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange on 12 May 2005 at 
a price of 130 pence and in the year ended 30 April 2006 Diluted Adjusted 
EPS was 14.23 cents and total dividends for the year of 6 cents per share was 
declared. In the year ended 30 April 2017 Diluted Adjusted EPS is 175.65 cents 
and the proposed full year dividend is 88.06 cents representing a compound 
annual growth rate of 25.7% and 27.7% respectively. 
Dividends paid on our shares since the IPO to 30 April 2017 have totaled 
228.64 pence (350.21 cents) and in addition since January 2012 we have 
made four Returns of Value totaling 215 pence per share. On 30 April 2017 
our share price had increased to 2,588 pence. A shareholder who invested at 
the time of the IPO and had reinvested the Returns of Value would have grown 
their investment by 2,167% which is a compound annual return of 29.3%. 
In addition the Company has announced that there will be a Return of Value 
of $500m payable to existing Micro Focus shareholders on the register 
immediately before closing the HPE Software transaction.
On 28 March 201 1, on the back of two proﬁt warnings and poor performance 
in the year ended 30 April 201 1, the Company announced a share buy-back 
programme. The closing share price on 25 March 201 1, the day before the 
announcement, was 308.6 pence and the dividends received since IPO at that 
time were 43.56 pence. The annual rate of return for the shareholder from IPO 
to 25 March 201 1 was 18.5% per annum. The Company’s market capitalization 
on that date was £635.0m and by 30 April 2017 this had increased to £5,944.0m. 
The Company made cash returns to shareholders during this period of 
£764.9m, consisting of share buy-backs of £65.0m, ordinary dividends of 
£360.3m and Returns of Value of £339.6m. These cash returns represent 
120.5% of the market capitalization of the Company on 25 March 201 1 and 
the annual compound return for shareholders from that date to 30 April 2017 
is 29.3% per annum.
Micro Focus intends to remain a high growth company in terms of returns 
to shareholders.

07 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our performance in the year
Micro Focus Group delivered revenues and Underlying Adjusted EBITDA 
of $1,380.7m and $640.9m respectively (2016: $1,245.0m and $532.5m). 
On a pro-forma constant currency (“pro-forma CCY”) basis the revenue 
reduced by 0.9% which is just above the mid-point of the guidance range 
given at the beginning of the year and re-conﬁrmed at the interims. 
Our net debt at 30 April 2017 was $1,410.6m and represents a multiple of 
2.1 times Facility EBITDA of $673.4m, against our target of 2.5 times. 
We would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication, 
commitment and hard work in delivering the full year results. 
For the year ended 30 April 2017 bonuses will be paid to executive 
management and non-commissioned staff in Micro Focus in line with the 
improvement in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of the Group on a pro-forma CCY 
basis excluding the impact of in year acquisitions. Staff bonuses will be paid at 
45.0% of their on target amount reﬂecting a 4.5% increase in Underlying 
Adjusted EBITDA of Micro Focus on a CCY basis excluding the impact of 
in-year acquisitions. Executive Management received the same percentage.
Non-commissioned staff fully aligned with SUSE, were targeted 50% on 
improvement in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of the Group on a CCY basis 
excluding the impact of in year acquisitions and 50% on delivery of Annual 
Contract Value (“ACV”) growth targets in SUSE. Their bonus payment is 
75.5% of their on target amount, reﬂecting stronger than targeted 
achievement in the ACV component. 
The amount charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
in respect of the Corporate Bonus plan in the actual results for the year ended 
30 April 2017 was $20.8m (2016: $45.6m). 
Operational strategy to deliver our core objective
Operational excellence
Micro Focus has set out to be the most effective company at managing a 
portfolio of mature infrastructure software assets. This shows in our industry 
leading EBITDA margins and our strong cash conversion. We believe that our 
proven ability to execute not only delivers signiﬁcant amounts of cash and 
consequently great ﬂexibility, but also a competitive advantage in the 
acquisition of other similar assets as demonstrated this year.
The aims of our portfolio focus and operational strategy are:
1. Revenue growth;
2. Operating leverage; and
3. Signiﬁcant cash generation.
Our key areas of operational focus in order to deliver single digit revenue 
growth to achieve our core objective are Financial Discipline in M&A, 
Go-to-Market (“GTM”) (including indirect channels) and Product Development.

Executive Chairman’s statement 
continued Financial discipline, mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”)
Micro Focus has a strong ﬁnancial discipline around the uses of cash. The 
Company has a base case model that estimates the returns to shareholders 
from organic execution and the return of excess cash. This gives a sound basis 
on which to evaluate M&A where any acquisition contemplated would need 
to generate a risk adjusted return greater than the base case. Successful 
execution of M&A has been instrumental in achieving an annual compound 
total shareholder return of 29.3% since IPO compared to a base case target 
of 15% to 20%. The TAG and Serena acquisitions demonstrate this strong 
discipline and the returns that are achievable.
Industry and market dynamics mean that there are signiﬁcant numbers of 
potential assets that could ﬁt with our business model. These are either:
1. Bolt-on transactions like those completed in FY13, FY14, FY16 and FY17;
2. Signiﬁcant transactions such as Serena in FY17; or 
3.  Transformational deals such as the acquisition of TAG in FY15 and 
HPE Software. 
Each year the world of IT gets another year older (and we should remember 
that IT is still a relatively young industry). Whilst the vast majority of companies 
will choose to focus on the “new and exciting”; we believe that there will be an 
increasing opportunity to help clients derive value from their existing and often 
highly complex IT investments. 
Since the Completion of the TAG acquisition, the Company continues to 
receive signiﬁcant numbers of approaches from owners of companies who 
would be interested in becoming part of the larger Group. 
GTM and Product Development are covered in the CEO reports.
Linkage of management incentive to 
shareholder returns
Micro Focus has deployed a simple model to link management incentives 
to the delivery of shareholder returns. This model has worked successfully 
in motivating management to deliver exceptional returns to shareholders and 
is well understood and supported by our investment manager population. 
The annual cash bonus applies to all members of staff in Micro Focus 
(excluding those on sales incentives). If the Group’s Underlying Adjusted 
EBITDA is no greater than the prior year’s CCY comparative at budgeted 
exchange rates there is no bonus. The bonus for executive directors and 
operating committee members is maximized on achieving 10% growth over 
the prior year CCY Underlying Adjusted EBITDA with a straight line between 
the two points and for other staff there is no maximum. The staff neither 
beneﬁts nor loses from elements outside of their control such as exchange 
rates with the board taking a view that these items balance out over the 
business cycle. In year acquisitions are not included for bonus purposes. 
The board sees no value in bonuses being based on “soft” or non-ﬁnancial 
measures as evidence would suggest that these tend to serve to increase 
bonuses to levels not merited by ﬁnancial performance. Such targets are best 
achieved by executives managing and having appropriate management and 
control systems in place.
The normal stock plan starts to vest at EPS annual growth over the 
performance period of RPI plus 3%, with maximum vesting at RPI plus 9%. 
With RPI per annum over the three years to 30 April 2017 of approximately 
1.9% full vesting required 10.9% growth in EPS and dividend yield of 
approximately 3% this means that full vesting is aligned to lower end of 
the overall objective of 15% to 20% shareholder returns.
At the time of the TAG acquisition shareholder approval was obtained for an 
Additional Share Grant (“ASG”) of up to 5,412,240 ordinary shares, representing 
a maximum of 2.5% of the enlarged Group’s share capital at announcement 
which could be awarded to up to 15 senior managers in the 18 months 
following Completion. The performance period expires on 1 November 2017 
and vesting is dependent upon shareholder return of between 50% and 100% 
over the performance period, with straight-line vesting of the ASG between 
50% and 100% of shareholder return. 
As at 30 April 2017 ASGs are outstanding over only 3,262,420 ordinary 
shares granted to seven senior managers representing 1.4% of the voting 
rights of the Company at 30 April 2017. As it is more than 18 months since the 
Completion of the acquisition, no further ASGs relating to TAG will be made. 
This means that if, at the date of vesting, the share price is a minimum of 
1,490.27 pence per share or more, then 100% of the shares granted would 
become exercisable. This is based on the current dividend per share of 
148.58 pence for the relevant period. 
The ASG was essential to the delivery of value and has proven to be a very 
effective incentive from a shareholder perspective. Shareholders voted to 
repeat this scheme for the HPE Software transaction which received 99.98% 
support at the general meeting on 26 May 2017. If successfully executed, the 
plan will deliver approximately an increase in shareholders’ investment of 
£7.9 billion including ordinary dividends for full vesting of the ASG from the 
base price of 1,817 pence per share. 
As we look to the consolidation of the market the Company will be at a 
disadvantage to US listed companies and private equity ﬁrms when negotiating 
acquisitions if it is not free to negotiate appropriate management compensation.
Key performance indicators to check that we are on track are Underlying 
Adjusted EBITDA (absolute amount and growth percentage), cash conversion 
(absolute amount and conversion percentage), free cash ﬂow and earnings 
per share.
Delivering value to shareholders
The board has adopted a very clear plan of value creation.
Our priority is to improve the performance of the business in order to maximize 
the opportunity to generate modest revenue growth in the medium-term. At the 
same time we have created ﬂexibility to allow value creation to shareholders 
through cash distributions or acquisitions as appropriate. We deliver value to 
our customers through customer centred innovation. We will do nothing that 
will constrain our ability to achieve organic growth and we are currently 
investing signiﬁcant amounts on activities designed to enhance growth.
The TAG and HPE Software transactions are transformational in terms of 
the size of the Group from an operating point of view. It involves the type of 
transformation that many companies would have said that they needed to 
go private to achieve out of the public eye. The board and management of 
Micro Focus believe that it is quite possible to do this on the public market 
and deliver the resulting increase in value to existing shareholders.
The HPE Software transaction was also transformational in terms of market 
capitalization. The day before the announcement of the transaction Micro Focus 
had a market capitalization of £4,480.7m which had increased to £5,944.0m 
by 30 April 2017. This increased scale drew the attention of a new set of public 
company institutional investors and also meant that some existing institutional 
investors would be unable to hold their investments as we had become too big. 
We will also list in the USA, through an ADS, which further expands 
Micro Focus relevant investor base.

09 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Working with our brokers, Numis Securities, we set about establishing a 
signiﬁcant increase in our investor relations and outreach to the HPE 
shareholder base. Following this activity approximately 30% of the Company’s 
shares are now held in North America.
The board continues to target a net debt to Facility EBITDA multiple of 
approximately 2.5 times. This is a modest level of gearing for a company with 
the cash generating qualities of Micro Focus. We are conﬁdent that this level 
of debt will not reduce our ability to deliver growth, invest in products and/or 
make appropriate acquisitions. As the integration of the businesses continues 
the board will keep the appropriate level of debt under review.
In order to complete the acquisition of HPE Software the Company has 
extended its revolving credit facility from $375.0m to $500.0m, reﬁnanced its 
term loan debt of $1,515.2m with an improved repayment proﬁle and raised 
new term loan debt of $3,485m to complete the transaction and make the 
Return of Value.
At 30 April 2017 we had net debt of $1,410.6m representing a net debt to 
Facility EBITDA of 2.1 times. On closing of the HPE Software transaction net 
debt will be approximately $4.6 billion representing approximately 3.3 times net 
debt to pro-forma Facility EBITDA for the 12 months ended 30 April 2017.
The board has adopted a dividend policy of being two times covered by the 
adjusted earnings of the Group. This policy has delivered a proposed second 
interim dividend of 58.33 cents (2016: 49.74 cents per share), which represents 
a 17.3% increase on last year’s ﬁnal dividend and gives a total proposed 
dividend for the year of 88.06 cents per share (2016: 66.68 cents), an 
increase of 32.1%.
The dividend will be paid in Sterling equivalent to 45.22 pence per share, 
based on an exchange rate of £1 = $1.29, the rate applicable on 1 1 July 2017, 
the date on which the board resolved to pay the dividend. The dividend will be 
paid on 25 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at 4 August 2017.
Board changes and succession planning
At the Completion of the HPE Software transaction the board has announced 
that Chris Hsu will become CEO and Stephen Murdoch will become Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer (“COO”). Nils Brauckmann will continue as CEO of SUSE. 
To ensure delivery of the integration the board has agreed that I will remain 
Executive Chairman until the announcement of the ﬁrst full year results after 
Completion. This is currently expected to be January 2019.
During the year there were a number of other board changes which arose due to 
the conditions of the agreement to acquire HPE Software (”Merger Agreement”).
Effective 15 May 2017, Silke Scheiber and Darren Roos joined the board 
as two of the three independent Non-Executive Directors nominated by HPE 
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Upon Completion, John Schultz, the 
Executive Vice President and General Counsel of HPE, will join the board 
as the Non-Executive Director nominated by HPE. The board has determined 
that Mr Schultz will not be independent. In addition, Chris Hsu, who will 
become CEO of Micro Focus upon Completion, will join the board at that time. 
An additional independent Non-Executive Director nominated by HPE and 
to be approved by the Micro Focus Nomination Committee, is expected to 
be appointed after Completion. 
Steve Schuckenbrock and Tom Virden both resigned as Directors of 
Micro Focus, effective 25 April 2017, to ensure that the composition of the 
board remained in line with the UK corporate governance code and met the 
requirements of the Merger Agreement. We would like to thank Steve and 
Tom for their signiﬁcant contributions to Micro Focus.
Stephen Murdoch remains CEO of Micro Focus until Completion and will 
then become COO and simultaneously step down from the board. Stephen 
will remain a key member of the management team going forward and was 
instrumental in operationalizing our FOUR-BOX MODEL during the integration 
of TAG. We would like to thank him for his contributions as a board member 
and his continued commitment to Micro Focus as COO.
We welcome the new members of our board and biographical details of all 
board members are available on pages 52 and 53.
Outlook
Following completion of the acquisition of HPE Software, the Group intends to 
align its ﬁnancial year end to 31 October and will report an 18 month ﬁnancial 
period ending 31 October 2018. Assuming the transaction remains on schedule, 
the ﬁrst six months will comprise six months of the current Micro Focus business 
and two months of the HPE Software business. There will then be a full 
12 months trading of both businesses.
We anticipate revenues for the current Micro Focus Group business for the 
six months to 31 October 2017 will be broadly ﬂat on the comparative period. 
In anticipation of the impending integration of the Micro Focus and HPE 
Software businesses in November we have put on hold any operational 
changes in the existing Micro Focus business. We will provide guidance for the 
combined 12 month period to 31 October 2018 when we report in January 
2018 on the Group’s performance in the six months ending 31 October 2017.
Having delivered 12 years of approximately 29.3% compound annual returns 
to investors we believe we have a strong operational and ﬁnancial model that 
can continue to scale and provide excellent returns to our shareholders.
