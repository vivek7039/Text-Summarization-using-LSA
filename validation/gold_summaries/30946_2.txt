As a result of rising premiums across the 
market, more customers are shopping around 
and switching provider. Many customers who 
switch insurance providers are doing so via price 
comparison websites (PCW), leading to an increase 
in penetration of motor new business via PCW of 2% 
in 2017 to 70%. 
Retail is also benefitting from the continued 
growth in its share of new business sales via PCW, 
combined with a profitable maturing renewal book 
and retention rates which remain strong and above 
the market average of circa 70%.

Strategy
We have a straightforward approach; 
to provide our UK car, van, bike and 
home insurance customers with great 
service and straightforward products 
at competitive prices, however they 
choose to interact with us.
Business model
Our business model has been designed 
to be successful in the dynamic 
digital distribution segment of the UK 
insurance market, and it is underpinned 
by sophisticated IT systems, which 
are driving our strong track record of 
sustainable growth. 
The Group operates across the insurance 
value chain with clear separation to 
ensure the Underwriting business 
focuses on pricing the risk whilst the 
Retail business maximises customer 
conversion and value, without impacting 
Underwriting profi tability.
Pricing capabilities are at the heart 
of the Retail business model, with a 
team of highly specialised decision 
scientists who are empowered to drive 
sophisticated pricing structures and 
assess overall customer lifetime value. 
Underwriting has a disciplined approach 
with expertise in risk selection, which 
combined with award winning counter 
fraud capabilities enables sustainable 
and profi table growth, delivering a 
strong loss ratio at or below our target 
range of 75-79%.
Delivering value and effi  ciencies
Digital interaction is expected to 
continue to grow for the foreseeable 
future, partly due to increased use of 
mobile technology. Our digital business 
model, new Guidewire platform and 
agile approach enable us to identify 
such opportunities, outperform and 
deliver value for our shareholders. 
Guidewire is a market leading software 
that supports claims, broking and billing 
in an integrated platform. We have 
also invested in additional software 
components to increase the ability of our 
customers to self-serve through digital 
engagement. Improvements for our 
customers and our colleagues include 
more effi  cient processes through activity 
management, more informed pricing, 
and enhancing our customer services by 
providing customers with a 24/7 online 
self-service portal.
We have realised signifi cant benefi ts 
following the launch of the Guidewire 
claims module, and continue to improve 
and enhance the system based on 
colleague feedback and customer 
experience. We are following a staged 
roll out of the broker platform and by 
the end of 2017 we had all major price 
comparison websites live on Guidewire 
for private car insurance. In addition, 
we have now commenced transferring 
private car insurance renewals to 
Guidewire.
