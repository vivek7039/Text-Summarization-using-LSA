 Looking to the future with 
a stronger base
Chairman’s statement
As Chairman of Stock Spirits Group PLC, I am pleased to present our 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017.
After a year of great change in 2016, the Group 
entered 2017 with a significantly strengthened and 
experienced Board and Executive team who have a 
strong commitment to turning round the fortunes 
of the business. 2017 was a year of stabilisation for 
Stock Spirits, embedding the significant changes 
accomplished in 2016 whilst continuing to address 
the competitive challenges that remain in our 
markets, particularly that of our largest market, 
Poland. We believe we have stabilised in this market 
and the local management team continues to drive 
through change and improvements.
While the Board’s major focus remained on 
returning our Polish business to growth, we also 
considered the Group’s future wider priorities. 
A comprehensive review of the Group’s strategy 
was carried out in the latter half of the year. The 
chief conclusion from this process was that our 
strategy as outlined at the time of the IPO remains 
as relevant as ever. However, to achieve our goals 
we need to respond better to developments and 
changes in our key markets; to execute those 
plans more effectively and to focus more on the 
ultimate consumers of our products, rather than 
just on internal KPIs. The major focus of our 
updated strategy, therefore, is to concentrate on 
our largest value drivers, our brands. Mirek will 
cover the detail of our conclusions and plans more 
thoroughly in his Chief Executive’s Report.
Given our operational progress we are better able 
to return to the other key element of our IPO 
strategy which is growth through mergers and 
acquisitions (M&A).
During 2017, we continued to review ‘bolt-on’ 
opportunities and we were pleased to announce our 
25% investment in premium Irish whiskey brands, 
The Dubliner and The Dublin Liberties in July this 
year. Now that Poland has been stabilised, we return 
to looking at larger, more strategic opportunities to 
deliver enhanced growth and shareholder value for 
the future. More detail about the updated strategy is 
set out on pages 16 and 17.
Dividend
I am also pleased to announce our proposed final 
dividend for the year of 5.72 €cents per share 
(2016: 5.45 €cents per share). This takes the total 
dividends paid for the year to 8.10 €cents per

Stock Spirits Group PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2017  share (2016: 19.62 €cents per share, which also 
included a special dividend of 11.90 €cents per 
share). The adjusted free cashflow conversion of 
the Company continues to be a strength and at 
86.3% (2016: 94.1%) remains robust. The dividend 
policy has been revisited and the Board is moving 
from the 35% of net free cashflow (free cashflow 
after investments) approach outlined at IPO, in 
favour of progressive dividends where cashflow 
permits. We also reiterate our commitment 
to return surplus cash to shareholders should 
no meaningful capital investment or M&A 
opportunities arise. 
People
At the time of our interim results, we announced 
that Lesley Jackson, our Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), would be retiring and would be replaced 
by Paul Bal. I would like to personally thank Lesley 
for her hard work and dedication to Stock Spirits; 
she took the Company through the IPO and has 
worked tirelessly over the years. Paul took office in 
November 2017 and has made a great start in the 
Company and I look forward to working with him 
more in the future.
Randy Pankevicz, Non-Executive Director, notified 
the Board of his resignation as a Director of the 
Company to enable him to focus on his personal 
investments. He does not intend to seek re-
election at the forthcoming AGM.
The Board would like to thank Mr Pankevicz for 
his contribution to the Company over the last two 
years and wish him well for the future.
Governance
The retirement of Lesley and the appointment of 
Paul as CFO was the only Board change in the year.
Following the more extensive changes to the Board 
in 2016, the new members have been fully engaged 
not only in the strategic review process but have 
also made significant and valuable contributions in 
all Board matters. I am pleased with the results.  
All Board Committee compositions are fully 
compliant with the Corporate Governance Code. 
See page 55 of this report for further details. 
The Board and its various Committees have met 
regularly throughout the year and an internal 
Board evaluation exercise was undertaken during 
the year (see page 58). 
Looking ahead
As I have mentioned previously, the implications of 
Brexit on the Group are not considered material at 
this stage, but we will continue to monitor progress 
on the negotiations currently taking place. 
With a stable Board, senior management team 
and award-winning brands, I am looking forward 
to delivering on our refreshed strategy to ensure 
growth and increased shareholder returns.
