 Focus
We have a deep understanding of the 
economic dynamics of healthcare real estate. 
By building on the knowledge and expertise of 
our team and engagement with our healthcare 
partners we believe we can generate superior 
Total Property Return through a strategic focus 
on a highly attractive market.
  21.2% growth in investment property to £1,344.9 million.
  1.57% rental growth from rent reviews settled in the period.
  Total Property Return of 9.7%.
  Drive development opportunities to support rental 
growth evidence.
  Investment managers to focus on asset 
enhancement opportunities.
  Continue to seek growth opportunities through 
acquisitions, and purchase and leasebacks.
  The market is becoming increasingly competitive  
but our strong brand and reputation as a long-term 
investor in the sector mean we are well placed to 
secure further attractive opportunities. 
Expertise
Our strong reputation for innovation derives 
from our bespoke designs for our medical 
centres. Our designs have an emphasis 
on flexibility and adaptability to ensure that 
the buildings can adapt to the changing 
NHS agenda.
  Delivered two newly constructed, bespoke GP-led 
medical centres.
  Engaged with senior NHS leaders and politicians  
to support transforming primary care.
  Complete developments currently on site.
  Promote benefits of investment in primary  
care infrastructure for the NHS.
  Work with emerging STPs to identify  
development opportunities. 
  Further changes to the organisational structures or 
policies of the NHS could lead to delays in further 
investment in primary care infrastructure. However, 
recent publications recommend an increasing  
role for primary care service provision. 
Sustainability
We pride ourselves on our commitment to 
the highest possible standards in sustainability, 
the personal development of our teams 
and our role in spearheading investment 
in social infrastructure.
  First zero carbon and energy neutral building on site.
  Both of the two newly constructed medical centres 
achieved “Very Good” BREEAM rating.
  Develop more zero carbon medical centres of  
the future for the NHS and continue investment  
into the highest sustainability standards for  
new developments.
  Further investment in our team’s development.
  Sustainable development and building design is an 
area of constant change and we seek to be fully up 
to date with the latest technologies and innovations. 
  Failure to recruit, develop and retain our team with 
the right skills and experience may weaken our 
ability to deliver against our strategic priorities. 
Effectiveness
We are committed to supporting the NHS 
in tackling the major underinvestment in UK 
primary care property and utilising our skills 
and capital in achieving this. We have the 
right team to source and manage these 
opportunities and the right plans to leverage 
our team’s skills to maximum advantage.
  EPRA Cost Ratio reduced to 13.7% and weighted 
average cost of debt reduced to 4.06%.
  EPRA EPS increased to 2.4 pence.
  Total Accounting Return of 12.0%.
  Seek further opportunities to expand the portfolio.
  Continue to promote the Company to a wide 
shareholder base and a diverse group of  
debt funders.
  Achieve further scale benefits.
  Maintaining cost discipline as the business expands 
will be crucial in ensuring that we continue to reduce 
our overall EPRA Cost Ratio. Included within this 
metric is the cost of vacant space and so letting 
this available space will improve this cost metric. 
  We have been successful in securing both equity 
and debt capital for supporting the expansion of  
the business although there is no certainty that 
future expansion will be supported in the same way. 
We believe the fundamentals of the business remain 
very strong and attractive to both equity and  
debt funders.
