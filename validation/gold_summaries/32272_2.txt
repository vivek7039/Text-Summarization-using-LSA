Findel plc 
Annual report and accounts 2017
Strategic Report I Chairman’s Statement
Dividends
The Board continues to focus on 
strengthening the financial position of 
each of the operating subsidiaries’ balance 
sheets and that of the parent company. 
As such, the Company does not have 
plans to reinstate dividend payments 
at this stage.
Management and Board
I joined the Board in January 2017 as 
Chairman, initially in an executive capacity 
before reverting to a more conventional 
non‑ executive capacity in April 2017. Phil 
Maudsley was appointed as CEO at that 
time, with Paul Kendrick stepping up 
to replace Phil as managing director of 
Express Gifts. Stuart Caldwell became the 
acting CFO, with Chris Mahady remaining 
as managing director of Findel Education.
David Sugden and Tim Kowalski left Findel 
in 2017 having steered the Group over 
the last seven and six years respectively. 
They joined at a time when the Group 
had a diverse composition and was over‑ indebted, but they left it well funded and 
simplified for the medium term. We wish 
them both well for the future.
Employees
I have met many of our employees since 
joining in January and have been struck 
by their enthusiasm for our businesses 
and their shared belief in modernising 
our operating models to make it easier 
and more compelling for our customers 
to shop with us. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all of our employees 
for their continued hard work.
Current trading
We have made an encouraging start to 
the year, with Express Gifts trading in 
line with expectations, although Findel 
Education has seen weaker demand in 
recent weeks than anticipated. The early 
weeks of our financial year are always 
relatively quiet trading periods for our 
businesses. A fuller update on trading will 
be given at our AGM which will be held at 
the end of August.
Outlook
The investment in growing the Express 
Gifts customer base has provided a strong 
foundation for the new financial year, 
and we expect to see the initial benefits 
coming through towards the second half 
of the year. Our plans to improve the 
profitability of Findel Education will start 
to take shape during the coming year.
The impact of higher input costs from the 
depreciation in Sterling since the Brexit 
referendum will feed its way through 
the sector in the coming months. We 
are working hard with our suppliers and 
continue to review our internal cost‑ base 
to maintain Express Gifts’ proposition 
as a leading online value retailer. The 
general level of uncertainty arising from 
recent events and the start of the Brexit 
process, inevitably, is impacting consumer 
confidence. However, any weakening in 
this confidence would be expected to 
lead to value retailers such as Express 
Gifts gaining market share. Therefore, 
we remain confident in the opportunities 
for growth in our business.
