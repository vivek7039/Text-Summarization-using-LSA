with our US commercial strategy. 
The Grass MATA MPL product 
completed the safety study relating 
to its higher dose and the Phase 
II Grass trial is due to commence 
before the end of 2017. 
Financially, the Group remains in a 
robust position with a strong cash 
balance due to strong sales growth, 
aided additionally by the weakening 
of sterling against the euro.
Board Changes
There were a number of changes 
to the Board during the year. In 
February, we welcomed US-based 
Jeff Barton who succeeded Jean-
Yves Pavée as Abbott Laboratories’ 
nominated director and, in June, 
Thomas Lander, our Board member 
with extensive R&D experience, 
retired from the Board and Tunde 
Otulana was appointed as a new 
independent Non-Executive Director. 
I thank Jean-Yves and Thomas for 
their significant contributions to 
the Board during their tenures. Jeff 
Barton, who is based at Abbott 
headquarters in Chicago and is VP 
Licensing and Acquisitions, brings 
extensive commercial experience, 
especially in the US, which will prove 
vital as the Group continues to 
execute its global strategy. Tunde 
is also based in the US and brings 
a wealth of global experience 
in clinical and regulatory work, 
particularly with the US Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA), with whom 
he worked for six years earlier in his 
career. I am delighted to welcome 
Jeff and Tunde to the Board.
Governance 
The Group endeavours to adopt 
best practice, above normal levels 
for a company of its size and sector 
across the business and it is overseen 
by an effective and knowledgeable 
Board. We are pleased that a 
regular and transparent dialogue 
is maintained with our key 
stakeholders throughout the year.
Looking ahead
Allergy Therapeutics’ strategy 
remains clear and focused and it 
is expected that the business will 
continue to grow and its portfolio 
of products expand in 2018 and 
beyond. The Group benefits from 
a committed, experienced and 
enthusiastic management team and 
the Board and I are confident that we 
shall continue our successful record 
of growth and deliver long-term 
value creation for shareholders.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all Allergy Therapeutics’ 
employees for their commitment 
and hard work during the year.

Performance
In our European business, sales 
grew by 15%* in constant currency 
and we continued to achieve 
market share gains, with our 
market share in markets where we 
operate up to 13 % (2016: 12%). 
This shows an increasing adoption 
in the market for our convenient 
and patient-friendly treatments 
compared to other products.
In addition, there has been good 
progress in the R&D pipeline this 
year, facilitated by investment from 
our growing revenue stream. In 
March, we announced that we had 
recruited the first patient in our 
pivotal Phase III PQ Birch trial and, 
in May, the first patient was recruited 
for our Acarovac MPL (house dust 
mite) study. We announced exciting 
pre-clinical data from the Polyvac 
Peanut project in February and we 
are pleased that all of the products 
that the Group has submitted for 
the German Therapieallergen-
Verordung (TAV) process are 
continuing to progress well.
We are also making progress
