 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 11
The second year of my tenure has certainly 
been more eventful than I would have wished. 
Despite some unexpected and significant 
challenges, it is a proud feeling to be able to 
state that we have delivered record profits 
during 2017, significantly up on 2016. 
STM’s acquisition of London & Colonial 
Holdings Limited (LCH) in late 2016 has 
played a key part in helping us to adapt and 
widen our product offerings to the expatriate 
market; which was a necessity following 
the UK Spring Budget that announced an 
Overseas Tax Charge of 25% on certain 
overseas pension transfers. As stated at 
the time, this was expected to affect circa 
80% of our new business volumes for our 
international pension products. 
This estimate proved correct but due to 
management’s innovation and flexibility, we 
were able to come to the market in short order 
with an alternative, UK regulated, product to 
service our international distribution network. 
This has seen most of this lost new QROPS 
business, by both policy number and revenue, 
replaced by our International SIPP offering.
With a significant amount of new business 
falling under our UK regulated entity, this in 
turn has given us a more UK centric focus, 
and has contributed to the decision to move 
our Group head office from Gibraltar to the 
UK from January 2018. 
As part of this move, it allows the Group 
Executive function to recruit from a larger 
population and will also see some additional 
appointments to our PLC Board which will 
further strengthen our depth of knowledge 
and capabilities.
Certain STM Gibraltar regulated entities have 
been working in a collaborative way with 
the GFSC on a third-party review (a Skilled 
Person Review) being carried out under 
Section 7 of the Financial Services (Information 
Gathering and Co-operation) Act 2013, on 
certain aspects of the various businesses 
(the ‘Report’). It is expected that the Report 
will be finalised by 30 April 2018 and will 
include recommendations, if appropriate. The 
Group has no appetite for risk in respect of its 
relationships and dealings with the regulators 
and we are determined that we will move 
the Group forward in line with that level of 
risk appetite. 
Overall, it is very clear that our underlying 
business continues to perform according 
to plan, demonstrating the quality and 
predictability of our recurring revenue streams 
which are key component parts of any robust 
business model.
During the last quarter of 2017, we signed 
the Sale and Purchase Agreement for the 
acquisition of Harbour Pensions Limited. 
Regulatory approval came through in February 
2018 allowing completion to occur. We are 
now in the process of integrating this business 
with that of our existing Malta business, which 
once complete, we expect to result in a further 
increase of some £0.4 million profit before tax 
per annum to the Malta operation.
On behalf of the Board and the Company, a 
special thank you goes out to Mike Riddell, 
STM’s Chairman for the past three years and 
Board Member for seven years, who is not 
putting himself forward for re-election having 
decided that it is time for him to leave his 
working life behind and enjoy more time 
with his family. His stewardship in guiding 
us through the re-invention phase of our 
recent history has been invaluable, and has 
protected and enhanced shareholder value 
for all concerned.

I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE ANNUAL RESULTS FOR 
STM GROUP PLC FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017. ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 12
OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW
PENSIONS 
Our pensions businesses have all seen significant changes to their 
modus operandi following the UK Spring Budget. 
Total revenue across our pensions businesses amounted to £10.2 
million (2016: £9.2 million) and accounted for 47% of total Group 
revenue (2016: 52%). 
As predicted since the UK Spring Budget, our Gibraltar operation 
has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS, whilst 
Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA. 
Conversely, our UK SIPP business has become the focus of new 
business growth.
To put this in context, for the nine months following the Budget, 
new business numbers were 217 ROPS (2016: 1,224) administered 
by our Malta and Gibraltar offices and 755 SIPPs (2016: 162) 
administered from our UK operations.
Malta remains the largest of our three jurisdictions with pension 
turnover of £6.1 million (2016: £6.5 million), with Gibraltar 
generating £2.6 million (2016: £2.4 million) of turnover, and finally, 
in its first full year under STM’s ownership, the UK generated 
£1.5 million of revenue (2016: £0.3 million). 
An important KPI remains the annual recurring revenue statistic 
which has been determined as the contractual element of any 
trustee fee due or any fees under the life assurance policies, which 
are billed on an annual basis. For 2017 this amounted to £9.6 
million (2016: £8.5 million) which represents 95% (2016: 93%) 
of total pension revenue, giving a highly visible and predictable 
future revenue stream. 
LIFE ASSURANCE
The acquisition of London & Colonial in late 2016, and with it 
the Gibraltar based life assurance company (LCA), has allowed 
STM to significantly grow its life assurance business.
This is seen from the 2017 combined revenue figure of £5.9 
million as compared to £2.8 million for 2016.
Pleasingly, organic growth for STM Life during the year has 
delivered a 26% uplift, to generate turnover for 2017 of £2.4 
million (2016: £1.9 million). Within this revenue figure, recurring 
revenue, annual fees and investment income amounted to £1.8 
million compared to £1.4 million in 2016. This provides a steady 
and highly visible annuity income stream.
In addition, LCA has performed as expected with its long standing 
and predictable customer base delivering a revenue of £2.2 million 
for the year, with a further release from technical reserves of 
£1.3 million (2016: £0.5 million) as a result of the reduction in 
the administrative costs per policy. 
CORPORATE AND TRUSTEE SERVICES
Turnover from the Corporate and Trustee Services (CTS) division 
for the year was £4.3 million (2016: £4.4 million) thus accounting 
for 20% of the Group’s total turnover (2016: 25%). This business is 
generated in Jersey and Gibraltar, with Jersey revenue accounting 
for circa 57% (2016: 56%) of the CTS business at £2.5 million 
(2016: £2.5 million) and Gibraltar generating turnover of £1.8 
million (2016: £1.9 million).
As noted in previous years’ reports, the CTS environment and 
sector remains challenging, and it is accepted by the Group that 
this will be a difficult segment to grow organically. 
OTHER TRADING DIVISIONS AND NEW 
INITIATIVES
Trading in other divisions, which are mainly insurance management 
and the Spanish office, was broadly in line with management 
expectations. These are expected to continue at similar levels 
going forward having generated revenue of £1.2 million in the 
year (2016: £1.1 million). 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR
Profitability has seen a step change in 2017, compared to that of 
2016, but reflects the hard work of building the infrastructure 
and business development function in previous years. 
Clearly, the integration of the LCH acquisition has enabled us 
to restructure the cost base of those businesses acquired and 
ensured that profit margins were enhanced.
Group revenue for 2017 amounted to £21.5 million (2016: £17.4 
million), and as anticipated EBITDA (Earnings before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and amortisation) has increased by 55% 
from £3.1 million in 2016 to £4.8 million in 2017. 
Reassuringly, the amount of recurring annuity revenue business 
continues to increase and still accounts for 75% of 2017 total 
revenues (2016: 75%). 
Finance costs amounted to £0.3 million (2016: £0.1 million) and 
reflects the debt financing in place for the LCH acquisition. The 
depreciation and amortisation charge has in turn increased as a 
result of amortising the client portfolio acquired with LCH and 
the investment in offices across various jurisdictions. This is £0.5 
million in 2017 (2016: £0.3 million). 
Profit before tax was £4.0 million for the year being a pleasing uplift 
of 43% above the 2016 PBT result of £2.8 million notwithstanding 
one-off costs and the technical reserve release referred to above.
TAX CHARGE AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
The tax charge for the year was £0.1 million (2016: £0.4 million).
The tax charge for the year has been impacted by the refund 
received in Malta on tax due on dividends paid to companies 
outside the Group. Whilst the corporate rate on Malta profits is 
35%, the refund is 30% on tax due on dividends.
In Malta’s infancy and growing stage, the tax charge was higher 
than the refund as profits were higher than dividends. This year, 
dividends have been in excess of profits due to the payment of 
a dividend from last year’s reserves. Hence the refund is higher 
than the charge. But this is a one-off and as profits in Malta 
become consistent year on year, the position will stabilise and 
the Group’s effective rate will remain at circa 15%. 
This significantly lower than expected tax charge together with 
the increased profitability has resulted in a healthy uplift to the 
earnings per share from 3.99p in 2016 to 6.69p in 2017. Diluted 
earnings per share takes into consideration the long term incentive

plan approved by the Company as approved by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2016 which stipulates 
a maximum dilution factor of 5% resulting in diluted EPS of 
6.37p (2016: 3.87p).
CASHFLOWS
Overall net cash balances at the year end have continued to 
increase, resulting in cash and cash equivalents of £18.4 million 
at 31 December 2017 (2016: £11.9 million). Whilst part of this 
increase is due to cash generated from operating activities of 
£4.0 million (2016: £1.4 million), part of this is also as a result of 
the sale of investments acquired as part of the LCH acquisition.
During the year the Group also made the final deferred 
consideration payment on the LCH acquisition of £0.8 million, 
having accrued £1.15 million in the previous years’ accounts. 
The Company continues to have bank borrowings of £3.3 million 
taken out in October 2016 for the purposes of the acquisition 
of LCH with repayments being quarterly over the forthcoming 
two years and as such the first repayment was in January 2018.
As with most services businesses, the Group had accrued income 
in the form of work performed for clients but not yet billed at 
the year end of £0.9 million (2016: £1.2 million). The Group 
policy for pensions is to recognise this accrued income over the 
period from when an application has been received up to the 
point when the pension funds are received, at which point the 
invoice is raised. The decrease in accrued income this year is 
predominantly as a result of the decrease in QROPS new business 
in favour of the International SIPP accrued income which is much 
quicker to convert. 
Deferred income (a liability in the statement of financial position), 
representing fees billed in advance yet to be credited to the 
statement of total comprehensive income, has remained consistent 
with the balance as at 31 December 2016 of £3.8 million. 
Both the accrued and deferred income will be invoiced and earned 
in 2018 thus providing visibility on fees for the forthcoming year.
Other large balance sheet items relate to trade and other 
receivables which stood at £5.6 million as at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £5.2 million). Of this amount, trade receivables at the year 
end stood at £3.4 million (2016: £3.4 million). 
DIVIDEND POLICY
The Group Board continues to follow its progressive dividend 
policy having re-commenced paying dividends in March 2016. In 
this regard, I am pleased to advise that the Board is recommending 
the payment of a final dividend of 1.2p per share (2016: 1.0p 
per share). This together with the interim dividend paid of 0.6p 
in November 2017 (2016: 0.5p) makes a proposed total dividend 
for the year of 1.8p per share (2016: 1.5p). 
Subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 27 June 2018 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 1 June 2018. The ordinary 
shares will become ex-dividend on 31 May 2018.
OUTLOOK 
2017 has demonstrated that STM is flexible and able to take 
advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, whilst 
managing the challenges that will invariably manifest from 
time to time. To see 80% of new pensions business literally fall 
away overnight in March 2017 and still meet original market 
expectations is testament to that. 
Expectations are that 2018 new business volumes and client 
retention rates will remain in line with those of 2017 post the 
UK Budget. In addition, we continue to seek earnings enhancing 
acquisitions in the ROPS and UK SIPP sector. We are confident 
in the Group’s prospects and that we will deliver trading results 
in line with our previous management expectations for the new 
financial year.
Furthermore, our key deliverable for the current year is to continue 
to build on our governance framework and to place more reliance 
on IT efficiencies.
Our medium term strategy continues to move forward, with 
an emphasis on improving profit margins, as well as looking to 
diversify our product range both within the expatriate, as well as 
UK market. In turn, this will allow us to expand our intermediary 
base, all of which continues to re-enforce the robustness of the 
business model. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my STM colleagues 
for their continued hard work and professionalism in carrying 
out their duties. 
I look forward to updating the market on our achievements 
during the course of the coming year.
