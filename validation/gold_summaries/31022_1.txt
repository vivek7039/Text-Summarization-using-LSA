 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Delivering sustainable growth  
with risk-balanced investment
It has been an important year of progress for Vectura. We have 
delivered a good set of financial results, in line with market expectations, 
and our key inhaled flutiform
®
 and Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 products have 
continued to show strong in-market growth. We have progressed our 
enhanced therapy pipeline, extended our valuable generics portfolio 
and delivered our merger integration plans in terms of both financial 
synergies and the establishment of the “AsOne” Vectura Group culture 
and values. Despite these achievements, Vectura’s performance in 
2017 has been partly overshadowed by the delay in the approval of 
VR315 (US), our generic Advair
®
 programme. 
It was certainly disappointing to receive a complete response letter 
(CRL) in May but our confidence in the approvability of VR315 (US) 
has not changed. Only three companies have publicly stated that 
they have filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for an 
AB-rated substitutable product and all three applicants had their 
submissions rejected. Although tough, the experience we have 
gained through the review process and feedback we have received 
in relation to the formulation and device elements of the programme 
give us even greater conviction that we are one of the very few 
companies which has the capability to meet the FDA’s high standards 
to develop complex inhaled generic drug-device combinations. 
Our confidence in our drug formulation and device capability, the 
heart of what Vectura does, is reflected in our increased investment 
focus and our belief in the future valuation of our expanding 
generics portfolio. 
Our belief in the value of our rare generic capabilities was further 
validated by Sandoz’s decision in June 2017 to partner the VR2081 pMDI 
US generic development programme. This was after we had already 
received our VR315 CRL. Given that Sandoz has its own Advair
®
 
generic in development, its choice of Vectura for this new development 
was an important further validation of our capabilities.
Strategy
Vectura’s strategy and vision remain unchanged. 
Our goal is to be the industry-leading inhaled drug-device 
development specialist, enabling us to deliver on our purpose to 
transform the lives of airways disease patients. Our strategy is to 
fully leverage our differentiated technology and skills, maximising 
value through partnered generic drug-device combinations and 
enhancing the inhaled performance of existing molecules. We will 
do this by continuing to invest and grow our business alongside 
demonstrating strong financial and capital allocation discipline.
We aim to develop a strong portfolio, primarily partnered to share 
the risk and cost of development, and to progressively develop assets 
in niche specialist disease segments. Our current revenues result 
primarily from partnered sales in the largest respiratory disease 
segments of asthma and COPD. Over time, smaller niche disease 
areas will increasingly become an important revenue source and 
it is in this market segment that we would look to establish a 
successful specialist commercial product portfolio.
The plan is one of organic growth supplemented by the potential 
to acquire products with in-market revenues and specialist customer 
capabilities in the US.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Future self-commercialisation of our specialist assets remains an 
option open to us but only as part of a wider commercial portfolio.
Vectura has a well-established business with proven capabilities 
and a simple differentiated business model which can be described 
in three simple steps: firstly, inhaled drug formulation and licensing; 
secondly, inhaled device design, development and licensing; and 
thirdly, our "sweet spot", where we combine the drug formulation 
and device work together and license a combined development 
programme to partners. We hit this "sweet spot" when we maximise 
the integrated combined IP, technology and skills across our platforms 
and teams and it is at this point that we can create the highest 
value returns from our partners.
We have a well proven track record of value creation through this 
model with some of the world’s biggest pharma companies. Typically, 
our formulation licensing expertise is seen in the revenues from 
novel patented molecules for inhaled delivery including Novartis’ 
Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 and GSK’s Ellipta
®
 portfolio. Proprietary device 
licensing is a relatively small part of the business, again typically for 
novel patented molecules. Bayer’s Breelib
TM
 iloprost product and 
Ablynx’s ALX-0171 novel inhaled Nanobody
®
, both of which use 
the FOX
®
 device, are both examples of this approach. Our “sweet 
spot”, where we combine our inhaled drug formulation, device 
and development expertise for the enhanced delivery of existing 
molecules or as generic developments, is demonstrated through 
in-market products such as flutiform
®
 and AirFluSal
®
 Forspiro
®
. 
In total, our partnered model, capabilities, reputation and track 
record are exemplified in the more than ten partnerships we 
have with leading pharmaceutical companies. 
What we do is technically complex and the way we do it is different. 
Unlike most companies operating in this sector that work on elements 
of what we do, few have a proven successful track record of combining 
and integrating the three key elements of inhaled drug formulation, 
device and combined product development. Additionally, none have 
the range of skills and platforms that Vectura has developed ranging 
from small to large molecule and biologic formulation through to 
dry powder, pressurised metered dose and novel nebulised device 
design and development. In the complex and challenging world 
of inhaled drug-device development these proven capabilities are 
rare and difficult to replicate and provide the basis for our sustained 
and valuable differentiation. 
In order to further accelerate the value leverage of our skills, we 
have taken the decision to adjust the focus of our investment with 
a deliberate shift towards projects with higher value and higher 
probability of success. Investment priority is being given to projects 
where Vectura has the highest probability of value creation with 
known medicines, either as partnered generics or as medicines 
with enhanced delivery mechanisms, using Vectura’s advanced 
proprietary devices. Vectura will be more selective in identifying 
partnering and co-development opportunities for novel molecules, 
focusing only on highly profitable and significant opportunities. 
Existing early-stage novel programmes will be out-licensed where 
the cost, risk and likely returns do not meet our newly defined 
investment criteria. 
Our strategy remains one where we are pursuing growth whilst, 
at the same time, maintaining and demonstrating strong financial 
management and capital allocation discipline. 
Operational highlights
In-market portfolio
Our key inhaled growth drivers, flutiform
®
 and Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
, 
have continued to perform strongly in market. flutiform
®
 generated 
in-market sales of €206.2m, up 11.8% on a constant currency 
basis, contributing £68.5m to underlying revenues for Vectura 
(2016 underlying: £65.8m).
Mundipharma continues to focus on driving growth for flutiform
®
 
and is making steady market share gains in a highly competitive 
and mature European ICS/LABA market, reporting value growth of 
5.0% on a constant currency basis. Outside of Europe, Mundipharma 
has continued to drive strong growth of 32.5% in 2017. As anticipated 
in our interim statements, Vectura’s 2017 reported revenues were 
impacted by destocking which was driven by partner working 
capital management.
In Japan, which now contributes over 37.1% of total flutiform
®
 
sales, Kyorin continues to make good progress with in-market sales 
up 19.8%. This performance has given flutiform
®
 a market share 
of 11.5% in the Japanese ICS/LABA market. With a strong respiratory 
commercial heritage in Japan and the relatively less mature nature 
of the Japanese ICS/LABA market, we believe that Kyorin has a solid 
basis for further strong growth in the future. 
Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 grew in market by 20.6% on a constant 
currency basis with total reported sales of Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
and Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
 exceeding $550m. Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
continues to be the leading LAMA/LABA combination ex-US and is 
maintaining a strong growth profile despite heavy competition from 
Boehringer’s Stiolto
®
 combination. Following the initial rapid launch 
of Stiolto, its market share is now stabilising with Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
maintain its market-leading position and strong trajectory growth 
supported changes to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) global COPD management strategy and a 
robust clinical data set. Reported sales for Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 were 
also affected by destocking as indicated by Novartis; however, they 
reported strong Q4 growth of 26% on a constant currency basis. 
GSK’s branded Ellipta
®
 portfolio has also grown strongly with 
annual capped revenue of £9m achieved in Q3 2017.
Generics pipeline
A number of people have asked me why we would increase our 
focus on generics at a time when generics are under huge pressure 
in the US. To date there have been no approvals of complex inhaled 
substitutable drug-device combinations in the US and our own VR315 
asset has been delayed following the receipt of a CRL. The answer is 
quite simple.  12 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Operational highlights continued
Generics pipeline continued
We should not confuse the overall generics market, including the oral 
solids market, for example, which is relatively simple and commoditised, 
with the complex inhaled drug-device combination market, which 
remains untapped in the US today. The inhaled formulation market 
in 2017 in the US was valued at over $23bn, with less than 1% generic 
conversion in key inhaled classes. This compares to the oral solids 
market in the US, where over 91% of the prescriptions dispensed 
are for generic products. Vectura, with our partner Hikma, remains 
one of only three known companies with an inhaled drug-device 
combination application for a substitutable generic Advair
®
 product 
(VR315 (US)). Our unique capabilities have been validated throughout 
the regulatory review process and the lessons we have learned on 
the VR315 (US) programme journey put us in a good position going 
for future development of complex generic programmes.
Following the announcement of the partnering of VR2081, and the 
in-licensing of an advanced tiotropium from Pulmatrix, our generics 
pipeline now includes the three largest current inhaled branded 
opportunities in the US. 
In addition, following a series of interactions with the FDA, we are 
looking forward to the partnering and development of what we 
believe is the leading industry drug-device combination for the 
Ellipta
®
 portfolio. This portfolio includes, potentially, five separate 
project opportunities with analyst projections of net sales of 
approximately $6bn in 2023.
Enhanced delivery pipeline
One of the highlights for me during the year was participating in a 
symposium about Breelib™ at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) 
meeting in Milan. Breelib™, which uses our novel FOX
®
 handheld 
nebuliser, is the new iloprost product device combination sold by our 
partner Bayer. This was the first time that Breelib™ and the FOX
®
 
device were being showcased at such an event since the product 
was launched. The compelling data presented at the meeting showed 
a decrease in the average inhalation time of approximately 48 minutes 
per patient per day and is quite remarkable for these very sick 
pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. It provides us with both 
an enormous source of pride in terms of patient impact as well as 
important validation of the technical value of these novel devices.
In addition to Breelib
TM
 we have made very good progress with our 
two leading AKITA
®
 budesonide clinical programmes. The Phase III 
EU adult asthma programme is now fully recruited and we look forward 
to the completion of this important and challenging project before the 
end of 2018. The US paediatric programme has also progressed well, 
with the first Phase II patients dosed in Q4 2017, with completion 
expected in Q3 2018. 
Based on the increased conviction in both the differentiation and 
validation of our devices seen with Breelib™, we are now initiating 
the development of a series of known compounds where, through 
formulation and enhanced delivery, we believe that efficacy and 
convenience of delivery for the patient can be significantly improved. 
We look forward to sharing details of these projects around the 
time of our interim results. 
Novel drug-device partnering pipeline
During the year we have made good progress with continued 
support for the ongoing Ablynx ALX-0171 neonatal RSV Nanobody
®
 
development utilising an adapted variant of the FOX
®
 handheld 
nebuliser device. Ablynx is expected to report Phase IIb results 
in Q4 2018.
In December 2017, Mundipharma informed the Group of its decision 
to stop the development of the pMDI triple therapy for asthma and 
COPD (VR2076), which was at an early formulation phase. 
Aligned to our refocused investment strategy, we will now take an 
increasingly selective approach to future novel partnered development 
programmes, with each programme having to achieve a higher 
hurdle rate in terms of potential financial returns.
Organisation 
Following the successful completion of the merger with Skyepharma 
in June 2016, we made huge progress in the integration across the 
business in 2017 and we are tracking above the targeted plan of 
£10m annual savings in cost synergies. We now expect financial 
synergies to total between £11m and £12m by the end of 2018.
A key component of the integration has been the alignment of a 
new “AsOne” culture. Our target culture is supported by a clear set 
of values and expected behaviours. These elements were articulated 
with the engagement of all Vectura employees and have been 
incorporated into all the key management frameworks and 
systems being used across the business.
Alongside the merger integration activities, I was pleased to welcome 
Gonzalo De Miguel and Tony Fitzpatrick to the Executive Leadership 
Team. Both Gonzalo and Tony bring a wealth of experience to 
the clinical development and manufacturing operations settings 
respectively and have quickly settled into their new roles making 
positive contributions to, and beyond, their functions.
Summary 
2017 was a challenging year for Vectura. Despite this we remained 
highly focused and we have delivered well against our key objectives. 
The team demonstrated great tenacity and resilience and I would like 
to extend my heartfelt thanks for their contributions and support. 
With strong in-market product performance and validation of our 
team’s skills, capabilities and technology during 2017, we enter 
2018 with a clear, refocused investment strategy and increased 
conviction in our ability to create and deliver shareholder value.

13 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
The airways disease market is currently estimated to be worth 
in excess of $40bn
1
 worldwide; population growth and lifestyle 
changes, coupled with increasing longevity and wealth, particularly 
in developing economies, are increasing the disease burden for 
airways diseases. As a whole, this market is expected to grow 
in value by 3.5% annually to $56bn by 2025
1
.
After many years of status quo, the dynamics within this market 
are beginning to change with new treatment classes emerging, 
offering society and patients new ways to treat and control 
airways-related diseases.
Asthma and COPD
Asthma and COPD are expected to remain the largest and most 
competitive segments with new classes of treatment emerging and 
new phenotyping leading to more personalised medicine. Given the 
size and scale of these markets, these disease areas are best served by 
Vectura partnering with pharmaceutical companies which have the 
expertise and infrastructure to sell and market these products globally. 
Vectura’s existing portfolio and existing pipeline are well 
placed to benefit from changing market dynamics in the 
asthma and COPD market
The COPD market as a whole is expected to grow from $15bn to  
in excess of $19bn
2
, with the growth being driven from continued 
uptake of dual bronchodilators such as Breezhaler
®
 (LAMA/LABA, 
partnered with Novartis) and Anoro
®
 Ellipta
®
 (LAMA/LABA, IP licence 
with GSK) and the emergence of closed triple therapies.
The asthma market as a whole is expected to grow from $17bn to nearly 
$18bn
3
, with growth being driven by the emergence of closed triple 
therapies such as QVM149 (ICS/LAMA/LABA, partnered with Novartis) 
and biologic therapies expected to grow strongly from a small base 
offsetting genericisation of the ICS/LABA class (VR942, co-developed 
with UCB, now available for license).

The world population is expected to rise from its current level  
of some 7bn to 8.5bn by 2030 according to the United Nations
13 
and, alongside this population increase, life expectancy is also 
expected to increase significantly. Globally, over the same time 
period, the number of people aged 60 years and over will 
increase from 901m to over 1.4bn
14
. Alongside these changing 
demographics, the number of people who can access healthcare 
continues to increase.
In most established markets, ageing populations and certain 
lifestyle choices such as smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise 
are increasing the incidence of non-communicable diseases, such 
as airway-related diseases, which require long-term management.
Advances in science and technology innovation are critical if  
we are to address unmet medical need. Existing drugs will 
continue to be important in meeting the growing demand for 
healthcare, particularly with the increasing use of generic 
medication. The use of large molecules, or biologics, has also 
become an important source of innovation, with biologics 
amongst the most commercially successful new products.

Asthma and COPD generics – inhaled generics  
class still in its infancy, set to expand rapidly
Generic penetration is increasing in the EU; however, there is currently 
very little generic penetration in the US. Globally, the use of generic 
medicines is growing. In the US, the inhalants market was estimated 
to be worth some $23bn
5
 in 2017, with less than 1% generic 
conversion in key inhaled maintenance classes
6
. This trend is set 
to change as a number of inhaled products reach patent expiry in 
the US, with generic entrants expected over the coming years. 
Generic erosion is expected to have the most impact in ICS, ICS/
LABA and LAMA classes
7
.
Significant growth in these classes is likely as substitutable products 
are approved; however, the large volumes and value opportunities 
are made up of a limited number of large individual opportunities, 
e.g. Seretide/Advair
®
, Symbicort
®
, Spiriva
®
 and QVAR
®
. Technology 
barriers remain, making inhaled generics a specialist area.
The ICS/LABA class is expected to remain the largest and at present 
Advair
®
 and Symbicort
®
 remain the largest brands within this class 
in the US. Vectura’s pipeline asset VR315 (US) is one of only three 
known AB-rated generic Advair
®
 applications that has been submitted 
to the FDA for review. 
Globally, the LAMA class is expected to be worth $2.7bn by 2025

, 
with $1.2bn of this value being in the US

 remaining 
the dominant branded product in this segment. Vectura’s pipeline 
includes VR410 (US), a branded alternative to Spiriva

Globally, the ICS class is expected to be worth $3.4bn by 2025, 
with $3.0bn of this value being in the asthma segment
10
. Of the 
total ICS asthma market, $1.4bn of this value is expected to be 
in the US

STRATEGIC REPORT
Specialist markets
Alongside the expected growth in asthma and COPD markets, 
specialist markets are also expected to grow significantly with  
high unmet medical need and increasing scientific understanding 
driving development of new therapies. Patient populations are 
smaller, but significant commercial potential exists and this 
specialist market has less competitive intensity than the larger 
asthma and COPD markets. 
The growing specialist disease segment is well suited to 
nebuliser therapy and provides an opportunity for future Vectura 
enhanced delivery programmes to enhance patient benefit using 
our smart nebuliser technology. The nebuliser device market is 
currently worth c.$630m, and France, Germany, the UK and the  
US account for 65% of this value

Specialist diseases with high unmet need are expected 
to show significant growth as therapies become available
Over the past few years, changing attitudes towards globalisation 
and free trade, coupled with concerns over inflation and wages 
and, for many, concerns about inequality, have caused significant 
volatility and uncertainty in western markets. In 2016, these 
uncertainties were exemplified by the UK vote to leave the 
European Union and the result of the US presidential election. 
These trends have continued during 2017 as the “Brexit” 
negotiations have commenced and further national elections 
have been held in the UK, France and Germany. 
Expanding patient populations and growing unmet medical need 
are contributing to higher demand for healthcare services and 
leading to increased cost pressure within global healthcare systems. 
The world’s major regions are expected to see healthcare spending 
increases ranging between 2.4% and 7.5% between 2015 and 
2020
15
. This background of steadily rising healthcare costs has 
also led to increased scrutiny on drug pricing by governments, 
the media and consumers, particularly in the US. 
Increasingly, government agencies and insurers are looking for 
ways to manage increasing costs and, in some cases, are restricting 
access to treatment, slowing the uptake of innovative new medicines. 
With continued focus on cost management, it is expected that 
generics will take an increasingly larger share of global medicine 
spend, increasing from 27% in 2012 to 36% by 2017
