The measures below are deemed appropriate to assess the underlying operating results and enhance the comparability and understanding of the financial performance of Caledonia:
1. Net assets provides a measure of the value of the company to shareholders and is taken from the IFRS group net assets.
2.  Net asset value (‘NAV’) per share is a measure of the value of the company per share, calculated by dividing net assets by the number of shares in issue, adjusting for shares 
held by the Employee Share Trust and for dilution by the exercise of share options and awards, detailed in note 16 of the financial statements. NAV per share takes account 
of dividends on the ex-dividend date.
3.  NAV total return is a measure showing how the NAV per share has performed over a period of time, taking into account both capital returns and dividends paid to 
shareholders. NAV total return assumes that dividends are reinvested at the NAV per share on the ex-dividend date.
4.  Annual dividends are dividends declared as part of the company’s recurring dividend cycle and are typically paid out of earnings in a financial year. Annual dividend growth is the 
geometric progression ratio that provides a constant rate of increases over the period. Special dividends are non-recurring dividends declared separate from annual dividends.
