 10 Ergomed plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FOCUSED
ON STRATEGY
2017 saw continued very strong performance 
for Ergomed in the services business and 
particularly in the Drug Safety and Medical 
Information business. The Board sees this 
area and specialist CRO services such as 
orphan drug development as significant 
opportunities where Ergomed can take 
global leadership positions and continue 
to grow.
The appointment of Stephen Stamp as CEO and Dr Jan 
Petracek as COO was a catalyst for the re-aligned Board to 
review Ergomed’s growth opportunities and set strategic 
priorities which will see greater focus on the services business 
and a targeting of the Company’s resources at those areas.
The co-development pipeline continues to represent a 
differentiator for the CRO business and is a source of 
potential upside but with increased focus on the services 
business, expansion of the pipeline will not be a strategic 
priority. Having delivered strong Phase II clinical trial results 
for PeproStat, the Company intends to pursue further 
development of the Haemostatix assets through partnerships 
and collaborations.
The integration of pharmacovigilance services under the 
PrimeVigilance brand, which commenced during 2017, was 
successfully completed in 2018 and the acquisition of PSR, a 
specialist orphan CRO, contribute to a firm foundation for the 
Company’s strategic priorities. 
I look forward to further progress this year and in the future.

MARKET LEADERSHIP
PrimeVigilance is a leading provider 
of drug safety and medical 
information services in Europe. Our 
goal is to be the leading global 
provider by 2020. Within Contract 
Research services, we aim to be 
the leading provider in orphan 
drug development, building on the 
acquisition of PSR Group in 
October 2017.
ACQUISITION  
OPPORTUNITIES
We have acquired and successfully 
integrated five services acquisitions 
since IPO in mid-2014, all of which 
have been earnings enhancing. 
Strategic acquisitions which add 
specialist skills and/or geographic 
coverage to our services offering 
remain key to our growth strategy.
PRODUCT 
DEVELOPMENT UPSIDE
We have economic interests in five 
drug development programmes 
through co-development 
partnerships together with two lead 
products from our wholly-owned 
Haemostatix subsidiary. A milestone 
event from any one of these interests 
could have a material positive impact 
on Ergomed.
