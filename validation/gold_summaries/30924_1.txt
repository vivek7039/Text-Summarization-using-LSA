CEO’S REPORT
Shortly after my appointment in March 2017 we set out three key strategic priorities critical to enhancing our 
capital allocation discipline:
• Earlier and broader syndication of our subsidiaries, focusing on strategic investors, where we see scope for 
valuable validation and acceleration or de-risking of the path to commercialisation and monetisation;
• Strengthened leadership, governance and accountability at our subsidiary businesses, including changes in 
personnel where required, additional Board and advisory Board members, and clearer accountability for 
tangible milestone delivery; and
• A transition to thematic investing, focusing on theses and areas of competitive advantage, and on deeper 
relationships with a smaller number of research institutions aligned to these areas.
The actions undertaken across our investment, syndication and operating activities have been consistent with 
these priorities.
We completed subsidiary funding rounds in 2017 for HawkEye
360
, BridgeSat, Federated Wireless and 
Signature Medical that each included external strategic investors. As financial, strategic or commercial co-
investors, they offer both validation of the respective company’s business model and expand and/or de-risk the 
path to commercialisation.
We made good progress against a majority of the management objectives set for 2017, and I would like to 
recognise the teams for their accomplishments. Further, we strengthened leadership at several of our subsidiaries, 
including the appointment of two new CEOs, Tom Sparkman at Spin Transfer and Barry Matsumori at BridgeSat.
The addition of representatives from the strategic investors to the respective boards, and experienced non-
executive directors to others have enhanced governance and strategic insight.
In terms of new opportunities, we have focused our origination activities around theses or areas of competitive 
advantage, and sourcing on a more selective group of university and federal laboratories, and medical institutions 
with expertise in these areas, in addition to leveraging our own strong networks. As part of this enhanced focus, 
we are expanding the types of new investments we make, to consider both majority and minority investments at 
seed or Series A rounds where the opportunity is aligned to one of our theses and where we can leverage our 
experience and network.
Simon Davidson joined the team in June as Executive Vice President, Technology Investments, bringing extensive 
experience working with federal laboratories and government customers. He is driving focus on areas including 
space, connectivity and data, all of which leverage expertise and access derived from our current portfolio and 
team. Omar Amirana, MD, Senior Vice President, Life Sciences Investments, has focused on investment theses 
revolving around proprietary minimally-invasive solutions for procedures with a clear reimbursement path that 
reduce morbidity, mortality and costs. We are largely focused in areas where adoption can be dramatic such 
as interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, neuroradiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. 4

CEO’S REPORT (CONTINUED)  
(CONTINUED)
2017 was a year in which we focused on strengthening and repositioning the current portfolio. In 2018, we will 
continue to build on the strategic priorities identified with a view to focusing on two drivers of shareholder returns:
• Accelerate the path to commercialisation/monetisation at our top six companies, and nurture progress at our 
earlier stage companies; and
• Grow our new opportunity platform by increasing the number of high quality new investments.
Given the disruptive innovations and significant market opportunities our subsidiaries face and the steps we 
have taken to strengthen and focus operations, we believe that our portfolio holds the potential to deliver 
premium exit valuations and attractive returns to our shareholders. We believe each of our top six subsidiaries 
has strong sources of sustainable competitive advantage, including via patent portfolios which were markedly 
strengthened in 2017. The highly capable, experienced management teams have the necessary mix of technical 
and commercial skills, and have a clear line of sight to the critical goals and inflection points necessary to drive 
value and maximise exit optionality. Strategic, commercial and financial co-investors have validated the business 
plans and opportunities for those companies and provided invaluable support for the management teams.
I look forward to 2018 as a year in which we consolidate the hard work undertaken in 2017 and deliver further 
demonstrable progress against our objectives. I would like to thank our shareholders, our employees and our 
partners and customers for their ongoing support.
