 .The US spent $1.2 billion in 2002 on patient
monitoring products and, with an annual
growth rate of 8. 9%, hospitals will continue
to allocate a significant percentage
(30–40%) of their resources to critical care
patients. There remains a growing need for
advances in cardiovascular monitoring and
the care of such hospital patients. 
The size of the available market therefore
is not in doubt. The challenge for LiDCO 
in 2004/05 was to get into the position
where the Company could fully exploit
the potential for its technology to meet
this growing need. Therefore it was key to
complete residual registration activities in
a number of new territories and appoint
additional distributors in these territories.
These activities have now been
concluded successfully .
Following product approvals the
publication of independent clinical studies
showing both patient and economic
benefits is crucial to the development 
of the minimally invasive monitoring
market. With this in mind I am pleased 
to report that during the year , a number
of trials using LiDCO’s technology have
concluded positively . Of these trials 
the most powerful report was the one
presented on 22 March 2005 at the 25th
International Symposium on Intensive
Care and Emergency Medicine in 
Brussels – following the conclusion of 
a prospective controlled trial conducted
by St. George’s Hospital, London. This 
trial has demonstrated that better post
operative intensive care can be achieved
with the use of LiDCO’s minimally invasive
technology and importantly that such
care translates into benefits for both the
patient and cost savings for the healthcare
provider . The savings achieved through
adoption of this approach to the hospital
per year have been estimated at 
£2 million. This represents a saving of
£4,000 per patient through an average
reduction in stay of more than ten bed
days per patient treated. It has been
estimated that if this form of advanced
cardiovascular care was implemented
throughout the UK, savings of up to 
£500 million per annum could be
achieved for the NHS. 
Business review
During the period we have made
significant advances in the development
of a truly worldwide sales and distribution
network. In order to do so a number of
regulatory milestones were reached in
2004 and in early 2005. We have paid
particular attention to the European
market – as this is the most developed
territory for the adoption of advanced
minimally invasive cardiovascular
monitoring. We have received full
approvals for marketing in eight
additional territories: Italy , Germany ,
Austria, Norway , Sweden, Denmark,
Ireland and Bulgaria. These latest
registrations now provide LiDCO with 
full marketing approval in 13 European
countries. F ollowing these additional
registrations we are now selling product
in a greatly expanded group of territories:
Germany , Austria, Italy , Sweden, Holland,
Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic,
Croatia, Spain, Sweden, Norway and the
UK. We expect continued and significant
sales growth in Europe during 2005.
We also extended our sales reach in the
US, signing agreements with five regional
distributors. We are supporting these
distributors with our direct sales staff and
will continue to appoint additional
organisations throughout 2005. Our
Chief Executive’s review: T erry O’Brien
Hospitals will always need to maintain a 
high standard of patient care, which means 
a constant need for the latest technology,  
despite budget restraints.
LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 6 focused on: real-time beat to beat
display of critical parameters
ambition is to achieve full coverage of the
US market through a mixed direct and
distributor sales force. 
In May 2004 the Company announced 
it had contracted with Philips Medical
Systems (‘Philips’) to create a
communications link between LiDCO’s
proprietary , stand-alone monitoring
system (LiDCOplus Monitor) and Philips’
patient monitors, via the Philips Open
VueLink Interface protocol. The
communications link allows Philips’
customers access to LiDCO’s proprietary ,
minimally-invasive hemodynamic
monitoring data on the IntelliVue Patient
Monitor . The integration of critical care
parameters and hemodynamic data
derived from the LiDCOplus monitor 
will allow a fuller picture of the patient’s
condition and history to be displayed and
accessed throughout the hospital. I am
pleased to say that this communication
link software has now been completed
and launched. In addition, for those
hospitals without Phillips monitors we
have provided a real time ethernet based
communication feature. This means that
LiDCO monitors can now be interfaced
through both proprietary and inexpensive
non proprietary protocols. This is a major
step forward as hospital information
systems can now be updated with
LiDCO’s oxygen delivery data, shown by
the St. George’s trial to be fundamental to
improving outcomes for surgical patients.
We believe that there is a growing
requirement from intensive care staff 
and the hospital administration for the
provision and clinical audit of such 
crucial information. Our experience is
that interconnectivity of hemodynamic
monitors to hospital information 
systems is becoming a key part of 
the hemodynamic monitor purchase
specification. Our PC based monitor
approach is highly flexible and 
able to accommodate this 
developing requirement.
Trading review
Sales, margins and placing 
In the period turnover was modestly
down in comparison to 2003. This was a
consequence of our continuing strategy
to promote monitor rental and disposable
sales at the expense of one-off revenues
from capital sales to distributors and
hospitals. Revenues in 2003 were also
boosted by the receipt of an initial 
£0.7 million stocking order from Japan.
Thus the overall revenue figure disguises
the underlying strong growth of revenue 
in Europe and the US – which was
increased by 32% over the previous year .
This reflects continued encouraging
levels of disposable usage and the
expansion in the installed monitor base 
– up 30% (from 591 to 770 systems).
Overall disposable sales increased
strongly in the period – up by 87%. Thus
2004 was the fourth year in succession
where we have seen such growth in
recurring revenue. These more
predictable revenues from sales of
disposables, fee for use and rentals 
now account for the majority (64%) 
of total revenue – see T able 1.
As disposable sales increase in existing
markets and territories that were added
in the second half of the year the
Company expects continued strong
recurring revenue growth in 2005. We
continue to make progress in the USA
which represents 46% of our installed
base of monitors. We expect that, in
addition to the sales achieved by our 
own sales team, there will be a growing
contribution from the five US regional
agents who, following training, are
starting to make an impact on income.
The global interest in minimally invasive
technology is supported by the
widespread distribution of our installed
base of monitors US (46%), Europe
(35%), ROW (17%).
The slightly increased operating loss 
for the period reflects the modestly
reduced turnover with administration
expenses held at just below the previous
year’s figure.
Cost controls have been maintained 
and the underlying monthly cash usage 
is steady despite servicing a larger
distributor sales organisation in a
considerably expanded number of
territories. Our expectation is that the
installed base of monitors (770 as at 
31 January 2005) will continue to
increase and our first commercial
milestone of an installed base of 1,000
monitors looks within reach during 2005. 
In order to support the sales expansion 
in the US and Continental Europe, and 
to finance product development, the
Company concluded a placing of shares 
in June raising approximately £3.7 million
(net). It was gratifying to see a number of
our existing investors supporting this
financing round, and at the same time 
we were able to welcome a number of
new institutional investors.
Hospitals will always need to maintain 
a high standard of patient care – which
means a constant need for the latest
technology , despite budget restraints. 
In January 2005 LiDCO signed an
7 LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 agreement with a major US finance
house – a leading provider of equipment
acquisition solutions for acute-care
hospitals throughout the United States
and Canada. We will use the flexible
leasing programs on offer to help sell
equipment to US hospital customers via
leasing programs that give hospitals the
ability to obtain equipment immediately
and pay for it in monthly instalments. The
provision of this facility greatly enhances
the ability of our sales team and agents to
provide appropriate financing solutions
for our customers. 
US
T urnover in 2004 was £935,000 (2003:
£754,000) an increase of 2 4% despite 
an adverse currency impact from the
weakening dollar of £131,000. Currency
adjusted turnover (£1.1 million) shows an
increase of 41%. Capital sales of monitors
represented 27% of systems placed in the
period (2003: 58%). The number of
monitors placed and sales of sensors/
fees for use increased by 36% and 111%
respectively compared to 2003. A
number of distributors were appointed
during the second half of 2004 to
supplement our existing direct sales
force, and increase the sales coverage
within the US. The training of their staff
took place during the second half 
of 2004 and sales have commenced.
Further appointments of US agents 
are expected in 2005.
Given the lengthy US capital sales cycle,
the rental/ consignment model was 
introduced during the last quarter 
of 2003 to accelerate market
penetration of our monitoring
systems alongside the existing capital
sales option, and sales through higher
charges on disposables (‘Upcharge’).
Under this new model, customers are
charged a fee each time they use the
LiDCOplus software, but pay no up-
front fee for the monitor . Furthermore,
they can cost-effectively calibrate
their installed LiDCOplus system using
third party products, as well as LiDCO
sensors, thereby further increasing
the range of clinical situations in
which our monitors can be used. With
this sales model we have had successes
at a number of US hospitals where we
have been able to provide advanced,
real-time cardiovascular monitoring,
while still saving the hospital money
against their existing revenue budget
for invasive monitoring. 
UK
T urnover in the UK increased by 32% 
to £930,000 (2003: £706,000) with both
monitor placements and sensor numbers
increasing by 64%. Sales in the UK are
made via a direct sales force of seven
people, ensuring that LiDCOis kept in
direct contact with clinical developments
in the critical care community and can
rapidly adapt its products to meet
changing demands. As in the US, a variety
of sales models are also used in the UK,
with hospitals able to select from simple
capital purchase, up charged sensor
prices (but no capital purchase) or , more
recently, a fee-for-use programme.
The flexibility offered to NHS hospitals
assists them in the acquisition of the
LiDCO technology according to local
budgetary and planning circumstances.
We expect sales growth in the UK to 
be accelerated through adoption of
the protocol for improving outcome in
high risk surgery patients pioneered at 
St. George’s hospital.

LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 8 In March 2005, LiDCO launched a new software inter-connectable
with Philips’ technology . The new software incorporates the Philips
VueLink protocol as well as an intranet connectivity . This means
that LiDCO monitors can now be interfaced with hospital
information systems already in place. This will allow many more
hospitals around the world to achieve significant improvement in
patient care and reduction of complication related costs. 
“The LiDCOplus monitor , with 
its ability to connect to other
primary patient monitors, helps 
us to improve our patient care 
by showing all the key clinical
information we need on 
one screen.”

Continental Europe
T urnover for the period was £386,000 –
an increase of 55% (2003: £2 49,000).
With the first wave of mutual recognition
approvals only achieved in late 2003,
first sales into continental Europe started
in earnest in mid 2004. The registration
process has continued, with second wave
approvals received in the first quarter 
of 2005. There are now 13 European
territories open to LiDCO and its products,
with further European approvals
scheduled for 2006.
Sales in Europe are made via a network
of distributors supported by LiDCO 
staff based in the UK and Northern
Europe. The market for less invasive
cardiovascular monitoring is most
advanced in Europe, compared to the
rest of the world and interest in adopting
minimally invasive monitoring is strong.
We expect significant sales growth 
in 2005.
F ar East, Japan and the Rest of the World
Sales in the F ar East, Japan and the 
Rest of the World totalled £204,000
(2003: £822,000). Adjusting for the 
one-off stocking order received from 
our Japanese distributor in 2003
(£700,000), reveals a sales increase 
in territories outside of Japan. In Japan,
following their purchase of an initial
stocking order of 100 monitors in 2003
our distributor Nipro have established a
number of key clinical reference sites 
for our technology . The strategy is to
concentrate on these centres initially and
then expand sales through local referrals.
The market for real time hemodynamic
monitoring is less well developed in
Japan when compared to Europe – 2005
will therefore represent a year where 
the product advantages are still being
established by our distributor partner . 
We therefore expect modest sales 
during this market development period.
Research & development and product
application
Focus on improving hospital patient
outcomes and reducing costs 
Our core development activities centre
on the acquisition and intelligent display ,
through a platform PC based monitor , of
combinations of measurements, that
have been proven to influence hospital
patient outcomes positively , and thereby
reduce costs. The advantages to be
obtained through targeting one such
parameter (oxygen delivery) have
already been demonstrated. LiDCO
believe that there will be an increasing
recognition of the advantages of this
form of hemodynamic driven care. 
Hemodynamic driven care and
intravenous fluid management
The Company expects to add a further
software product to simplify and make
safer the administration of fluids for 
re-hydration purposes. Knowing the
precise amount of fluids to administer is
surprisingly difficult. T oo little fluid and
the oxygen delivery and blood pressure
can fall to dangerous levels. T oo much
can result in overloading the circulation
and heart resulting in a greatly extended
hospital stay . LiDCO is developing 
a unique interface allowing the
nurse/ physician-led optimisation of 
fluid administration to such patients. 
This development activity will result in 
an intelligent fluid administration screen
and new software product. This will not
only improve safety but also help in the
implementation of early goal directed
therapy (EGDT) in surgery patients.
Looking ahead, we are also assessing the potential
to use completely non-invasive (skin applied) sensor
technology with the LiDCOplus monitor to identify
and optimise high-risk surgery patients.
“The USA is the biggest
single market and now
represents approximately
50% of our potential
worldwide sales.”
LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 10 Oxygen delivery and consumption ratio
patent application
Improved outcomes are achieved 
when the consumption and delivery 
of oxygen are well matched – the EGDT /
St. George’s study is an example of where
increasing oxygen delivery to pay back
an oxygen debt has markedly improved
outcome. T o further simplify the
monitoring of the relationship of these
two parameters LiDCO have filed a
patent on a unique way of calculating 
and displaying their relationship in a
simplified form. Through such a display ,
the user can be alerted to any
deterioration in this key ratio and a 
menu of appropriate responses is
presented e.g. giving additional blood,
more fluids or the administration of a
drug. It is our intention to add this
functionality to our software.
Potential neonatal application for the
LiDCOplus monitor
Monitoring of cardiovascular status 
in the unwell pre-term baby (neonate) 
is mostly limited to the continuous
measurement of blood pressure through
an umbilical artery catheter . However ,
these blood pressure values, although
useful, may not accurately reflect actual
tissue perfusion with oxygen. The
continuous measurement of cardiac
output and estimation of oxygen delivery
in these very small babies has not 
been possible, except intermittently 
by echocardiography . Researchers from
the Clinical Science Department (Child
Health), University of Bristol, UK have
shown that continuous analysis of
cardiac output is possible with the
LiDCOplus monitor . The cardiac output
trend derived from our monitor shows 
a closer correlation to changing tissue
oxygen perfusion than standard arterial
blood pressure monitoring. They conclude
that ‘This methodology is applicable to
the term and preterm infant in assessing
cardiovascular function, using either 
a standard umbilical catheter , or a
peripheral arterial line’. The LiDCOplus
monitor is not registered for use in
subjects less than 40 kgs in weight;
however , this work has encouraged 
us to further investigate the potential 
for sales of the LiDCOplus monitor in
neonatal intensive care units. If an
attractive business case can be made
then the appropriate steps will be 
taken for registration of this new 
clinical indication.
