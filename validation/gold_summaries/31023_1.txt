 10 / John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Outlook for our markets
The overall market for greenfield infrastructure is driven by a
number of factors, but especially population growth, urbanisation
and climate change. In the case of urbanisation, some
commentators forecast that within 20 years, two out of every
three people will live in a city. Other factors which influence
infrastructure spending include governmental policy towards
regulation and investment, the demand for energy and the
availability of capital, both private and public sector.
Most of these factors apply to each of the sectors in which
we operate: transport and transport-related infrastructure,
such as roads, tunnels, bridges and rail assets; environmental
infrastructure, such as renewable energy, water treatment and
waste management; and social infrastructure, such as schools
and hospitals. We are proud of the fact that many of the assets
we invest in provide a public benefit.
We operate in a wider infrastructure market in which there
has been historical under-investment. This provides a strong
incentive for governments to use public private partnerships
(PPPs) to procure greenfield infrastructure. As well as access
to private capital, PPP arrangements enable governmental
and other public sector bodies to benefit from fixed price
arrangements which transfer very significant risks to the
private sector, especially design, construction and operational
delivery risks. The growing international adoption of PPPs as
a procurement model for infrastructure is acknowledged by
the World Bank which publishes a PPP Reference Guide.
Our Primary Investment teams benefit from a robust and
diverse pipeline of future opportunities in each of the three
regions where we currently operate: North America (Canada
and the US); Asia Pacific (Australia and New Zealand); and
Europe (including the UK). We have focused strongly on
developing our relationships with international partners,
including construction companies, rolling stock manufacturers
and renewable energy developers and this is resulting in more
investment opportunities. We entered 2018 with strong positions
in nine shortlisted PPP consortiums and with four exclusive
renewable energy opportunities.
North America: six of the nine shortlisted PPP positions •
are for potential investments in North America. In Canada,
we continue to see a strong commitment to PPPs from
federal authorities, as evidenced by the recent establishment
of the Canadian Infrastructure Board. The most active
province is Ontario, especially in the transport sector.

I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN 2017 WE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED
OUR INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS, WHILE MAINTAINING OUR TRACK RECORD
OF STRONG RESULTS. THIS WAS ACHIEVED DESPITE THE IMPACT OF LOWER
POWER PRICE FORECASTS WHICH AFFECTED A NUMBER OF OUR RENEWABLE
ENERGY INVESTMENTS AND WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE SIGNIFICANT
FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN IN 2016.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
Olivier Brousse
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
In the US, 2017 has been a breakthrough year for John Laing.
We have taken advantage of increased activity in PPPs, and
made further investments in renewable energy. The US is
a market where procurement for greenfield assets takes
place predominantly at state or city, rather than federal,
level, and where the need for greenfield infrastructure has
been highlighted by states or cities introducing specific
local tax increases to raise funds for new assets required.
Asia Pacific: we remain very active in the PPP markets in •
both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, following a
very successful year in 2017, we see fewer PPP projects
reaching financial close in 2018, but a very active pipeline
thereafter. In renewable energy, we have benefited from
the impetus given to the market by the Federal Renewable
Energy Target in Australia.
Europe: three of the nine shortlisted PPP positions are •
for potential investments in Europe. While the PPP market
in some European countries remains subdued, we are
concentrating on those jurisdictions which have, or will be,
initiating active PPP road programmes, such as the
Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Norway. While the
political climate in the UK is currently not favourable
towards PPP, it only accounts for 5% of our total pipeline.
Outside the current pipeline and beyond the PPP and renewable
energy markets, we continue to research other infrastructure
asset classes that could potentially fit our business model in
order to feed future growth. The due diligence we carry out
before investing in new markets follows a rigorous process that
eventually rules out many opportunities. Over the last three years,
we have made our first investments in managed lanes and in
offshore wind, and expect these sectors to offer a number of
investment opportunities in the future. We also continue to
research new geographies where we see potential opportunities
to invest alongside established partners at appropriate returns.
These include selected countries in Latin America and South
East Asia.
Business model 
Our business model has three key areas of activity:
Primary Investment: we source, originate, bid for and win •
greenfield infrastructure projects, typically as part of a
consortium in the case of PPP projects. Our Primary
Investment portfolio comprises interests in infrastructure
projects which are in the construction phase.
Secondary Investment: we own a substantial portfolio •
of investments in operational infrastructure projects,
almost all of which were previously part of our Primary
Investment portfolio.
Asset Management: we actively manage our own Primary •
and Secondary Investment portfolios and provide investment
advice and asset management services to two external
funds, John Laing Infrastructure Fund (JLIF) and John Laing
Environmental Assets Group (JLEN), through John Laing
Capital Management Limited (JLCM), which is regulated
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Our business model is based on our specialist infrastructure
investment and asset management capabilities and the
continuing demand for operational infrastructure assets as
an attractive investment class.
We aim to invest in new greenfield infrastructure projects which,
post-construction, produce long-term predictable cash flows
that meet our rate of return targets. The projects we invest
in are held within special purpose vehicles (SPVs) which we
(often in conjunction with other investors) fund with equity,
and which are structured so that providers of third party debt
finance have no contractual recourse to equity investors beyond
their equity commitment.
The principal value creation mechanism inherent in our business
model is the difference between the hold-to-maturity IRR at the
financial close of a greenfield investment and the discount rate
applied to that investment once the underlying project has
reached the operational phase. Although we have in recent
years experienced pressure on hold-to-maturity IRRs as our
Primary Investment teams bid for new greenfield projects, this
has typically been accompanied by a reduction in secondary
discount rates. This has allowed the Group to maintain attractive
“yield shifts” which drive one of the principal measures applied
to the Group’s investments, namely annualised rate of return.
When investments become part of our Primary Investment
portfolio, their value should grow progressively with a reasonable
degree of predictability as the underlying assets move through
the construction phase and their risk correspondingly reduces.
Once the projects reach the operational stage, investments
move from our Primary to our Secondary Investment portfolio
where they can be held to maturity or sold to secondary market
investors, who are targeting a lower rate of return consistent
with the reduction in risk.
Our asset management activities focus on management and
reduction of project risks, especially during the construction
phase, and enhancement of project cash flows. The latter involves
identifying and implementing value enhancement initiatives that
can increase future cash flows to project investors compared to
those originally forecast at the start of the project. We look at
a wide range of such value enhancements. Opportunities may
arise at any time during a project’s life and may vary significantly
from one investment to another.
“We have a proven business
model and we believe we are in a
good position to take advantage 
of opportunities for investment 
in greenfield infrastructure in a
growing market.” 12 / John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Objectives and outcomes
Our overall strategy is to create value for shareholders through
originating, investing in and managing infrastructure assets
internationally. In that respect, we see NAV growth and dividends
as key measures of our success:
In 2017, our NAV grew by 10.5% from £1,016.8 million at •
31 December 2016 to £1,123.9 million at 31 December 2017.
This was 13.5% if we add back the dividends paid in 2017.
We are proposing total dividends of 10.61p per share for •
2017 compared to dividends of 8.15p per share for 2016.
This represents growth of 30.2% over 2016, reflecting the
significant increase in realisations during 2017.
To deliver our strategy, we have set ourselves the core objectives
below, while maintaining the discipline and analysis required
to mitigate against the delivery, revenue and operational risks
associated with investments in infrastructure projects:
growth in primary investment volumes (new investment •
capital committed to greenfield infrastructure projects)
over the medium term;
growth in the value of external AuM and related fee •
income; and
management and enhancement of our investment •
portfolio, with a clear focus on active management during
construction, accompanied by realisations of investments
which, combined with our corporate banking facilities
and operational cash flows, enable us to finance new
investment commitments.
Growth in primary investment volumes over the medium term
We operate in a broad market for new infrastructure with a
strong pipeline of future opportunities.
Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to
making new investments. Using detailed financial analysis and
investment appraisal processes, we assess the specific risk
profiles for each prospective investment with the aim of optimising
risk-adjusted returns and securing only those new investments
which are likely to meet the investment appetites of secondary
market investors when the underlying assets become operational.
Our resources are concentrated on countries or geographical
regions carefully selected against five key criteria:
a stable political, legal, regulatory and taxation framework; •
a commitment to the development of privately-financed •
infrastructure;
the ability to form relationships with strong supply chain •
partners, preferably companies we have worked with before;
the likelihood of target financial returns, on a risk-adjusted •
basis, being realised; and
the existence of a market for operational investments or a •
strong expectation that such a market will develop.
Our total commitment to new investments in 2017 was
£382.9 million, made up of £142.5 million in renewable energy
and £240.4 million in PPP assets. This was a record level for
John Laing and significantly ahead of investment commitments
of £181.9 million in 2016 and our guidance. Our international
growth continued with all our investment commitments being
made outside the UK, including the following:
I-66 Managed Lanes (US) – £118.0 million •
Rocksprings Wind Farm (US) – £62.9 million •
New Grafton Correctional Centre (Australia) – £79.3 million •
Melbourne Metro (Australia) – £43.1 million. •
Growth in the value of external AuM and related fee income
Our strategy to grow the value of our external AuM is linked
to our activities as an investment adviser to JLIF and JLEN.
JLCM not only advises and provides management services
to the portfolios of JLIF and JLEN, but also sources new
investments on their behalf. During the year, both JLIF and
JLEN successfully undertook secondary equity issues and
made acquisitions both from John Laing and from third parties.
Both funds have the benefit of a right of first offer over certain
investments should they be offered for sale by the Group.
During the year, the value of external AuM grew from
£1,472 million to £1,649 million, an increase of 12%.
Fee income from external AuM was £16.7 million for 2017,
up from £15.8 million in 2016.
Management and enhancement of our investment portfolio
For John Laing, being an active investor means not only
participating actively in consortiums at the bidding stage, but
also being actively involved in the project during the construction
phase in order to protect the value of our investment and
provide advice and/or assistance when delays occur or problems
arise. This time last year, we reported on the work of our team
on the New Royal Adelaide Hospital project in helping to resolve
the sometimes competing priorities of the Government of
South Australia, the bank lending consortium, and the
construction contractor. This situation had arisen principally
because construction of the hospital had been delayed. At the
half year, we reported that the hospital had successfully
achieved technical completion in mid-March 2017 followed by
commercial acceptance in mid-June 2017. Our team played a
key part in the achievement of this stage. Patients were first
admitted to the hospital in early September 2017.
Like many assets in the early operational stage, certain aspects
of service provision are still being addressed and, as we have
previously reported, remaining disputes are being dealt with
through a process of arbitration. The important thing from our
perspective is that the hospital is delivering under its contract
to the people of South Australia.
As regards Manchester Waste, we reported in September 2017
that our investment in Manchester Waste VL Co had been
acquired by the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority
(GMWDA). While this resulted in a reduction compared to the
value of this investment at 31 December 2016, it is important
to note that the cash received of £23.5 million, together with
previous distributions, resulted in a positive return on the
investment versus our original commitment in 2009. We remain
shareholders in Manchester Waste TPS Co where the
underlying asset, a combined heat and power station which
burns refuse-derived fuel, is performing well.
We regularly apply our active management skills when issues
arise. Wherever we operate, we believe our investing,
contracting and banking partners appreciate and value the
investment experience and active management we provide.
We continue to make good use of this expertise to monitor
and guide our investments through construction while
protecting investment base cases and, where appropriate,
seeking to find additional value.
At 31 December 2017, our portfolio comprised investments
in 41 infrastructure projects plus our shareholding in JLEN
(31 December 2016 – 42 projects plus shareholding in JLEN).
Our year end portfolio value, including the shareholding in
JLEN, was £1,193.8 million (31 December 2016 – £1,175.9 million).
The portfolio value decreased by £142.8 million as a result of
cash flows in the year, with proceeds from realisations and
cash yield received from project companies partly offset by
cash invested in projects. Fair value movements of £160.7 million,
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 / 13
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
or 15.6% of the cash rebased portfolio value, increased the
portfolio value to £1,193.8 million at 31 December 2017. This
growth is analysed further in the Portfolio Valuation section.
The portfolio valuation represents our assessment of the fair
value of investments in projects on a discounted cash flow basis
and assuming that each asset is held to maturity, other than
shares in JLEN which are held at market value. At 31 December
2017, investments with availability-based cash flows made up
58.8% of our portfolio by value.
The cash yield in 2017 was £40.2 million (2016 – £34.8 million),
a yield of 7.4% (2016 – 7.6%) on the average Secondary
Investment portfolio, in line with our guidance of a 6.5% to
8.5% yield. Cash yield represents cash receipts in the form of
dividends, interest and shareholder loan repayments from
project companies and listed investments.
During the year, we agreed realisations totalling £298.9 million,
including the agreed sale of five UK PPP investments to JLIF
for a total of £104.6 million, one of which is not expected to
complete until later in March 2018. This left us with realisations
for 2017 of £289.0 million which were well ahead of our original
guidance for 2017 of approximately £200 million.
Consistent with our self-funding model, we are actively
considering a number of realisations which are yet to be
confirmed. One potential realisation, which is at a reasonably
advanced stage, is the disposal of our remaining 15%
shareholding in IEP (Phase 1) which could be announced in
the next few weeks.
The percentage of our portfolio value attributable to UK
investments has fallen from 58% at 31 December 2014 to 34%
at 31 December 2017.
Profit before tax
Our profit before tax was £126.0 million in 2017, compared to
£192.1 million in 2016. Profit before tax is primarily driven by
the fair value movement on our investment portfolio. As set out
in the Portfolio Valuation section, the main reasons for the
lower fair value movement were:
The impact of lower power price forecasts (£54.8 million •
negative in 2017 compared to £17.6 million negative in 2016);
Adverse foreign exchange movements (£11.0 million •
negative in 2017 compared to £74.7 million positive in 2016,
as a result of the significant weakening of Sterling in 2016);
offset by:
A higher value uplift on financial closes (£50.1 million in •
2017 versus £31.0 million in 2016);
Higher value enhancements and other changes •
(£15.1 million positive in 2017 versus £17.2 million
negative in 2016), including in 2017 the value reduction
in the Manchester Waste investments; and
A benefit from revised macroeconomic assumptions of •
£4.1 million (£13.8 million negative in 2016).
Funding
In October 2017, the Group’s corporate banking facilities were
increased from £400 million to £475 million. The facilities
comprise a five-year committed corporate banking facility and
associated ancillary facilities, all of which expire in March 2020.
The Group also held surety facilities of £50 million backed by
two £25 million committed liquidity facilities both expiring in
March 2018. In early 2018 these liquidity facilities were
extended to February 2019.
The Group’s facilities enable us to issue letters of credit and/or
put up cash collateral to back investment commitments. We
finance our new investments through a combination of cash
flow from existing assets, the above corporate banking facilities
and realisations of investments in operational projects.
Organisation and staff
Our staff numbers were 158 at 31 December 2017 compared
to 160 at the end of 2016. We now have 39% of staff located
outside the UK (31 December 2016 – 36%), consistent with our
increasing internationalisation.
In January 2018, we initiated an internal reorganisation under
which the Primary Investment and Asset Management teams
in each of our three geographical regions will in future report
to a single regional head, each of whom in turn reports to me.
The principal objective behind this revised structure is to enable
us to focus more effectively on value creation in each region,
while allowing our business to scale up.
I visited our international offices regularly during 2017. We are
lucky to have high quality individuals and experienced teams
across our business and it is my privilege to thank them for all
they have done this year. As I have said before, our success
depends on our people.
Current trading and guidance
Our total investment pipeline at 31 December 2017 was
£2,150 million and includes £1,585 million of PPP opportunities
looking out three years as well as nearer term renewable energy
opportunities of £565 million. Within the pipeline is one preferred
bidder position related to the MBTA fare collection project in
Boston, US as well as nine shortlisted PPP positions with an
investment opportunity of approximately £200 million and four
exclusive renewable energy positions with an investment
opportunity of approximately £150 million. The current pipeline
does not include potential opportunities in new jurisdictions
or take account of late entry investment opportunities which
may arise.
As stated earlier, we achieved a record level of investment
commitments in 2017. As our investment pipeline continues to
grow, our aim is to keep on growing investment commitments,
but not necessarily year on year, giving our teams the time to
select the best opportunities. In 2018, our guidance is for
investments commitments of approximately £250 million.
We expect realisations to be at a broadly similar level to our
investment commitments, consistent with our self-funding model.
As set out in the Chairman’s statement, we have today launched
a 1 for 3 rights issue to raise £210 million, net of costs, which
will enable us to take advantage of a higher proportion of the
attractive investment opportunities currently available to the
Group. With the benefit of the rights issue, we will have greater
ability both to position ourselves for, and execute on, investment
commitments in excess of £250 million in 2018.
We have a proven business model and we believe we are in a
good position to take advantage of opportunities for investment
in greenfield infrastructure in a growing market. Since we
re-listed in 2015, we have delivered steady growth despite
changing governmental policies and macroeconomic
environments. Against this background, we have confidence
in the future.
