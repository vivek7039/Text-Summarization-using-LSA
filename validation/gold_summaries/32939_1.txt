annual report and accounts 2017
I am very pleased to report a solid performance for 2017. 
The dedication and hard work of our people has been 
outstanding during 2017 and is the reason we have delivered 
a very good result in a period of significant change during 
our Transformation Programme.
ceo’s review
Our core business has 
remained stable, with 
a solid performance in 
Fixed Line, Broadband 
and Data Services, Mobile 
and further growth in our 
Global Solutions business.
Overview
The Company has had a busy 
year operationally, and continues 
to provide a wide range of 
telecommunications services to 
consumers, businesses and the 
public sector on the Isle of Man 
as we continue to demonstrate 
our commitment to the Island 
community. Our core domestic 
business performance in Fixed 
Line, Broadband, Data and Mobile 
remained solid during the year. 
Availability and take-up of high- 
speed broadband services continues 
to increase, and the introduction 
of our Smartroam tariffs has been 
a success, with a positive take-up 
by our post-pay customer base. 
Our 4G network is performing well, 
supporting our significant market 
share of mobile subscribers.
Our International Global Solutions 
business performed well during the 
year, with continued year-on-year 
growth across the majority of the 
product portfolio.
Results overview
Revenue was lower than 2016 due to 
the previously noted consolidation of 
some of our Data Centre customers 
and rescheduling of the directory 
distribution, partially offset by 
continued growth in Global Solutions.
Cash performance in the year has 
been exceptionally strong as a result 
of tight control of our working capital 
and capital expenditure, and 
continues to support our progressive 
dividend policy for 2017.
Underlying EBITDA declined slightly 
to £27.1m (2016: 27.7m). Reported 
EBITDA was up for the year at 
£23.1m (2016: 22.7m) as a result of a 
reduction in the costs relating to the 
Transformation Programme compared 
with 2016 and a lower impairment 
charge for obsolete assets. The cash 
performance triggered the provision 
for incentive payments, resulting in a 
moderately lower underlying EBITDA, 
while decreased revenues were offset 
by cost saving initiatives made 
throughout the year.
Underlying profit after tax decreased 
to £15.1m (2016: £16.3m), as a result 
of a lower underlying EBITDA and 
increased depreciation. Underlying 
diluted earnings per share was 
therefore reduced to 13.15p (2016: 
14.26p). Reported profit after tax 
increased year-on-year to £11.9m 
(2016: £8.8m), primarily due to a 
non-recurring £1.3m loss on the 
revaluation of property costs in

the prior year and a £0.8m profit on 
interest rate swaps (2016: £1.2m loss).
In 2017, the Company continued to 
invest in its infrastructure, specifically 
in the mobile network, increasing 
the availability of our VDSL high 
speed broadband network, and 
in key back office systems as part 
of the Transformation Programme.
Fixed, Broadband and 
Data services
Fixed, Broadband and Data services 
provide fixed line voice, broadband 
and connectivity services for 
customers, connecting approximately 
37,000 homes and 4,000 businesses 
on the Isle of Man. Fixed, Broadband 
and Data is our largest business, 
representing 40% of all company 
revenues. In 2017 revenue was stable, 
at £31.5m (2016: £31.6m).
Take up of our high-speed broadband 
services, known as Ultima and Ultima 
plus, delivered Broadband revenue 
growth of 2.2% during 2017 to £9.3m. 
During 2017 , we commenced our trial 
rollout of our fibre to the premises 
(FTTP) programme, with the first 
businesses and consumers expected 
to be serviced in H1 2018. Our planned 
investment in FTTP for 2018 is included 
in our 2018 capital expenditure 
budget, and is expected to result in 
ARPU accretion as customers upgrade 
to the new service.
In May 2017, we introduced changes 
to our Fixed Line and Broadband Tariff 
Charges. The price changes increased 
fixed line rental charges, but offered 
the opportunity to deliver greater 
value for money to customers who 
subscribe to multiple services.
Mobile
Our Mobile business performed well 
with encouraging revenues following 
successful Christmas promotions 
and well-received additional 
complementary products, offset by 
the anticipated impact on revenues 
from our roaming proposition 
(Smartroam). In August 2017, we 
launched inclusive roaming usage 
for our post-pay customers, and 
reduced roaming rates to all our 
mobile customers; a first for the Isle 
of Man market. These price reductions 
were supported by improved cost 
control and have proved popular with 
our customer base.
Our award-winning 4G network, which 
provides 99% population coverage at 
speeds of up to ten times faster than 
3G services, continues to perform well 
and enable us to defend our mobile 
subscribers market share.
Data Centre
The Data Centre business offers 
co-location, managed hosting, cloud 
and disaster recovery services to an 
international and local corporate client 
base. These services are supplied by

three data centres at Douglas North, 
Douglas Central and Greenhill Data 
Centre (‘GDC’). The data centres at 
GDC and Douglas North are Tier 3 
designed data centres providing high 
standards of data security, resilience, 
and expandable hosting capacity, 
including business continuity and 
distributed denial of service 
protection (‘DDoS’).
Following a decline in Data Centre 
revenue last year due to customer 
consolidation, it is good to see 
underlying growth for the year. 
H2 saw improved performance, 
with revenues up 4.9% compared 
with H1. This growth was primarily 
due to recurring revenues from  
a good uptake of our intelligent  
cloud services and from some 
non-recurring sales. We continue  
to be responsive in seeking to 
re-populate capacity in our data 
centres, with a focus on managed 
service business, to better  
utilise our investment, as well  
as through new complimentary 
product offerings.
Global Solutions
The Global Solutions business 
generates revenue from services 
which run on our domestic mobile 
technology platform and utilise our 
international roaming agreements. 
This enables us to offer a variety of 
products to UK and international 
partners who use our Global  
Solutions SIM cards. There are  
four key revenue areas: wholesale  
SMS and voice, international traveller 
market, M2M and strongest signal 
mobile (branded ‘Chameleon’).
Global Solutions continues to perform 
well with increased year on year 
revenues, up 6.2% during the year 
to £16.5m (2016: £15.6m), with most 
of the product portfolio enjoying 
growth, in particular M2M and the 
international traveller market.
In 2016, we signed an agreement 
with China Unicom Global Limited, 
a subsidiary of China Unicom Group, 
the world’s fourth largest mobile 
service provider by subscriber base, 
to provide the connectivity to facilitate 
China Unicom’s ‘CUniq’ UK mobile 
and roaming product. Whilst there 
were some delays in the project in the 
first half of 2017 (as explained at the 
half year), the partnership performed 
better in H2. We remain excited about 
the potential of this collaboration and 
other growth opportunities for the 
Global Solutions business in 2018.
Other revenues
Other revenues include the advertising 
revenue from our telephone 
directory, hardware equipment sales, 
interconnection fees and managed 
services. Other revenue also includes 
our revenues from our standalone 
business, Vannin Ventures and 
its subsidiaries.
Other revenue decreased in line with 
management’s expectations by 23% 
during the year to £5.9m (2016: £7 .6m) 
due to the rescheduling of the directory 
distribution and lower kit sales.
In August 2016, we launched Vannin 
Ventures, a standalone business 
established to support the Company’s 
long-term growth strategy. Wholly 
owned by Manx Telecom, its purpose 
is to identify new and promising 
business opportunities in the telecoms 
and technology sectors, acting 
as an incubator to bring innovative 
products and services to market. 
There is a dedicated team behind 
the new business with a view to 
fostering a creative environment 
and an entrepreneurial ethos.
The acquisition of Partitionware, 
an Isle of Man software developer 
specialising in telecommunication 
platforms, at the end of 2016 has 
proven successful, with Partitionware 
supporting Vannin Ventures 
throughout the year as it seeks to 
acquire new businesses in line with 
our transformational growth strategy.
In May 2017, the Group acquired a 67% 
interest in Goshawk Communications 
UK Limited (‘Goshawk’). Goshawk is 
a UK-based company which develops 
and exploits technology-based 
solutions that enhance audio quality. 
Goshawk was acquired in order to 
support the Group’s growth strategy 
by developing disruptive technologies 
and bringing innovative products 
and services to the market.
Transformation Programme
In October 2016, the Company 
launched a two-year programme 
aimed at improving the experience 
it delivers to customers.
Vannin Ventures, our business incubator, has successfully 
integrated Partitionware following its acquisition in 
December 2016, and has acquired a majority stake 
in Goshawk Communications, a provider of technology 
for those with hearing loss, bringing exciting growth 
potential in the medium term. 19

CEO in touch with the business
The programme progressed well 
in 2017 with the introduction of new 
IT systems supporting improvements 
in processes and organisational 
structure. We are still on track to incur 
exceptional costs of approximately 
£10m over a 24-month period with 
£8.2m recognised up to the year end 
(2017: £3.9m, 2016: £4.3m), in addition, 
capital expenditure of £3.2m has been 
incurred to date (2017: £3.2m, 2016: nil) 
over the course of the programme. 
The cash cost of the programme 
in 2017 was £8.9m (2016: £0.5m).
We remain confident in 
the outlook for the Group, 
which is reflected in the 
maintenance of our 
progressive dividend policy. 
The strong underlying 
cashflow performance 
during the year reflects our 
focus on working capital 
and control over capital 
expenditure, and enables 
us to create value for our 
shareholders and invest in 
our network infrastructure 
in the Isle of Man.”
