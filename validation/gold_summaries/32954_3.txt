 The strength of Playtech’s model was 
evident again as the Group delivered 
double digit top line growth despite 
significant headwinds faced in the year. 
One of the key pillars of Playtech’s 
strategy has been its ability to continually 
improve the quality of earnings both 
organically and through acquiring 
strategically important targets in regulated 
and soon-to-be regulated markets. These 
acquisitions, such as BGT and ECM in 
2016, have augmented the growth of 
regulated revenue by deepening the 
retail channel in Playtech’s Omni-channel 
offering and delivering new opportunities 
in the regulated and newly regulated 
markets. This strategy has delivered 
consistent growth in the Company’s 
regulated revenue which grew to 54%  
in 2017. As outlined at the trading update 
in November, the M&A pipeline is very 
strong and Management and the Board 
are confident it will continue to diversify 
Playtech’s revenue base. 
 
Operationally 2017 was another year of 
significant progress for Playtech as the 
Company continues to execute on its 
industry leading Omni-channel solution. 
The integration of Playtech BGT Sports 
(PBS) is an important milestone for 
the Company and has created a fully 
integrated best-in-class sports technology 
solution. Integrated with the strength of 
the Casino vertical, via Playtech’s single 
platform, we have already seen the 
Sports division win new landmark clients, 
including leading Portuguese operator 
SAS, post period end. Moreover, the 
completion of the migration to our new 
Live Casino facility in Riga gives Playtech 
a competitive advantage in a fast-growing 
part of the industry.
Momentum reported in TradeTech Group 
continued with improvements across 
all KPIs, including revenue and EBITDA 
growth. Given Playtech’s experience in 
the Gaming industry the Financials division 
has been an early adopter of regulation in 
its industry and is therefore strategically 
well positioned for the potential incoming 
ESMA measures. Moreover 2017 saw 
TradeTech consolidate its B2B offering 
creating a full turnkey financial trading 
solution which Management believes is 
strategically well placed to benefit from  
the consolidation further regulation will 
bring to the sector. 
Management is confident 2017 has delivered  
a strong platform for strategic progress in 2018.

A POSITION OF STRENGTH 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
To reflect the Board’s confidence in 
the growth and cash generation of the 
business Playtech adopted a progressive 
dividend policy in 2016. One of the 
pillars of the Playtech model is its ability 
to convert its operational performance 
into strong cash generation and this has 
allowed a 10% increase in the full year 
dividend per share for 2017. 
Management is confident 2017 has 
delivered a strong platform for strategic 
progress in 2018 through both organic  
and inorganic opportunities.
