Our business at a glance
Flexible workspace
As at 31 March 2017 the Group owned or managed a 
portfolio of 44 business parks in Germany containing 
more than 1.4 million sqm of lettable space. 
The majority of the Group’s business parks are a mixture 
of office, storage and production space. Whilst retaining 
the major core anchor industrial tenants, many of the 
business parks are restructured to enhance the working 
environment of the tenants.
We are an owner and operator of branded business parks 
providing conventional space and flexible workspace in Germany.

A well-balanced portfolio
What we offer
The Group derives a large part of its rental income from conventional industrial tenants, which include international 
blue-chip corporations, but the majority of clients are German small to medium-sized enterprises (“SME”) companies.
The stable long-term income from anchor tenants underpins the ability to generate higher revenues from the more flexible 
leasing options.
We have created a range of innovative and flexible products by investing into sub-optimal space. This attracts a large number 
of tenants to our sites whilst generating higher income and asset value growth from space that would often be left vacant or 
rented at low prices.
