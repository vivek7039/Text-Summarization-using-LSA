Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Greggs performed well in 2017, delivering 
further like-for-like sales growth as well as 
expanding its estate of shops. This was 
achieved despite significant inflationary 
headwinds and alongside continued major 
investment in line with our strategic plan. 
These investments are creating the 
platform for us to deliver sustainable 
long-term growth for the benefit of  
all stakeholders.
Overview
Greggs once again demonstrated the resilience  
of its people and business model, delivering a solid 
trading and financial performance in the face of 
increased cost inflation and a strategic change 
programme. The development of our products  
and shop formats has opened up additional 
opportunities for growth in shop numbers and we 
expect this expansion to continue in the year ahead. 
We are investing significantly in our supply chain to 
enable this growth, whilst continuing to make 
improvements to our processes and systems that  
will deliver enhanced capability and efficiency to 
compete in the fast-moving food-on-the-go market.
Our people and values
In 2017 we began the investment in our supply chain 
that will enable us to deliver growth whilst remaining 
competitive in terms of the quality and price of our 
products. As I reported last year this involved taking 
some difficult decisions, particularly regarding the 
organisation of our manufacturing and logistics 
operations. We have worked hard over the last year 
to carry out the necessary changes in line with our 
values. There has been much challenge and dialogue 
but the whole team has worked together with the 
best interests of the business in mind, and  
I would like to extend my thanks to all involved.
Greggs has a long history of conducting its business  
in a responsible manner. We have made great strides 
in environmental management in recent years and are 
working with others in our industry to make further 
improvements. This includes finding solutions to 
increase the proportion of packaging that can be 
recycled and ensuring that more of our surplus  
food is channelled to those who need it most.
We have a strong reputation for sharing our 
success with the communities where we operate 
and direct much of this support through the 
Greggs Foundation, which celebrated its 30
th
 
anniversary in 2017. Representatives of the 
Foundation attended a Board meeting in the  
year to explain how they work with the Company 
and other partners. The Foundation makes a  
real difference to the lives of people in our 
communities and is given tremendous assistance 
by staff throughout Greggs. It is a great charity 
and one that we are very proud to support.
I would like to thank everyone who has worked  
for Greggs during the past year and contributed  
to the positive impact that it has had on all of 
its stakeholders.
The Board
As we announced last year, our Retail Director 
Raymond Reynolds stepped down from the Board 
at the AGM in May 2017 but remains a key member 
of the Company’s Operating Board in his new role 
as Property and Business Development Director. 
Raymond was a member of the Board for ten years 
and I would like to thank him for his important 
contribution throughout that time.
Otherwise the composition of the Board was 
unchanged in 2017. We continued to spend a 
significant amount of time overseeing the major 
programmes of change that support the Company’s 
strategic plan, particularly the investments under 
way in our internal supply chain. Other reviews 
included emerging risk areas, including the 
uncertainties around exiting the European Union, 
and examination of customer preferences and 
behaviours and our resulting plans.
The Board also visited Northern Ireland in the year 
to see for itself the progress that Greggs has made 
establishing a presence there. It was pleasing to see 
the same levels of enthusiasm and commitment to 
doing business the right way that we experience in 
more established trading areas.
Directors continue to be encouraged to visit 
different areas of the business and experience it 
through the eyes of our colleagues and customers.

Strategic Report
This helps to ensure that Non-Executive Directors’ 
contributions to Board discussions are well informed, 
supporting open and constructive dialogue with the 
management team. This year I also spent time with  
an employee panel, a particularly helpful experience 
given the significant changes that we are making in  
our supply chain.
Further details of the Board’s work are included in  
the Governance and Committee sections of this  
Annual Report.
Dividend
Our progressive dividend policy targets an ordinary 
dividend that is two times covered by earnings,  
with any further surplus capital being returned to 
shareholders. Our Finance Director, Richard Hutton, 
outlines the expected application of the distribution 
policy in more detail in the financial review.
In line with its progressive dividend policy, the  
Board intends to recommend at the Annual General 
Meeting a final dividend of 22.0 pence per share 
(2016: 21.5 pence), giving a total ordinary dividend 
for the year of 32.3 pence (2016: 31.0 pence), an 
increase of 4.2 per cent.
Looking ahead
Greggs continues to demonstrate its resilience in  
the face of economic uncertainty. This environment 
seems unlikely to change in the short term as the UK 
negotiates its exit from the European Union, with the 
associated risks to consumer confidence and further 
cost inflation. We are alive to these risks and working 
hard to mitigate the possible impacts where we can.
Looking beyond this we remain optimistic about 
the growth potential for Greggs and are currently 
investing to support this. The benefits of our major 
change programmes are beginning to show and 
will give us much greater capability and capacity 
for further growth in the years ahead.
Greggs continues to be a strong business with  
a great team. I am confident that we will make 
further progress in the year ahead.
