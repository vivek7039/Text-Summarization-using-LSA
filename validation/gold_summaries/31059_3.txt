In 2017, Medica continued to grow 
strongly and achieved another 
impressive set of results. t he Group 
saw growth across its main 
teleradiology offerings with revenue 
increasing by 18% on last year. t his 
growth has been underpinned by 
strong recruitment in the period 
which saw a net increase of 58 
radiologists on the prior year.
In March 2017, Medica successfully 
listed on the Main Market of the 
l ondon stock exchange, raising 
gross proceeds of £15m for the 
c ompany, which were used to pay 
down the net debt of the Group to 
approximately £10m. By the end of 
the year cash generation had further 
reduced the net debt to £5m and 
Medica’s strengthened financial 
position provides us with a strong 
platform to support growth and 
future development of the Group. 
Medica is well placed to pursue 
further organic and other growth 
opportunities to generate long-term 
value for shareholders.
t he teleradiology market continued 
to develop and demand from clients 
grew strongly as n Hs t rusts 
continued to face capacity pressure 
and seek efficient solutions of high 
clinical quality.
Medica’s strategy remains to 
provide the highest quality clinical 
services and to promote 
improvements in clinical quality 
across the u K. Medica’s goal is to 
work in partnership with n Hs t rusts 
and independent providers to 
reduce waiting times and improve 
patient outcomes. t hrough this 
approach, Medica can continue to 
lead the growth of teleradiology in 
the u K.
Medica’s key focus is to support 
n Hs t rusts at a time when they are 
dealing with increased demands for 
reporting against a backdrop of 
limited in-house capacity. t hrough 
investments in clinical process and 
technology Medica is able to 
provide a high quality clinical 
service to its clients’ patients in a 
timely and cost-effective manner. 
Increasingly Medica is able to 
partner with clients to bridge 
geographical and specialist gaps 
across the u K.
Recruitment of radiologists has 
been strong in 2017 and is expected 
to continue to be so as Medica 
focuses on improving the radiologist 
reporting experience with Medica 
through strong technical support 
and robust clinical governance. 
despite the relatively low 
proportion of reporting currently 
outsourced, the c ompany’s 
investment to increase the 
productivity of its radiologists is 
important in increasing the overall 
reporting capacity in the u K.
Medica’s employees have performed 
exceptionally well again in 2017 
supporting clients and radiologists 
and always focused on trying to 
ensure the best patient care. I have 
been impressed with the level of 
professionalism and dedication 
since joining Medica and express my 
gratitude on behalf of the Board to 
all of our staff for their contributions 
during the year.
t he Board has adopted a 
progressive dividend policy for the 
c ompany from Admission, which 
seeks to maximise shareholder value 
and reflect Medica’s strong earnings 
and cash flow characteristics, while 
allowing it to retain sufficient capital 
to fund ongoing operating 
requirements and to invest in the 
Group’s long-term growth. 
Following the interim dividend of 
0.55 pence for the period to 30 
June 2017, the Board proposes a 
final dividend of 1.10 pence for the 
year ended 31 december 2017.
t he Group has performed well in 
2017 and I believe we are well 
positioned to continue to create 
value for all shareholders by 
delivering high levels of service to 
our clients and helping to improve 
patient outcomes.
