At a Glance
Background
EKF Diagnostics is a global medical diagnostics business with a long history in point-of-care testing 
and manufacturing reagents for use in central laboratories.
Our point-of-care (POC) products, most of which are designed and manufactured in Germany, 
have a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability and accuracy from professionals working 
in diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine.
The POC business is built around a large installed base of analysers each of which generates a 
regular demand for tests, often for the entire life cycle of the analyser. In 2017 we sold an estimated 
70 million tests. This approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a 
percentage of organic growth each year.
The EKF Central Laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured 
at premises near San Antonio, Texas. Clinical chemistry reagents are sold for use on open channel 
systems or on EKF’s own brand of analysers. 
EKF Life Sciences, based in Elkhart, Indiana, manufactures diagnostic enzymes and contracted 
custom products for use in medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and industry.

Point-of-Care: Hemoglobin Analysers
Product Portfolio
The hemoglobin analysers product range within EKF Diagnostics, is the largest in terms of revenues 
and the size of the installed base. 
The acquisition of DiaSpect and Separation T echnology in 2014 allowed EKF to offer an unparalleled 
range of hemoglobin and hematocrit Point of Care blood analysers manufactured in Germany and 
the USA.
Strategy
The EKF Diagnostics portfolio of hemoglobin and hematocrit analysers is unique within the Point 
of Care diagnostics sector. 
Sales are primarily focused around two markets – public health initiatives such as anaemia screening 
programmes, and private practices where the cost of testing is paid for by an insurance company 
or the patient.
To approach these markets EKF has two distinct strategies: firstly, OEM partnerships with 
international distributor/manufacturers such as Fresenius Kabi; and secondly agreements with 
smaller distributors who are focused on the public health opportunities within their own countries.
Sports medicine and veterinary medicine provide two additional niche sources of customer for 
EKF distributors. 
EKF believes that this portfolio can provide it with a competitive advantage to grow its market 
share.
In  2017 EKF sold more than 22 million tests for the DiaSpect Tm range, and 19 million tests for 
Hemo Control and HemoPoint® H2

Point-of-Care: Diabetes Care
Product Portfolio
EKF’s Diabetes Care range aims to provide affordable, easy-to-use technology that reduces the 
costs of long-term healthcare of the diabetic and pre-diabetic population.
Diabetes has been at the core of EKF’s strategy for well over 10 years starting with the early models 
of the Biosen C-Line and Biosen S-Line glucose analysers. More recently HbA1c analysers have 
been launched that address the diabetes screening market.
Although they do not strictly belong within a point-of-care framework, clinical chemistry reagents 
such as Glycated Serum Protein and Beta- Hydroxybutyrate add further provenance to EKF’s claim 
to be a significant contributor to diabetes care worldwide.
Strategy
Although glucose testing is the most commonly used method of determining glycaemic control 
within diabetics, HbA1c is the accepted long term barometer of patient wellbeing and their 
compliance with the treatment regimes.
The growth in popularity of HbA1c measurement has seen an increasing number of entrants to the 
point-of-care HbA1c market focused on GP surgeries and diabetes clinics.
Since transferring manufacturing from the UK to Germany EKF has engaged in programmes 
to automate the production of cartridges to increase capacity and improve quality. In addition, 
these changes have allowed EKF Diagnostics to make significant operational savings through the 
centralisation of manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, and customer service.
Biosen
TM
• Glucose and/or lactate 
measurement
• Three models, each aimed 
at different settings
• Strong presence in 
Eastern Europe and China 
in diabetes clinics and 
research
• Used by professional and 
amateur sports clubs.

Hemoglobin)
• Results in four minutes 
using a unique 
methodology

aimed at cost-sensitive 
markets
Quo-Test® A1c
• HbA1c testing (Glycated 
Hemoglobin)

Point-of-Care: Maternal & Women’s Health
Product Portfolio
Maternal and Women’s Health focuses primarily on diagnostics used to address conditions and 
complications associated with pregnancy and child birth.
Sales include revenues from Creamatocrit centrifuges and hemoglobin meters used in Women and 
Infant Clinics, pregnancy test kits and HbA1c analysers used to diagnose gestational diabetes in 
pregnant women.
Strategy
EKF’s Maternal and Women’s Health business unit has seen steady growth since it was created.
SensPoint is awaiting CE marking whilst the product team continue to work with key opinion 
leaders to educate the future target market on the need for a protocol in the use of lactate in 
obstetric medicine.
In parallel there is a slowly building commercial interest in this market in Europe. Some medical 
professionals are using the Lactate Scout+ to provide accurate lactate readings within ten seconds.
Lactate Scout+ uses the same strip system as SensPoint but does not include SensPoint’s data 
management functionality.
Lactate Scout+ has historically been sold into sports medicine, specifically endurance activities 
such as cross-country skiing, cycling and rowing. This market also contributes significantly to 
Biosen revenues in which the lactate testing function is used in the preparation of elite squads of 
athletes such as Premier League and Budesliga football teams and Olympians.
Creamatocrit Plus
TM
• Small lab centrifuge used 
in Women and Infant 
Clinics
• Measures the lipid 
concentration and caloric 
density of breast milk
• Allows professionals 
to guide mothers with 
underweight infants
Pregnancy Testing
• Cassette rapid tests
• Marketed for use in 
hospital settings 
SensPoint
• Handheld lactate analyser 
with docking station
• Results in 10 seconds
• Undergoing European 
evaluation at the time of 
publication
Lactate Scout+
• Handheld lactate analyser
• Results in 10 seconds
• Developed for use in sports medicine
• Applications in medical and veterinary 
medicine
• New model to be launched in 2018  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  7

Central Laboratory
Product Portfolio
EKF, through its wholly owned subsidiary Stanbio Laboratory, has had a presence within central 
laboratory dating back over 50 years. During this time it has built a global customer base for its 
clinical chemistry reagents that can be used on most open-channel analyser platforms.
The Central Laboratory business also includes the manufacture of enzymes, produced at EKF Life 
Sciences in Elkhart, Indiana. 
From this facility EKF Life Sciences sells enzymes used in Stanbio’s clinical chemistry portfolio 
as well as providing contract manufacturing services for enzymes and proteins used in industrial 
applications. These are then sold in bulk or used in the production of in-vitro diagnostic devices 
(IVDs).
The acquisition of Separation Technology Inc. provided EKF with a third element to its central 
laboratory offering. As well as being a manufacturer of hematology products STI has a heritage in 
manufacturing high quality, US-built, mini-centrifuges.
Strategy
The central laboratory market continues to experience relatively low levels of growth. This is in part 
because sales of chemistry reagents are often linked to the provision of the analysers on which the 
tests are performed. EKF Diagnostics’ approach to the clinical chemistry market changed in late 
2015 with the launch of the Altair 240, a benchtop analyser calibrated to run the Stanbio Chemistry 
range of reagents.
Further opportunities continue to exist in niche markets. Sales of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Liquicolor 
reagent continue to be healthy with a strong performance from US distributors who have developed 
a market capitalising on the withdrawal of a previous method of testing for ketosis.
More than 1,000 US hospitals now use EKF’s Beta-Hydroxybutyrate reagent. A similar approach is 
being used for Procalcitonin (PCT) in Europe where EKF has undertaken awareness activity using 
key opinion leaders in target markets.
