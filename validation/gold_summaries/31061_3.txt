Governance
Excellent momentum
Chairman’s Statement
As our co-CEOs noted 
in their statement, 
LoopUp has had another 
strong year, maintaining 
its track record of 
consistent, efficient 
growth and continued 
product innovation.
LoopUp offers a superior service to clients 
and customers. 
Lady Barbara Judge CBE 
Since joining the board at IPO in 2016, 
I have been pleased to be a part of 
LoopUp’s excellent momentum in the 
market and look forward to the 
Company maintaining this trend during 
2018 and beyond. 
LoopUp addresses a significant problem 
that businesses face – the proliferation 
of painful, time-wasting conference calls 
that frustrate busy professionals and 
diminish their productivity every day. 
Having experienced these very issues 
myself, I have found LoopUp’s approach 
an innovative alternative. Its business 
model and growing adoption among 
demanding enterprises is further proof 
of the value LoopUp delivers to its 
customers and shareholders.
The Company continues to experience 
strong demand for its differentiated 
product, which combined with its 
innovative and efficient Pods 
organisational strategy, makes for 
an exciting outlook, and we remain 
confident in our ability to deliver 
further growth.
The Directors and executive team have 
demonstrated their continued ability to 
take the business forward as a public 
company and maintain its upward 
momentum. I remain confident that the 
Company is well positioned to grow in 
line with market expectations and 
deliver against our strategic priorities in 
the year to come. 
I look forward to seeing you, our 
shareholders, at our AGM on 
15 June 2018.
A note on corporate governance 
LoopUp Group plc, as an AIM company, 
is not required to comply (and does not 
claim to comply) with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). The 
Board, however, recognizes the 
importance of the principles set out in 
the Code and remains committed to the 
maintenance of high standards of 
corporate governance. 
After due consideration, the Board 
seeks to apply those aspects of the 
Code as far as it considers appropriate 
for a business of this size and nature. 
The composition of the Group’s Board 
was considered carefully prior to AIM 
admission, and no changes to the 
Board or its Committees have taken 
place since admission. 
The Board holds its strategic decision-
making meetings in various Group 
offices, taking the opportunity to meet 
with members of both the Executive 
team and the wider senior management 
team, building their knowledge of 
the business. 
In my opinion, LoopUp offers a superior 
service to clients and customers. It is my 
honour and pleasure to be its Chairman, 
and to have the opportunity to work with 
such an effective and impressive 
management team and Board.
