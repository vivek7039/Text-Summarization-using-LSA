Chief Executive Officer’s report
Financial performance
The Group made a healthy return to profitability with a 
reported profit before tax of £8.8 million compared to a loss 
of £0.3 million in the previous year. This was aided by strong 
financial markets but driven primarily by the transformation 
implemented over the past two years. The Group is streamlined, 
focused and positioned to deliver profitably the wealth 
management services and products sought and needed 
by UK clients. This has been delivered without recourse to 
a restructuring charge and the precautionary capital raised 
from shareholders in April 2015 remains intact.
As planned, the financial improvements were broad-based. 
A strong cost control culture was evident across all units 
and each of our four client-facing divisions delivered 
positive underlying momentum. Profits from the Core 
Business increased from £4.2 million in 2016 to £9.8 million 
this year reflecting an improvement in operating margin 
from 3.1% to 7.1%, paving the way towards our medium-term 
target of a 15% operating margin. 
Strategy implementation
The strategy determined in early 2015 required considerable 
preparatory work but I am pleased to be able to report that 
this is now largely in place and the benefits to both clients 
and shareholders are materialising. Our four client-facing 
divisions provide a full service, holistic wealth management 
offering, from discretionary fund management to simple 
execution, with financial planning advice as needed. 
We remain an investment-led firm and the delivery of 
discretionary fund management by empowered investment 
professionals is at the heart of our offering. Indeed, we are 
experiencing a steady trend in previously self-directed 
clients seeking a discretionary service instead.

Chief Executive Officer
Charles Stanley’s transformation 
programme is on track. As previously 
communicated, our aim is to push 
our business into the first quartile for 
client satisfaction, staff engagement 
and stock market rating by 2020. 
We have made good progress during 
the 2017 financial year and I am 
confident that we will hit our targets 
and become the UK’s leading wealth 
manager within three years.

The year ahead
The benefits of the strategy have started to crystallise and 
we remain confident that this momentum will be maintained. 
Indeed, with a renewed focus on reaching new clients and 
serving our existing clients more comprehensively, we expect 
an acceleration in new business revenues. The underlying 
commercial models in each of our four client-facing divisions 
have been re-engineered to ensure profitable delivery and to 
underpin the operational gearing which, over time, will 
support margin growth. Growing revenues and building 
operational efficiency will now be the central focus.
Recourse to technology in divisions such as Charles Stanley 
Direct allows the Group to serve a broader range of client 
needs, often at an earlier stage in our clients’ lifetime 
financial journeys. While profound digital disruption is not 
yet on the horizon, it is important to ensure that our technology 
platforms permit a timely and flexible response to evolving 
client needs. We intend to foster such preparedness whilst 
continuing to provide first-class advice to our clients.
Our Chairman, Sir David Howard, referred to the new 
governance framework and this will become a vital enabler, 
particularly given the new wave of regulatory requirements 
for which implementation is under way. We are well prepared.
Continuing successful delivery of our strategy moves 
the Group closer to the 2020 vision of becoming the UK’s 
leading wealth manager as measured by the quantitative 
scores for relative client satisfaction, staff engagement 
and stock market rating. Delivery will ensure that all our 
stakeholders are appropriately served and we look forward 
to the new financial year with growing confidence.
