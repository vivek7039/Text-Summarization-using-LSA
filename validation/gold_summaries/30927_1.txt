Taking stock 
When we listed in 2015 we 
said there were supportive 
market fundamentals and 
opportunities for Ibstock.
We have delivered. 
It has taken over £100m 
of planned investment 
in infrastructure, brand, 
innovation and people.
We’ve achieved a lot in 
three years and there’s 
more to come.
Wayne Sheppard,  
Chief Executive Officer
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 08 Ibstock plc Having announced my intention to retire in 
2018, it is with mixed emotions that I write 
my last CEO statement. I am, however, 
delighted to be able to report significant 
headway in each area of the Group’s 
strategy during 2017 , continuing the strong 
progress made since the business listed in 
October 2015.
The Group has grown revenue and 
adjusted EBITDA in both 2016 and during 
the year ended 31 December 2017 , with 
revenue growth of 4% and adjusted 
EBITDA growth of 7% in the current year.
The Group’s statutory results are 
discussed in the Financial Review on 
pages 38 to 42.
This year’s Annual Report focuses on the 
Group’s strategic progress since our listing 
and some of the individuals who have 
enabled this. Our strategic achievements 
in the areas of Health and Safety (“H&S”), 
investment and innovation are described 
below and within our Strategy section on 
pages 22 and 23. 
Succession planning has always been 
a high priority for us, including my own, 
as I will reach the age of 60 in 2019. 
Having considered the best time for my 
own succession, I advised the Board that 
ideally I would like 2018 to be my last year 
as CEO with the third anniversary of the 
IPO coming in October 2018. I am 
delighted that Joe Hudson joined Ibstock 
in early 2018 to allow a thorough handover 
of responsibilities (see inset on page 14).
Safety
A business which looks after its employees 
is a business that thrives and a key element 
is ensuring the well-being of our team. 
H&S continues to be our highest priority 
and we continually work to drive improved 
performance in this area as we have done 
for many years. Ibstock Brick was one of 
the founding members of the Ceramic 
Industry Health and Safety Pledge in 2001 
as part of an industry-wide commitment 
to engage in a process of continuous 
improvement in health and safety. 
The initiative is managed by the British 
Ceramic Confederation (BCC) and has 
won significant recognition from the 
UK Government’s Health and Safety 
Executive (HSE) and is seen as a model 
for other industries.
I am pleased to report that our revised 
measure of all lost time accidents (LTA) – 
employees and those working on our 
sites, such as contractors, reduced from 
20 to 18 during the year ended 
31 December 2017 . This 10% reduction 
marked a significant year-on-year 
improvement. This is particularly pleasing 
as the measure includes the many 
contractors on our sites engaged with the 
construction of our major projects during 
the year such as the new brick factory and 
the blue brick kiln. At times this amounted 
to several hundred additional people on 
our sites every day.
We continue to work hard in this aspect of 
our business as we strive to achieve world 
class performance and drive LTAs to zero.
Ibstock has driven the development of 
intelligent mobile plant to operate on our 
sites to protect our employees and 
visitors. These fork lift and clamp trucks 
are able to detect objects behind the 
truck when reversing and apply brakes 
automatically, thus avoiding a collision and 
making reversing operations much safer. 
As well as the increased safety of our 
employees, contractors and visitors, 
there is an added benefit to the Group 
of reduced stock damage and building 
maintenance. This technology was 
co-developed with mobile plant supplier 
partners and is now available across the 
industry as a standard option; however it 
has been mandatory for all new plant in 
Ibstock for several years.
I believe this is an example of Ibstock 
continually pushing the boundaries to 
protect our employees.
For 2017 we introduced the reporting 
of “causes for concern” (CFC) by all 
employees to identify and correct hazards 
before an accident occurs. We have 
targeted two reports per person per year 
to increase awareness in the working 
environment. During the year, over 3,500 
CFCs were reported and corrected and 
whilst increasing awareness, this initiative 
must have also reduced the potential for 
accidents to occur. I believe this is 
reflected in our 2017 LTA performance.
Invest
At the time of the Group’s initial public 
offering (IPO), we advised that we believed 
the fundamentals underpinning growth in 
our UK markets looked robust and that we 
would invest in our businesses to support 
growth and cost efficiency. We have 
subsequently invested over £100 million 
and delivered the major projects identified 
and more.
Our new roof tile line at Leighton Buzzard 
commenced commissioning in late 2016 
and has improved its performance during 
2017 . Take-up of these innovative new tiles 
has been good with the major developers 
who have appreciated this new capacity 
coming to the market at a time of need. 
We have not said much publicly about 
an investment in our Supreme Concrete 
Company to further automate the 
production of general cast concrete 
products. Our first machine to a bespoke 
design was commissioned in 2017 and 
has been very successful in increasing 
productivity, reducing manpower 
requirements and eliminating manual 
handling. We intend to invest in further 
machines over the coming years. 
Construction of our new Leicester brick 
factory is complete and we commenced 
making bricks and commissioning towards 
the end of the year. Early in 2018 the first fired 
bricks exited the kiln ready for despatch 
to customers. This has been a massive 
project to deliver and I am pleased that we 
achieved it with only one lost time accident 
over the entire two-year build programme 
involving several million man hours. 
As you will see from my remarks in the 
Business Review section (see pages 16 
and 17), the timing for our investment in 
additional brick capacity has been superb. 
We have designed an excellent range of 
bricks that we will progressively prove and 
commission the new factory as 2018 
progresses. The range has been designed 
to target imports and the factory has also 
been designed to be exceptionally flexible 
and make a very broad range of types and 
styles of brick.
We said 
We would build a strong 
business for the future.
And here is how we did 
this year.

at the Dorket Head factory and won 
the company ‘Apprentice of the Year’ 
award that year.
Having transferred to the new factory 
in Leicester as part of the project 
team in early 2016 Tom has gone on 
to be promoted to Technical Manager 
in November 2017.
We said 
We believed there was a 
structural imbalance between 
brick demand and supply in 
the UK.
And we invested in our new soft 
mud brick factory in Leicester, 
which will have the capacity to 
produce an extra 100m bricks 
per year.

Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information Innovate
Innovation continues to be a priority 
for all businesses within the Group. 
By continually seeking to improve our 
customer service and introducing new 
products to our ranges, we can respond 
to our current customer or business 
needs, but also anticipate future trends. 
Our innovation objectives will increase the 
Group’s efficiency and continue to support 
increased profitability.
As mentioned above, two of the biggest 
innovations are supported by our major 
investments in the new SL8 and PAN8 
roof tiles and the new brick factory to 
make a range of new and exciting bricks. 
Indeed, our new brick factory includes 
some significant innovations in the clay 
brick manufacturing process, such as 
a tunnel dryer for soft mud bricks.
Glen-Gery, our US brick subsidiary, 
has developed two new ranges of 
laminate stone products to complement 
our brick ranges. These products are the 
new “StoneFit” system and “Creative 
Mines” range of laminated stone and will 
increase our offering in the residential 
cladding market. 
Supreme Concrete has developed a new 
range of fencing products allowing the 
fencing range to be repositioned at various 
price points.
The Ibstock Kevington components 
business has developed a brick clad 
underslung soffit – a brick clad 
component for non-residential buildings 
called “Nexus” that fully came to market 
in 2017 and has been received as a very 
innovative new product by architects and 
specifiers alike.
Amongst our targets for the future are to 
ensure our brick ranges continue to satisfy 
traditional RMI markets and that we develop 
new ranges to meet the more fashionable 
non-residential and developer markets.
Brexit
I am regularly asked about the impact of 
the UK’s withdrawal from the European 
Union (“Brexit”) upon our business. The 
Group exports a very small proportion of 
its products, but where it does, mainly to 
Ireland, the devaluation of Sterling has 
made our products better value for our 
customers. Clearly the converse is true for 
imports with imported brick from northern 
Europe having become less profitable or 
competitive for the exporters which is also 
helpful to our business. However, certain 
imported raw materials, such as 
reinforcement steel, have become more 
expensive although this input cost impact 
is relatively small in scale, as we own 
our primary raw material; clay. Skilled 
employee availability, especially for skilled 
maintenance personnel is a concern. 
However, our growing apprentice 
programme helps to mitigate any potential 
adverse impact.
In March 2016, we also mentioned an 
investment at our Ravenhead wire cut 
brick factory to automate our de-hacking 
and packaging operations and this 
was commissioned on time and cost 
during 2016.
Since our IPO we announced an £8 million 
investment to replace the blue brick kiln at 
our Lodge Lane plant. This project was 
completed in 2017 and is at an advanced 
stage of commissioning with blue bricks 
being produced to meet customer demand. 
These investments are very exciting but 
Ibstock is a long-term legacy business and 
we have also continued to invest in the 
Group’s long-term future in a number 
of ways: 
We have acquired substantial additional 
clay reserves at two of our sites to support 
the continued development of the business 
and also maintained planning permission 
for an additional concrete products factory 
at one of our sites to support further 
strategic growth when required. 
To prepare for the future we have 
continued to invest in our people – good 
examples being our continuing apprentice 
programme with 34 apprentices under 
training and the roll out of training 
initiatives to our wider workforce 
amounting to over 9,000 training days 
over the year. Additionally, several senior 
appointments were made that reinforce 
the strength and depth in the Company 
teams, and the formation in 2017 of the 
Group Executive Committee (see overleaf) 
positions us well for the future.
We have commenced a project to 
implement the JD Edwards ERP system 
into Supreme Concrete. Once implemented, 
all UK businesses will be on a common IT 
platform allowing a common Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM) system 
to be implemented to support the 
extraction of further commercial synergies 
from the UK businesses in the future.
We continue to work to redeploy our 
assets by enhancing the value of our 
surplus land. These activities have resulted 
in considerable success over the past 
decade or more by improving the planning 
status of surplus land assets. Recent 
activity is likely to lead to significant 
additional cash flows and profits during 
2018 and 2019. These cash flows can 
then be deployed to the benefit of the 
Company and its shareholders.
In 2018 our investment objective is to 
deliver fully the benefits of the major 
projects undertaken to date. We expect 
significantly lower capital expenditure over 
the next two years, whilst over this time 
we will be planning and developing for the 
next potential capacity expansion and 
improvement projects.
Wayne Sheppard welcomes our 
new Chief Executive designate
 
I am delighted that Joe Hudson joined 
Ibstock in early 2018. Joe has very 
relevant experience in building materials, 
most recently with Lafarge Holcim where 
he was responsible for their UK cement, 
Bradstone paving and concrete block 
businesses. With experience of 
manufacturing with high capital cost plant 
and the sale of aesthetic masonry and 
commodity concrete building products, 
he is ideally experienced to be the next 
CEO of Ibstock plc.

Chief Executive’s statement continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Ibstock plc Summary
Supported by strong market 
fundamentals, Ibstock continues to follow 
a growth strategy underpinned by organic 
growth opportunities in UK clay and 
concrete products. We continue to look for 
value-enhancing acquisitions, particularly 
those that would provide new platforms 
for growth and enhance our portfolio of 
principally residential building products. 
In the US, the brick industry continues to 
operate at low levels of capacity utilisation 
resulting in lower returns than we enjoy in 
the UK. Against this backdrop, we 
continue to consider all options and 
opportunities for our business.
We will shortly complete our CEO 
succession plan with the business in a 
good position. Profit performance and 
cash generation are strong and continue 
to improve. Debt levels are at a 1x 
adjusted EBITDA after the substantial 
investments made since our IPO – the full 
benefits of which are still to come. 
The UK pension scheme has been well 
managed and this has allowed the 
Company to enter into discussions with 
the Trustees to accelerate the de-risking 
strategy already in place. Importantly, 
we have a highly experienced Group 
Executive Committee to provide continuity, 
manage the business, provide succession 
and support my successor. 
We have a clear strategy and have 
outlined our capital allocation priorities, 
which are set out in the Financial Review. 
Given our robust balance sheet and 
strong cash generation, in the absence of 
any significant value enhancing acquisitions 
and with continuing supportive markets, 
the Board currently expects to introduce 
a supplementary dividend alongside the 
interim dividend in 2018.
Finally I should like to thank all of my 
Ibstock colleagues for their hard work and 
commitment over many years that has 
been instrumental in the Group’s strong 
performance. It has been a pleasure to 
work with them all and I will miss them 
greatly. With their undoubted continued 
support for my successor, the further 
progression of the strategy we have 
deployed and with the investments we 
have made, we have every reason to look 
to the future with confidence.
