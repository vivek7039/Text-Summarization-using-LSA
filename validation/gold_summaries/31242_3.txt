Performance Review
The performance for the year to end December 2017 was +18.5%, out-performing the 
benchmark FTSE All Share Index by 5.4%. 
One of the key features of the Investment Management Agreement with Phoenix 
is that they earn no management fees other than an annual performance fee, equal 
to one third of NAV per share total returns in excess of the total return of the FTSE 
All-Share Index. This fee is subject to claw back and a high water mark and is capped 
at 4% of NAV p.a. in the case of an absolute increase in NAV per share; and 2% in the 
case of a decrease but with outperformance compared with the FTSE All-Share.
Despite Aurora’s strong outperformance of the Index in 2017 , no performance 
fee was earned by Phoenix. The NAV had lagged the Index in 2016 and, as the 
performance fee is calculated on a cumulative basis, it can only be earned once the 
lag has been caught-up. At the year-end, the “lag” had reduced to just under 5%, after 
which a performance fee will be earned for subsequent outperformance.
The share price of Aurora traded at a premium to NAV for substantially all of the 
period in question. The average premium for the year was 1 .5%, which was helpful in 
attracting new investors and to increase the size of the Company through the issuance 
of new shares. Accordingly our aim is for the shares to continue to trade at a small 
premium to NAV and to grow the Company further, as discussed below. 
Two Years of Phoenix Management
2017 was the second full year of Phoenix management, which began with their being 
appointed Investment Manager in January 2016. Aurora is managed under the same 
investment strategy as Phoenix’s long standing, open-ended fund, the Phoenix UK 
Fund. Since its inception in 1998 that fund has delivered, net of fees, annualised 
returns of 10% compared with 5.5% for the FTSE All-Share Index.
I thought it might be useful to add some observations on our experience over the 
last few years of the investment management process and practices of Phoenix. Three 
key words stand out in my experience: patience, discipline and focus. There’s a lot of 
talk about patient capital but it seems to me that the root of long term outperformance 
is the willingness to accept some periods of underperformance followed by (hopefully 
more significant) periods of outperformance based on core investment principles. 
The key though are those investment principles that guide the stock selection. Get 
them right, wait to find the right business at the right price – as evidenced by the 
recent purchase of Dignity after many years of patient research and monitoring – and 
hopefully you’ll reap a long-term reward. 
Discipline I think goes with patience. It’s about waiting to buy the right stock but 
also it’s about using thorough processes, checklists and research gathering processes 
to find the right stock. Phoenix build up the required knowledge by studying the 
relevant industries and companies in detail – a learning process which can take several 
years. When it comes to price, Phoenix are disciplined in only paying up to half of what 
they believe the business is worth. 
The last word I mentioned was focus. In the case of Phoenix this involves knowing 
some sectors really very well. That requires that patience and discipline but it also 
requires a willingness to shut out other ideas and stay focused on what you know – 
your circle of competence. That means for instance some focus on consumer stocks 
such as Sports Direct, where Phoenix have been patient and successful – in terms of 
investment returns. Alternatively, it could mean a focus on housebuilding companies 
or, indeed, specialist hobby brands – a niche within the consumer space arguably – 
which involves outfits such as Hornby or latterly Stanley Gibbons. 
There is though one side effect of what we think as the three virtues of patience, 
discipline and focus – sometimes there aren’t many new portfolio additions. This 
means turnover can and has been low.

 Annual Report Strategic Report 7
The rarity of suitable investment candidates, combined with the time-consuming 
nature of the investment process, inevitably results in a concentrated portfolio, 
typically of a maximum of between 15 and 20 investments. 
I would add a final parting observation. Patience, discipline and focus can also 
be applied not only to the investment process but also the way the Company is 
developed over time and marketed to a wider audience. Phoenix are committed to 
growing the size of the Company and have over the last few years attracted what 
we would like to believe are high quality, patient investors from wealth managers, 
family offices and university endowments. Within the retail space this is echoed 
by the determination of the Company to reach a wider private investor audience, 
a development we hope will be accelerated with the appointment by Phoenix of 
Frostrow, as covered later, to assist in marketing Aurora to a national audience. Again, 
these all demonstrate a commitment to the long term, to building the Company and 
creating real value for our shareholders. 
Investment Policy 
At this year’s AGM, shareholders will be asked to vote on a resolution to amend 
Aurora’s Investment Policy. The Existing Investment Policy limits the scope of 
investment to UK listed equities and cash. The changes, which have been proposed 
by Phoenix and carefully considered by the Aurora Board, will broaden the scope 
to enable investment in companies listed outside the UK (limited to 20% of assets 
at cost price) and unlisted securities (limited to 10% of gross assets at cost price). 
From the Board’s discussions with Phoenix, it is clear that the proposed amendments 
do not represent a shift in Phoenix’s investment strategy and objectives. Rather, they 
will enable Phoenix to implement more effectively their well-established investment 
philosophy. The ability to hold 10% of gross assets at cost price, in unlisted securities 
is also necessary to participate in the Stanley Gibbons investment, which Phoenix 
have recently undertaken. Phoenix have assured the Board that they will be cautious 
in making use of the expanded remit and the Board recommends that shareholders 
approve the proposed changes. 
Growth of the Company 
Growing the Company remains a key objective of the Board. A new prospectus was 
published during the year to enable the continued issuance of new shares, both via 
small “tap-issues” and larger, more structured “Placings” . A total of 12,679,198 new 
shares were issued in 2017 , bringing the total number of shares issued during the era 
of Phoenix management to 28,080,114. Consequently, the market capitalisation of the 
Company, which had been £51 .69m in January 2017 , finished the year at £88.34m. 
After the year-end, in January 2018, Phoenix announced the appointment of 
Frostrow Capital to assist achieving an increase in the size of the Company by raising 
the profile of Aurora, with potential investors across the UK. This appointment will 
be paid for, at their suggestion, by Phoenix and therefore minimise the cost to 
shareholders. Frostrow has an excellent reputation built on the provision of similar 
services to a select number of other investment trusts.
In last year’s statement I mentioned our objective was to increase the size of 
Aurora to £100m. At the time of writing, the market cap has reached £92.63m and it 
seems appropriate to update the objective. Having spoken with Phoenix, who have 
considered the investment opportunities available to them, our new objective is now 
to increase the size of Aurora to £200m over the next two to three years. As well as 
finding sufficient opportunities to invest new money, it is essential that the Company 
attracts new shareholders with a long-term focus who understand and respect the 
Phoenix investment strategy. Job No: 34360 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Level: 0 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA
