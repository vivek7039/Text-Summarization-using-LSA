major geographic territories – the UK, US  
and Australasia – a stronger balance sheet  
and a large and diversified portfolio of

MIKE HUMPHREY CHAIRMAN
HIGHLIGHTS
I am pleased to report a year of substantial 
progress at IP Group in 2017. The underlying 
business performed well with some notable 
commercial progress within the portfolio while at 
a corporate level, IP Group completed a number 
of individually significant strategic transactions. 
The Group now has operations in three major 
geographic territories – the UK, US and Australasia 
– a stronger balance sheet and a large and 
diversified portfolio of exciting opportunities.
Corporate transactions
2017 was a busy period in terms of corporate 
transactions for the Group. In June, the Group 
formally launched an all-share offer for Touchstone 
Innovations plc, a company which creates, builds 
and invests in technology companies and licensing 
opportunities developed from scientific research 
from the ‘Golden Triangle’, the geographical 
region broadly bounded by London, Cambridge 
and Oxford. The combination gives us critical 
mass, a better-balanced portfolio and additional 
partnerships. The transaction was declared 
wholly unconditional in October and Touchstone’s 
portfolio, people and operations have been 
integrated into the Group.
In May, IP Group announced a £181.0m (net) 
capital raise and welcomed new shareholders from 
Australia, China, Singapore and the UK. The funding 
allows the Group to accelerate growth by investing 
in new and existing portfolio companies, build on 
its pool of valued scientific and commercial talent, 
and attract further investors and co-investment 
partners. It also furthers the transformation 
underway by expanding the Group’s share register 
and by further extending its model into Australasia.

In February, we completed the acquisition of Parkwalk 
Advisors Ltd. that was announced in December 
2016. Founded in 2009, Parkwalk is the UK’s leading 
university spin-out focused EIS fund manager. We are 
delighted to have the team on board and Parkwalk 
recorded a net contribution of £1.6m for the period 
since acquisition, while co-investing in six IP Group 
portfolio companies.
Expansion into Australasia
IP Group was also delighted to announce a landmark 
agreement with Australasia’s leading universities 
in 2017, which will see at least A$200m invested 
in finding and developing companies involved 
in disruptive innovation. The commercialisation 
agreements, the first of their type in Australasia, 
were signed with nine universities: the University of 
Adelaide, Australian National University, the University 
of Melbourne, Monash University, UNSW Sydney, the 
University of Queensland, the University of Sydney 
and the University of Western Australia in Australia, 
and the University of Auckland in New Zealand. The 
Group committed to invest at least A$200m over 
a 10-year period to fund investments in spin-out 
companies based on the intellectual property (IP) 
developed by academics at the nine universities, 
generated from research in areas such  
as digital medicine, new medical therapies and 
quantum computing.
Key portfolio events
Turning to the portfolio, I would draw out a few 
highlights. During the year, Diurnal received positive 
CHMP opinion for its Alkindi® product, followed by 
market authorisation in February 2018, paving the 
way for Diurnal to become the first IP Group company 
to launch a new therapeutic in Europe, which is 
anticipated in Q2 2018. Istesso commenced Phase 
2a clinical trials for its lead MBS2320 programme 
in Rheumatoid Arthritis and expanded its R&D 
collaboration with Janssen. Autifony Therapeutics 
Ltd, a Touchstone Innovations company, announced 
it had signed a €627.5m collaboration agreement 
with Boehringer Ingelheim. And finally, once again, 
Oxford Nanopore has shown significant commercial 
progress during the period, with the company 
recently announcing that 2017 order intake had 
increased approximately three-fold to $25.3m, with 
an expectation for a similar level of growth in 2018, 
and a number of product developments, including the 
launch of the GridION x5. 
In addition, our portfolio companies continue 
to attract significant external funding, raising 
approximately £315m of new capital this year. 
Significant fund raisings included AIM-quoted Tissue 
Regenix Group plc (£40m), Actual Experience 
plc (£17.5m) and, among the private companies, 
Ultrahaptics Ltd (£17.9m) and Creavo Medical 
Technologies (£13.4m).
MAY 2017 OCTOBER 2017
IPG announced the result of £181m (net) 
 capital raising with new shareholders from  
Australia, China, Singapore and the UK, 
and the launch of IP2IPO Australia with

Financial performance
In terms of financial performance, the Group 
continues to build on its strong track record. In 2017, 
IP Group’s portfolio delivered a solid performance 
with net assets excluding goodwill and intangibles 
(“Hard NAV”) totalling £1,326.2m (2016: £706.5m) 
with the fair value of the portfolio increasing to 
£1,130.6m (2016: £614.0m) and resulting in a reported 
profit of £53.4m (2016: £14.8m loss). The Group 
ended the year with gross cash and deposits of 
£326.3m (2016: £112.3m). I must stress however that 
our business model remains long term in nature and 
while our objective is to generate long term value 
for stakeholders, portfolio company valuations and 
therefore our results can and do fluctuate from year 
to year.
Changes to the Board
At Board level, there have been two changes this year. 
In October, we were delighted to welcome Professor 
David Begg as a non-executive director following the 
acquisition of Touchstone Innovations plc, where he 
was a non-executive director. Professor Begg joined 
Touchstone Innovations plc from Imperial College 
London, where he was Professor of Economics and 
Principal of the Business School from 2003 until 2012. 
He also acted as Vice Provost for Research for the 
College. During his earlier career, he held a number of 
distinguished advisory and academic appointments, 
including Professor of Economics at Birkbeck College, 
Visiting Fellow at the Reserve Bank of Australia, 
and Visiting Professor at M.I.T and at INSEAD, and 
Economic Policy Advisor in the Bank of England.
Doug Liversidge, CBE, retired from his position as 
a non-executive director of the Company at the 
end of 2017. Mr Liversidge served on the Board in a 
non-executive capacity since March 2014 following 
IP Group’s acquisition of Fusion IP plc, where he was 
Chairman. He was also the Group’s Senior Independent 
Director, a role that Professor Begg agreed to take on 
from the beginning of 2018. Mr Liversidge made an 
important contribution to the Group’s growth and I 
would like to thank him for his commitment and wise 
counsel over the past four years.
Summary
The business made substantial progress in 2017, 
leaving IP Group well positioned for 2018 and beyond. 
I would like to welcome all our new colleagues and 
partners to the Group this year and to thank staff, 
academic partners and portfolio companies for 
their commitment and contribution to this positive 
performance. As ever, I would also like to extend 
the Board’s thanks to all our stakeholders for their 
continued support without whom none of this would 
be possible. With a larger and maturing portfolio  
and an expanded pipeline of opportunities around  
the world, we look to the rest of the year with 
continued confidence.

Market
The purpose of IP Group is to evolve great ideas  
into world-changing businesses.
IP Group is a leading intellectual property 
commercialisation company which focuses on 
evolving great ideas, mainly from its partner 
universities, into world-changing businesses. 
The Group has pioneered a unique approach to 
developing these ideas and the resulting businesses 
by providing access to business building expertise, 
capital (through its 100%-owned FCA-authorised 
subsidiaries IP Capital and Parkwalk Advisors), 
networks, recruitment and business support.
The Directors consider that the Group is operating 
and competing in two major areas. Firstly, the Group 
competes for access to great ideas with significant 
commercial potential. The Group primarily sources 
these ideas from a network of world-leading academic 
research institutions, frequently those with which it 
has a long-term partnership arrangement. Secondly, 
the Group competes for capital to develop these great 
ideas into viable businesses against other investment 
opportunities. While the market for capital is very 
broad and deep, the Group’s companies are typically 
seeking earlier-stage and development risk capital.
Challenges facing the developed 
and developing world today
One of IP Group’s core beliefs is that overcoming 
many of the world’s common problems will require 
multiple scientific solutions. The common challenges 
facing the developed and developing world include 
issues such as ageing population, climate change, 
resource scarcity, energy availability and storage, 
rapid urbanisation, health challenges and increasing 
digitisation. Historically, many of the solutions to these 
global problems have come from fundamental R&D 
carried out in the world’s leading research universities 
and institutions. IP Group believes that this will 
continue to be the case and therefore the Directors 
feel the Group’s work, of helping commercialise 
cutting-edge science, is of such importance.
The search for solutions
IP Group partners with major leading research 
institutions in countries where research is produced. 
The Group has three areas of geographic focus; 
the UK, the US and our recently formed business 
in Australasia. In total, the Group has access to 
R&D emanating from 32 universities or research 
institutions around the world comprising 18 in the UK, 
5 in the US and 9 in Australia/New Zealand. IP Group 
has access to intellectual property from universities 
whose academic staff have published 16.8% of the 
world’s Top Research. The Directors therefore believe 
the Group is the international market leader in the 
emerging university IP commercialisation sector.
The Group’s core business remains the UK, which 
has been further reinforced by the acquisition of 
Touchstone Innovations plc. IP Group does, however, 
continually assess potential opportunities in other 
territories that satisfy its criteria including long-term 
partnerships with leading research institutions and 
good access to both capital and entrepreneurial talent.
Economic backdrop
The overall economic backdrop has a significant 
bearing on the Group’s ability to pursue its strategic 
objectives. In the shorter term, financial market 
volatility and investor risk appetite impacts access to 
capital for the development of spin-out companies, 
which in turn, can affect the likelihood of achieving 
exits and can influence the periodic valuations of 
holdings in portfolio companies. Over the longer-term, 
Government spending on fundamental R&D as well as 
policy support towards the commercialisation of IP are 
key areas affecting the Group’s business model.

Market CONTINUED
In this context, these are uncertain times both 
economically and politically, particularly following 
events including the UK’s vote to leave the European 
Union and the economic policy changes made, and 
under consideration, in the US. Global economic 
activity, however, has been strengthening with the 
International Monetary Fund forecasting a global 
growth rate for 2018 of 3.9%. The forecast for strong 
growth is a result of upward revisions to the EU and for 
many parts of Asia, though it also includes downward 
revisions for both the US and UK. While the ongoing 
European Union exit negotiations may have an impact 
on the Group’s business, IP Group is actively mitigating 
this through diversification to both research and 
capital. The Group has a burgeoning business in the 
US and, in 2017, established operations in Australasia. 
In addition, the Group has taken steps to broaden its 
shareholder register and now counts several large 
global investors among its shareholder base.
Global research landscape
Globally, the US remains the world’s largest R&D 
investor with nearly $463bn of gross domestic R&D 
expenditures in 2015 according to the OECD. This 
exceeded by almost one-quarter the amount of 
R&D performed in the People’s Republic of China 
($377m), the second-largest performer, which is just 
over the combined level of the EU28 area ($346m). 
However, concerns remain that a potential decline 
in government funding of science and technology 
research in some countries could pose a threat to 
innovation. The OECD Science, Technology and 
Innovation Outlook 2016, published in December 
2016, noted expenditure on R&D by universities 
and public research institutes in OECD countries 
began flattening out in 2010 following three decades 
of growth as other policy priorities, such as state 
pensions, health and social care, absorbed a growing 
share of public resources.
UK landscape
In the UK, where IP Group is predominantly based 
and where it has partnerships with 18 leading UK 
universities including access to innovation from  
both the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,  
the Government has announced a package of 
measures designed to support innovation and drive 
economic growth.
The Government’s £4.7bn stimulus package for 
science and innovation was increased in the Autumn 
Statement 2016. The Government stated that this will 
grow by a further £2.3bn of additional spending in 
2021-22, taking total direct R&D spending to £12.5bn 
per annum by 2021-22.
Stressing that research and development is a 
key driver of economic growth and a vital part 
of the Government’s ‘Industrial Strategy’, the UK 
Government also announced that it would review 
the tax environment for R&D to ensure the system is 
strongly pro-innovation to make the UK an even more 
competitive place to carry out R&D. 
The UK Government also concluded its review 
of long term investment into British firms. The 
‘Patient Capital’ review, led by the Treasury, looked 
at how to remove the obstacles to getting long 
term investment into innovative firms. The results 
from the consultation with leading industry figures 
included references to the significant need for patient 
capital and various ways to increase government 
support, such as through public/private partnerships 
and tax incentives. It is also worth noting that the 
government has recently extended the applicability of 
its Enterprise Investment Scheme in the 2017 Autumn 
budget, including an increase to the upper annual 
limit of funding that each company can take.
Competitive landscape
The number of companies and organisations seeking 
to commercialise intellectual property, and/or provide 
capital to spin-out companies from universities and 
research-intensive institutions in the UK has increased 
in recent years. Further, the Group continues to face 
the risk of competition in new geographies in which it 
seeks to operate.
When approaching new opportunities, potential 
funders, including the Group, will often act in 
a collaborative manner through syndication of 
investment. However, there are also occasions when 
IP Group may need to participate in a competitive 
process to obtain an interest in a particular 
technology.

IP GROUP’S KEY DIFFERENTIATORS
• Operations in three core geographic hubs:  
UK, US and Australasia
• Breadth of partnerships with leading research institutions, 
giving access to 16.8% of the world’s T op Research
• T echnology transfer capability to identify disruptive IP and to 
enable its transfer from research lab to commercial entity 
• Business-building expertise, including executive search, 
administrative support, capital sourcing and innovative 
portfolio board and CEO programmes
• “Patient capital” approach, enabling the provision  
of funding from ‘cradle to maturity’ unconstrained by 
artificiality of fixed life funds
• International shareholder and co-investor network
• Strong track record built over 15+ years
The Group and its portfolio companies regularly 
compete with a range of technology, and other, 
businesses when seeking capital for the development 
of their business models. The competition for capital, 
and for opportunities on occasion, can come from a 
wide variety of entities, including:
 y specialist traditional venture capital investors;
 y large private institutional investors;
 y privately managed schemes based on government 
funding;
 y private individuals, both acting individually or 
collectively as groups such as business angel 
networks, crowdfunding platforms or through 
beneficial tax mechanisms such as SEIS, EIS and 
VCTs in the UK;
 y direct public funding, for example the EU level 
JEREMIE fund and other national and local 
schemes; and
 y universities and research-intensive institutions 
seeking to raise private sector funding 
themselves to support their in-house technology 
commercialisation activities.
IP Group’s approach to building businesses is one of 
the ways in which it differentiates itself from more 
traditional venture funds. The Group actively supports 
the development of its portfolio companies through 
access to early-stage business-building expertise, 
interim executive support, technical and commercial 
networks and senior team recruitment and 
development in addition to the provision of capital.
In addition, the Group provides operational, legal, 
business and company secretarial support to its 
companies, with a view to minimising the most 
common administrative factors that can contribute 
to early-stage company failure. The Group has also 
successfully carried out several innovative programmes 
to accelerate company growth, including working with 
CEOs and company boards to improve performance.
In the UK, the Group also considers tax-advantaged 
Enterprise Investment Scheme (‘EIS’) funds to be an 
increasingly important source of financing for early-
stage technology companies and has seen a strong 
operating performance from its new subsidiary, 
Parkwalk, the UK’s largest EIS growth fund manager 
focused on university spin-outs, which has strong 
links to leading institutional wealth managers and 
university partners.
