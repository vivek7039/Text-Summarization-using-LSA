 Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Spirent thrives on the challenges of 
helping our customers to manage 
the complexity of their networks 
and services while they seek to 
dramatically reduce costs. 
I took on the role of Chairman after the 
AGM in May 2017. In my time on the Board 
I have been impressed by our industry 
leading technology and believe that we 
have a compelling value proposition for 
our customers. I have been even more 
impressed by the calibre and commitment 
of our people who are truly passionate 
about delivering value for our customers 
and shareholders. It is thanks to them 
that Spirent is so well respected in the 
industries it serves.
The Board believes that the opportunity to 
bridge across from the laboratory to live 
operations represents a major opportunity 
for Spirent. In order to realise our full 
potential we require a relentless focus 
on our go to market strategy, excellent 
customer service and our market leading 
products and solutions.
In the last few years, Spirent has seen a 
huge amount of change in its markets, with 
the polarisation of the smartphone industry, 
the consolidation of major network 
equipment manufacturers and the sudden 
growth by Asian equipment suppliers. At 
the same time, it was necessary to sustain 
high investment levels in order to realign 
the business for these market changes.

In 2016, the Group’s strategy was amended 
to focus on a few key strategic growth 
areas – cyber security, network assurance 
and new wireless services. This strategy 
has driven success in our Networks & 
Security business and has moved Lifecycle 
Service Assurance into a growth market 
for active test in network operations.
Throughout 2017, we saw the benefits of 
this tighter focus coming more fully to the 
fore with Spirent winning new business 
with major accounts in these key areas, 
despite a background of tighter cost 
management across the Group.
Performance in 2017
This new strategic focus led to a material 
improvement in our financial performance 
in 2017. Adjusted operating profit¹ grew by 
27 per cent to $58.9 million, an adjusted 
operating margin² on revenue of 13.0 per 
cent (2016 10.2 per cent). Revenue was 
slightly down by $3.1 million to $454.8 
million as we transition to these new 
focus areas.
Dividend
Following strong earnings growth and cash 
flow generation the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 2.40 cents, resulting in a 
total dividend for 2017 of 4.08 cents, a 5 per 
cent increase on 2016.
In addition, the Board is recommending a 
special dividend of 5.00 cents per share 
payable at the same time as the final 
dividend for 2017.

Board composition
The composition of the Board has changed 
significantly during 2017. Alex Walker, Tom 
Maxwell, Sue Swenson and Tom Lantzsch 
all stepped down in 2017 and I would like to 
thank them for their contributions. In early 
2018 we announced the appointment of 
Edgar Masri and Wendy Koh who will both 
bring deep technical knowledge in our 
served markets and extensive knowledge 
of dealing with our customer base. I am 
delighted they have agreed to join Spirent 
and I look forward to their contribution as 
the refreshed Board seek to help Spirent 
fully leverage its strengths.
Employees
I would like to thank our employees for 
helping to deliver increased profitability 
during the year and for their continued 
commitment to Spirent’s success. I am 
confident that with good execution against 
our priorities we will be able to realise 
Spirent’s potential for the benefit of all 
our stakeholders.
Outlook
The strong growth in our Application 
Security and Lifecycle Service Assurance 
businesses indicates that Spirent is headed 
in the right direction. The demand for 
high-speed Ethernet, particularly in 400G 
is expected to increase in the second half 
of 2018 and the market demand for security 
testing continues to be strong. I believe we 
have the strategy, technology, market 
opportunity and people to build on 2017’s 
successes in the years ahead.
