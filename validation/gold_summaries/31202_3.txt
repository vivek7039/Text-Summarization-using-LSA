 Group overview 
Financial results
Group revenue for the year was £2,070.6m, up 16% on 2016. 
Constant currency revenue was up 10%, primarily as a result of 
strong organic growth in the EMEA and APAC regions. Constant 
currency revenue in North America was down 4% year on year.
Underlying operating profit was £108.7m, an increase of 14% 
on the £95.3m generated in 2016. On a constant currency basis 
underlying operating profit was up 10%. The group underlying 
operating margin decreased from 5.4% to 5.2%, mainly due to 
lower margins in North America offset by improved profitability 
in EMEA. Pre‑tax Return on capital employed was stable at 15.1% 
(2016: 15.3%).
After taking account of £9.0m of amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, a £21.0m exceptional credit relating to a 
historical contract dispute and other non-underlying items, 
totalling a net £0.6m credit, the statutory operating profit was 
£121.3m (2016: £85.2m). Further details on non‑underlying items 
are given after the discussion of divisional results.
On an underlying basis, after net finance costs of £10.0m 
(2016: £10.2m), the profit before tax was £98.7m, up 16% on 
the previous year’s £85.1m. The underlying effective tax rate 
decreased from 35.0% in 2016 to 25.0% in 2017, mainly due to 
a £9.7m credit for the revaluation of US deferred tax liabilities 
following the recent US tax reforms.
Underlying earnings per share for the year were 102.2p 
(2016: 75.9p), an increase of 35%. On a constant currency 
basis, underlying earnings per share were up 30%.
The statutory profit before tax was up 50% at £110.6m 
(2016: £73.9m). After the statutory tax charge of £23.1m 
(2016: £25.9m), statutory profit after tax was £87.5m 
(2016: £48.0m) and statutory earnings per share were 121.0p, 
compared with 65.7p in 2016. 
Net debt at the year‑end was £229.5m (2016: £305.6m), 
representing 1.3x underlying EBITDA. The financial position 
of the group remains strong with undrawn borrowing facilities 
totalling £194.9m. The group continues to operate well within 
all of its financial covenants.
Cash generated from operations before non-underlying items 
was £136.1m, which represents 77% of EBITDA. This cash 
conversion rate is lower than previous years due to a £28.8m 
increase in working capital mainly as a result of the fourth 
quarter’s like‑for‑like revenue being 16% ahead of the same 
period in 2016.
The group continues to invest in growing and upgrading its 
equipment capability, with net capital expenditure of £74.5m 
in 2017, representing 1.1x depreciation.
Reflecting confidence in 
the group’s prospects, the 
Board recommends a 20% 
increase in the 2017 full 
year dividend.

Chairman’s statement Dividends
As noted above, the group’s underlying earnings per share 
increased by 35% from 75.9p in 2016 to 102.2p in 2017. About 
12p of this increase was due to the one‑off revaluation of US 
deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted US tax 
reforms. As previously announced, these changes are expected 
to reduce the group’s future effective tax rate from a percentage 
number in the mid-thirties to a number in the high-twenties, 
resulting in an ongoing earnings per share enhancement of 
between 5p and 10p per share each year.
As a result, and reflecting confidence in the group’s prospects, 
the Board has decided to rebase future dividends and accordingly 
recommends a 20% increase in the 2017 full year dividend to 
34.2p (2016: 28.5p). Full year 2017 dividend cover, before 
non‑underlying items, is 3.0x (2016: 2.7x).
This recommendation results in a proposed 2017 final dividend 
of 24.5p per share (2016: 19.25p per share), a 27% increase, to be 
paid on 22 June 2018 to shareholders on the register as at the 
close of business on 1 June 2018. 
The group intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy 
in the future.
Outlook
Our group order book of over £1bn gives us confidence as we 
start 2018. Most of our markets remain robust, bidding activity 
is at a healthy level and Keller is well positioned to address the 
market trends of urbanisation and infrastructure growth. Two 
significant loss‑making contracts in APAC in 2017 masked some 
good progress in the region and we continue to expect the 
division to return to profit in 2018. Overall, despite the completion 
of our excellent Caspian project, we expect 2018 to be another 
year of underlying progress, albeit with recent currency 
movements expected to result in translational headwinds 
on reported profits.
We are now seeing tangible results from a number of the 
strategic initiatives launched in the last two years. We are 
confident that a combination of these improvement initiatives, 
our technical leadership, wide product portfolio, broad branch 
network and operational strength will continue to drive our 
business forward.

Road Traffic Accident
We were devastated after a serious road accident in July 
of 2017, near Machadodorp, South Africa, left 18 of our 
Franki Africa employees dead and a number seriously injured. 
We provided care and support to those directly impacted and 
trauma counselling was made available for the families of the 
deceased and injured as well as for colleagues. Practical and 
financial arrangements were also made to assist families to 
travel from their homes around South Africa to the various 
hospitals where the deceased and injured had been taken. 
We also advanced financial support for funeral costs and other 
expenses and provided assistance to families and victims to 
claim benefits from pension and insurance providers. 
Memorial services were arranged and held in Machadodorp 
(jointly with our client, the Nkomati Mine), and at Franki Africa 
branches in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.
The hundreds of messages received from all over the world via 
a Keller-wide online condolence board have formed a memorial 
book. An online portal was also established for colleagues to 
make voluntary financial contributions to the victims’ families 
if they wished.
In recognition of those employees involved in the accident, 
Keller has recently established an educational trust to benefit 
the children of the deceased and injured, and partnered with 
Arrive Alive, a major road safety organisation, to improve road 
safety generally in South Africa. On behalf of the Directors, 
I again offer sincere condolences to all of those affected.
Employees
Over 10,000 employees continued to contribute to the group’s 
performance during 2017. On behalf of the Directors, I would 
like to recognise their hard work and thank them for their efforts.
