STRA TEGIC REPORT
Overview
FY2017 Performance
Gooch & Housego (“G&H”) benefited from positive market 
conditions and strong demand across its main sectors of 
industrials, aerospace & defence (“A&D”) and life sciences. 
Demand was particularly high for critical components used in 
microelectronic manufacturing and high reliability fibre couplers 
used in undersea cable networks. 
FY 2017 has been a ‘watershed’ year for the company, as we 
passed through the £100 million sales barrier for the first time. 
Revenue of £112.0 million represents year on year growth of 
30.2%, or on a constant currency basis 18.7%. Adjusted PBT, 
which is less affected by foreign exchange fluctuations due to 
the natural hedging within the business, was £16.1 million, 
equating to a year on year profit growth of 13.7%.
Strategically important investments in people, processes, systems 
and the latest capital equipment were made during the year, 
enabling us to address high levels of demand in FY2017 and 
provide an important platform for G&H’s future growth.
Strategic Goals
Considerable progress has been made towards our strategic 
goals of further diversification and moving up the value chain. 
A&D and life sciences both provide a counter balance to the 
exposure that the industrial laser sector has to the global 
economic cycle. These business areas have customer bases which 
include tier one A&D and medical diagnostic companies, who 
often prefer G&H to provide sub systems or systems rather than 
solely critical components, providing a strong impetus to move 
up the value chain. When coupled with the regulatory hurdles 
inherent in both A&D and life sciences, these markets provide 
a defensible business model with a high barrier to entry. 
Our aim is to establish a ‘critical mass’ of business in both the 
A&D and life science sectors.
This has in large part been achieved in A&D, which now represents 
31.1% of G&H’s FY2017 revenue (2016: 23.2%); this was made 
possible due to a combination of organic growth and by the 
three acquisitions made in FY 2016 and FY 2017. Life sciences 
has undergone good organic revenue growth, in particular with 
products utilising our optical coherence tomography technology 
and laser surgery, but the sector still needs further acquisitions 
to achieve the desired ‘critical mass’.
Sub systems and systems now represent 22.1% of our business 
(2016: 15.1%), with the growth again helped by the recent 
acquisitions, most notably Kent Periscopes and StingRay. Kent 
Periscopes, acquired in FY 2016, moved to a larger custom fitted 
facility in St. Asaph, North Wales, during FY 2017. This was 
funded in large part by the Welsh Government. As well as being 
required for the growth of the existing Kent Periscopes business 
the facility is earmarked to become a hub for assembly of sub 
systems and systems across the Group.
Acquisitions 
Strategic acquisitions remain an important part of G&H’s 
business model and in February 2017 we acquired StingRay 
Optics LLC (“StingRay”). 
StingRay is a USA based specialist designer and manufacturer of 
high performance optical and opto-mechanical sub systems for 
demanding defence and commercial applications. Their product 
range is focused on laboratory, ground based, airborne, 
unmanned aerial vehicles (‘UAVs”) and space applications for 
key US defence customers. Synergies include leveraging G&H’s 
greater reach through our global sales teams and our expertise 
in manufacturing infrared precision optics and specialist coatings. 
The partnership has proven to be very successful so far, with 
StingRay’s performance exceeding our expectations and their 
talented workforce integrating well into the wider company.
Research and Development (“R&D”)
There has been continued benefit from concentrating our R&D 
efforts on fewer higher return projects. During FY 2017 we 
introduced a record 22 new products and we expect the full value 
of these products to peak over the next three years. Revenue 
generated from new products this year was £11.1 million.
“Gooch & Housego met its FY 2017 financial goals and was able 
to make strategically important investments in key skills, 
processes, systems and the latest capital equipment. Significant 
progress has been made towards meeting our strategic aims of 
diversifying the business and moving up the value chain, with 
A&D now representing 31.1% of our business. We acquired 
USA based StingRay in February 2017, which has integrated 
well into the wider organisation and performed strongly”

STRA TEGIC REPORT
Good progress has been achieved in our key R&D areas of 
interest, notable among which are the following:
Microelectronics is entering a new phase of nano technology 
and the UV lithography and via drilling techniques required to 
achieve this need a new generation of precision lasers and 
laser systems which are being developed with our laser 
manufacturer and laser system partners.
OCT technology dominates the retinal scanning and imaging 
arena, but the longer term development partnerships we have 
with medical diagnostic companies in the areas of cardiovascular 
disease and cancer detection are now moving to the prototype 
and early commercial model stage, with the prospect of new 
product launches in the near future.
Our space communication group has gone from strength to 
strength with European Space Agency and UK Space agency 
funded work in satellite communications and is now attracting 
commercial interest from the USA and elsewhere. In addition 
to the grant funded work we have enhanced our $4 million 
commercial contract to provide communication systems for 
near term satellite launches. We are also developing similar 
technology for the adjacent market of UAVs.
Various aspects of our R&D defence programmes in the US and 
Europe are classified, but we are able to say that we are making 
good headway in developing key parts of Kent Periscopes’ product 
portfolio, so they are compatible with USA military standards.
We have recently moved some of our R&D effort into sensing 
technology, focusing on use in harsh environments with 
ruggedised photonics technology. We have been able to bring 
some of our space communications experience to problem 
solving in this arena.
In order to accommodate the need for more system based 
projects, the Systems Technology Group (“STG”), primarily based 
at our Torquay site, has been expanded. The group consists of 
scientists and engineers who bring a wide range of skills such 
as electronic, software and mechanical engineering, which are 
required in order to present a complete sub system or system 
to our customers.
Performance Improvement Programme
In addition to the enhanced R&D performance outlined above, 
we have continued to expand our business development group, 
adding a microelectronic business development executive to 
the existing life science and A&D executives. The established 
business development executives have brought enhanced 
access to tier 1 A&D companies and multi-national medical 
diagnostic organisations and have been instrumental in the 
development of some of our most notable R&D projects. Our 
expectation is that with the addition of the new microelectronics 
business development executive we will be able to enhance 
our contribution to the new industrial laser systems that are 
currently in development.
G&H’s ongoing operational performance improvement programme 
was instrumental in enabling us to meet the challenge of this 
year’s high growth rate. The major infrastructure projects in 
Fremont, CA and Cleveland, OH are now substantially complete. 
Investment in key skills, lean processes and systems and the 
latest capital equipment was accelerated in sites that provide 
critical components for precision lasers used in microelectronic 
manufacturing, namely Ilminster, Fremont, CA and Torquay.
We have built on the good work done in previous years to further 
improve efficiency, customer service and to establish a more 
scalable organisational model for future growth. Our ten 
manufacturing sites have been organised into three 
manufacturing centres. They are based on our sites’ areas of 
technical expertise, namely Acousto Optic / Electro Optic, 
Precision Optics and Fibre Optics. Each manufacturing area has 
a leader and their role is to ensure best practice is shared; there 
is process harmonisation and optimal allocation of resource. 
G&H is in a strong positon financially and is well positioned to 
make further investment in the business.
Market and Applications
Industrial
The industrial sector represents 57.4% of G&H’s revenue and is 
composed of a diverse range of industrial applications aligned to 
our world class photonic technologies, including microelectronic 
manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing and test, remote 
sensing, metrology and optical communications.
Our industrials division grew by £10.0 million or 18.4% compared 
to the previous year, reflecting a positive performance across 
the range of industrial products. 
Critical components for precision lasers used in microelectronic 
manufacturing were in particular demand. This was driven by the 
next generation of smart phones and tablets and the consequent 
change in manufacturing technology required to produce them. 
The aforementioned ‘cutting edge’ technology is primarily 
dependent on the latest solid state lasers and we worked closely 
with the laser manufacturers and laser system suppliers to meet 
these demands. 
Precision inspection equipment for real time calibration in smart 
phone and tablet production continued to deliver significant 
revenue for us during FY 2017.
The ongoing need for ever more data capacity from government, 
industry and the consumer continues to drive a strong optical 
telecommunications performance. G&H provides some of the 
more technically challenging elements to both land and undersea 
optical communications. Our ultra hi-reliability fibre couplers are

used in amplifiers that are a key part of undersea cable networks. 
Over the last couple of years there has been a positive step 
change in the requirement for these products, driven by 
technology firms laying their own cable networks in order to 
control the process of data delivery. This new level of demand 
has continued unabated throughout FY 2017. 
Aerospace & Defence
A&D represented 31.1% of our revenue and grew year on year by 
£14.9 million or 74.5%. This was due to a combination of organic 
growth and acquisition, as highlighted earlier. G&H is now able 
to bring a wide range of photonic capabilities that very much 
represent the “direction of travel” in this sector. These include 
target designation, range finding, ring laser and fibre optic 
gyroscope navigational systems, infra-red and RF counter 
measures, periscopes and sighting systems for armoured vehicles 
and opto-mechanical sub systems for unmanned aerial vehicles. 
Delivering product quality, reliability and performance in 
challenging environments is essential in the A&D arena and 
this very much plays to G&H’s strengths. Our customers 
encompass the major European and USA A&D companies.
Space satellite communication is undergoing a technology 
revolution. The use of fibre optic lasers to transmit information 
means the satellite communication systems are more efficient 
and robust, as well being significantly lighter. This has changed 
the economics of the sector and has led to smaller satellites and 
encouraged the move towards the use of satellite constellations 
as part of a communications network. The investment we have 
made in this area means we are at the forefront of some of 
these developments.
Life Sciences
Life Sciences represents 8.5% of G&H’s revenue and grew year on 
year by £1.7 million or 21.1%. Despite the increase in revenue the 
profit did decline year on year, which is primarily due to the 
investments made into future capabilities. Though life sciences 
is a relatively small sector for G&H we see this as a strategically 
important one going forward.  
The principal applications are in optical coherence tomography 
(“OCT”), laser surgery and microscopy. OCT is widely used in 
ophthalmology for 3D retinal scanning and G&H has a dominant 
position in supplying critical components and sub systems to 
the main equipment suppliers. We also have a number of R&D 
collaborations with medical diagnostic companies in 
cardiovascular and cancer detection.
Laser surgery is a fast growing area particularly in ophthalmology , 
prostate and cosmetic surgery and has significant potential to 
be exploited beyond these current areas of use.
There is potential for photonic technology to be used in minimally 
invasive surgery, endoscopy and robotic surgery and this sector 
remains an area where G&H will continue to invest in R&D and 
look for strategic acquisitions.
Scientific Research
G&H’s research market is dominated by a small number of “big 
science” projects in the fields of nuclear fusion research and 
synchrotron radiation sources. It provides 3.0% of our revenue. 
The year on year decline was due to the phasing of one of the 
projects. This is a profitable sector for G&H, where we have some 
unique capabilities, that has the capacity to deliver growth and 
we will continue to selectively invest in this area.
Outlook
G&H met its FY 2017 financial goals and was able to make 
strategically important investments in key skills, processes, 
systems and the latest capital equipment. Significant progress 
has been made towards meeting our strategic aims of 
diversifying the business and moving up the value chain, with 
A&D now representing 31.1% of our business by revenue. We 
acquired USA based StingRay Optics LLC in February 2017, 
which has integrated well into the wider organisation and 
performed strongly.
G&H will continue with an active policy of making further 
progress towards a more diverse and balanced business by 
building “critical mass” in A&D and life sciences, through a mix 
of investment in R&D and acquisitions.
We are committed to making further investment in R&D in our 
targeted high growth areas. These include fibre and solid state 
laser systems, precision inspection equipment for microelectronic 
manufacturing, OCT medical diagnostics, laser surgery, space 
satellite communications, A&D sub systems and fibre optic 
sensing systems.
G&H intends to take the performance improvement programme to 
the next level, by further investment in business development 
activity, focusing our global resources on a few high return R&D 
projects and continuing to improve operational efficiency. We 
believe the introduction of three well defined and focused 
manufacturing centres will provide a scalable platform for 
enhanced lean manufacturing practice
These strategic initiatives combined with a record year end 
order book mean the Board remains confident that G&H is well 
positioned to deliver further progress in FY 2018 and beyond
