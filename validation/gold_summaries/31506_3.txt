 STRATEGIC REPORT

Chairman’s Statement
Clive Carver
“
During the year under review we met
all internal and external targets for the
business. We are confident in our ability
to continue to increase both our
capabilities and shareholder value
moving forward
”
I am pleased to report to shareholders in respect of the year
ended 31 December 2017.
The year under review saw the Company make encouraging
progress to its longer-term objective of being a leading
international provider of regulatory compliance software and
professional services.
Our current focus is on the corporation tax software and
services market in the UK and Ireland. In this business we met
all internal and external targets including increasing our
revenue, contracted annuity base and number of new
customers. Of particular note has been the level of cash
generated from the business, which has allowed us the reduce
debt levels faster than initially planned. Further details of our
progress in 2017 is set out in the following CEO and CFO
reports.
We made significant investments during 2017 to maintain,
update and de-risk our solutions and services in light of the
increasing regulatory landscape. Over time we expect more
demand for automation and process control which is where
we want to provide enhanced functionality and value.
We look forward to extending our technology offering by way
of continued product development and targeted acquisitions.
In particular, in the shorter term, to broaden the range of
taxes covered.
The integration of OSMO, acquired in April 2017, was largely
completed and considered a successful transition. OSMO’s
leading edge technology is now embedded as part of our
core value proposition and helps organisations automate the
collection of data from large accounting / ERP systems. 
We firmly believe we are well placed to exploit the
opportunities that will arise from the ever-greater digitalisation
of tax compliance and in compliance more generally.
We look forward to the future with confidence.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on
20 June 2018 at 11 am at the offices of K&L Gates, One New
Change, London EC4M 9AF.
