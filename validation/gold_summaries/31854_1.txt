Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Since joining the Company in 2009, 
our team has been keenly focused 
on creating strong foundations and 
a competitive cost base to ensure 
that we are in a solid position to 
weather industry-wide challenges. 
Driving efficiency and scale has been a long-term  
focus for Finsbury and has represented the 
rationale behind a range of initiatives we have  
implemented over recent years.  
With this in mind, having been operating within 
a deflationary UK grocery food market during 
the period under review, the effectiveness of 
these initiatives has been tested. Therefore I am  
pleased to report on the solid performance and  
trading resilience the Group has demonstrated 
against the headwinds posed by sustained Sterling  
devaluation and high input costs experienced 
during FY 2017 . This performance, which includes  
growth in both Group sales and profit in the year 
on a like for like basis, follows several years of  
very strong organic and acquisition-led growth 
and demonstrates the benefits of the investment  
and diversification strategy implemented over 
recent years. Additionally, our strong cashflow 
and robust balance sheet allowed us to both 
reduce debt and increase our dividend whilst 
continuing to invest to strengthen our business 
for the future. 
The Group is now one of the largest speciality 
bakery groups in the UK with a small but fast  
growing European business. The latter performed  
particularly strongly as it benefited from 
improved celebration cake and free from product 
ranges and was boosted by the exchange rate 
tailwind from a weaker Sterling.
All food manufacturers and their customers 
have had to navigate the transition from the 
deflationary food market of recent years to the  
inflationary environment evident throughout 
the second half and beyond. Sterling’s structural  
decline amplified typically cyclical commodity 
input cost increases for UK manufacturers 
importing many of their ingredients. The National  
Living Wage has similarly amplified annual labour 
cost inflation throughout the labour intensive 
food and agriculture sector and indeed beyond. 
This trend looks set to continue for some time 
with high profile butter price hikes, driven by 
increased demand and a supply shortfall, the 
most significant example in recent months.
This market transition has seen us work 
proactively with our brand partners and customers  
to revise our product, pricing and promotional 
portfolio to strike the right sustainable balance  
of providing value for consumers whilst delivering  
on margin requirements. These are difficult 
customer conversations and whilst diminished 
promotional spend reduced sales growth in the  
short-term, operating margin was successfully 
maintained in FY17 in conjunction with our 
internal efficiency improvement initiatives  
and recent capital investment.
Strategic Investment Underpinning 
the Future
Finsbury’s goal is to ensure that the Group is well  
positioned to maintain pricing for consumers and  
to remain a low cost producer for customers. 
These resilient results are testament to the  
importance of continually investing in our  
operations in order to improve overall productivity 
and offset increases in the Group’s cost base.  
FY17 saw the second consecutive year of record  
capital investment at £12.5m, some 181%  
of depreciation, as we further strengthen the 
Group’s growth capacity, product capability, 
efficiency and cost competitiveness. 
This has seen the installation of a new automated 
whole cake line in an upgraded bakery at our  
Cardiff site. This is currently undergoing product 
commissioning for full production in FY18.  
We have also opened a new artisan bread bakery 
at our Salisbury site. Both of these will enable 
future growth aligned to changing consumer 
demand for premium, healthy and authentic 
product ranges across different market channels.
The second major investment area is focused 
on redesigning our business processes to drive  
scale and efficiency across the Group businesses.  
This standardisation of process across all sites 
in the Group establishes agreed best practice 
and this is then embedded within the roll out 
of our new ERP IT platform across the Group 
during the first half of FY18.
The third major investment area, largely non 
capital expenditure, is our ‘people’ strategy. 
Having successfully rolled out our vision and  
values last year, we completed our first Group 
employee engagement survey, with an 
engagement score of 68%, to establish a base 
for future improvement. A new Group-wide 
talent management system and an associated 
management development programme were 
also successfully deployed during the year to 
nurture the development of both today’s and, 
importantly, tomorrow’s leaders.

Chief Executive’s Report
Finally, we have entered into consultation for the  
closure of Grain D’Or, the Group’s loss-making 
pastry factory. Over the two and a half year  
period since acquisition we have been working 
closely with management of this site to stem 
the losses it experienced. However, although 
improvements have been made, the ongoing 
pressures from commodity and labour cost 
increases has made it difficult to maintain 
customer contracts. The cost to close, if seen  
as an investment, will be justified by the reduction  
in losses. The Group will update the market 
following the completion of the consultation 
process and, depending on the outcome,  
will outline the financial consequences  
of any decision.  
A Consistent Strategy  
for Uncertain Times
Our vision is to be a leading speciality bakery 
Group which produces a broad range of high  
quality products for growing channels and market  
niches, delivers growth and differentiation for  
our major customers, and fulfills end-consumer 
requirements. Our focus is on the UK but 
increasingly we are extending our reach  
into Europe.
We operate in competitive sectors and markets,  
supplying brand partners and customers with  
innovative, safe and high quality bakery products  
which anticipate and fulfil consumer trends, 
are efficiently and sustainably made and offer 
great value. These results show that this 
strategy has delivered results for the Group. 
Additional investment to better  
understand consumer needs and category 
growth opportunities complements the product,  
business process and people investment outlined 
previously. Our ability to leverage scale and best  
practice intellectual property across the Group,  
whilst delivering for individual customers and 
brand partners, is central to our continued 
competitiveness and underpins our growth 
ambitions. It is rewarding to see Group businesses  
winning a number of externally recognised 
industry and customer food awards, whilst also  
extending and deepening our licensed brand 
relationships with both existing partners such  
as Thorntons and Mars, as well as new partners 
such as Mary Berry.
In line with our stated growth strategy the Group  
has continued to explore acquisition opportunities  
that fit strategically and meet our value criteria. 
However, none were successful in the year as 
valuations remained unrealistic given known 
market headwinds. More challenging market  
conditions may provide new acquisition 
opportunities in the year ahead and we remain  
patient. Meanwhile there are ample opportunities  
identified to further strengthen and optimise 
our current Group businesses.
I would like to thank my Board, Executive teams  
and the thousands of colleagues across Finsbury  
for their continued commitment and hard work  
in baking great food products every day and in 
particular, to those individuals which drive the 
investment and change programmes on top  
of their other day job responsibilities.
The business environment isn’t going to get any  
easier but I remain confident that Finsbury has  
the right people, investment approach and M&A  
strategy to deliver growth in the years ahead, 
delivering value for employees, customers  
and shareholders alike.
