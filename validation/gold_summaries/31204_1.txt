Strategic report
Chief Executive’s summary
2017 was a transformational 
year through the acquisition of 
Seachill and expansion in New 
Zealand and Central Europe.”
Robert Watson OBE
Chief Executive Strategic objectives
Our strategy continues to be to support our 
customers’ brands and their development 
in local markets, whilst achieving attractive 
and sustainable growth in shareholder 
value. This straightforward approach has 
generated growth over an extended period 
of time and with a strong reputation, well 
invested modern facilities and a robust 
balance sheet, the Group remains well 
positioned to achieve continuing progress.
Hilton seeks to build long term customer 
and shareholder value by focusing on:
 – Growing volumes and extending 
product ranges supplied and services 
provided to its existing customers;
 – Optimising the use of its assets and 
investing in new technology and 
capacity expansion as required;
 – Maintaining a vigilant focus on food 
safety and integrity and reducing unit 
costs, while improving product quality 
and service provision; and
 – Entering new territories and markets 
either with new customers or in 
partnership with our existing customers.
We will continue to pursue measured 
geographical expansion and range 
extension, whilst at the same time 
actively developing, enriching, deepening 
and expanding the scope of our existing 
business partnerships, playing a full and 
proactive role in supporting our customers 
and the successful development of their 
brands. We have successfully expanded 
our product range into new proteins such 
as fish as well as fresh foods including 
pizzas and soups.
Business model
Our business model is the means by which 
we deliver on our strategic objectives. 
The Hilton business model is proven 
and sustainable, whilst being relatively 
simple and straightforward. We operate 
large scale, extensively automated and 
robotised meat and fish processing and 
packing facilities for major international 
multiple retailers on a dedicated basis. 
Central Europe is an exception where our 
facility in Poland supplies multiple retailers 
in order to achieve critical mass in terms of 
volumes supplied and, as a consequence, 
gives us the ability to achieve competitive 
unit packing costs. 
Raw material meat and fish is sourced, in 
conjunction with our retail partners, from 
a combination of local sources and a wide 
international base of proven suppliers.  
It is then processed, packed and delivered 
to the retailers’ distribution centres or 
stores. Our plants are highly automated 
and use advanced robotics for the storage 
of raw materials and finished products. 
Developing robotics technology has been 
extended in recent years both in the 
production environment and to the sorting 
of finished products by retailer store order, 
achieving material supply chain efficiencies 
for our customers.
We seek to keep ourselves at the forefront 
of the meat and fish packing industry, 
which helps ensure our continued 
competitiveness. We constantly look to 
drive efficiencies, always maintaining a 
pipeline of clear identifiable cost reduction 
initiatives and an open minded approach 
designed to continually challenge the 
status quo. We consider our modern, very 
well-invested facilities to be a key factor 
in keeping unit packing costs as low as 
possible. Over the past thirteen years 
we have invested continuously across 
all areas of our business, including the 
sourcing of raw materials, the design of 
packaging materials, increased efficiency 
in processing and storage solutions 
and updating our IT infrastructure. 
Group capital expenditure over the period 
2004-2017 has totalled £238m. 
We have facilities in six countries in 
Europe, each run by a local management 
team enhanced by specialist central 
leadership, expertise, advice and 
support. These businesses operate 
under the terms of five to ten year 
long term supply agreements with our 
retailer partners, either on a cost plus, 
packing rate or volume based reward 
basis. These contractual arrangements, 
combined with our customer dedication, 
serve to maximise achievable volume 
throughput whilst minimising unit packing 
costs thereby delivering value to our 
customers. In Australia and Portugal, 
together with our retailer partners, 
facilities are operated under joint venture 
companies who receive volume related 
management fees.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Under the long term supply agreements 
we have in place with our customers, 
the parameters of our revenue are clearly 
defined. As well as income derived from 
the supply of retail packed meat and 
fish products, there are also provisions 
whereby our income can be increased 
or decreased subject to achievement 
of certain pre-agreed and pre-defined 
key performance measures and targets 
designed to align our objectives with  
those of our customers.
We are a committed and loyal partner with a 
continuing record of delivering value through 
quality products with the highest levels of 
food safety, traceability and integrity, whilst 
providing a range of services which enable 
our customers to evolve and improve their 
meat and fish supply chain management. 
Our customer base comprises high 
quality multiple retailers and our in depth 
understanding of our customers’ needs, 
together with those of their consumers, 
enables us to play an active role in managing 
their meat and fish supply chains whilst 
providing agile solutions to supply chain 
challenges as they arise. As our customers’ 
markets change and competition increases, 
we need to keep a constant focus on 
the challenges they face so we can put 
forward flexible solutions, together with 
continuing increases in efficiency and cost 
competitiveness. This flexible approach and 
understanding of our local markets remains 
one of our core strengths.
The strength of our long term partnerships 
with our retail customers has been a key 
driver of our growth since the Group was 
formed and will continue to underpin the 
Group’s strategy. Hilton’s business model 
has proved successful across a range 
of European countries and in Australia, 
appropriately adapted in each case by 
working in close collaboration with its 
local customers to meet their specific 
requirements. Our experience to date 
continues to indicate that our business 
model, appropriately adapted, can be 
successfully transferred to a number  
of new countries.
As well as our ability to provide excellent 
execution locally, we also have at our 
disposal a wide and deep expertise on  
a number of areas of specialism, such as 
engineering, food related IT applications, 
category management support and market 
intelligence. We are able to apply these 
skills to a number of markets to support our 
customers where required, and to do so  
in a cost-effective way.
Business development
The Group’s rapid expansion has been 
based on its established and proven 
track record, together with its growing 
international reputation and experience 
and the recognised success of the close 
partnerships it has forged and maintained 
with successful retail partners. We are 
an international business and operate 
production facilities in six countries across 
Europe and work with joint venture partners 
in two further countries. Products from 
these facilities are sold in fourteen European 
countries and Australia.
Our first facility opened in Huntingdon in 
1994 supplying Tesco UK. In 2000 we took 
over an existing facility in Zaandam, Holland 
supplying Albert Heijn which also has stores 
in Belgium. In 2004 new factories were 
built in Drogheda, Ireland supplying Tesco 
Ireland and in Vasteras, Sweden supplying 
ICA Gruppen. Our facility in Tychy, Poland 
opened in 2006 and supplies Ahold stores  
in Czech Republic and Slovakia, Tesco stores 
in Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland and 
Slovakia and Rimi stores in Latvia, Lithuania 
and Estonia. Our Danish factory near Aarhus 
opened in 2011 and supplies Coop Danmark.
We formed a joint venture company with 
Woolworths in Australia in 2013 which 
manages their meat processing and packing 
facilities at Bunbury in Western Australia 
and a state of the art meat packing facility 
near Melbourne, Victoria which opened 
in 2015. 
Progress in 2017
Seachill was acquired during the year for 
£81m. The business was founded in 1998 
and has grown to become one of the 
largest chilled fish processors in the UK, 
with well-invested facilities and a well-
established supply chain based in Grimsby, 
Lincolnshire. It operates from three sites 
and supplies a number of UK leading food 
retail customers. Seachill has successfully 
innovated and developed new products 
including The Saucy Fish Co. brand which 
is the largest chilled wet fish brand in the 
UK. This extension into a new protein is 
an exciting development for Hilton which 
creates the following opportunities:
 – Investing to increase Seachill’s capacity 
and use our experience in robotics and 
automated processes to deliver higher 
quality and better value to the customer;
 – Expanding into overseas territories 
alongside our existing key customers 
and other new business opportunities;
 – Developing innovative new products 
in the fish category broadening the 
range of products offered to new and 
existing customers; and
 – Expanding The Saucy Fish Co. 
brand into other categories both 
in the UK and overseas.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s summary
continued At the beginning of the year we signed 
a joint venture agreement with Sonae to 
manage their existing meat processing  
and packing facility in Santarem, Portugal.
We also signed an agreement to construct 
a new facility in Auckland, New Zealand 
to supply Progressive Enterprises, a 
subsidiary of Woolworths, which operates 
under the Countdown brand. This facility 
will supply beef, lamb, pork, chicken and 
added value products and production is 
expected to commence in 2020.
Our facility in Poland will expand following 
agreement with Tesco to supply fresh 
foods into Central Europe including 
sandwiches, pizzas, ready meals 
and soups.
Since the year end we have reached 
agreement with Woolworths to restructure 
the Australia joint venture and take full 
operational control of these existing 
plants from 1 July 2018. After a two year 
transitional period we will purchase the 
relevant plant assets. We are currently 
constructing a new facility in Brisbane, 
Queensland which Hilton will finance and 
operate through its Australian subsidiary 
and progress is on track. 
In 2017 some 75% of the Group’s  
volumes were produced in countries 
outside the UK.
Currency translation
The wide geographical spread of the Group 
increases its resilience by minimising its 
reliance on any one individual economy. 
This means that Hilton’s results, as 
reported in Sterling, are sensitive to 
changes in the value of Sterling compared 
to the range of overseas currencies in 
which the Group trades. During 2017, 
the average exchange rates for the various 
overseas currencies in which the Group 
trades have all appreciated significantly 
against Sterling, compared with the 
corresponding period in 2016, specifically, 
the Euro by 7.2%, the Danish Krone by 
7.3%, the Polish Zloty by 10.0%, the 
Swedish Krona by 5.2% and the Australian 
Dollar by 8.5%.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Resourcing for growth: 
culture and people
Successful businesses are principally 
about having the right people in the 
right positions at the right time working 
together as ‘one team’, with local 
management teams empowered, 
encouraged and advised in specialist 
areas enabling them to support their 
local customers. The Group benefits 
from each of its businesses being part 
of a larger organisation, which enables 
them to share best practice solutions, 
including equipment selection, IT solutions 
and ways of working along with the 
collaborative sharing of new learnings, 
ideas and techniques.
We are committed to providing an inclusive 
working environment where everyone 
feels valued, respected and able to fulfil 
their potential. We recognise that people 
from different backgrounds, countries 
and experiences can bring benefits to 
our business. We fully recognise the 
benefits of gender diversity and details 
of the gender composition of our staff 
are set out in our Corporate and social 
responsibility report.
The Group currently employs over 
3,600 employees across Europe and 
Australia. Our business model is largely 
decentralised, with capable, largely self-
sufficient management teams running 
our businesses in each local country. 
We consider this devolved structure to be 
a critical success factor, achieving close 
working relationships with our customers, 
who benefit from personal, dedicated, 
flexible and rapid local support.
The Board fully understands and 
appreciates just how much our progress 
relies on the effort, personal commitment, 
enthusiasm, enterprise and initiative of 
our employees. I would like to take this 
opportunity, on behalf of the Board, to 
personally thank all of them both for their 
dedicated efforts during 2017 and their 
continuing commitment to the Group’s 
ongoing growth and development.
Performance overview
The overall performance of our business 
was stable across its three separate 
operating segments boosted by the 
new acquisition and joint venture as 
outlined below.
Western Europe
Operating profit before exceptional 
items of £41.5m (2016: £36.1m) on 
turnover of £1,267.9m (2016: £1,147.5m)
This operating segment covers the 
Group’s businesses in the UK, Ireland, 
Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. 
Volumes were 14.4% driven higher by new 
Portugal and Seachill businesses offset 
by lower consumer demand in Holland. 
Sales on a constant currency basis grew 
by 6.5%. Operating margins improved 
slightly to 3.3% (2016: 3.1%) boosted 
by new contributions from Seachill and 
Portugal. Seachill trading in the post-
acquisition period was good with profit 
of £1.8m before charging amortisation. 
Portuguese income in the year was 
generated from managing the refurbishing 
and re-equipping phase activity. 
Central Europe
Operating profit of £1.2m (2016: £2.1m) 
on turnover of £91.6m (2016: £87.0m)
In Central Europe the Group’s meat 
packing business, based at Tychy in 
Poland, supplies customers across 
Central Europe, from Hungary to the 
Baltics. Volumes decreased by 13.7% 
with constant currency sales 4.1% 
lower and operating margins fell to 1.3% 
(2016: 2.4%) as we continue to adapt our 
business model to the local environment 
with performance improving in the second 
half of the year.
A five year agreement was reached during 
the year with Tesco to build a state of the 
art factory in Poland to produce fresh foods 
including sandwiches, pizza, ready meals 
and soups. It is expected that production 
will begin in the first quarter of 2019.
Central costs and other
Net operating cost before exceptional 
items £4.4m (2016: £3.9m)
This segment includes our share of the 
management fee earned by our joint 
venture with Woolworths of £4.3m 
(2016: £3.1m), start-up and support costs 
of £1.5m (2016: £0.6m) and central costs 
of £7.2m (2016: £6.4m). These figures 
exclude the exceptional one-off acquisition 
costs of £2.8m. Hilton’s share of post-tax 
joint venture service fees in Australia grew 
by 42% in the year across the facilities  
in Melbourne and Western Australia.  
Start-up and support costs increased as 
we designed and commenced construction  
of our new facility in Brisbane, 
Queensland. Central costs were higher  
as we progressively increase resources  
to manage our growth successfully.
Past and future trends
Over recent decades as major retail 
chains have progressively gained a 
greater share of the grocery markets in 
most countries, they have increasingly 
turned to large scale, centralised packing 
solutions capable of producing private 
label packed food products more safely 
and cost effectively. In doing so, they have 
rationalised their supply base, achieving 
lower costs with higher food safety, food 
integrity, traceability and quality standards. 
This has allowed supermarket groups to 
focus on their core business and maximise 
their return on available retail space 
whilst addressing consumers’ continuing 
requirement for quality and value.
Grocery retail markets are expected 
to remain extremely competitive, with 
continuing pressure on consumer 
expenditure. The trend towards increased 
use of centralised packing solutions is 
likely to continue albeit at different speeds 
across the world. This gives rise to a wide 
range of potential future geographical 
expansion opportunities for Hilton, but 
inevitably in a range of different timescales 
as markets develop and change over time.

Hilton Food Group plc
Annual report and financial statements 2017
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s summary
continued Within the wider retail market, consumer 
patterns are continuing to change with 
increased internet based ordering and 
delivery together with growth in the 
number of ‘click and collect’ facilities. 
Following pressures on consumer 
expenditure over a number of years, there 
has been increased use by cost conscious 
consumers of local convenience stores and 
discount outlets to shop more frequently 
for a reduced overall basket cost per visit 
and at a wider range of retail outlets. 
These developments which appear to be 
structural rather than cyclical reinforce the 
overall trend towards retail packed meat 
and fish, as this is the offering in all these 
growth areas. 
Outlook and current trading
Hilton’s operating performance in the 
early months of 2018 has been in line 
with the Board’s expectations. The Group 
will implement the transfer of operational 
control of the two existing Australian joint 
venture facilities during the year. We will 
continue to explore opportunities for 
further geographical expansion in both 
domestic and overseas markets and are 
well placed to capture those opportunities 
as they arise.
The medium term outlook for Hilton is 
positive with the integration of the Seachill 
business together with new factories in 
Queensland, Australia and New Zealand 
as well as business extension in Central 
Europe. These projects and continued 
focus on product development and range 
extension lay foundations for strong 
growth over the next five years.
