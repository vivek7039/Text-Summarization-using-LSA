CONTENTS OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
 » Feeds – headline operating profit of £1.5 million 
(2016: £2.1 million). Good second half recovery, 
having been impacted by margin pressure due to 
increased commodity costs, particularly through 
the winter months. Volumes were robust and the 
mill developments in the North and Cheshire, 
completed during the year, have strengthened 
our operating platform.
 » Food – headline operating profit of £3.0 million 
(2016: £2.7 million). A strong result built on 
efficiently delivering increased activity levels with 
the business operating at capacity throughout 
the year.
 » Fuels – headline operating profit of £4.5 million 
(2016: £3.9 million). Strong volume growth across 
the depot network and the new depots in the 
South East exceeded expectations in their first 
full year.
