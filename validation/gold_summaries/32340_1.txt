 Chief Executive’s review
The past year was an important period for National Grid. 
We completed the sale of a majority interest in our UK Gas 
Distribution business, made progress with our new rates  
in the US, and developed our thinking on National Grid’s 
purpose, vision and strategic direction.
I am proud of what we have achieved during 
2016/17 . We have continued being innovative 
and efficient to deliver savings for customers, 
while taking steps across the Group to evolve 
by investing in newer technologies. These 
developments come at a time when there have 
been considerable changes in our operating 
environment, as described on page 9. 
This is why our leadership team has conducted 
a strategic review of our business to articulate  
our purpose and evolve our vision and strategy. 
I am excited by the evolution of our strategy, 
which we are setting out in this report.
Our performance in 2016/17
In terms of safety, our overall lost time injury 
frequency rate for the Group was 0.08, which  
is considered to be world class. This figure, 
which includes our contractors and excludes 
the UK Gas Distribution business, is slightly 
different to our KPI for the Group’s employee 
injury frequency rate. You can read about this 
on page 10.
However, we were all reminded of the 
importance of safety this year, following a tragic 
incident in which one of our UK employees  
lost his life. We take safety very seriously  
at National Grid – it remains a fundamental 
priority – and we will do everything we  
can to learn from incidents, so we can 
continually improve our performance.
Both our UK and US businesses remain 
committed to achieving the highest possible 
standards for safe working.
We invested £4.5 billion of capital this year in 
our businesses, a record level for the Group, 
driving growth of 5% in our total asset base. 
In both the UK and US, we continued to 
achieve close to 100% reliability across  
our networks.
At National Grid, we are very aware of the  
need to put our customers at the heart of  
how we run our business. In all of our business 
areas, both in the UK and in the US, we have 
exceeded our customer satisfaction targets, 
which I believe is testament to the continuous 
efforts we have made on improving the 
services we provide.
Finally, through the strong operational 
performance and growth in our assets, we 
support our growing dividend. We measure  
our performance through our Group Return  
on Equity (RoE), which remained strong at 
11.7% this year and Value Added, which 
increased to £1.9 billion this year, equivalent  
to 51.6 pence/share. 
Developments in our business
In 2016/17 , we have made progress in our 
business in a number of important areas.
The sale of a majority interest in our UK Gas 
Distribution business marks an important 
milestone for National Grid. We worked closely 
with the purchasing Consortium to ensure a 
smooth transition for our customers and 
employees so that services continue to be 
delivered safely and efficiently. The sale puts 
our portfolio in a strong position to support 
higher growth and to continue delivering an 
attractive dividend while maintaining a healthy 
balance sheet.
We have retained a 39% interest in the new 
Gas Distribution business, and have entered 
into an option agreement with the Consortium

A period of change
The energy sector is undergoing 
transformation. It faces greater 
change and uncertainty than  
ever before, which brings fresh 
challenge and new opportunities. 
As a result, we have spent 
considerable time over the past 
year re-evaluating how we will 
respond to these new challenges. 
The result is an articulation of  
our purpose, and evolution of our 
vision and strategy, which guide 
everything we do. 
 “Our purpose, 
which sets out 
why National 
Grid exists, is 
simple – we 
bring energy  
to life.”

for the potential future sale and purchase of 
an additional 14% interest. This would be  
on broadly similar terms to the sale of the  
61% equity interest.
During 2016/17 , we made progress with our 
rate cases in the US, securing agreements  
in Massachusetts, New York City and Long 
Island. The New York agreements include 
provision to phase the impact on consumer 
bills over time to help manage the increase  
in costs. 
Our ability to make new investments in our US 
networks means we can continue our work to 
ensure a clean, sustainable energy supply for 
our customers. In December, we began the 
transmission of electricity to Rhode Island from 
the Block Island wind farm, the first offshore 
wind generation in the US. You can read more 
about our US investments on pages 26–27 .
In the UK, Ofgem concluded its mid-period 
review of the RIIO price control for Gas and 
Electricity Transmission, giving us certainty 
over our core revenues for the remaining 
RIIO period. 
Also this year, we issued a joint statement with 
BEIS and Ofgem about the enhanced role and 
greater separation of the Electricity System 
Operator (ESO) function. While the proposals 
are subject to consultation, we support the 
principle of greater separation of the ESO role 
within National Grid. We believe it is the most 
effective way to balance the interests of 
consumers with the need to maintain security  
of supply in a fair and competitive energy 
market. We look forward to working with the 
regulator and our stakeholders to deliver the 
best possible outcome for UK consumers.
The outcome of the UK referendum on EU 
membership has challenged all businesses  
to consider the impact Brexit will have on their 
operations. We continue to work positively  
with both UK and EU legislators to maintain 
access to cross-border services so we are  
able to ensure the UK’s security of supply  
and the interests of energy consumers.
We welcome the opportunity the UK 
Government’s Green Paper ‘Building our 
Industrial Strategy’ provides to contribute  
to the industrial development of the UK. We 
believe secure, low-carbon and affordable 
energy underpins the success of all the UK’s 
industries. We welcome the commitment to 
investing in the skills and education needed to 
encourage future innovation in energy systems.
We have brought together our Other Activities, 
which mainly comprise businesses that are 
adjacent to our core regulated operations, to 
create a new division with its own leadership. 
It will be called National Grid Ventures and its 
objectives are to focus on the development of 
new growth opportunities and strengthening  
our commercial and partnership capabilities  
for the future. A recent example of this is our 
partnership with US solar supplier Sunrun, 
which we announced in January. I would like  
to welcome Badar Khan to my leadership team 
as Group Director, Corporate Development and 
National Grid Ventures.

in our UK, US and other businesses on pages 
24–29.
Our purpose, vision and strategy
Throughout this year’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, we describe our performance  
for 2016/17 against our current strategy. 
However, as Sir Peter has described, there  
is much change taking place in our operating 
environment. 
The shift to a low-carbon economy is  
gathering pace in both the UK and US. Globally, 
investment in coal-powered generation is falling 
and renewables have now overtaken coal as 
the world’s largest source of installed power 
capacity. This year, for the first time, we saw 
periods where no coal-fired power stations 
generated electricity in the UK. In the US, 
investment in solar, battery storage and energy 
efficiency continues apace.
With such change happening all around us,  
we cannot stand still. That’s why we have 
developed our thinking on National Grid’s 
purpose, vision and strategic direction. 
Our purpose, which sets out why we exist,  
and what we bring to our customers and  
wider society, is simple: we bring energy to  
life. This means getting the heat, light and 
power that customers rely on to their homes 
and businesses; and supporting the 
communities that we are a part of.
Our vision is to exceed the expectations of  
our customers, shareholders and communities 
today and make possible the energy systems 
of tomorrow. How we perform individually,  
and as an organisation, is guided by this  
single ambition. 
So, what does this all mean for our strategy? 
Our strategic focus is predicated on our 
customers. As a responsible, purpose-led 
organisation, we must put into sharper focus 
the customers to whom we deliver – their 
needs and priorities must come first. And by 
making decisions that consider our customers’ 
interests, we will be able to deliver sustainable 
performance over the long term. Therefore,  
we are focused on three specific areas. 
Firstly, we are finding new ways of optimising 
our operational performance, so we can 
maximise value from our businesses. And  
as we improve performance, it increases our 
efficiency and ultimately benefits the customer 
by improving affordability.
Secondly, we are seeking opportunities to drive 
asset growth by investing in our core regulated 
assets where we see strong potential. This 
investment is needed to deliver asset health, 
network expansion and modernisation. We 
expect the current levels of spend to continue 
over the medium term. 
And thirdly, we are making further changes  
to make sure National Grid is better equipped 
for the future. As I described earlier, we have 
created National Grid Ventures, which will focus 
on developing new growth opportunities and 
strengthening our commercial and partnership 
capabilities for the future. 
You can read more about our purpose, vision 
and strategy on page 8.
Our people
Our performance is dependent on the 
commitment and achievements of our people. 
As Chief Executive, it’s been a privilege to meet 
many of our employees across the organisation 
and see how they deliver for their customers, 
their communities and each other.
That’s why I am pleased to report that our 
annual employee engagement score has risen 
to 77% from 73%. 
If we are to achieve the strategic objectives I 
have described, it’s important that we continue 
to make sure our employees have the right 
skills and capabilities to lead us through this 
period of change.
Over the past year, we’ve delivered an average 
of 6.5 days of technical, safety, leadership or 
professional effectiveness training per employee 
in the UK and US. You can read more about 
this on pages 30 – 31.
Looking ahead
Our focus will remain on driving the 
performance of the business to deliver strong 
Group returns and increasing Value Added. 
To achieve this, our UK and US regulated 
businesses will continue looking for ways to 
optimise performance. In 2017/18, we will look 
to achieve good outcomes for our US rate 
filings. In the UK, we’ll begin the process of 
preparing for RIIO-T2. The performance of our 
regulated businesses will be underpinned by 
continued investment, so we can make sure we 
deliver a safe, reliable and affordable service for 
our customers. Our newly formed National Grid 
Ventures will look for opportunities adjacent to 
our core business to support its growth.

Strategic Report Our purpose
Having a clear sense of what we stand for  
as a company and what it is that binds us all 
together is vitally important. This is what we  
call our purpose. In simple terms it’s what 
drives our desire to serve our customers and 
it’s that thing that makes us proud about the 
work we do.
Our purpose is to bring energy to life.
In its simplest form ‘bring energy to life’  
means getting the heat, light and power  
that customers rely on to their homes and 
businesses. But ‘life’ also means supporting 
the communities that we are a part of and  
live amongst to support the economic  
growth and sustainability of wider society.
Our vision
Our vision describes how we create value –  
not just today, but in the future too. 
Our vision is: “We will exceed the  
expectations of our customers, 
shareholders and communities  
today and make possible the  
energy systems of tomorrow.”
The needs of our customers, shareholders and 
communities are at the heart of everything we 
do. So, our vision statement clearly describes the 
ambitious challenge we have set ourselves – to 
make sure we deliver value for them every day.
Our vision also looks to the future, reminding  
us of the critical role we will play for future 
generations. We are already seeing changes  
in our energy system as more renewable and 
decentralised generation is introduced. To be 
relevant in this future, we have to play an active 
role in helping shape the energy landscape, 
and benefiting from what it provides.
Our strategy 
We have three strategic priorities for our 
business that will help us achieve our vision.
1)  Find new ways of optimising our 
operational performance
Our customers want and need us to be more 
efficient, so we must find ways to improve how 
we run our business. We have looked at 
enhancing our productivity and customer 
experience through more efficient and 
customer-focused processes. Given the scale 
of our core business in the UK and US, even 
small improvements will have a huge impact  
on our overall performance. Finding new ways 
of optimising our operational performance will 
be an important factor in our ability to compete 
and grow. It creates the financial capacity  
and the capability for us to future-proof  
our business.
2)  Look for opportunities to grow  
our core business
Delivering strong operational performance 
provides us with a foundation to pursue  
other opportunities. We will continue to  
pursue business development opportunities 
that are close to our core business. In the US, 
we will build on our successful efforts over  
the past two years to pursue opportunities  
in electricity and gas transmission. In the UK, 
interconnectors and competitive onshore 
transmission projects will be our focus over  
the next decade.
3)  Make sure National Grid is better 
equipped for the future
We need to future-proof our business against 
the effects of a changing energy landscape. 
The operation of our networks is already 
affected by changes to the generation mix, 
while the needs and expectations of our 
customers are evolving. 
Our preparations for the future have already 
begun in the UK and US with the establishment 
of National Grid Ventures, which brings 
together our non-network businesses to focus 
on targeted investment in the energy sector 
outside of our core business. We are also 
looking to develop new capabilities that are 
essential for long-term success.
For example, our partnership with Sunrun,  
the largest dedicated residential solar company 
in the US, allows us to increase our capability  
in the distributed energy space, and enhance 
our ability to meet the changing energy needs 
of our customers and communities.
Our values
We know that how we deliver is as important 
as what we deliver. If our purpose is the ‘why’, 
our values are the ‘how’. They help shape our 
spirit, attitude and what guides us. We have  
to adapt and develop our values to align with 
the expectations of our customers and 
communities, without losing sight of the  
things that make us strong today.
Our values build on and protect our strong 
foundations while looking to the future.  
They are aligned to our purpose and help our 
people understand how we expect to achieve 
our purpose and vision for our customers  
and each other. 
Every day we do the right thing and find  
a better way.
‘Do the right thing’ pulls together our 
foundational values – keeping each other and 
the public safe; complying with all the relevant 
rules, regulations and policies; respecting  
our colleagues, customers and communities; 
and saying what we think and challenging 
constructively. ‘Find a better way’ challenges 
us to focus on performance and continuous 
improvement for our customers, our 
shareholders and communities.
Our purpose, vision, strategy and values
We describe on page 9 how the operating environment  
for our industry is changing. To make sure National Grid  
is well positioned to respond to these changes, we have 
evolved our purpose, vision, strategy and values.
Our vision 
 “We will exceed  
the expectations  
of our customers, 
shareholders and 
communities 
today and make 
possible the 
energy systems  
of tomorrow.”
