Chief Executive’s Review
I am encouraged by the 
performance of the Group 
during my first year as Chief 
Executive, having made good 
progress in strengthening the 
business and positioning it for 
the future. The year has been 
one of transition with a new 
strategy, associated portfolio 
changes and the formation  
of a new leadership team.
The most notable strategic development has 
been the launch of the Horizon strategy, our 
transformational programme for the Group, 
which will drive both our future direction and 
our operational model. Horizon will build on 
our strengths, brand and innovation heritage 
and has the following key elements: 
• We will focus our investment on market 
segments where nanotechnology drives 
long‑term growth for our customers 
and where we can maintain or develop 
leadership positions.
• We will migrate to being a more 
commercially focused, market‑driven 
Group by maintaining our heritage in 
supporting fundamental research whilst 
increasing our focus on products for 
applied R&D and the commercialisation 
of nanotechnology. 
• We will drive the delivery of synergies and 
enhanced collaboration. For example, in 
R&D we will prioritise our high‑impact 
projects and resource them from across 
the Group.
• We will evolve our existing “tools and 
service” model and move up the value 
chain by providing our customers with 
enhanced solutions, information and 
support that will drive advances in 
innovation and productivity. 
• We will transform our operational model 
to embed consistency and excellence 
across our businesses, measured by clearly 
defined core capabilities that will enhance 
our competitive advantage. 
Over the past ten years, Oxford Instruments 
has focused on being a leading provider 
of high technology tools and service to 
research communities all over the world. 
Nanotechnology is now well established 
as a fundamental and integral driver for 
delivering advances across the sciences and 
commercial end markets. We will build on 
our leadership and expertise in the fabrication, 
manipulation and analysis of materials down 
to the molecular and atomic scale. We will 
support the changing needs of our customers 
by evolving to become a leading provider of 
high technology solutions, information 
and support. We will be known for 
unprecedented performance, ease of use and 
service that will add value to our customers’ 
capabilities and productivity. 
The year has been one of transition with a new strategy, 
associated portfolio changes and the formation of a new 
leadership team.
Summary
• Horizon strategy underway, 
repositioning the Group for  
long‑term growth
• Continued strength and 
improved profitability across 
NanoTechnology Tools sector

New operational model
Within Horizon, we will actively manage our 
portfolio of businesses and products, selecting 
those markets with long‑term growth drivers 
where we can maintain or grow leading 
positions. We will focus on those markets 
where nanotechnology has the potential to 
address some of the world’s most complex and 
pressing challenges and where we can deliver 
enhanced solutions and service excellence. 
Global drivers for our core markets are: 
Healthcare where growth is driven by 
demand for improvements in disease detection 
and the understanding of fundamental 
mechanisms;
• Our advanced imaging and analysis 
solutions, such as our Dragonfly optical 
system and our newly launched video 
rate Atomic Force Microscope are 
examples of where we are providing 
enhanced capabilities and productivity 
for investigators working in this area.
Energy where improved efficiencies and 
sustainability remain core drivers, and includes 
work in photovoltaics and batteries.
• Our deposition and etch processes, and 
our characterisation solutions are essential 
for our customers in the development of 
their current and next generation devices. 
Plasma Technology, Asylum Research 
and NanoAnalysis are particularly well 
aligned to support these markets with new 
processing and characterisation capabilities.
IT and Communications where there is 
a focus on speed, security and capacity.
• Again, it is our ability to provide the 
fabrication capabilities for new materials 
and device structures, and the subsequent 
characterisation of their performance 
that helps our customers, for example 
in photonics, semiconductors and data 
storage devices. Our solutions are being 
utilised by fundamental science right 
through to the practical application of new 
materials within this area, and will support 
growth across our NanoTechnology 
Tools portfolio. 
We have made notable progress in establishing a more 
synergistic portfolio.

Advanced Materials where we can help 
customers lead the race to develop lighter, 
stronger, higher functioning and more 
affordable materials.
• This remains a core market for our 
businesses and we continue to build 
strong relationships with the leaders in this 
field, ranging from Nobel Prize winners 
through to Quality Assurance for leading 
manufacturers.
Quantum Technology is the exploitation of 
the regime where quantum effects dominate 
and radically change the ‘rule book’ of 
what is possible. For example, the quantum 
interaction between remote particles has 
the potential for new paradigms in secure 
communications, computing and sensors.
• Our cryogenics, advanced fabrication, 
imaging and characterisation capabilities 
are all critical to the advancement of 
this field.
Within our core markets, we have identified a 
number of niche segments that are particularly 
attractive to us, such as biodynamics, quantum 
computing and advanced batteries, where we 
will focus to gain competitive advantage.
As part of Horizon we have undertaken a 
strategic review of the growth opportunities, 
competitive landscapes and leadership 
capabilities across the Group to inform 
our portfolio management. We have 
made notable progress in establishing 
a more synergistic portfolio. In November, 
we announced the disposal of our 
Superconducting Wire business and since the 
year end we have announced the agreed sale 
of our Industrial Analysis business to Hitachi 
High‑Technologies. 
Horizon will change the way by which we 
operate and will embed clearly defined core 
capabilities across our businesses in the 
following areas: 
Market Intimacy: We will further develop 
in‑depth understanding of our customer 
segments and align our innovation and 
product development initiatives to customers’ 
strategic roadmaps.
Innovation and Product Development: 
We will focus our R&D investment on higher 
growth segments, prioritising our efforts 
on the most valuable product development 
opportunities. 
Customer Support: We will build on the 
growing customer demand and offer a 
higher level and broader range of services 
and support. 
Operational Excellence: We will drive 
improvements in cost, time and defects 
to become a more delivery and outcome 
focused business. 
Horizon will drive a culture of continuous 
improvement and best practice across all 
of our businesses, which will deliver clear 
competitive advantage and long‑term 
shareholder value. I am excited by the 
potential of the Horizon strategy which 
builds on our heritage and is the next stage 
in the evolution and commercialisation of 
Oxford Instruments.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Results
Looking back over the previous financial year, 
the Group delivered a stable performance, 
supported by stronger second‑half trading 
in line with our expectations and currency 
tailwinds. This was despite an uncertain 
macroeconomic background, which has seen 
a sustained period of slow global academic 
and R&D funding and continued softness 
across industrial end markets. 
Progress in the year has been underpinned 
by the continued strength and improved 
profitability across our NanoTechnology 
Tools Sector. Industrial Products delivered 
a steady performance against continued 
challenging end markets supported by new 
product launches. In our Service sector, the 
increased demand for services related to our 
own products was more than offset by the 
previously flagged weaker performance from 
our OI Healthcare business in the US.
Orders in the period increased by 4.3% 
to £350.7 million (2016: £336.1 million), 
orders at constant currency were down 
7.3%, predominantly due to lower orders 
in OI Healthcare and Industrial Analysis. 
Orders in NanoTechnology Tools increased 
by 7.9% but were marginally down on the 
previous year at constant currency. The order 
book for future deliveries at the end of the 
year increased by 9.3% to £144.5 million 
(2016: £132.2 million), representing a 
constant currency increase of 0.5% at a Group 
level and 0.5% and 5.0% for NanoTechnology 
Tools and Service respectively.
Reported revenue in the period was up 9.0% 
to £348.5 million (2016: £319.7 million), 
down 3.7% at constant currency, reflecting 
the weaker performance across our Industrial 
Products and OI Healthcare businesses. On a 
geographical basis, demand for our products 
reflected global trends in funding and capital 
expenditure, resulting in an exceptionally 
strong performance in Asia, growth in Europe 
and a relatively flat performance in the USA. 
Reported revenue grew in Europe, North 
America and Asia by 4.2%, 0.7% and 22.3% 
respectively. Revenue on a constant currency 
basis grew 7.2% in Asia supported by 
continued strong growth in China. Constant 
currency revenue declined in Europe by 
5.9% with growth in France and Germany 
being more than offset by reduced volumes 
from the Rest of Europe, principally from 
lower shipments from Plasma Technology, 
and it declined in North America by 12.0%, 
predominantly due to reduced volumes in 
OI Healthcare and Asylum Research.
Adjusted profit before tax from continuing 
operations increased by 7.1% to £36.0 million 
(2016: £33.6 million) with improvements 
across NanoTechnology Tools and Industrial 
Products more than offsetting a fall in Service. 
Adjusted operating profit margin fell to 
12.2% (2016: 12.9%) reflecting the reduced 
profit from OI Healthcare and the uplift to 
revenue due to the movement in currency 
exchange rates.
We recorded a loss before tax of £25.5 million 
after the impairment of non‑current assets 
and other adjusting items of £45.8 million, 
primarily reflecting deterioration in the 
financial performance from Asylum Research, 
OI Healthcare and our joint venture, 
ScientaOmicron. While we have plans 
that address the weaknesses and issues 
within all three businesses, the impairment 
reflects the actions and time required to 
improve profitability. 
Continuing adjusted basic EPS grew by 5.5% 
to 47.8 pence (2016: 45.3 pence). Basic EPS 
was a negative 44.0 pence (2016: 12.2 pence) 
after reflecting the impairments of non‑current 
assets and other adjusting items. 
Net debt at the end of the period fell to 
£109.3 million (2016: £128.2 million), largely 
due to good cash conversion and proceeds 
received from the sale of Superconducting 
Wire business in November 2016. 
Turning to the individual sectors: 
NanoTechnology Tools saw reported 
revenue growth of 11.4% to £208.7 million 
(2016: £187.4 million), adjusted operating 
profit grew 20.2% to £25.6 million 
(2016: £21.3 million), with an increase in 
adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points 
to 12.3%. The improved performance is 
due to the success of recently launched 
higher margin products across the portfolio 
combined with a focus on operational 
efficiencies. We continued to see enhanced 
performance from Andor Technology and 
NanoAnalysis; while Plasma Technology and 
NanoScience both continued to make progress 
in the year and contributed strongly to the 
improved performance. Asylum Research 
underperformed against the previous year 
having been disproportionally impacted 
by reduced academic funding levels and a 
delay in launching new products. As a result 
of prioritising investments and delivering 
operational efficiencies we expect to see an 
improvement in the profitability of the Asylum 
business, albeit still below original projections 
at the time of acquisition. 
Progress in the year has been underpinned by the 
continued strength and improved profitability across  
our NanoTechnology Tools Sector. 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information
Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 09
In Industrial Products, reported revenue 
increased by 5.0% to £56.7 million 
(2016: £54.0 million), excluding discontinued 
contributions from the Superconducting Wire 
business, which was divested in November. 
Reported adjusted operating profit increased 
to £1.7 million (2016: £1.1 million) with 
an associated increase of 100 basis points 
in adjusted operating margin to 3.0%. 
This represents a stable performance 
in the face of continued challenging 
end‑market conditions. 
In Service, reported revenue increased by 
6.1% to £83.2 million (2016: £78.4 million). 
This was driven by the increased demand 
for services relating to our own products. 
As previously flagged, the OI Healthcare 
business in the US, which offers refurbished 
imaging systems, mobile imaging solutions 
and maintenance services, had a slower year 
due to a change in the software licensing 
policy on second hand systems by one of the 
main system manufacturers. This significantly 
reduced the number of refurbished systems 
sold in the year and, despite improved profit 
and operational margin from the servicing of 
our own products, resulted in a fall in reported 
adjusted operating profit to £15.2 million 
(2016: £18.8 million). We have taken the 
necessary actions to align the business to the 
new software licensing model for refurbished 
imaging systems and the OI Healthcare 
business is now positioned to deliver an 
improved performance going forward. 
From a customer perspective, our end‑market 
distribution has remained relatively unchanged 
compared to the previous year. Over half of 
the Group’s revenue came from academic and 
commercial research customers, of which a 
quarter was engaged in Bio and Life Sciences. 
The Group continues to invest in future 
products and services and in the year we 
increased investment in R&D by 7.1% 
to £30.3 million (2016: £28.3 million). 
We monitor the proportion of our revenue 
which originates from products launched in 
the last three years (our Vitality Index). Our 
Vitality Index stands at 31%, and is in the 
range we expect from a high technology 
business. This reflects the continued strength 
of our existing leading products and the 
successful uptake of more recently launched 
products. Some of the new products launched 
in the year are outlined in the Operational 
Review. We continue to have a healthy 
pipeline of new products in development 
that push the boundaries of scientific 
understanding and technical performance 
and increase our market reach.
People
Our staff are central to the successful delivery 
of our Horizon strategy. We will focus on 
resourcing our core capabilities through the 
development of our existing workforce and 
targeted recruitment. 
To further support the delivery of Horizon, 
I have reshaped our Management Board. 
The Management Board develops and 
embeds our business processes across the 
Group and the new structure will drive the 
exploitation of synergies and efficiencies 
across our businesses. 
The progress we have made so far in our 
transformation is largely due to the talented 
workforce we have at Oxford Instruments. 
I would like to thank all our employees 
for their positive response to the new 
strategy and the resulting changes, their 
continued enthusiasm and their dedication 
to our customers.
Outlook
In a year of transition, the Group delivered a 
stable performance, supported by currency 
tailwinds. Whilst academic and R&D funding 
levels remain uncertain, we believe that 
progress with our strategic initiatives and 
favourable currency effects will deliver an 
outcome for the year in line with expectations.
Our focus is on markets with long‑term 
growth drivers where nanotechnology has 
the potential to address some of the world’s 
most complex and pressing challenges. 
Fundamental improvements to our structure, 
operations and strategy are underway 
and give us a solid platform to return to 
sustainable growth, at improved margins 
over the medium term.
