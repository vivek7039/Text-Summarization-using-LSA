STATEMENTS
The Group reported another strong 
performance in 2017 and delivered 
robust underlying growth in more 
confident global economies. The 
Board remains focused on executing 
the Group’s established strategy 
which is designed to deliver strong 
growth in earnings and shareholder 
value over the economic cycle.
The Group has a long track record 
of consistent delivery against its key 
performance metrics by compounding 
stable “GDP plus” underlying growth 
with carefully selected, value enhancing 
acquisitions, funded by the Group’s 
free cash flow. This strategy has been 
successfully designed and executed 
under the outstanding leadership of 
Bruce Thompson since he became 
CEO of Diploma PLC in 1996. Over the 
last 15 years, since emerging from a 
major restructuring of the Group led 
by Bruce, the Group has delivered 
strong double-digit growth in earnings, 
dividends and share price and has 
grown market capitalisation from ca. 
£60m to ca. £1.2bn today, without 
any new equity having been issued. 
In September of this year, the Board 
received notice from Bruce of his 
intention to retire as CEO before the 
end of 30 September 2018. This notice 
period ensures sufficient time to 
complete a thorough search process and 
a smooth transition of responsibilities. 
Bruce will be leaving the Group with a 
clearly defined and sustainable strategy, 
with a substantial runway for future 
growth and an experienced senior

long, healthy and well-earned retirement.
Results
Group revenues increased in 2017 by 
18% to £451.9m (2016: £382.6m), with 
the Group’s results again boosted by 
currency effects from translating the 
results of the overseas businesses, 
following the substantial depreciation 
in UK sterling. After adjusting for the 
contribution from acquisitions completed 
both this year and last year, net of a small 
disposal and for these currency effects on 
translation, Group revenues increased by 
7% on an underlying basis. The Controls 
businesses delivered robust underlying 
revenue growth of 14% and both the Life 
Sciences and Seals businesses reported 
a 4% growth in underlying revenues.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 
19% to £78.2m (2016: £65.7m) reflecting 
the strong growth in revenues and a 
small increase of 10bps in adjusted 
operating margins to 17.3% (2016: 17.2%). 
Adjusted profit before tax increased 
by 19% to £77.5m (2016: £64.9m) and 
adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) also 
increased by 19% to 49.8p (2016: 41.9p).
The Group’s free cash flow remained 
robust at £55.7m (2016: £59.0m) as 
working capital increased by £4.0m 
to support the stronger trading 
environment across the Group. Last year’s 
free cash flow included an inflow of £6.3m 
from reduced working capital and £4.6m 
of cash realised on the sale of assets. 
Capital expenditure of £3.3m (2016: £3.7m) 
remained at a similar level to last year. 
The Group has invested ca. £90m 
over three years in acquiring value 
enhancing businesses. However, 
expenditure on acquisitions slowed 
this year to £20.1m (2016: £32.7m) as 
some vendors postponed their exit 
plans in the face of a more favourable 
macroeconomic environment. There are 
still a number of good quality businesses 
in our acquisition pipeline which we 
are confident of completing when the 
vendors are ready to move forward. 
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
robust with cash funds at 30 September 
2017 of £22.3m (2016: £10.6m), after 
investing £20.1m in acquisitions and 
making distributions to shareholders of 
£23.5m (2016: £21.0m). The Group also 
has renewed committed bank facilities 
of £30m with an accordion option to 
extend these facilities up to £60m. 
Dividends
The combination of strong results and 
free cash flow, supported by a robust 
balance sheet has led the Board to 
recommend an increase in the final 
dividend of 16% to 16.0p per share 
(2016: 13.8p). Subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”), this dividend will be paid on 
24 January 2018 to shareholders on 
the register at 1 December 2017.
The total dividend per share for the 
year will be 23.0p (2016: 20.0p) which 
represents a 15% increase on 2016. 
With underlying adjusted earnings 
increasing by 19%, the level of 
dividend cover increases slightly to 
2.2 times on an adjusted EPS basis, 
from 2.1 times in recent years.
Governance
The Board’s Committees, led by the 
non-Executive Directors, have had 
a productive year. Anne Thorburn 
led the Audit Committee through 
an audit tender process which in 
September resulted in a proposal to 
appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as Company and Group auditor from 
next year. Andy Smith has also led the 
Remuneration Committee through 
a thorough review of the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy, in advance of the 
triennial vote by shareholders at the 
AGM on 17 January 2018. I have worked 
closely with Charles Packshaw as Senior 
Independent Director and with the 
Nomination Committee to commence 
a search for a new CEO to lead the 
Group, following the intended retirement 
of Bruce Thompson later in 2018.
 
Employees
Our employees remain our most 
important asset and their hard work 
continues to be a driving force behind 
our consistent and strong performance. 
Diploma is very much a people business 
and success is always a team effort. 
I wish to thank all of our employees 
for their support and contribution to 
the success of the Group this year.
Outlook
Diploma reported another strong 
performance in 2017, delivering 
strong double-digit growth in 
revenue and earnings. All of the 
Group’s Sectors contributed to this 
growth with a particularly strong 
performance from Controls. 
 
Principal corporate  
objectives
Achieve double-
digit growth in 
adjusted EPS over 
the business cycle
Generate TSR 
growth in the  
upper quartile of 
the FTSE 250
Deliver progressive 
dividend growth 
with two times 
dividend cover
The Group’s performance in 2017 
provides confidence in the Group’s 
prospects for solid underlying growth in 
the year ahead, which we aim to enhance 
by unlocking value enhancing acquisition 
opportunities. With a proven business 
model, broad geographic spread of 
businesses, robust balance sheet and 
consistently strong free cash flow, the 
Board is confident that further progress 
will be made in the next financial year.
