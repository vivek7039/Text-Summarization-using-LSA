An Excellent Performance in a 
Changing Market
Ultimate Products has delivered a strong 
financial performance this year, amid a period 
of significant change for the Group. Over the 
last five years, we have been building a market-
leading position in branded, value-focused 
and mass-market consumer goods for the UK 
consumer. 2017 has seen the results of this effort 
start to come to fruition. Following the IPO, we 
now have a strong platform from which to drive 
the next stage of Ultimate Products’ growth.
Performance
Group revenue rose 39.1 % to £110.0 m (FY 16: 
£79.0 m), and continued to be driven by three 
main factors:
1. growth in sales to discounters in the UK 
 and in Europe (up 64.6 % to £63.8 m);  
2. increased sales to the main UK 
 supermarkets (up 95.0 % to £10.3 m); and 
3. the emergence of online platforms as a new  
 revenue for the business (up 63.6 % to £4.6 m).
Underlying Profit Before Tax* was up 42.0 % 
to £10.7 m. Gross Margin was down by 1.6 % at 
22.3 % as a result of a higher mix of Free on 
Board (‘FOB’) business in the year and, for our 
Landed business, as a result of imported price 
inflation arising from a weakened Sterling.
Despite this, our Underlying EBITDA Margin*  
held firm at 10.5 % (up 0.1 %). This reflects:
1. the economies of scale from higher revenues; 
2. an increased proportion of FOB sales 
 (which is less overhead intensive), partially  
 
 offset by increased sales via online platforms 
 (which is more overhead intensive); and 
3. a more efficient operating model as the 
 focus on the Group’s brand portfolio, which  
 has led to an increase in repeat sales 
 and extended product life cycles.
Operational Overview
We have made solid operational progress 
across the business. The Group has continued 
to develop and expand the relationships with 
its core customer base of UK and European 
discounters. We have also made significant 
progress in Germany, with a number of major 
retail accounts opened and plans are well 
advanced to open a showroom there in CY 18. 
Other international developments include a 
new landed supply arrangement with a major 
European customer. This allows the Group 
to expand beyond its current limited product 
offering with the customer into other product 
categories, representing an exciting opportunity 
to continue to grow alongside one of the fastest 
expanding retailers in Europe, further cementing 
the Group's position as a key supplier to it. 
A particular highlight of the Group's branded 
product portfolio during the period has been 
the performance of Progress, the cookware and 
kitchen electrical brand, which is now listed with 
several retailers including, as of January 2018, a 
major UK supermarket.

UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc 
grew in the year by 63.6 % to £4.6 m and, 
while still a relatively small proportion of overall 
revenue at the moment, it is increasing in 
importance. Online is an exciting and fast 
growing part of the business and we are 
optimistic about its future prospects.
We are seeing some cost pressures coming 
through from China, where the bulk of our 
product is sourced. This has been caused by 
the strengthening of the Chinese currency and 
local regulatory changes.  However, we are 
confident in our ability to effectively manage this 
because of our experience over many years 
in that territory and our strong local presence 
through our office in Guangzhou.
Finally, the refurbishment of Ultimate Products' 
new 240,000 sq ft warehouse at Heron Mill 
in Oldham has been completed to plan and 
is now the Group's main distribution facility. 
The Board anticipates that this will create 
improved operational efficiencies and significant 
additional capacity to manage the future growth 
of the business.
Board Appointments
The Group's Board has been substantially 
strengthened through the appointments 
of James McCarthy as Chairman, Alan Rigby as 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and 
Robbie Bell as Non-Executive Director.
James McCarthy has over 40 years' experience 
in the fast-moving retail industry, having 
previously held the position of Chief Executive 
Officer of Poundland. He stepped down in 
September 2016 after a decade-long tenure 
during which the company's sales grew from 
£300 m to £1.3 bn per annum, whilst the number 
of stores increased from 150 to over 900. Prior 
to joining Poundland, James was Managing 
Director of Convenience at J Sainsbury plc and 
was a member of the company's operating, retail 
and investment boards.

Alan Rigby has spent the majority of his 
working career at HSBC plc, joining in 1975 and 
gaining broad experience through a range of 
management positions, including credit and risk, 
retail, commercial, large corporate and global 
banking markets.
Robbie Bell is the Chief Financial Officer of 
Welcome Break. Prior to that, he was the Chief 
Financial Officer of Screwfix, a subsidiary of 
Kingfisher plc. He was previously the UK Finance 
Director of Travelodge between 2006 and 
2008, having started his career at Whitbread plc 
before moving to Tesco plc.
Outlook & Market Environment
The Group operates primarily in the branded, 
value-focused consumer goods sector in the 
UK. Due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty 
and tougher trading conditions, retailers are 
generally exercising caution with regard to their 
non-food buying as we head towards the end 
of the calendar year. As a result, we are seeing 
retailers' reluctance to order too far forward 
and many are placing orders later or buying 
from stock. The lower volumes available to non-
food suppliers and retailers’ desire to minimise 
increases in retail prices is creating an even more 
competitive environment than normal. The Board 
therefore anticipates that revenue growth for FY 
18 is unlikely. In addition, approximately £4–5 m 
of FY 18's revenue will now be recognised in FY 
19 as a result of the move from FOB to landed 
arrangements with a key European customer. 
However, Ultimate Products is used to managing 
such challenging dynamics. Current trading is in 
line with expectations and the Board remains 
confident that the business will continue to 
deliver sustainable, long term growth. 
Summary
As one of the founders of the business, I am 
very proud of what Ultimate Products and its 
staff have achieved over this reporting period. 
To deliver such strong growth whilst at the same 
time adding a new and larger distribution centre, 
executing an IPO and maintaining an excellent 
service to our retailers shows what a high-
quality, flexible and resilient business Ultimate 
Products is.
In the short-term, this flexibility and resilience 
will be needed as UK retailers and consumers 
alike adapt to a new and more challenging 
environment. However, it should also be noted 
that in a market where people have less money 
to spend on general merchandise, we provide 
a compelling proposition to consumers and 
retailers alike – and we therefore continue to see 
substantial opportunities for the ongoing success 
of Ultimate Products.
