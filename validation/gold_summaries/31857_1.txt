Delivering on our strategy – three areas for growth 
Strong advances have been made this year 
across all three major strategic objectives. 
These are focused around three key pillars  
of growth: profitably expanding the existing 
European business; developing a strong 
product pipeline, and; preparing for product 
entry into the US market.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
“  A key aim of the 
management team is 
to leverage its current 
infrastructure and this 
is demonstrated by 
the strong increases in 
revenue and pre-R&D 
operating profit this 
year in comparison  
with the prior year. ”
infrastructure, further strengthening 
its supply chain and regulatory 
functions in anticipation of an 
increasingly regulated framework 
for allergy treatment across the EU 
and the US. The changes in the 
regulatory environment and a drive 
towards evidence-based products 
will be to the Group’s advantage. 
Increasing market share 
During the period, the Group 
continued to increase its market 
share in the markets in which we 
operate, driving this to 13% (2016: 
12%) against a broadly flat market 
backdrop. In the product portfolio, 
Pollinex Quattro continues to 
grow well as patients and allergists 
increasingly seek the benefits of 
our ultra-short course treatment 
programmes. Venomil, driven by 
raw material supply issues in the 
market also grew strongly. Acarovac 
Plus and Probiotics continued 
to gain market share with the 
former being the fastest growing 
component of the Spanish portfolio. 
Scaling up the business
A key aim of the management team 
is to leverage its current infrastructure 
and this is demonstrated by the 
strong increases in revenue and 
pre-R&D operating profit this year 
in comparison with the prior year. 
Pipeline – Phase III trial 
underway with broad 
programmes running 
During the year, the scientific team 
has been actively managing and 
preparing for a number of significant 
clinical trial. The Pollinex Quattro 
Birch Phase III trial received Clinical 
Trial Application (CTA) approval and 
recruitment is now well under way, 
with treatment of patients ongoing 
and read out expected in H2 2018. 
The Grass MATA MPL development 
is discussed in more detail below.  
If the Grass trials are successful,  
they will form part of 
both the German and US 
regulatory submissions.
The products in the German TAV 
process continue to progress well 
with plans for the start of clinical 
trials on the oral products and the 
injectable house dust mite product in 
a staggered process starting during 
the 2018 financial year. The German 
TAV process has the potential 
to boost sales of these products 
through additional clinical data as 
well as reducing the number of 
competing products in the market.
The Acarovac MPL product for house 
dust mite allergy has started Phase 
I trials in Spain using the Pollinex 
Quattro platform technology. This 
product, if successful through the 
trial programme, could become a 
global best-in-class product with 
the first short course subcutaneous 
treatment in a global market 
worth an estimated $3-4bn
1
.
The Polyvac Peanut product 
completed a positive pre-clinical 
trial showing impressive protective 
immunity with a single vaccination 
and no anaphylaxis. This product 
uses the virus like particle (VLP) 
technology that the business 
acquired to create a subcutaneous 
product that could offer long lasting 
protective immunity for subjects 
with peanut allergy, rather than 
just increasing tolerability in the 
case of accidental exposure. 
Team – expanding the 
scientific excellence 
In order to facilitate continued 
success in the clinical development 
programme, the Group is 
strengthening the organisation 
with expansion of the clinical 
team led by Murray Skinner, Chief 
Scientific Officer at the Group’s 
UK headquarters in Worthing. 
European business – 
milestone CAGR of 10% 
reached over past 18 years
The Group reached a significant 
milestone this year with compound 
annual growth over the past 18 
years of 10%. This reflects continued 
delivery of our focused growth 
strategy, innovative products and a 
robust business model that is resilient 
to major economic downturns and 
significant regulatory changes. 
The business achieved net sales 
of £64.1m, up 15%* at constant 
currency on the 2016 performance 
and up 32% in actual terms. 
Following on from the 16% 
underlying constant rate growth last 
year, this illustrates the strength of 
the Group’s portfolio of convenient, 
patient-friendly, technically advanced 
products and the skilled sales and 
marketing teams in the business. 
Whilst operating in a highly 
fragmented European allergy market, 
Allergy Therapeutics continues to 
benefit from its innovative approach 
within this marketplace and will look 
to build value for shareholders via 
suitable corporate development 
opportunities. The Group has 
also continued to invest in its

Strategic Report | Chief Executive Officer’s Review
The Group has underlined its 
commitment to clinical excellence 
by appointing Pieter-Jan de Kam as 
Clinical Director in mid-September. 
Pieter-Jan de Kam joined the Group 
from HAL Allergy in the Netherlands 
where he was responsible for clinical 
development with recent successes 
including European and US studies 
for pollen and house dust mites.
In addition to the appointment 
of Pieter-Jan, the Group has 
recruited Simon Piggott as Head 
of Clinical Science. Simon will be 
responsible for the delivery of a 
robust clinical strategy bridging the 
gap between the Groups’ existing 
product development teams and 
clinical departments. Simon has 
significant experience in successful 
development programmes from 
time spent at Novartis, GSK and 
most recently at Quintiles. Tim 
Higenbottam has been appointed 
to the role of Senior Pharmaceutical 
Physician and will focus on 
the US regulatory process.
The Group is continuing to invest in 
the R&D function to drive the key 
pipeline trials. The overall headcount 
in the research and development 
function within the Group has 
doubled in the last two years.
Publication of data – 
validating the Bencard 
Adjuvant Systems division
During the year, two papers were 
published in peer-reviewed journals 
reporting on new pre-clinical 
studies from the Group’s Bencard 
Adjuvant Systems (BAS) division. 
The two papers report that the novel 
depot adjuvant behind the Pollinex 
platform, micro-crystalline tyrosine 
(MCT), both alone and in an adjuvant 
system, have broad applications and 
elicit high, sustained antibody levels 
demonstrating enhanced protective 
efficacy compared to conventional 
adjuvants including aluminium. MCT 
has now been granted manufacturing 
patents in the US, Europe and Japan.
US market – changing 
environment will drive 
market share towards 
Allergy Therapeutics 
The US market for allergic rhinitis, 
which is estimated to be worth 
$2bn
1
, continues to evolve. The 
regulatory pressures in the US 
that the Group acknowledged last 
year are becoming stronger as the 
FDA and the US Pharmacopeial 
Convention (USP) set strict guidelines 
for compounding and dispensing of 
allergy products. These guidelines, 
if fully implemented, will drive the 
market towards pharmaceutical 
grade, centrally manufactured 
products that should benefit 
businesses, like Allergy Therapeutics, 
with GMP , MHRA approved facilities. 
Given the widespread adoption 
of subcutaneous immunotherapy 
(SCIT) treatments in the US, the 
oral products that are currently 
in the US market have so far not 
achieved a significant share leaving 
the market open for new entrants, 
such as Allergy Therapeutics, with 
the right products, manufacturing 
capability and commercial approach. 
The Group continues to prepare its 
portfolio of products for capturing 
the significant US market opportunity. 
The Grass MATA MPL product, 
which is in development, has 
completed a safety study relating 
to a new higher dose and the 
Phase II trial is expected to start in 
the autumn. Following completion 
of this trial, meetings with the 
regulatory authorities in the US and 
Germany will be necessary before 
it progresses to a Phase III trial. 
Outlook – confidence  
across the business 
Allergy Therapeutics’ management 
team expects 2018 to be a pivotal 
year with significant results due 
across a number of key programmes. 
Revenue for 2018 is again set 
to show continued growth at 
constant currency, driven by further 
penetration of the market by the 
Group’s convenient ultra-short course 
treatment. Gross margins are likely 
to improve slightly as volumes grow. 
Overheads will rise less in 2018 than 
they did in 2017 as investment slows, 
based on constant currency rates. 
However, as previously disclosed, we 
anticipate research and development 
expenditure is likely to almost double 
as the Group commences the PQ 
Birch Phase III and Grass MATA MPL 
Phase II studies and continues to 
invest in new product development. 
The Group expects the results of 
both the PQ Birch Phase III trial, 
the first pivotal Phase III trial for a 
Pollinex Quattro product in Europe, 
and the results of the Grass MATA 
MPL Phase II trial in H2 2018.
The Board and the executive team 
remain confident about the Group’s 
future growth potential and remain 
focused on generating significant 
value for shareholders given its 
continued sales momentum, the 
robust research pipeline progress 
driven by the strengthened research 
and development team and the 
potential of the US product portfolio 
as we prepare the ground for the 
future.
