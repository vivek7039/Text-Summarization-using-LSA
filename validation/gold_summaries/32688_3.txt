Directors’ report
Governance
Chairman’s  
statement
2017 has been a year of political and economic 
uncertainty with a constantly changing 
macroeconomic backdrop. With a sharper 
focus on risk management and mitigation, 
the Redefine International Board remains 
confident that it has the right strategy to 
sustain the Company through potential 
uncertainties ahead, whilst continuing to 
provide our shareholders with market-leading 
income returns.
During the year the Board has sought 
to strengthen the portfolio, through the 
recycling of assets with lower rental or growth 
potential, in favour of assets with stronger 
property fundamentals and longer-term 
growth prospects. Disposal proceeds have 
largely been reinvested or used to reduce 
gearing. Refinancing initiatives have broadly 
been concluded at lower levels of gearing 
and resulted in a reduced cost of debt and a 
stronger capital structure. 
Communication of the Company’s strategy 
was conveyed to shareholders at the Capital 
Markets Day in February, which was well 
attended and received. The Board’s decision 
to rebase the dividend to better align earnings 
with operating cash flow has been clearly set 
out and communicated. The Company has 
made significant progress in becoming the 
UK’s leading income focused REIT.
On 1 December 2017, the Company will be 
rebranded to Real Estate Diversified Income 
REIT, or RDI REIT. The purpose of rebranding 
is to ensure the Company has a clear and 
independent identity as well as supporting 
better communication with stakeholders.
Greg Clarke
Chairman of the Board
Through communication with its wider 
stakeholder base, the Company strives 
to improve both our buildings and the 
environments they provide whilst contributing 
where possible to communities in which 
we operate. We endeavour to ensure that 
our suppliers adhere to a strict code of 
ethics and undertake to pay them fairly and 
within agreed timeframes. We build strong 
relationships with our lenders and deal with 
them in an open and transparent manner. 
We encourage openness amongst our 
employees and listen to their concerns, while 
supporting them to develop their careers 
and work-life balance through training and 
transition through various stages in their lives.
At the heart of our success is our culture. 
Both internally and externally, the Company 
is considered agile and experienced, 
hands on, proactive, efficient, personable 
and approachable. The personable and 
experienced nature of the Board and its 
executive has resulted in a strong leadership 
team. A team that is relentlessly inquisitive, 
seeking out new opportunities with agility 
enabling opportunities to be harnessed. 
Boardroom culture is good natured and 
constructive and relationships between 
executives and non-executives are good, 
although with the uncertainty of the 
political and economic environment, the 
non-executives have been increasingly 
challenging management to ensure that 
the long-term success of the Company has 
been properly considered. An analysis was 
conducted in January to record how Redefine 
International should react to a range of 
different scenarios that could be faced by 
the Company in the next few years. The 
Board evaluation conducted at year end 
showed that Directors wanted more time set 
aside to review strategy, to ensure that the 
current model remains fit for purpose in the 
constantly changing economic environment.
As Chairman of the Board and Nominations 
Committee, I have sought to expand the 
experience and diversity of the Board and  
I am confident that the appointment of a  
new Non-executive Director will be announced 
before the end of the calendar year which 
will further enhance the strength of the 
Board. Succession planning for the executives 
and committee chairs will be a focus area 
during 2018. Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 61
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
I thank shareholders for their support of the 
Company’s new Remuneration Policy, which 
was approved at the AGM in January 2017. 
During 2016 the CEO received 62 per cent 
of his target income, considerably below 
comparable peers. The policy was amended 
following a strategic review to ensure closer 
alignment between remuneration, strategy 
and shareholder returns. The new policy 
provides the executives with a fair and 
balanced package that motivates performance 
and rewards results. 
For the first time this year, the Company will 
be reporting under the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) and the Audit 
and Risk Committee adopted new model 
terms of reference to comply with the 
provisions of the new Code, FRC guidance and 
revised ethical standards published earlier 
this year. Focus areas for the committee this 
year have been to oversee compliance and 
regulatory change, improvement in internal 
controls and risk reporting.
With robust corporate governance, a strong 
Board and strategy, I am pleased to report 
that the Company has delivered a solid set of 
results and is well positioned to look to the 
future with confidence. 
Full details of the Company’s operations have 
been laid out in this Annual Report, which the 
Board has reviewed and considers to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
shareholders with the necessary information 
with which to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and 
strategy. The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote to adopt the Annual Report 
and support the re-election of the Board at 
the AGM to be held on 25 January 2018, where 
Directors will be available to answer any 
questions shareholders may have regarding 
the operation of their Company.
I have informed the Board that I intend to 
step down as Chairman during 2018. The 
exact timing will be determined by the 
process to recruit a new Chair and execute 
an appropriate handover. 
By this time I will have been Chairman of 
Redefine International for seven years, during 
which time we have domiciled to London, 
become a REIT and entered the FTSE 250. 
I consider it time to move on and for a new 
Chair to oversee the next exciting phase of 
Redefine International’s future.

Corporate governance statement 
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (the “Code”)
Redefine International is a UK-REIT with a 
premium listing on the Main Market of the LSE 
and a secondary listing on the “Real Estate – 
Real Estate Holding and Development” sector 
of the Main Board of the JSE. The Company 
was incorporated in the Isle of Man with 
registered number 111198C in 2004 and was 
re-registered under the Isle of Man Companies 
Act 2006 in December 2013, with registered 
number 010534V. The Company’s home state 
is the United Kingdom.
Further to the secondary listing of the 
Company in South Africa on 28 October 2013, 
the JSE accepted that Redefine International 
will primarily comply with the Code as 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in April 2016 (www.frc.org.uk) as opposed 
to the provisions of the King IV Report on 
Governance for South Africa 2016. It should 
be noted that during the reporting year ended 
31 August 2017 and up to the date of this 
document the Company has complied with all 
of the Code principles, but has not complied 
with the following Code provisions: 
a. Code B.1.2. Half of the Board should 
comprise independent Non-executive 
Directors. 
  Explanation: At year end, the Board 
comprised four executives, four 
independent non-executives and two 
non-executives who represent the major 
shareholder, Redefine Properties Limited. 
  Although the composition fails to meet 
the provisions of the Code, the Board 
structure does meet the Code principles, 
with no block of individuals dominating 
the decision making and includes an 
appropriate combination of Executive 
and Non-executive Directors. With an 
additional appointment expected by 
the end of the year, the balance will 
be improved, but in order to reach the 
required Board composition another 
independent Non-executive Director would 
need to be appointed, taking the Board 
size to 13, which is considered too large. 
  It should be noted that to ensure that 
there is enough independent oversight 
of related party transactions, a committee 
comprising solely of independent 
Directors has been established to review 
such matters before deciding whether a 
transaction can progress to the Board for 
final consideration. 
b. Code B.2.3: Non-executive Directors 
should be appointed for a specified term.
  Explanation: Directors are appointed for 
a term which expires when either the 
Director (i) is not re-appointed following 
retirement, (ii) is removed or vacates office, 
(iii) resigns or does not offer himself  
for re-election, or (iv) terminates his 
appointment on three months’ notice. 
It should be noted, that, as a FTSE 250 
company, all Directors are subject to annual 
re-election and therefore it is considered 
that the Company’s terms are appropriate.
c. Code E2.4: Notice of general meetings.
  Explanation: The EGM held on 25 April 
2017, regarding the acquisition of the 
German supermarket Portfolio, was held 
on 14 clear days notice in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association, 
rather than the 14 business days 
required by the Code. This was due to the 
transaction being time sensitive and the 
Board was mindful that any delay would 
cause a transactional risk. 
Compliance with the Listing Rules
During the reporting year, Redefine Properties 
Limited was regarded as a controlling 
shareholder of the Company in accordance 
with LR 6.1.2A. As a Chapter 6 Company with a 
controlling shareholder, Redefine International 
has complied with LR 9.8.4 R (14):
1.  The Company entered into a relationship 
Agreement with Redefine Properties on 
17 November 2014 (the “Agreement”) and 
the Board confirms that during the period 
under review:
a. the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included in 
the Agreement;
b. as far as the Company is aware, 
Redefine Properties has complied with 
the independence provisions included 
in the Agreement; and 
c. the election and re-election of 
independent Directors at the AGM held 
on 23 January 2017 was conducted in 
accordance with the election provisions 
of LR 9.2.2.E and LR 9.2.2F R and 
approved by:
i. the shareholders of the Company; 
and
ii. the independent shareholders of 
the Company.
2.  No independent Director has declined to 
support the statements in (1) above.
Compliance with the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules
