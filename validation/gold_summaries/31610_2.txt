: £61m
In December 2016, DMGT reduced its stake in Euromoney from c.67% to c.49% and Euromoney ceased to be a subsidiary of DMGT 
and became an associate. To allow a like-for-like comparison, FY 2016 pro forma results have been presented based on a c.67% stake 
in Euromoney during the first quarter of the year and a c.49% stake during the final three quarters, consistent with the actual holding 
during FY 2017. Underlying revenue and operating profit growth rates exclude Euromoney. The results of Euromoney are described 
within the JVs & Associates section of this Annual Report on page 24.
*  These are adjusted results see pages 29 to 31 for more detailed tables and explanations.
Ω  Pro forma FY 2016 figures have been restated to treat Euromoney as a c.67% owned subsidiary during the first three months and as a c.49% owned associate during the nine months to 
September 2016, consistent with the ownership profile during FY 2017. See reconciliation on page 28.
