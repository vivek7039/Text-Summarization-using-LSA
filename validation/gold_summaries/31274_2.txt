About WideCells
WideCells Group PLC is building an integrated stem cell services company, focused on
making stem cell treatments accessible and affordable. The Directors believe that the
use of cord blood stem cells for transplant will drive one of the next important phases
in medicine and the Group is developing market leading products in complementary,
strategic areas which are designed to take advantage of substantial market
opportunities in one of the fastest growing segments in the healthcare industry.
Keeping this in mind, WideCells Group PLC has been developing its three divisions:
• CellPlan: The world’s ﬁrst stem cell healthcare insurance plan providing ﬁnancial
cover for a second medical opinion and recommendation of the best transplant
centre worldwide, private cord blood transplantation costs, travel to treatment
centre where required, accommodation expenses and concierge service to manage
the whole transplant process.
• WideCells: The WideCells Institute of Stem Cell Technology (ISCT) has been
established and is based in the University of Manchester Innovation Centre. The
focus is on stem cell research and regenerative medicine. The WideCells ISCT also
has a Cryogenics division specialising in cell freezing and long term stem cell
storage.
• Wideacademy: An education and training division to promote understanding of the
beneﬁts of stem cell storage and treatment across the global medical, patient and
cord blood client and lay community.
To support the growth of these divisions, WideCells Group has built an experienced
Board and Senior Management Team, which was strengthened during the period
through the appointment of three new board members and the creation of a new
Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee.
Cord Blood Stem Cell Facts:
• Umbilical cord blood (the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta
following the birth of a baby) provides the most effective source of haemopoietic
stem cells for families. Collection of cord blood at birth is simple, safe and painless
compared to other sources of haemopoietic stem cells such as bone marrow,
which requires a general anaesthetic and a surgical procedure to collect. WideCells
is focused on promoting the collection and storage of umbilical cord blood and
tissue.
• Since 2005, there has been a 300% increase in the number of illnesses that can be
treated using cord blood stem cells reﬂecting its use in the treatment of blood
disorders.
• Cord blood is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of cerebral palsy which is a
neurological disorder.
• 82 different blood disorders have been treated using cord blood stem cell
transplantation.
• Despite initial cord blood collection, processing and storage often costing no more
than a few thousand pounds, cord blood stem cell transplantation for blood
disorders costs hundreds of thousands of pounds.
