 SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 9
chief executive officer’s report
Introduction
The year to 31 March 2017 has been a year of both significant progress and change for SysGroup plc.
The acquisition of System Professional Ltd (“Sys-Pro”) in July 2016 and subsequent disposal of the SME Mass Market 
business unit in the same month marked the firm transition to a Cloud and Managed Services business.
These were large undertakings for our business as firstly we acquired a business which had higher revenue and staff 
numbers than ourselves and then disposed of a business which represented almost half of the Group’s size, before the 
acquisition of Sys-Pro.
Subsequent to the transactions, we reorganised the combined businesses and made several changes to the management 
team.  We have created internal teams for managing the integration and have created liaisons between teams to maximise 
the cross-selling opportunity to customers to take advantage of the increased range of services from our growing product 
portfolio.
Not only did this work to create a business that is now focused on Managed Services with a cloud bias but it allowed us to 
put in place the foundations to better take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves in this growing market.
The above corporate activity was in line with the Board’s stated strategy to exit from a light-touch, low margin and high 
volume mass hosting market, which was largely commoditised and subject to high customer churn, to a business focused 
exclusively on providing higher value Managed Services.
Notwithstanding the management time that was involved in this, we maintained focus on the core business and delivered 
results in line with market expectations for FY 2017.
Our revenues (from continuing and discontinued operations) in the year were £7.87m, an increase of 65.3% on the 
previous year (2016: £4.76m).  Our adjusted EBITDA (from continuing and discontinued operations) increased by 22.7% to 
£0.81m (2016: £0.66m) and our adjusted profit before tax increased from £0.31m in 2016 to £0.45m representing a 45.2% 
increase. At the year-end, we had a healthy net cash position of £3.07m.
We believe that the foundations are now firmly laid for us to capture growth in our chosen markets and complement these 
with carefully considered acquisitions.
Market
The market for managed and cloud services is large and long term, driven by the structural move to cloud delivered 
solutions and IT outsourcing in general. IT is no longer seen as a cost base but is something which can really help drive 
profits and efficiencies in businesses, and corporations are embracing technologies that will put them at a commercial 
advantage compared with a competitor.
This desire to embrace the best of breed technologies which can drive these efficiencies means that knowledge of 
better, more cost effective, reliable and secure solutions in a changing environment drives customers to partner with us 
as we help guide and advise them along their journey.  We become part of our customers’ IT function and our close and 
increasing engagement with them is demonstrated by an overall net increase in customer spend year on year for the past 
three years.
strategic report SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 10
Our Managed Service offerings include all forms of Cloud hosting (private, public and hybrid) but also outsourced service 
desk and various IT consulting services including public cloud (Azure and AWS services).  Our Managed Services revenue 
is predominantly derived from Cloud and this element of our service is growing at the fastest rate, with organic growth of 
19.8% in 2017.
Strategy
SysGroup’s clear focus is to expand its position as a trusted provider of managed services and expert IT consultancy 
to clients in the UK and Ireland. We have positioned the Group as an extension to a customer’s existing IT department 
guiding them through the complexities and developments in the market.
Our target market is servicing the UK corporate sector that has traditionally managed and housed their own IT 
infrastructure on premise.  We operate in a variety of vertical sectors but have weighting in not for profit, education, health 
services, financial services, insurance, technology and merchant and distribution sectors with a variety of well-known 
clients in these verticals.
Being a Visa Level 1 PCI-DSS service provider (highest level) and with our ISO9001 and ISO27001 credentials we are an 
attractive partner to anyone who wishes to ensure platforms are built and maintained to the highest of security standards.
Our IT consulting services often result in customers taking Cloud services from us, and the legacy VAR (Value Added 
Reseller) element of the Sys-Pro business provides a feeder of cloud and managed service opportunities as customers 
favour OPEX over CAPEX models and the flexibilities that offers.
Along with seeking to engage with larger spending customers who have a specific need for a large custom built cloud 
platform we also seek to engage with customers in our chosen markets who are at different stages of their IT journey.  
This can initially be by partnering with us for functions like our monitoring services, remote service desk, backup and 
disaster recovery services.  As our customers develop, the opportunity grows and results in more of their services 
being outsourced to us. The result is that these customers can be very sticky in nature as the increased level of services 
provided by the Group creates a greater reliance on the Group and significant barrier to entry for competitors. Customers 
typically sign up for a contract period of one to three years, with larger contracts tending to be three years.
We intend to supplement our organic growth with carefully considered acquisitions.
Acquisitions
In July 2016 the Group acquired Sys-Pro for an initial consideration of £4.0m, paid 85% cash and 15% in new ordinary 
shares at 60 pence per share,  funded by way of a placing raising £5.0m gross. There have been certain operational 
challenges at Sys-Pro since its acquisition but overall integration of the business into the Group is continuing and was 
accelerated just prior to the year end, with a number of important milestones already reached.
During the period the Group secured new banking facilities with Santander UK plc. The facilities comprise a £2.5m 
Revolving Credit Term Loan Facility to finance acquisitions alongside a £0.5 million overdraft facility and a £0.5m finance 
leasing facility.  
In line with the Group’s stated growth strategy, the Board remains alert to strategic acquisition opportunities to supplement 
organic growth. In a fragmented market, we believe we are well placed to make further astute acquisitions given our size 
and funding availability.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 11
Disposal
On 22 July 2016 the Group announced the disposal of its SME Mass Market business for a total consideration of £2.7m in 
cash, less an amount of £0.5m in respect of advance receipts/payments.
As this business was based in the Group’s former head office in Nottingham a necessary reorganisation occurred and a 
new finance function was established in the Liverpool office of the Group.  
Operational Review
All of the Group’s activities relate to delivering IT Managed Services with a Cloud bias along with consulting.  The Group 
is segmented into Managed Services, VAR and SME Mass Market.  The SME Mass Market division was discontinued 
following completion of the disposal of this division on 18 July 2016, and is therefore shown as discontinued in the table 
below.  Managed Services segment consists of all the activities of Netplan Internet Solutions Ltd and that of Sys-Pro but 
excluding its VAR business.
The SME Mass Market and System Professional Ltd businesses are included in the results to their respective date of 
disposal or acquisition.
We have introduced a new operating segment of VAR. This is legacy activity from which Sys-Pro built its business.  
Traditionally Sys-Pro was a provider of hardware and software but has followed the transformation to Cloud and IT 
Managed Services and was at the beginning but established level of the curve in converting its traditional ‘on premise’ 
customers to Cloud delivered solutions.  We continue our work educating our traditional customers of the benefits of Cloud 
delivered services and the concept of moving from a CAPEX to an OPEX model.  Market drivers and overall trend underline 
the substantial opportunity to us in this base.  We expect the VAR segment to decrease as customers continue to shift to 
Managed Services.

Key Performance Indicator Review
Revenue Growth 2017 2016
Revenue (continuing) £7.165m £2.515m
Growth 184.9% 22.0%
Revenue from continuing operations grew by 184.9% driven by Managed Services and the acquisition of System 
Professional Ltd.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 12
Adjusted EBITDA (including discontinued activities) improved 22.7% to £0.81m (2016: £0.66m).
The growth in Adjusted EBITDA is a combination of improved performance from the Netplan business unit and from 
contribution from Sys-Pro (acquired in the period)
Performance Review
Group revenue for the year grew by 65.3% to £7.865m for the year to 31 March 2017 (2016: £4.764m). Revenue growth 
was driven by the Managed Services division, which consists of the Netplan brand (incorporating Q4Ex) and the System 
Professional brand (acquired in the year), contributing revenues of £7.165m (2016: £2.52m).  The SME Mass Market division 
generated revenues of £0.7m (2016: £2.2m) before being divested. 
We continue to have good visibility of future revenues as the vast majority of our customers have entered into multi-year 
contracts. As at 31 March 2017 there is £0.47m of deferred revenue (2016: £0.71m) which will be released to profit in future 
periods. 
Gross profit for the year on continuing and discontinued operations was £4.82m (2016: £3.01m) representing a gross 
margin of 61.3% (2016: 63.2%). The reduction in gross margin is attributable to the change of sales mix during the year and 
the slower conversion of Sys-Pro VAR customers into Managed Services revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year to 31 March 2017 is 
£0.81m (2016: £0.67m).  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated after excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, share based 
payment costs and fair value adjustments.  The Directors consider that an adjusted EBITDA figure is a more appropriate 
measure of the underlying performance of the business.
Balance Sheet
Net cash inflow from operating activities during the year amounted to £1.22m (2016: £0.65m). Cash at bank at 31 March 
2017 was £3.47m (2016: £0.51m).
 
Payables falling due within one year are reported at £2.36m (2016: £1.64m). This figure includes an amount of £0.47m 
(2016: £0.71m) for deferred revenue which will be released to profit in future years. 
Contingent consideration payable on the System Professional Ltd acquisition of £0.69m (2016: nil), which is the fair value of 
the amounts payable in shares, is included within liabilities falling due after more than one year. Contingent consideration 
on the acquisition of Q4Ex Ltd has now been fully settled given all performance criteria were satisfied.
Based on certain performance criteria, the vendors of Sys-Pro could be due further consideration of up to £1.865m. At 
the year-end the fair value of the contingent consideration stood at £0.69m.  Post period end however this has now been 
settled by a one-off payment of £150,000.  This is a post balance sheet event and has also removed some operational 
challenges by removing certain approval processes required with the vendors allowing for integration to be accelerated 
and is explained in more detail in note 24.
The Directors are confident there is sufficient working capital within the Group.  The Group also has surplus cash, is 
cash generative and has £3.0m of committed but undrawn banking facilities (which includes a £2.5m acquisition facility).  
However, should accretive acquisitions become available to the Group that cannot be met from existing resources (or with 
enough headroom comfort), the Group may seek to raise additional finance either through debt, equity or a mixture of the 
two. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 13
Our People
Our people are very highly valued and the Directors place considerable emphasis on employees sharing in the success of 
the Group. This is achieved through the participation in share option schemes. Due to the nature and size of the business, 
employees are constantly encouraged to communicate with the Group’s senior management to discuss business issues 
and potential improvements.
It is the policy of the Group that there should be no unfair discrimination in recruiting and promoting staff, including 
applicants who are disabled. The Directors are committed to maintaining and developing communication and consultation 
processes with employees, who in turn are encouraged to develop an awareness of the issues affecting the Group.

Infrastructure and Technology
During the year, we invested in our capabilities and have begun deploying Cloud services from a newly fitted out location 
on our network in a datacentre in Manchester.  We are utilising ‘hyper-scale’ technologies that the likes of Facebook, 
Microsoft and Amazon utilise, such as software defined networking and continuous integration.  These technologies allow 
us to automatically roll-out a whole network deployment and virtual machine build in minutes whilst continuous integration 
means we can test changes in a virtual environment before pushing these to a live environment, minimising ‘change 
control’ risks.
Our work and contribution to the CEPH OpenSource community gained us recognition for the development of an industry 
leading low cost storage solution which lead us to become the first VEEAM accredited service partner in the UK.  We will 
continue our R&D efforts and bring new and interesting services to our customers.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
In line with the nature, size and complexity of the business the senior management team work very closely to identify and 
evaluate areas of risk whilst developing and monitoring action plans to deal with any potential threats.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14
All outcomes are reported to the Board and support is given as necessary to ensure actions are carried out.
Identifiable areas of risk include:
• Dependency on key suppliers – the Group is dependent on certain key suppliers for the continued operation of its 
business, the most significant of which are the supply of third party software and datacentre services. If any of these 
suppliers fail in the provision of their services it may have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to provide services 
to its customers. However, the Group continually assess suppliers for both price competitiveness and technical 
innovation and are confident that alternative providers could be found.
• Customer retention – the Group provides an essential service to its customers. Any diminution in service levels could 
impact customer retention levels. However, the Group constantly monitors service levels and the low level of customer 
attrition is evidence of the Group’s ability to provide the level of service required.
• Network – the datacentres we utilise are linked by fibre that we lease.  Should the network fail there would be an 
adverse impact on the service provided to our customers.  The Group has designed its network to have no single 
point of failure, it connects with transit providers at different geographical locations.
• Employees – the Group is a service organisation and as such, is dependent on the skills, knowledge and commitment 
of its staff. The performance of the Group is dependent on retaining its staff. We mitigate this risk by offering 
competitive reward packages.
• Search engine optimisation – a significant amount of the Group’s sales revenues are generated from customers using 
internet search engines.  Should the Group’s search engine optimisation performance deteriorate, this could have an 
adverse impact on Group revenue.  The Group continually monitors the position of its websites with respect to these 
search engines.  The Group has experienced staff that work with specialist agencies to maintain or enhance the 
position of its websites for inclusion in search results.
• Acquisitions – the Group has stated that its strategy is to continue to make acquisitions to strengthen its growth. 
The risk is that we may not be able to find suitable acquisition targets. We mitigate this risk by regularly conducting 
searches for targets and also retain advisers who introduce targets.
Summary and Outlook
We are pleased with our results, delivered in a year of both significant progress and change for the Group. We have 
achieved our objectives of fundamentally transforming the business to focus on high growth managed services whilst 
delivering enhanced profitability and results in line with market expectations, while at the same time integrating a large 
acquisition. Our sales pipeline has grown by 28.8% from 30 September 2016 to £3.49m at 31 March 2017, showing the 
tangible impact of our growth strategy. 
Due to operational challenges at Sys-Pro since its acquisition the Group expects growth to be slower than originally 
expected for FY 2018. The Board have taken the necessary remedial steps and following entry into the deed of variation 
with the vendors of Sys- Pro, the management team has the ability to accelerate the integration process. 
Our new management structure and internal teams will support further organic and acquisitive growth and given our 
healthy levels of recurring revenue and long term contracts with key customers, coupled with our cash generation, we are 
well placed to capture market opportunity.
We look forward to the future with confidence.
This Strategic Report was approved and signed by order of the board.
