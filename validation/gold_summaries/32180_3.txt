 Performance
Notwithstanding some uncertainty created by 
the outcome of the EU referendum, we have 
experienced robust demand for our homes from 
individual investors and owner-occupiers. Our ability 
to deliver forward sold homes to our customers 
on programme, together with a step change in our 
presence in the build to rent sector, saw Telford 
Homes achieving excellent results for the year to 
31 March 2017.  I am particularly pleased that we 
achieved a 99 per cent customer recommendation 
rate in 2016, a notable endorsement of our 
commitment to quality and service. 
Since February 2016 we have exchanged contracts 
on four significant build to rent transactions with 
a range of investors, indicative of our growing 
reputation in the sector as a trusted delivery partner.  
Along with monitoring external influences on the 
Group, the development of our build to rent strategy 
has been one of the principal areas of focus for 
the Board this year.  This sector complements our 
historic focus on individual sales to investors and 
owner-occupiers and is well aligned with our forward 
selling philosophy.  The attractive return on capital 
and lower risk profile associated with build to rent 
'We are well positioned to continue the growth of Telford 
Homes thanks to the strength of our performance in the 
undersupplied non-prime London housing market and  
our increasing activity in the build to rent sector.'

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
DEVELOPING IN LONDON: 
A STRONG PERFORMANCE
will facilitate accelerated growth for Telford Homes, 
although the Board remains mindful of ensuring  
the business grows in a controlled manner in order 
that our high standards of operational performance 
are upheld.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to declare a final dividend 
of 8.5 pence per share, making a total of 15.7 
pence per share for the year, an increase of just 
over 10 per cent compared with the previous 
year (2016: 14.2 pence).  Our policy is to pay one 
third of earnings as dividends in each financial 
year.  For the year to 31 March 2017 however, 
the Board has fulfilled its promise to increase the 
dividend payment above that level in order to offset 
the dilution in earnings resulting from the equity 
placing in late 2015.  Therefore, the interim dividend 
together with the full year dividend equates to 
over 40 per cent of earnings for this financial year.  
The final dividend will be paid on 14 July 2017 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 16 June 2017.  The ex-dividend date is 
therefore 15 June 2017.
Culture and values
I have always been proud of the single team culture 
and strong values of Telford Homes.  In the last year 
we have recruited talented people from outside 
of the business at levels not seen previously.  As 
Telford Homes continues to grow and our strategy 
evolves, there is a need to ensure that the culture 
that has made the business so successful to date is 
preserved, yet able to adapt to the requirements of a 
larger organisation.  For this reason, the Group plans 
to review its corporate vision, mission and values 
during 2017 to ensure these reflect the evolving 
position of the business and allow us to capitalise  
on the opportunities that lie ahead.
06 In a year that has seen strong operational growth, our 
admirable health and safety record merits mention.  
Health and safety is the first item on the agenda at 
monthly Board meetings and our performance is 
testament to the sound policies and procedures 
in place, as well as the deep-rooted sense of 
responsibility that pervades the organisation.
Another core principle in our approach is the 
emphasis placed upon sustainability.  Although 
this has been a consideration in the Group’s way of 
operating for some years, following the appointment 
in 2016 of a Head of Sustainability, the philosophy  
has been formalised into our ‘Building a Living 
Legacy’ strategy.  A number of core targets have 
been established within this strategy and we are 
committed to achieving these in the coming years.
Outlook 
I am delighted to be able to look back on another 
excellent year, and, on behalf of the Board, I wish 
to thank all our employees for their hard work in 
delivering these results.  I am excited by the strength 
of our development pipeline and the promising 
opportunities that lie ahead for Telford Homes to 
play an increasing role in meeting the need for new 
homes in London.
