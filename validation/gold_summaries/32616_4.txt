The Group’s strategic focus centres on two 
key pillars represented by the Specials and 
Niche Pharmaceuticals (‘Niche’) divisions.
Specials
Manufacture and supply
The Specials division operates in the UK’s 
specials market where it manufactures, 
procures and supplies unlicensed medicines 
and imported medicines licensed abroad 
(collectively referred to as ‘specials’), and 
special obtains. Its customers include the 
main wholesale and retail pharmacy chains in 
the UK, with a number of these relationships 
underpinned by exclusive supply agreements, 
as well as hospitals. The division also operates 
a dedicated aseptics compounding unit that 
manufactures bespoke intravenous specials  
to order.
The Specials division responds to prescription 
requests from healthcare professionals. It can 
deliver bespoke specials across a variety of 
dosage forms and strengths in as little as  
15 hours through its in-house, state-of-the-art 
compounding and manufacturing facilities.
The division therefore occupies a leading 
position in the specials market that enables it  
to track shifts in demand for medicines across 
the community and hospital pharmacy sectors.
Niche
Develop and supply
The Niche division uses this insight into the 
specials market, together with other data, to 
identify where patient demand for a particular 
special is high. These products are assessed 
to determine their suitability to enter the Group’s 
product development and licensing pipeline. 
The Niche division benefits from an in-house 
product development capability that manages 
the Group’s development pipeline alongside  
a range of projects for third-party customers.
Licensing products, particularly those 
currently prescribed as specials, represents  
a growth opportunity for the Group. For more 
information of the UK’s prescribing hierarchy 
and the role of specials and licensed products 
within the healthcare industry, turn to page 6.
Medication Adherence
Homecare and medication management
The Group’s visibility over prescribing  
trends and growth medicines has been 
complemented by the Medication Adherence 
division, which dispenses and supplies 
medicines into the homecare market and 
provides medication management services 
through its innovative multi-dose tray system.
Following implementation of the Group’s new 
strategy during the second half of this year, 
which aims to tighten focus on the growth 
opportunities available to the Specials and 
Niche divisions, the long-term fit of Medication 
Adherence within the Group is under review.  
A more detailed explanation of the Group’s 
new strategy is included in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s review on page 10, and in the strategy 
summary on page 18.

Specials 
The Specials division comprises 
three business units that 
manufacture, procure and supply 
unlicensed medicines, special 
obtains and imported medicines 
licensed abroad.
Niche  
Pharmaceuticals
The Niche Pharmaceuticals 
division comprises three business 
units that develop, license and 
commercialise medicines with  
a particular focus on those 
currently prescribed as specials.
Medication  
Adherence
The Medication Adherence division 
comprises two business units that 
provide products and services to 
support patients in adhering to their 
medication regime, patient-focused 
homecare services and services  
to pharmaceutical companies.
The Specials division is the most 
established of all the divisions, is profitable 
and cash generative and provides the 
Group with a strong platform. Around 89% 
of unlicensed medicines and special 
obtains volumes supplied into the retail and 
wholesale pharmacy markets are under 
exclusive supply contracts with customers. 
Key developments
• Unlicensed medicines and special obtains 
volumes grew moderately despite market 
and competitive pressure.
• Sales volumes of imported licensed 
medicines into the hospital sector 
also grew.
• New five-year contract extension signed 
with AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited, the 
UK’s leading pharmaceutical wholesaler.
• Contract renewals with Phoenix 
Healthcare Distribution Limited and 
Bestway Panacea Healthcare Limited 
(trading as Well Pharmacy) also secured 
on a long-term basis after the year-end.
• Contract manufacturing business 
NuPharm closed following a period of 
sustained trading losses, which resulted 
in a £13.7m loss on discontinued 
operations shown in the consolidated 
income statement (see page 46).
The Niche Pharmaceuticals division uses  
the excellent visibility of trends in the UK 
pharmacy and hospital markets gained 
through the Specials division to supplement 
external market data analysis, allowing early 
identification of opportunities to take products 
from unlicensed-to-licensed status (‘UL2L ’).
The division has a growing portfolio and 
pipeline of UL2L products, as well as 
complementary larger niche generic products 
across a number of therapeutic areas that  
the Group aims to commercialise either 
independently or in partnership with other 
pharmaceutical businesses.
Key developments
• Launched a number of products during 
the year and post year-end, including 
Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral Solution 
1mg/5ml, the Group’s first major 
UL2L launch.
• All UL2L products in the current pipeline 
now in active development.
• Profitability profile of the division 
transformed through trading growth  
and elimination of costs supporting 
underperforming product lines that have 
been discontinued during the year. Turn 
to the Chief Executive Officer’s review 
on page 10 for further details.
The Medication Adherence division 
provides the Group with direct access  
to the homecare market.
Key developments
• Strong growth in homecare and  
fertility volumes, particularly following 
commencement of a major contract 
with the Yorkshire and Humber NHS 
Pharmaceutical Purchasing Consortium.
• Following development of the Group’s 
focused and simplified strategy (details 
of which are explained on pages 18 and 
19), a strategic review of the Medication 
Adherence division has commenced.
