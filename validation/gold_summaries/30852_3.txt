JAMES FISHER AND SONS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Chairman’s statement
This is the last year that I shall 
be writing this statement as 
Chairman and therefore I am 
particularly pleased to be able 
to report that James Fisher 
and Sons plc (James Fisher) 
had another good year in 2017 
producing an underlying profit 
before tax of £50.3m, an increase 
of 10% over the prior year.  This 
reflected the strength of the 
Group’s business model with its 
broad spread of activities across 
the marine sector, its strong 
international presence and its 
ability to innovate and grow new 
businesses.
Three of our four divisions improved their 
results with Marine Support leading the 
way with a 17% improvement in profits 
generated by new markets in Brazil, the 
Middle East and offshore renewables. 
Specialist Technical delivered another 
strong performance making good progress 
with the delivery of its project pipeline and 
the Indian submarine rescue contract in 
particular. Tankships continued its run of 
profit increases generated by high vessel 
utilisation levels and careful attention to 
costs. Offshore Oil managed a result only 
marginally below the prior year: demand 
began to firm in some sectors towards year 
end while the division was also successful 
in opening new opportunities in the Middle 
East, Asia and in subsea decommissioning.
Group revenue for the year grew by 9% to 
£505.4m (2016: £466.0m). An increase in 
the Group’s underlying effective tax rate 
to 17.2%, (2016: 15.4%), held back the 
increase in underlying diluted earnings 
per share to 7% at 81.4 pence per share. 
Statutory diluted earnings per share were 
79.5 pence (2016: 78.7 pence).
With a number of major projects 
underway, careful attention has been paid 
to managing cash flow this year in the 
face of the expected increase in working 
capital. This build-up squeezed our cash 
conversion rate to 56% in 2017 and 
despite this, the year-end balance sheet 
gearing remained at a conservative 47% 
(2016: 41%) with the ratio of net debt 
(excluding bonds) to underlying earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation at 1.6 times (2016: 1.4 times).
The underlying strength of the Group’s 
performance and the positive outlook 
for the year ahead has led the Board to 
propose an increase in the final dividend to 
19.3 pence (2016: 17.6 pence) per share 
making a total for the year of 28.7 pence 
per share, an increase of 10% compared 
with 2016.
Strategic overview
Over the last ten years, with the exception 
of 2015, James Fisher has increased its 
profit and dividends every year, normally 
by more than 10%: this despite external 
events such as the financial crisis of 
2007-8, the fall in oil prices in 2014 
and most recently, Brexit. Key to this 
performance has been the Group’s ability 
to innovate and to build new businesses. 
The rapid growth of our ship-to-ship 
(STS) transfer business from 2007; the 
development of a market-leading position 
in submarine rescue and hyperbaric 
engineering since 2012 and more recently, 
the growth of a completely new activity 
in offshore renewables have enabled the 
Group to absorb these external shocks and 
continue to grow. This growth in turn has 
built an ever wider international presence, 
so that the Group is not dependent on 
any one geographical market. With a 
stable management team in place and a 
continued commitment to a decentralised 
management structure which keeps 
decision-making close to our customers 
and markets, this track record of change 
and innovation is set to continue.
All four of our divisions are well placed for 
the future. Marine Support is benefiting 
from the opening of new markets for STS, 
such as in Brazil, from the development 
of its subsea project businesses, and 
from its expanding presence in offshore 
renewables. Specialist Technical has 
market-leading positions in both its 
hyperbaric and submarine rescue niches 
and in its reactor decommissioning 
business in the nuclear sector.  While this 
division will always be project driven and 
therefore ‘lumpier’ in terms of turnover 
and working capital, it has an attractive 
pipeline of medium-term prospects. 
Tankships continues to perform well in a 
relatively stable market: this position will be 
underpinned by the introduction of more 
modern tonnage on some routes. Offshore 
Oil is now positioned for recovery: our 
businesses and management teams have 
done well both in terms of reducing their

costs and in opening new markets for their 
services in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
The strength of our balance sheet 
enables us to invest in development 
projects alongside a full capital investment 
programme. With the focus mainly on 
organic growth, we nevertheless remain 
alert for acquisition opportunities to help 
speed the development of our businesses. 
The purchase of Rotos 360 Limited in 
March 2017 for an initial consideration 
of £1.5m and EDS HV Group Limited in 
December 2017 for £9.0m have further 
extended our range of market-leading 
services to the offshore renewables sector.
The Board
After fourteen years on the Board and 
nearly six as Chairman, I announced 
in January that I will stand down at the 
conclusion of this year’s Annual General 
Meeting (AGM). It has been a privilege to 
have been part of James Fisher during 
an exciting period in the history of the 
Company.  The Group’s success is 
generated by the hard work and dedication 
of staff and management throughout the 
Group and it has been a great pleasure 
to meet and work with so many of them 
during my time with James Fisher.
The Board has chosen Malcolm Paul to 
become Chairman at the conclusion of the 
AGM. Malcolm has extensive experience in 
managing decentralised and international 
companies similar to James Fisher and 
has been an Independent Non-Executive 
Director since 2011. He has a deep 
knowledge of the Company having chaired 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
as well as being the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. He will bring the 
right balance of continuity and change to 
this role going forward.
Effective 1 February, I was also pleased 
to announce that Justin Atkinson had 
agreed to join the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. He will succeed 
Malcolm as chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Justin was until recently the 
CEO of the Keller Group plc, a FTSE 250 
business in the international construction 
sector. He will bring experience of 
successfully managing a group on a similar 
growth path to James Fisher.
With the development of James Fisher in 
recent years and the increasing spread of 
its international operations, the Board has 
been giving careful thought as to when it 
would be appropriate to strengthen the 
central executive team. In January 2017, 
Fergus Graham joined the Group having 
worked previously at De La Rue plc and 
other international companies in both 
operations and cross-border business 
development. He has played a senior role 
in our Marine Support division during the 
past year. The Board has now agreed to 
appoint Fergus as an Executive Director 
with effect from 1 March 2018. He will take 
responsibility for all of the Marine Support 
division which generated 47% of the 
Group’s turnover in 2017.  This will free up 
more time for Nick Henry as CEO to lead 
the Group’s further development.
Staff
The continued growth and success of the 
Group owes everything to the dedication 
of our staff who now work in many different 
countries across the globe. Some have 
to work in very challenging environments 
and all have to show a high level of 
professionalism worthy of the confidence 
our customers place in us. On behalf of the 
Board and from me especially in my final 
year, I would like to thank all our employees 
for their hard work and commitment shown 
to the James Fisher Group.
Outlook
Our Marine Support division has 
commenced the year with good prospects 
in its offshore renewables and marine 
project activities, as well as firm demand 
in the STS transfer business. Specialist 
Technical continues to work through its 
strong order book and has a good pipeline 
of active prospects. The timing of the 
award of these new projects will determine 
whether this division is able to deliver a 
further step up in profits in 2018. Tankships 
continues to operate well in a stable 
market. Sentiment amongst our Offshore 
Oil division’s customers has turned more 
positive in recent weeks and, while it is 
still too early to assess any general trend, 
this has begun to be reflected in orders 
received for repair and maintenance work 
in particular.  We therefore have a positive 
view of the year ahead and are confident 
of the Group’s potential to provide further 
growth and value for our shareholders in 
the future.

COBRA – JFD’s new diver breathing system 
JFD has successfully completed its first deep-water commercial dive project with 
its new diver breathing system COBRA (Compact Bailout Rebreathing Apparatus), 
a sophisticated system that was designed and developed to provide divers 
with an emergency supply of breathing gas in the event of a primary failure. The 
COBRA system provides divers with 20 minutes of air at a depth of 270 metres or 
45 minutes of emergency life support at a depth of 120 metres. This is compared 
to current alternative systems, which can only provide 3 minutes of air at 270 
metres, and 7 minutes at 120 metres. The extended operation time significantly 
improves the likelihood of a successful rescue in the event of an emergency.
