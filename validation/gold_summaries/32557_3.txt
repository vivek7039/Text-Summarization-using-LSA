 This year has been an important year 
in the history of Sainsbury’s. Our primary 
responsibility as a Board is to create 
value for shareholders in a sustainable 
way over the medium and long term and 
we have taken significant steps this year 
in delivering this objective.
Chairman’s 
Letter
08 Strategic Report Food is at the heart of our business. We 
continue to improve the quality and ranging 
of our grocery offer and with great products 
at fair prices, we have a clearly differentiated 
proposition in an increasingly competitive 
market. With the acquisition of Home Retail 
Group plc, owner of Argos (including Argos 
Financial Services) and Habitat, we have 
created one of the UK’s leading retailers in 
food, general merchandise, clothing and 
financial services providing customers with 
a choice, breadth and quality of product 
whenever and wherever they shop with us. 
We have also successfully implemented a 
new banking platform and introduced new 
products and services at Sainsbury’s Bank 
which are generating increased customer 
demand. 
These changes are all in line with the 
five pillars of the strategy we outlined in 
November 2014 (see page 11). By knowing our 
customers well and anticipating what they 
want, we will help to make their lives easier 
every day and achieve our vision of being the 
most trusted retailer where people love to 
work and shop. 
In the competitive market conditions of the 
last 12 months, underlying profit before tax, 
which includes the Argos contribution from 
2 September 2016, was £581 million, down 
one per cent. Underlying basic earnings per 
share were down 9.9 per cent to 21.8 pence 
per share. The last three years have been 
challenging for grocery retailers and the full 
impact of the vote to leave the European 
Union remains uncertain. However, we are 
pleased with the resilience of our business 
and the progress we are making with our 
strategy against this backdrop. 
Acquisition of Home Retail 
Group plc
In September, we completed the acquisition 
of Home Retail Group plc – owner of Argos 
and Habitat. Putting aside cash and store 
card receivables (which can be converted 
to cash), we purchased the business for 
an effective cash consideration of £156 
million. We believe this will prove to be a 
very economic acquisition of a valuable 
asset. The acquisition has accelerated our 
strategy, allowing us to offer our customers 
choice and convenience across food, general 
merchandise, clothing and financial services. 
Argos is making great progress, delivering 
strong like-for-like growth of 4.1 per cent in 
the six months since the acquisition. We also 
see a sales increase of between one to two 
per cent in Sainsbury’s supermarkets with 
an Argos Digital store. We are confident that 
we will achieve the £160 million of annual 
synergies we outlined at the time of the 
transaction six months ahead of schedule.
Dividend
We are committed to paying an affordable 
dividend to our shareholders and have fixed 
dividend cover at two times cover. We are 
therefore recommending a final dividend of 
6.6 pence per share, making the proposed full-
year dividend 10.2 pence per share. This brings 
our dividend payments over the last five years 
to 69.5 pence per share, equivalent to £1.4 
billion of cash paid to our shareholders. 
Management and colleagues
Mike Coupe leads a highly talented and 
experienced management team. In September 
2016, following the acquisition of Argos, we 
appointed John Rogers, previously Chief 
Financial Officer, as the Chief Executive 
of Sainsbury’s Argos, where he has put 
together a strong leadership team from both 
Argos and Sainsbury’s. In January, we were 
delighted to welcome our new Chief Financial 
Officer, Kevin O’Byrne, to the Company. 
Kevin has a wealth of retail and financial 
experience in executive leadership roles at 
Dixons, Kingfisher and Poundland and a 
track record of growing businesses. Finally, 
we were very pleased to welcome Simon 
Roberts as Retail and Operations Director. 
Previously President of Boots, I am sure 
Simon will make a significant contribution to 
our business, with his strong customer focus 
and extensive retail experience. 
Our Sainsbury’s store colleagues provide 
industry-leading service to customers every 
day and we have been awarded the Grocer 
Gold Awards for both Customer Service 
and Availability for the past four years. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our colleagues for their commitment 
and enthusiasm over the last year. We were 
pleased to increase the standard rate of pay 
of Sainsbury’s store colleagues by four per 
cent this year, the same rate as last year 
and well above the National Living Wage. 
In addition, colleagues across the Group will 
share a bonus of £78 million this year.
As we announced in March, Mary Harris will 
step down as a Non-Executive Director at 
our AGM in July 2017 . I would like to thank 
Mary for her extremely valuable contribution 
to Sainsbury’s over the past nine years and 
particularly for her skilful leadership of the 
Remuneration Committee. We expect to 
announce the appointment of a new Non-
Executive Director in due course. Susan Rice, 
our Senior Independent Director, is appointed 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee.
Outlook
The retail market remains very competitive. 
However, I am convinced that we have 
the right strategy in place to meet future 
opportunities and challenges. With our 
talented leadership team and highly engaged 
and committed colleagues, we are well 
placed to navigate the external environment 
and to create value for shareholders.
