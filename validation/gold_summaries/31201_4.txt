1. Performance Materials
The division creates industry-leading solutions 
which protect electronics by conducting 
harmful waste energy streams (e.g. heat and 
electrical noise) safely away from devices. 
Our high-performance products include: 
Precision Metals, Thermal materials, EMI 
shielding, and Magnetic and Ceramics 
products that protect signal integrity. 
The division also includes Model Solution, 
our prototype and mock-up business based 
in South Korea that is a specialist in designing 
and manufacturing fast turnaround prototypes. 
Model Solution is currently classiﬁed as an 
asset held for sale as the Board expects to 
dispose of the business in the next 12 months.
We partner with customers to identify and 
solve complex problems as technology 
changes and devices shrink. Our customers 
are redeﬁning the future of technology and 
include smartphone handset manufacturers, 
telecom infrastructure providers, automotive 
suppliers and military ﬁrms.
3. Wireless and Thermal Systems
We are a market leader in wireless 
connectivity and thermal solutions, designing, 
manufacturing and supplying products suitable 
for a range of applications, including: industrial 
and commercial antennae, commercial 
wireless connectivity (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
radios), industrial control systems and active 
engineered thermal management systems. 
Our products ensure safety and improve 
efficiency for our customers by helping to 
connect different products and applications 
and control critical processes. Our products are 
designed to provide continuous connectivity 
performance in extremely challenging and 
harsh environmental conditions. Our customers 
include large healthcare manufacturers, 
developers of high-density infrastructure, 
railway and mining operators.
2. Connected Vehicle Solutions
We are a market leader in providing 
customised multi-functional antenna products 
to ﬁt the needs of the large automotive 
manufacturers. We offer a complete set of 
products that integrate smart devices into the

Focusing our strategy 
in the right markets
Our Strategy
How we structure ourselves 1. Telecom and Computing:
Our products protect sensitive electronics 
from the impact of waste energy (e.g. 
escalating temperature and EMI issues), 
ensuring maximum performance over the life of 
the device. Growth is driven by ever-improving 
functionality and increased data usage.
2. Mobile Devices:
We create performance enhancing solutions 
that enable an ‘always on’ world. Growth is 
driven by demand for higher speciﬁcation, 
thinner, lighter design as well as miniaturisation 
of components and increasing device density.
3. Connected Transport:
We help to redeﬁne mobility with smart 
technology. Growth is driven by a widespread 
increase in the deployment of connectivity 
solutions in passenger cars, heavy equipment 
and ﬂeet management. The emergence of  
4G/LTE and the forthcoming evolution to 
5G is driving automotive manufacturers to 
upgrade their antennae to multiple input, 
multiple output (MIMO) technology.
4. Connected Industry:
We use industrial strength connectivity to 
accelerate critical workﬂows. Growth is driven 
by increased use of wireless automation 
solutions that improve productivity in safety 
critical environments. 
5. Connected Medical:
We improve patient care by wirelessly 
connecting the healthcare landscape. 
Growth is driven by the move to improve 
patient care and safety through use of 
wireless technology.
5.
Deliver a business 
with an improved and 
more sustainable cash 
generation proﬁle.
