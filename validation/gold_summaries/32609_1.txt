2017 performance
Chief Executive’s review
2016	 will	 be	 a	 year	 that	 many	 will	 remember	 as	 one	 of	 seismic	 and	
surprising	 change,	 especially	 on	 the	 political	 front	 both	 at	 home	 and	 abroad.	
On	 the	 quieter	 stage	 of	 aviation,	 our	 skies	 get	 busier	 and	 business	 gets	 more	
challenging,	 but	 Air	 Partner	 has	 completed	 the	 year	 with	 a	 set	 of	 results	
to	 make	 us	 proud	 and	 give	 our	 shareholders	 confidence	 in	 our	 strategy.	
Mark Briffa  Chief	 Executive	 Officer
The	 Group	 has	 made	 great	 progress	 during	 the	 year,	 delivering	
an	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 of	 £5.1m,	 a	 17.2%	 increase	
year-on-year.	 As	 ever,	 these	 results	 reflect	 the	 dedication	 and	
drive	 of	 all	 our	 staff,	 who	 continue	 to	 put	 our	 customers	 first,	
providing	 an	 unrivalled	 and	 differentiated	 service	 in	 our	 sector.
One Group, two divisions
The	 Group	 is	 structured	 into	 two	 complementary	 divisions:	
Broking,	 which	 delivers	 aircraft	 charter	 and	 remarketing	
services;	 and	 Consulting	 &	 Training,	 which	 delivers	
professional	 services,	 predominantly	 in	 the	 aviation	 safety	
sector.	 Both	 divisions	 operate	 internationally,	 servicing	
a	 high-quality	 customer	 base.	 Both	 divisions	 will	 play	
important	 roles	 in	 delivering	 our	 long-term	 strategy	 to	
become	 a	 world-class	 global	 aviation	 services	 group	 with	
a	 balanced	 business	 mix	 between	 the	 two.
Broking performance
Our	 Broking	 division	 has	 performed	 well	 this	 year,	 achieving	
a	 gross	 profit	 of	 £26.1m	 and	 an	 underlying	 operating	 profit	 of	
£6.6m	 which	 compare	 to	 £25.2m	 and	 £6.1m	 respectively	 in	 the	
prior	 year.	 This	 masks	 a	 better	 underlying	 performance,	 with	
some	 significant	 new	 business	 wins	 replacing	 a	 contract	 we	
expected	 not	 to	 be	 renewed	 as	 we	 entered	 the	 year.	 These	
wins	 were	 a	 result	 of	 some	 excellent	 teamwork,	 creativity	 and	
innovation	 by	 our	 people	 delivering	 solutions	 to	 some	 of	 our	
customers’	 most	 complex	 and	 technical	 needs.	 Our	 Customer	
First	 approach	 is	 delivering,	 and	 helping	 us	 measure,	 better	
levels	 of	 service	 and	 partnership	 with	 our	 most	 valued	
customers.	 As	 a	 result,	 we	 are	 seeing	 increased	 customer	
loyalty,	 and,	 with	 a	 greater	 portfolio	 of	 products,	 we	 are	 seeing	
the	 breadth	 of	 our	 activity	 with	 valued	 customers	 expand.	
During	 the	 year,	 we	 took	 steps	 to	 further	 enhance	 our	 Private	
Jet	 and	 JetCard	 offers,	 and	 we	 expect	 to	 evolve	 JetCard	 in	 the	
years	 ahead	 to	 reflect	 the	 lifestyle	 needs	 of	 our	 customers,	
in	 partnership	 with	 Camper	 &	 Nicholsons	 International.	 Since	
1782,	 they	 have	 been	 synonymous	 with	 the	 world’s	 leading	
yachts,	 and	 today	 are	 global	 leaders	 in	 all	 luxury	 yachting	
activities,	 specialising	 in	 their	 charter,	 sale,	 purchase,	
marketing,	 management	 and	 construction.	 This	 partnership	 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements

provides	 customers	 with	 a	 one-stop	 shop	 for	 all	 luxury	 air	
and	 sea-based	 travel	 needs.	 Other	 initiatives	 are	 under	 way	
to	 further	 enhance	 JetCard	 and	 I	 hope	 to	 be	 able	 to	 report	
to	 you	 in	 the	 future	 about	 some	 innovative	 work	 we	 are	 doing	
to	 make	 our	 customer	 experience	 the	 very	 best	 it	 can	 be.
Air	 Partner	 remarketing	 –	 formerly	 Cabot	 Aviation	 –	 also	
completed	 some	 significant	 projects	 in	 the	 year	 and	 the	
pipeline	 for	 the	 year	 ahead	 looks	 good.
The	 team,	 under	 the	 strong	 leadership	 of	 Tony	 Whitty,	 is	
responsible	 for	 all	 remarketing	 activity	 at	 Air	 Partner	 globally,	
and	 during	 the	 period	 we	 took	 the	 decision	 to	 consolidate	
all	 our	 short-term	 leasing	 activities	 under	 Tony’s	 wing	 so	
that	 we	 can	 leverage	 our	 expertise	 and	 understanding	 of	 the	
marketplace	 and	 service	 the	 customer	 better.	 The	 results	
from	 both	 the	 rebranding	 and	 the	 combination	 have	 been	
outstanding,	 and	 I	 believe	 the	 long-term	 outlook	 for	 our	
remarketing	 operation	 is	 excellent	 as	 we	 work	 with	 more	
international	 customers	 and	 add	 scale.	 Remarketing	 will	 be	
a	 beneficiary	 of	 organic	 investment	 and	 focus,	 and,	 while	 we	
will	 not	 rush	 anything,	 we	 hope	 to	 have	 a	 significantly	 larger	
remarketing	 business	 in	 three	 to	 five	 years	 than	 we	 do	 today.	
Consulting & Training performance
This	 report	 marks	 the	 first	 full	 year	 of	 operation	 from	 our	
Consulting	 &	 Training	 division,	 with	 a	 contribution	 of	 £0.5m,	
equating	 to	 10%	 of	 our	 underlying	 profits.	 I	 am	 very	 pleased	
with	 this	 maiden	 performance,	 and	 excited	 that	 the	 division	
is	 well	 positioned	 for	 future	 success.	 Almost	 all	 of	 this	 comes	
from	 Baines	 Simmons,	 our	 leading	 aviation	 safety	 consultants	
specialising	 in	 aviation	 regulation,	 compliance	 and	 safety	
management,	 which	 has	 performed	 well	 and	 is	 in	 a	 strong	
position	 to	 grow	 and	 develop	 in	 the	 years	 ahead.	 In	 December	
2016	 –	 seven	 weeks	 before	 the	 end	 of	 the	 financial	 year	
and	 15	 months	 after	 the	 completion	 of	 the	 Baines	 Simmons	
acquisition	 –	 we	 acquired	 Clockwork	 Research,	 a	 leading	
fatigue	 risk	 management	 consultancy.	 Integration	 of	
Clockwork	 Research	 was	 carried	 out	 on	 time	 and	 as	 planned.	
Similar	 to	 Air	 Partner	 Remarketing,	 Clockwork	 Research	 will	 be	
a	 beneficiary	 of	 future	 organic	 investment	 and	 focus	 as	 we

assist	 them	 to	 scale	 the	 business.	 As	 we	 work	 better	 together	
across	 the	 Group	 to	 deliver	 what	 our	 customers	 need,	 we	
expect	 the	 division’s	 contribution	 to	 our	 results	 to	 increase	
in	 future	 years	 as	 we	 become	 a	 more	 balanced	 business.
A common platform for growth
We	 have	 maintained	 our	 commitment	 to	 organic	 investment	
in	 core	 systems	 and	 controls.	 Our	 technology	 programme,	
Project	 Connect,	 began	 in	 2014	 and	 got	 us	 fit	 to	 compete	
globally.	 It	 enabled	 our	 latest	 upgrades,	 which	 began	 in	
February	 and	 should	 be	 finalised	 by	 the	 end	 of	 2017.	 The	 scale	
of	 the	 programme	 cannot	 be	 understated	 as	 it	 puts	 in	 place	
a	 solid	 foundation	 for	 future	 growth	 and	 is	 a	 core	 enabler	
to	 successfully	 carrying	 out	 our	 long-term	 strategy.	
We	 are	 introducing	 new	 platforms	 from	 which	 we	 can	
share	 data	 across	 the	 Group	 and	 which	 have	 the	 ability	 to	
accommodate	 the	 needs	 of	 any	 new	 acquisitions	 as	 soon	 as	
they	 come	 on	 board.	 This	 will	 give	 us	 greater	 consistency	 and	
flexibility.	 We	 introduced	 a	 new	 Group-wide	 finance	 system,	
which	 came	 on-stream	 in	 February,	 and	 will	 be	 moving	 all	 our	
companies	 onto	 a	 common	 CRM	 platform	 during	 2017.	
Transforming the business mix
Organic	 growth	 and	 self-improvement	 are	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 our	
long-term	 strategy,	 and	 by	 aligning	 ourselves	 closely	 with	 our	
most	 valued	 customers,	 we	 are	 better	 able	 to	 identify	 not	
only	 new	 business	 opportunities	 but	 also	 the	 strategic	 gaps	
across	 the	 Group.	 We	 have	 identified	 the	 services	 and	
capabilities	 we	 need	 to	 add	 or	 enhance	 and	 also	 identified	
the	 geographies	 where	 we	 need	 to	 develop	 a	 presence	 or	 add	
scale.	 In	 the	 years	 ahead,	 we	 will	 address	 these	 strategic	 gaps	
by	 either	 building	 a	 market-leading	 position	 organically	 or	
acquiring	 suitable	 businesses	 and	 platforms.		
It	 sounds	 straightforward	 –	 and	 as	 an	 idea,	 it	 is.	 The	 challenge	
lies	 in	 execution.	 We	 recognise	 that	 every	 acquisition	 carries	
risk	 –		 as	 it	 does	 reward	 and	 opportunity.	 We	 will	 judge	 risk	
and	 reward	 in	 detail	 before	 committing	 to	 acquisitions	
and	 deploying	 our	 capital.	 We	 are	 able	 to	 quickly	 assess	
a	 business’s	 strategic	 fit	 on	 various	 criteria,	 but	 alongside	 the	
analysis	 of	 its	 financial	 statements	 –	 the	 due	 diligence	 of	
financial	 track	 record	 and	 performance,	 and	 the	 assessment	
of	 future	 economic	 returns	 all	 speak	 to	 value	 –	 we	 spend	
a	 huge	 amount	 of	 time	 getting	 comfortable	 with	 the	 non-
financial	 components	 of	 a	 business,	 predominantly	 the	
people	 and	 culture.	
The	 most	 important	 question	 we	 ask	 ourselves	 when	 we	
evaluate	 a	 potential	 acquisition	 is	 ‘Is	 this	 an	 Air	 Partner	
company?’.	 The	 acquired	 business	 will,	 from	 day	 one,	 carry	
our	 brand	 or	 an	 association	 with	 our	 brand,	 and	 indeed	 may	
adopt	 our	 brand	 in	 due	 course,	 so	 we	 need	 to	 get	 comfortable	
with	 a	 lot	 more	 than	 just	 the	 numbers.	 The	 strategy,	 product	
or	 service,	 capital,	 scale,	 customer	 base,	 operating	 ethos	 and	
methodologies	 are	 all	 important,	 but	 they	 are	 brought	 to	 life	
by	 the	 people	 and	 the	 organisation’s	 culture.	 If	 we	 cannot	
tick	 all	 the	 boxes	 –	 both	 financial	 and	 non-financial	 –	 and	 get	
comfortable,	 we	 will	 not	 pursue	 the	 opportunity.
The	 aviation	 industry	 has	 many	 passionate	 and	 dedicated	
people	 who	 are	 delivering	 great	 products	 and	 services.	 Over	
the	 years,	 we	 have	 had	 the	 privilege	 to	 meet	 great	 businesses	
and	 we	 have	 evaluated	 many	 opportunities.	 There	 are	 plenty	
of	 acquisition	 opportunities,	 but	 we	 are	 selective,	 looking	 for	
complementary	 businesses.	 In	 nearly	 every	 instance,	 we	 are	
dealing	 direct	 with	 the	 owners	 or	 managers,	 and	 their	 decision	
to	 sell	 can	 be	 triggered	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 business	 or	 life	 events.	
In	 advance	 of	 that	 decision,	 we	 develop	 mutual	 trust	 and	 our	
understanding	 of	 the	 business.
We	 are	 delighted	 to	 have	 acquired	 three	 great	 businesses	 over	
the	 past	 two	 years	 –	 Cabot	 Aviation	 and	 Baines	 Simmons	 in	
2015	 and	 Clockwork	 Research	 in	 2016.	 These	 businesses	 are	
all	 run	 by	 passionate	 and	 dedicated	 people	 and	 deliver	 an	
exceptional	 service	 to	 their	 customers.	 As	 well	 as	 the	 financial	
contribution,	 they	 bring	 new	 services	 and	 capabilities	 to	 the	
Group	 which	 our	 customers	 and	 staff	 value,	 in	 the	 process	
making	 us	 a	 better	 and	 smarter	 organisation.	
Previous	 reports	 introduced	 the	 acquisitions	 of	 Cabot	 Aviation	
and	 Baines	 Simmons	 and	 this	 year	 I	 am	 pleased	 to	 introduce	
Clockwork	 Research.	 Clockwork	 Research	 brings	 new	 services	
and	 capability	 in	 the	 specialist	 field	 of	 fatigue	 risk	 management.

Clockwork	 Research	 uses	 systems	 models	 to	 measure,	
monitor	 and	 reduce	 fatigue	 in	 pilots	 and	 other	 key	 personnel,	
ensuring	 they	 get	 the	 necessary	 sleep	 to	 carry	 out	 their	 tasks	
effectively	 and	 safely.	 Founded	 by	 Dr	 Paul	 Jackson	 and	
Dr	 Alexandra	 Holmes,	 the	 business	 is	 a	 leader	 and	 innovator	
in	 its	 field.	 Both	 Paul	 and	 Alex	 are	 dedicated	 and	 passionate	
about	 helping	 customers	 tackle	 the	 challenges	 they	 face.	
Great people
As	 we	 go	 forward	 on	 our	 journey	 of	 transformation,	 it’s	
important	 that	 we	 share	 the	 same	 vision	 and	 that	 all	 our	
people	 understand	 it.	 Enhancing	 our	 brand	 is	 as	 much	
about	 our	 internal	 audience	 as	 it	 is	 about	 the	 external,	 and	
accordingly	 we	 are	 working	 to	 articulate	 our	 vision	 and	 values	
and	 enhance	 our	 internal	 communications	 by	 engaging	 our	
staff	 across	 the	 organisation	 more	 frequently.	 We	 can	 do	
a	 lot	 better,	 but	 we	 are	 starting	 from	 a	 strong	 base,	 with	 a	 rich	
heritage	 and	 globally	 recognised	 brand.	 We	 have	 a	 clear,	
long-term	 strategy	 and	 are	 becoming	 an	 exciting	 place	 to	
work,	 with	 services	 and	 capabilities	 that	 add	 value	 and	
enable	 us	 to	 compete	 beyond	 price,	 and	 that	 will	 offer	 steady	
career	 progression.	 We	 aim	 to	 reward	 good	 performance	
and	 exceptional	 behaviour,	 and,	 as	 we	 grow,	 a	 key	 aim	 is	
to	 retain	 our	 existing	 culture	 that	 keeps	 people	 at	 its	 heart.	
In	 January	 2016,	 we	 hired	 Lee	 Pyle	 as	 Group	 Head	 of	 Technology.	
Under	 his	 leadership,	 we	 are	 making	 a	 considerable	 investment	
in	 technology	 in	 order	 to	 create	 a	 solid	 and	 sustainable	 basis	
for	 growth.	
In	 June	 2016,	 we	 hired	 Julia	 Timms	 as	 Group	 Marketing	
Director.	 During	 the	 latter	 part	 of	 the	 year,	 she	 set	 in	 motion	
an	 overhaul	 of	 the	 Air	 Partner	 brand,	 which	 will	 become	
the	 umbrella	 brand	 for	 all	 our	 product	 offerings,	 including	
any	 future	 acquisitions.	 This	 is	 a	 really	 important	 lever	 of	
transformation,	 in	 that	 it	 will	 project	 a	 clear,	 unified	 identity	
to	 the	 world,	 enhancing	 our	 ability	 to	 cross-sell	 our	 services.	
Finally,	 in	 January	 2017,	 we	 appointed	 David	 McCown,	 who	
was	 formerly	 our	 Vice-President	 for	 Business	 Development	
for	 the	 United	 States,	 as	 President	 for	 our	 US	 business,	 a	 key	
focus	 for	 organic	 growth	 for	 2017	 and	 beyond.
Outlook
We’re	 on	 a	 journey	 of	 transformation,	 and	 2016	 has	 been	 an	
encouraging	 year	 on	 a	 number	 of	 fronts.	 The	 path	 ahead	 is	
exciting	 but,	 as	 we	 always	 state,	 in	 the	 world	 of	 aviation,	 and	
most	 especially	 in	 the	 charter	 industry,	 we	 must	 be	 cautious	
when	 managing	 expectations.	 The	 charter	 business	 has	
always	 been,	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 be,	 a	 volatile	 industry.	
Despite	 this,	 over	 nearly	 six	 decades,	 we	 have	 developed	
our	 business	 and	 adapted	 to	 grow	 and	 succeed.	
We	 are	 confident	 we	 have	 a	 successful	 and	 very	 clear	 long-
term	 strategy.	 We	 manage	 our	 operations	 for	 long-term	
success,	 aligning	 what	 we	 do	 with	 our	 customers	 and	 aiming	
to	 exceed	 their	 most	 complex	 and	 technical	 needs.	
We	 aim	 to	 become	 a	 balanced	 business,	 with	 two	 market	
leading	 divisions	 –	 Broking	 and	 Consulting	 &	 Training	 –	
delivering	 exceptional	 service	 and	 value	 to	 customers,	 and,	 as	
a	 consequence,	 high-quality	 and	 increasingly	 visible	 earnings	
to	 our	 shareholders.	 This	 will	 add	 value	 to	 our	 customers	 and	
staff	 and	 build	 real	 value	 to	 the	 owners	 of	 our	 business.	
Broking	 still	 accounts	 for	 90%	 of	 our	 profits,	 but	 in	 the	 future	
we	 expect	 our	 business	 mix	 to	 evolve	 significantly,	 driven	
by	 organic	 growth	 and	 suitable	 acquisitions.	 Our	 organic	
investments	 are	 rewarding	 us	 and	 we	 have	 some	 exciting	
initiatives	 under	 way.	 Our	 newly	 acquired	 businesses	 have	
delivered	 strong	 operational	 performance	 and	 made	 an	
excellent	 first	 full-year	 financial	 contribution	 to	 the	 Group.	
We	 will	 continue	 to	 build	 relationships	 with	 the	 owners	 and	
managers	 of	 the	 many	 suitable	 businesses	 we	 have	 identified	
as	 potential	 acquisitions,	 but	 we	 will	 remain	 patient	 and	 keep	
to	 our	 strict	 evaluation	 criteria.
