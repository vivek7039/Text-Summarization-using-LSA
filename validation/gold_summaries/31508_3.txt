Board priorities 
for 2018 
Following on from the findings of our Strategic Review, 
we identified three areas of focus for 2018: reduce the 
Group’s debt to manageable levels; Repair and revitalise 
the Tool Hire business; and Strengthen our commercial 
proposition across the Group.
Alan Peterson
Chairman
Dear shareholder,
Following decisive action taken by the Group 
Board and senior management during 2017 ,  
we have seen a significant improvement in our 
performance in the second half of the financial 
year and we will now build upon this momentum 
by implementing our clear strategic priorities.
Delever the Group
Repair and revitalise the Tool Hire business
Strengthen the Group’s commercial proposition

Strategic Review and progress made
We conducted a thorough, all-encompassing 
Strategic Review, reviewing the profitability of 
each customer, product and branch, as well 
as the most efficient operating model to 
support our business going forward. 
To this end there are three clear areas of 
focus for the year ahead:
1 Delever the Group
2
Repair and revitalise 
the Tool Hire business
3
Strengthen the Group’s 
commercial proposition
I am encouraged by the outcome of the 
Strategic Review, the findings of which we 
presented in December 2017 , and am 
confident that the delivery of these three 
priorities will improve Group profitability in 
2018 and beyond. 
We have already made good progress in 
the implementation of the strategy, and 
we are on track to deliver the annualised 
savings of £10m-£14m, which we 
presented in December. 
As we communicated as part of the 
Strategic Review in December 2017, an 
agreement was reached in principle with 
Unipart at the end of 2017 and was finalised 
on 13 February 2018. This allows us to 
make significant changes to our supply 
chain, in order to optimise our network. 
The National Distribution and Engineering 
Centre model was initially envisaged to 
support a much larger branch network. 
Based on the size of our current network, 
this model is no longer cost-effective. We 
therefore decided to move testing and 
some engineering back into the network 
and as a consequence, significantly reduce 
distribution costs. These changes have 
been positively received and will lead to 
improved product availability and contribute 
annualised cost savings of around £11m of 
the total anticipated cost savings stated 
above. These changes resulted in an 
exceptional cost of £41m, which includes 
various one off payments in 2018 and cash 
payments of £33.8m over the following 
seven year period.
Our results
We have seen an improving trend in our 
performance in the second half of the 
financial year, with strong Adjusted EBITA 
growth compared with the first half. These 
improving trends are demonstrated by our 
underlying rental revenue growth where 
we report 1.1% growth in H2 17 compared 
to H2 16. This underlying measure strips 
out the impact of branch closures in the 
two years, business divestments in 2017, 
the effect of week 53 in 2016, and rental 
revenues and disposal proceeds arising 
from the material asset disposals made in 
2016. This was augmented by continued 
growth in our services segment revenue 
and contribution which delivered 11.1% 
and 13.5% growth respectively in H2 17 
compared to H2 16. Our relentless focus 
on cost reduction led to our overheads 
in Q4 17 being £3.3m below the level in 
Q1 17. However, notwithstanding these 
improvements we have made, year on year 
revenue decreased by 2% to £335.8m, 
with a decline in rental, which was 
impacted by operating model changes 
in 2016 and branch closures, offset by a 
growth in services, generating an Adjusted 
EBITA of £1.8m and Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) of 0.9%.
Our results are discussed in more detail in 
the Financial Review on pages 18 to 21.
Our Board and management team
In June we welcomed the appointment 
of Steve Ashmore as our CEO. He brings 
considerable leadership experience to bear 
and consistent delivery of growth and value 
in a range of industries. Steve previously 
held a number of senior roles at Exel, 
the supply chain and third party logistics 
provider, and was UK Managing Director 
at Wolseley, the £2.0bn revenue distributor 
of plumbing and heating products and 
supplier of building materials. More recently 
he was the UK Managing Director of 
Brammer, the specialist distributor of 
industrial products. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
John Gill, who stepped down as CEO in 
May, for his considerable contribution over 
more than eight years at the Company. 
Governance
We are committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and as such, 
I am pleased to announce that the Group 
has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) during 2017.
During the year, and continuing into  
2018, the Group has assessed and is 
implementing changes as required  
in preparation for the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) becoming 
law. This year also saw the introduction  
of the Criminal Finances Act, placing 
increased emphasis on controls to prevent 
the facilitation of tax evasion. The Board 
has given top level commitment to this, 
including a new policy, a risk assessment 
and bespoke e-learning training modules. 
We also continued to monitor the Group’s 
policies and procedures in respect of the 
Modern Slavery Act.
Our people
I continue to be extremely impressed  
with the motivation, can-do attitude and 
achievement of HSS people across  
our Group, which is reflected in our 
consistently high customer satisfaction 
scores. I am very confident that with 
their support, HSS will be successful 
in delivering on our strategic priorities 
and building upon the momentum of 
the second half of 2017. 
Corporate responsibility 
Our primary responsibility is to always 
ensure the safety of HSS colleagues and 
customers, and the Board remains fully 
committed to providing a safe environment 
for all. We also pay close attention to 
reducing the impact we have on the 
environment and in the role that we play  
as a community business across the UK 
and Ireland. 
Refinancing
We announced in February 2018 that we 
had agreed with our lenders to extend 
the £80m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), 
which will now expire on 6 July 2019. 
Under the terms of the agreement, if the 
Group has not completed a refinancing by 
30 September 2018, the facility will expire 
at the option of the lenders on 30 April 
2019. Management continues to make 
good progress towards refinancing the 
Group and expects to complete this  
during 2018. 
We have prepared the accounts on a 
going concern basis as the Board is 
confident that the Group will be able to 
refinance these debt facilities well in 
advance of their maturity dates. 
Dividend
The Board is focused on reducing net 
debt and, after careful consideration of the 
performance of the Group during the year, 
and in line with the clear priorities set out 
in our Strategic Review, believes it is in the 
best interests of the shareholders of the 
Group, to not pay a final dividend in 
respect of 2017.
Looking ahead
The positive trading momentum in the 
second half of the financial year has 
continued into 2018. Underlying revenue 
grew by 6% in the first quarter of 2018 
against prior year with underlying rental 
revenue growing 3% and our already 
actioned cost initiatives are delivering 
benefits as expected. Based on this 
positive start to the new financial year we 
expect the LTM Adjusted EBITDA at the 
end of March to be around £54m with the 
first quarter Adjusted EBITDA being more 
than 50% higher than the previous year. 
This clearly benefits the net leverage ratio 
of the Group, which has reduced to 4.3x 
as at the end of Q1 18. Looking forward 
we expect Net Leverage to reduce to 
3.2x following the implementation of the 
identified strategic actions.
Our focus will be on developing a leaner 
operation, improving product availability 
and enhancing customer service, and 
reducing our debt to manageable levels. 
We will continue to drive operational 
efficiency across the Group, improving 
profitability and returns, and growing  
a profitable share of the market.
