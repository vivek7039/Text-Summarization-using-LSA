CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Strategy
Point-of-care (POC) testing
VISITECT
®
 CD4
We achieved a significant milestone in attaining formal design 
freeze with our VISITECT
®
 CD4 test for monitoring the immune 
status of people living with HIV following the successful manufacture 
of three pilot batches. Devices from these batches were tested at 
three UK hospital sites, on sufficient numbers of patient samples 
to demonstrate that we now have a method for manufacturing 
devices which consistently meets our design goal specifications 
regarding sensitivity and specificity. 
We have now moved into the validation and verification 
phase of the programme which can be summarised across 
the following activities:
 – manufacturing of validation batches to confirm manufacturing 
robustness/reproducibility;
 – utilising validation batches to verify performance;
 – external performance evaluation trials; and
 – CE mark.
We have selected two sites in the UK and one site in India to undertake 
evaluation studies. This is an important phase in the project and 
we will give ourselves sufficient time to demonstrate that we can 
transfer the product from development to routine manufacturing.
We continually assess the market landscape for this product and it 
seems clear that there is an increasing emphasis on the continued 
need for monitoring CD4 levels in people living with HIV, particularly 
those patients with low CD4 counts who are at significant risk of 
contracting opportunistic infections. The Company has built up 
relationships with a number of key opinion leaders over the years 
and so we have a voice that enables us to input into key stakeholder 
meetings. We have been invited to attend the ninth International 
AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2017) to be held in 
Paris in late July where VISITECT
®
 CD4 will be showcased.
Pune manufacturing facility
We made a significant amount of progress during the year with our 
manufacturing facility in Pune, India. 
In January, we announced that we received certificates of 
accreditation from BSI confirming our Quality Management 
System is compliant with ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485:2003. 
In March, we confirmed the facility underwent an annual inspection 
from the Indian FDA, confirming that the facility is compliant with 
GMP processes for manufacturing, testing, storage and QA, and 
that we were issued with a manufacturing licence which is valid 
until January 2021.
We also announced that we were successful in CE-marking 
and launching our VISITECT
®
 range of malaria tests comprising: 
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf (detection of HRP2 antigen in P. falciparum);
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf/Pan (detection of P. falciparum,  
non-P. falciparum or mixed infections); and
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria Pf/Pv (detection and differentiation 
of P. falciparum and P. vivax).
These products are currently available for general sale through 
business-to-business channels in those countries which do not 
require individual product registration and we are in the process 
of being evaluated for additional regulatory approvals to enable 
the Company to participate in higher volume tender business. 
We are also in the process of evaluating additional rapid tests 
for dengue, syphilis, leptospirosis, brucella and S. typhi.
Allergy automation
In October last year, we reported that we CE-marked our initial 
Allersys
®
 launch panel comprising 41 allergens. Since October, 
we have optimised a further eleven allergens and these are currently 
undergoing their claim support work, which should enable us to 
add them to the menu of tests available for sale. Two initiatives will 
help support the ongoing work to extend the menu beyond the 
initial launch panel, ensuring we enhance our product offering 
on a continuous basis. Firstly, in August last year, we secured a 
Scottish Enterprise research and development grant of £1.8 million 
and this has enabled us to accelerate recruitment of skilled project 
managers and leaders into the scientific team. Secondly, we have 
invested in creating our own in-house protein purification capability 
which will help in the optimisation programme of certain allergens 
that require a higher degree of characterisation to match the 
performance of the market leader.
David Evans 
Non-executive Chairman
I am pleased to be able to 
report progress on a number of 
activities within our operations, 
which I have outlined below www.omegadiagnostics.com Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2017 05
Strategic Report
Our commercialisation objectives are closely aligned with our 
partner company IDS, which is the manufacturer of the automated 
instrument over which we have exclusive rights to develop and sell 
our allergy tests. We have explored a number of routes in the last 
year on how best to take the partnership forward. Whilst IDS 
previously expressed an interest in acquiring the allergy business, 
we both subsequently concluded that our mutual objectives were 
better served with an enlarged distribution model. I believe we 
have now agreed the main outline terms which should enable 
the formal contract negotiations to proceed and we thank 
shareholders for their patience during this process.
Core business
Our core business is divided into our three main areas 
of operation comprising:
 – Food intolerance;
 – Allergy and autoimmune; and
 – Infectious disease.
Our strategic aims are to ensure that we can drive good growth 
across all three sectors in a way that achieves a balance such that 
we are not over-reliant on any single sector. I have already outlined 
initiatives that support growth in Allergy and autoimmune and 
Infectious disease.
We believe there are further significant opportunities for growth in 
Food intolerance and have made progress in North America, where 
customers are evaluating our products. In China, we are in advanced 
discussions with a partner company which could provide access 
to a large market which is increasingly aware of Food intolerance 
testing products and services.
In relation to our Food Detective
®
 product, the Company has been 
in discussions this year with our notified body, Lloyds Register 
Quality Assurance (LRQA), regarding use of the self-test version of 
the kit. The Company has agreed a timescale to complete some 
corrective actions to LRQA’s satisfaction. In the event that we are 
unable to achieve this, the CE mark for the self-test kit will be 
suspended for a period of time which would have a modest 
impact on revenues and profits.
Financial performance
Group revenue grew by 12% to £14.2 million (2016: £12.7 million) 
with growth in revenue across all three business sectors. As a 
predominantly export business, we benefited from a weaker sterling 
throughout the year, which added £1.1 million to reported revenues 
(2016: £0.2 million). On a constant currency basis, revenue would 
have been ahead of last year by 3%. Gross profit increased to 
£9.2 million (2016: £8.1 million), with an increase in gross profit 
margin to 64.7% (2016: 63.8%). Adjusted profit before tax (statutory 
profit before tax of £0.7 million with add backs for amortisation of 
intangible assets, share-based payment charges and IFRS-related 
discount charges) was £1.1 million (2016: £1.3 million) and adjusted 
earnings per share were 1.1 pence (2016: 1.2 pence), the small 
reduction reflecting an increase in overhead expenditure compared 
to the previous year. Statutory earnings per share were 0.7 pence 
(2016: 0.5 pence).
The Group’s cash position at the year end was £0.7 million 
(2016: £1.3 million), which represented a neutral cash flow in 
the second half of the financial year. We continue to monitor 
our working capital management in the conversion of adjusted 
operating profit (operating profit excluding share-based payments 
and amortisation of intangible assets) into operating cash and the 
conversion factor for the year was 171% (2016: 108%).
Corporate governance
The size and structure of the Board and its Committees are kept 
under review to ensure an appropriate level of governance operates 
throughout the year. The Board is comprised of two Non-executive 
Directors and four Executive Directors who meet frequently during the 
year to discuss strategy and to review progress and outcomes against 
objectives. Board reports containing KPIs, which report on business 
issues by exception, are circulated in advance of each Board meeting, 
which contribute to a more efficient Board process allowing sufficient 
time to consider business-critical issues. The Group is not required to 
comply with the full requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (as an AIM-quoted company) but we believe the Board has 
the skills and the necessary experience to deliver on its plans and 
objectives in a way that enables Non-executive members of the Board 
to challenge and advise the Executive team as appropriate.
The Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee are 
comprised of the two Non-executive Directors and the Board 
believes the current make-up and the number of Committees 
remain appropriate for a group of our size.
Board and employees
There has been no change to the composition of the Board 
throughout the year. Employees remain a key part of our Group’s 
success and we have introduced new training programmes for our 
managers and supervisors to enable them to develop themselves 
to the best of their ability. Wherever possible, we seek to fill new 
roles in the organisation with internal candidates and we have 
been able to promote a number of people in the year.
The Group now has 180 employees around the world and I thank 
them for their hard work and efforts which have achieved much 
progress on a number of fronts this year. 
Outlook
We are encouraged that trading in the first quarter of the new 
financial year is in line with our expectations.
We have made a significant amount of progress with a number 
of key assets that will underpin future growth:
 – Allersys
®
 reagents are now CE-marked with the menu 
continuing to grow;
 – VISITECT
®
 CD4 has achieved design freeze;
 – manufacturing facility in Pune, India, is now fully validated; and
 – VISITECT
®
 Malaria has now been CE-marked.
Since December last year, the Company has been seeking to agree 
global distribution terms with its Allersys
®
 licensor (Immunodiagnostic 
Systems Holdings plc (IDS)). The Company believes that it has 
made good progress and the Directors believe that once we get 
beyond the contractual process, the sales and marketing teams 
of both organisations will be capable of making a success of the 
Company’s allergy products. 
CD4 testing remains a practical and necessary marker for assessment 
of the baseline status of HIV infection. We are confident that we will 
meet the remaining challenges within the validation programme 
that will determine our ability to manufacture a product at scale 
which meets the market’s need.
We have also identified a number of organic growth opportunities 
for all our business segments which augurs well for the future.
