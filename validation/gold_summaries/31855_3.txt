 I am pleased to report that Abcam has made good 
progress, both financially and strategically, over the course 
of 	 the 	 past 	 twelve 	 months. 	 We 	 have 	 continued 	 to 	 successfully	
implement	our	growth	strategy	and	once	again	delivered	
double-digit 	 catalogue 	 revenue 	 growth, 	 performing 	 at 	 levels	
well 	 above 	 market 	 growth 	 rates. 	 At 	 the 	 same 	 time 	 we 	 have	
significantly strengthened the organisation’s underlying 
capabilities	to	deliver	further	growth	in	the	future.
We are a global leader in the sale of research antibodies 
and have a reputation for providing high quality products, 
along	with	comprehensive	supporting	scientific	data,	to	
researchers	who	strive	to	understand	the	molecular	basis	
of	biology	and	disease.	We	continue	to	ensure	we	are	
at 	 the 	 forefront 	 of 	 scientific 	 advances 	 by 	 investing 	 in 	 new	
technologies 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 in 	 methods 	 that 	 ensure 	 the 	 quality	
of our products, including knockout validation. We are 
excited	about	the	successes	we	have	made	and	the	
further	opportunities	we	see	in	custom	products	and	
licensing. 	 As 	 a 	 result 	 we 	 are 	 putting 	 increasing 	 resources	
behind this part of our business.
I am grateful for the 
hard work, enthusiasm  
and dedication of all our 
employees. My thanks 
to them and to our 
shareholders for their  
ongoing support.
