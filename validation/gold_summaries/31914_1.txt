 10 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Thoughts of  
the CEO
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to report that we continue to make good 
and steady progress. 
The past year has allowed us to close the ‘Repair’ phase, 
and in February I launched the ‘Prepare’ phase, the 
second element of our strategy, focusing our actions 
to prepare McBride for growth.
As I reflect on the last twelve months, it becomes 
very evident to me how much we have progressed 
the ‘Manufacturing our Future’ strategy and the 
extent we have changed as a result of the ‘Repair’ 
phase execution. 
The first of our three-phased approach of ‘Repair’, 
‘Prepare’ and ‘Grow’ focused on transforming McBride 
to its core capability of manufacturing excellence. 
Following our customer simplification exercise, we have 
been able to re-establish top quality service levels to 
our customers, accelerate our innovation cycle and 
substantially improve on our quality performance. In 
addition, I have been pleased with the agility of our 
teams in adapting and adopting new ways of working 
in their day-to-day practices. All of this has led to an 
appreciation of the ‘New McBride’ with recognition 
in many ways – including numerous customer service 
awards and several recommendations as ‘Best Buy’ in 
consumer magazines across Europe, while also securing 
new business with a number of customers.

McBride for growth
That said, the year has not been without its challenges. 
The consequences of the UK referendum have been 
diverse and have had to be closely monitored and 
managed. European markets have shown slightly 
negative growth, particularly in the Household category, 
resulting in an intensification of competitive price and 
volume behaviours. We have experienced rising raw 
material costs in several of our product streams across 
our markets, many of which have had to be absorbed 
by the business.
In addition, rising inflation, especially in the UK, 
has created a reduction in household disposable 
income resulting in more conservative spending on 
non-essential household items.
In line with the average market trends and as projected, 
we reported a 5.9% drop in sales at constant currency. 
In spite of these challenges, due to the continued 
diligence of our teams to control cost and execute 
efficiency improvements we have delivered on our 
projected profitability and continue to strengthen 
our balance sheet. This clearly demonstrates that our 
strategy is strengthening our ability to deal with the 
volatility of our markets.
In June, our announcement regarding the successful 
refinancing of the Company closed the final key action 
that we had set ourselves during our ‘Repair’ phase. 
This was a significant key milestone that completed 
all of the diligent transformation work that has been 
implemented in the past 18 months. 
Now, the ‘Prepare’ phase is a period of bridging 
from where McBride was and to where we aspire to 
be – moving the Company from ‘Repair’ to ‘Grow.’ 
It comprises four objectives that will enable us to build 
the foundations to sustain our ambitions: first, our 
fundamental commercial growth aspirations, second, 
the supporting asset base and related investment 
plans, third, the organisational structure and skills to 
deliver this overall ambition, and finally, the resolution 
of our underperforming business. All of the projects 
supporting these four objectives have been launched. 
In May, I reviewed progress on the key elements of 
the ‘Prepare’ phase with the wider management 
group within the business. They have an ongoing 
communication objective that is two-fold: first, to 
ensure that they and their teams clearly understand the 
key elements of our ‘Prepare’ phase and second, that 
their teams are clear on what their role is in support 
of executing this phase. We still have a lot to do, but 
the foundations we have built are very solid, and the 
progress we are making is very encouraging. Our teams 
are energised and focused – moving forward with 
confidence and trust in the future of McBride.
I sincerely hope that you too share our trust. 
With best regards,
Rik De Vos
Chief Executive Officer
