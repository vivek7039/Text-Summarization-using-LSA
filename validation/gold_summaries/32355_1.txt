Progress Provide a safe, efficient and reliable service every day
This	year	we	safely	handled	7.6%	more	flights	than	last	year.	We	saw 	
high	growth	rates	in	international	flights,	particularly	from	London	
airports,	and	the	volume	of	North	Atlantic	flights	exceeded	its	previous	
peak	in	2008.	The	number	of	flights	was	also	higher	than	projected	
by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in our Performance Plan for 
Reference Period 2 (RP2: 2015-2019) which, while challenging to handle 
operationally,	has	benefited	our	revenue.
The	basic	structure	of	the	UK’s	airspace	(its	routes,	sectors	and	holding	
patterns)	was	designed	over	50	years	ago	when	traffic	volumes	were	far	
lower than they are today. Airspace in the South East is now operating 
to its maximum capacity during the busiest times of the year. When 
the airspace is at capacity our service performance is very sensitive 
to	the	timing	and	distribution	of	traffic	flows	across	the	country.	This	
was evident last summer when periods of bad weather combined with 
industrial	action	in	neighbouring	countries	(causing	flights	to	divert	into	
UK	airspace)	changed	the	patterns	of	flight	across	the	UK.	We	faced	
similar operational challenges when particularly high demand coincided 
with the introduction of new systems (e.g. iTEC) into our operation.
Our primary objective is to ensure that, irrespective of the prevailing 
conditions,	all	flights	are	handled	safely.	For	this	reason,	on	certain	
days,	we	regulated	traffic	flows	in	some	sectors	of	airspace	to	maintain	
safety	which	resulted	in	more	air	traffic	delay	than	has	been	seen	in	
recent years, and slightly more than our regulatory targets anticipated. 
However, at no point did our performance fall outside of the bounds of 
the RP2 Performance Scheme targets which was very good, considering 
the	scale	of	traffic	growth.	Our	service	was	also	extremely	good	in	
comparison to Europe, with delay amounting to one third of the 
European average. 
Learning from last summer, we have been working closely with 
airlines, airports and the CAA over the winter to assess demand across 
the	UK	airspace	network	and	to	develop	a	strategy	to	minimise	delay 
this summer.
Deliver SESAR technology and transform the business 
for the future
The longer term solution to minimising delay during periods of high 
demand	is	the	combination	of	new	technology	and	modern	UK	airspace	
structures. The process of modernising airspace started in the previous 
financial	year	but	further	stages	have	been	paused	pending	Government	
consultation	on	a	UK	aviation	strategy	over	the	next	year.
We expect this strategy to include greater Government emphasis on 
airspace	modernisation	and	its	effect	on	those	who	are	overflown.	
Modernising	airspace	will	significantly	increase	its	capacity	but,	like	
runway	capacity	enhancement,	there	are	significant	social	and	political	
hurdles (such as public opposition to changing aircraft noise patterns) to 
be overcome, even when the noise impact is an overall improvement for 
a community. By engaging effectively with local communities, alongside 
airports and airlines, we can establish rules for respite and distribution 
that can help mitigate some of the noise impact on the ground. 
We also welcome Government’s clear decision on the location of a new 
runway and a faster planning process to deliver it. We have already 
started working with Heathrow Airport and other stakeholders to review 
the design of the local airspace, taking account of safety, noise and other 
environmental considerations. 
We consulted customers during the year on a revised capital investment 
plan for RP2. This follows changes that we have seen in the business 
environment	(such	as	higher	than	expected	traffic	growth)	and	progress	
made by the industry in developing SESAR technologies, such as iTEC. In 
a programme we refer to as Deploying SESAR
5
, we propose to accelerate 
the	deployment	of	new	technology	to	deliver	capacity	and	safety	benefits	
to customers more quickly while reducing our investment in legacy 
systems and their running costs. To achieve this, we expect to invest 
up to £160m more than the RP2 Performance Plan assumed. In order 
to mitigate the impact of this additional investment on prices in future, 
we	have	secured	£100m	of	EU	(INEA)	funding	and	we	are	applying	for	a	
further £30m.
As we deploy new technology we will be retiring our legacy systems. 
This	requires	significant	change	to	our	operation,	including	the	need	to	
train our people in the use of these new systems and in new methods of 
operation. While the transition will be challenging we will be doing all we 
can to minimise any operational impacts for our customers. 
This year we achieved key programme milestones, developing our ability 
to manage similar transitions in future: we delivered a new system to 
control upper airspace from our Prestwick Centre and we have started 
trial	operational	use	of	electronic	flight	strips	in	our	Swanwick	terminal	
control operation.

Win and retain commercial business
We are working hard to strengthen that part of our business which is not 
economically	regulated.	In	particular,	within	the	UK	we	face	increasing	
competition for the provision of airports ATC. Our response is to build 
trusting	and	sustainable	partnerships	with	UK	airport	customers,	
combined with a clear and compelling proposition for different airport 
market segments and to use advances in technology to improve price 
competitiveness.
During the year we were awarded the ATC contract by George Best 
Belfast City Airport and renewed ATC contracts with Aberdeen, Glasgow 
and Southampton airports, along with our engineering contract with 
Highlands and Islands Airports. However, the Edinburgh Airport ATC 
service	will	transfer	to	a	competitor	at	the	end	of	March	2018	and	we	
are working with the airport and its new provider on the transition of this 
service. This is evidence that we must continue to innovate and offer our 
service cost effectively. 
Digital	towers	(which	see	air	traffic	controllers	manage	aircraft	from	
remote facilities instead of in traditional airport towers) are becoming 
a demonstrably viable option for airports and have the potential to 
transform the way air navigation services at airports are delivered: 
London City has announced plans for a digital tower service in the future. 
In	April	2017,	we	invested	£5m	to	acquire	a	50%	interest	in	Searidge 	
Technologies, a Canadian provider of digital tower capability, and during 
the year we continued to develop a digital tower capability at Swanwick. 
Together these enable us to offer a wider choice of digital tower 
solutions to customers depending on their requirements.
We	are	supporting	our	Aquila	joint	venture	with	its	delivery	of	the	MOD’s	
Project	Marshall.	The	service	provision	element	of	this	contract	is	
performing extremely well. However, the asset provision element has 
faced schedule challenges. Together with our joint venture partner, 
Thales, we are committing more resources in 2017/18 to re-plan and 
execute on a delivery schedule for asset provision that will ensure our 
military customer has the capability required to perform its mission. 
We continue to develop our international activities, focusing on the 
Middle	East	and	Asia	Pacific.	Of	note	this	year	was	the	award	of	an	
airspace design contract in Thailand.
Our people
One	of	the	priorities	I	have	set	for	the	2018	financial	year	(see	below) 
is a focus on our people. 
We have a record of good relations with our employees and enjoy 
generally	constructive	relationships	with	our	Trades	Unions.	However,	
all parties faced a challenging pay round last summer and, on its 
conclusion,	we	jointly	reflected	that	our	ways	of	working	and	partnership	
approach needed to be reinvigorated and renewed. We are now working 
with union representatives to understand how we can work together 
more effectively; an objective which will take time but to which we 
are all committed.
As	noted	above,	a	large	part	of	our	strategy	over	the	next	five	years	is	
to replace much of our technical infrastructure. This infrastructure has 
served	us	well	but	is	coming	to	the	end	of	its	useful	life.	Updating	this	
technology	will	be	a	significant	change	for	everyone	working	for	NATS	
and this priority recognises that we will need to support our people 
through this transformation.
Our priorities for 2018
 > Provide	safe	and	resilient	air	traffic	services	from	our	airports 
and centres;
 > Focus on our people and employee relations as we transform our 
infrastructure;
 > Achieve Swanwick site acceptance testing for London City 
Digital Tower;
 > Deliver key Deploying SESAR milestones: expanding electronic 
flight	strips	in	Terminal	Control	and	fit	out	Combined	Operations	room 
at Swanwick;
 > Provide support to Heathrow and Hong Kong for their third runways; and
 > Enhance the Oceanic technical platform and Operations at Prestwick.
Our immediate focus is ensuring that we have the right resources to 
support this summer’s airline schedules so as to minimise the need for 
regulations that cause delay to the travelling public. We are also focusing 
on	continuing	the	delivery	of	electronic	flight	strips	which	transition	from	
trial to full operational use in our terminal control operation starting in 
January 2018. Finally, we are starting to turn our attention to developing 
next year’s business plan which will form our initial proposal to customers 
for RP3 (calendar years: 2020 to 2024). Our key objective in developing this 
plan	will	be	to	ensure	that	we	have	sufficient	resources	in	RP3	to	continue	
to	deliver	a	safe	and	efficient	service	to	the	travelling	public	which	is	
resilient to changing circumstances and operational conditions.
