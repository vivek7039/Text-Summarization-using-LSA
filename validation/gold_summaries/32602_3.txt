 Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Our focus on customer needs  
has been the driving force behind  
the growth of the business. They 
remain at the heart of everything  
we do.
Evolution of the strategy and  
further financial delivery leading  
to enhanced shareholder returns
I am delighted to present another strong 
set of results.
We have continued to deliver on our 
progressive dividend policy this year, 
increasing our dividend by 18.1% to 8.5p. 
This equates to a payout ratio of 62%
1
 of 
net earnings, compared to 57%
2
 in the 
previous year. Last year, we increased 
our target payout range from 40%-60%, 
to 50%-70% as a sign of our confidence 
that we will continue to deliver strong 
financial performance. This year’s 
decision to increase the dividend  
again reflects the Board’s ongoing 
confidence in the sustainability of our 
dividend policy, which is supported by  
a strong track record of profit growth 
and cash generation through our  
capital efficient model.
Financially, we have again delivered 
growth in underlying profit before tax  
of 5.6% to £187.4m and basic earnings 
per share by 6.0% to 14.1p. Furthermore, 
we have continued to be highly cash 
generative, resulting in a further 
deleveraging such that our net debt to 
EBITDA ratio has reduced to 1.9 times.
Our focus on customer need has been 
the driving force behind the growth of  
the business. Our customers remain at 
the heart of everything we do and it is  
a great credit to the Company that so 
many continue to support us through 
sustained ownership of our shares.  
The management team has done a lot  
of work throughout the year to deepen 
our understanding of our customers. 
This is helping us to interact differently 
and more efficiently with both existing 
and prospective customers.
1 Based on profit after tax excluding derivatives 
and Ogden impact.
2 Excluding the one-off benefit of Acromas  
tax losses.
