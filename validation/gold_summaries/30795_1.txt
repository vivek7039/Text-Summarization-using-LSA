Savills plc  
Report and Accounts 2017 Key operating highlights
Strength in key commercial markets, 
geographical diversity and the resilience  
of our residential businesses drove an 
improved performance for Savills in 2017. 
• Transaction Advisory revenues up 13%. 
Strong performances in the UK and Asia 
Pacific including Hong Kong, China, 
Australia and Japan. 
• Growth in revenues in Continental Europe 
with profits impacted by start-up costs in 
the Czech Republic and recruitment 
there and in the Netherlands. 
• Savills Studley’s revenue up 6% but 
profitability impacted by investment in a 
new capital markets team in New York.
• Further growth from our less-
transactional services with Consultancy 
revenue up 14% and Property 
Management revenue up 9%.
• Savills Investment Management 
performed ahead of our expectations, 
with AUM up 5% to £14.6bn.
Overall the Group increased underlying profit 
by 3.5% to £140.5m (2015: £135.8m). 
On a statutory basis, profit before tax 
increased 13% to £112.4m (2016: £99.8m).
Savills geographic and business diversity 
were key to achieving the year’s result.

Total 1,600.0 1,445.9 11 140.5 135.8 3
Overall, our Commercial and Residential Transaction Advisory business revenues together 
represented 47% of Group revenue (2016: 46%). Of this, the Residential Transaction Advisory 
business represented 11% of Group revenue (2016: 11%). Our Property and Facilities 
Management businesses continued to perform well, growing overall revenue by 9% and 
represented 32% of Group revenue (2016: 33%). Our Consultancy businesses represented 
17% of revenue (2016: 17%) where improved performances within the UK were supported by 
an increase in valuation work in our international operations. There was a reduction of revenues 
in the Investment Management business of 8%, which had been anticipated due to the 
exceptionally high level of disposals in 2016 from the SEB German Open Ended funds, which 
are in liquidation. Investment Management revenue represented 4% of Group revenue in the 
year (2016: 5%). 
People
The UK business won a number of national awards including Residential Advisor of the Year 
at the 2017 Estates Gazette Awards, Commercial Agent of the Year at the 2017 Props

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview

Savills plc  Report and Accounts 2017 The Savills Group advises on commercial, rural, residential  
and leisure property. We also provide corporate finance advice, 
investment management and a range of property-related 
financial services. Operations are conducted internationally 
through four business streams:
2017 clearly demonstrated both the 
importance of having a breadth of 
transactional business around the 
world, and our strong market position 
in the main real estate transactional 
markets/sectors. 
In the UK the commercial leasing and 
investment markets performed better than 
expected in 2017 , as both occupiers and 
investors adopted a more realistic view of how 
and where Brexit-related risks might fall. Of 
particular note was the very strong 
performance of our commercial teams in Asia 
Pacific, in particular in Hong Kong, China, 
Australia and Japan. The Savills Global 
Residential business also proved highly 
resilient in challenging markets, contributing 
to the increase in revenue and profit delivered 
by our Transaction Advisory business as a 
whole. Revenue grew by 13% to £746.2m 
(2016: £660.8m) and underlying profit 
increased by 2% to £81.5m (2016: £80.0m). 
The effect of significant business 
development costs in the US, including the 
recruitment of a New York capital markets 
team, reduced the underlying profit margin 
of the Transaction Advisory business as a 
whole to 10.9% (2016: 12.1%).
UK Residential
Our UK Residential business revenue grew by 
4% to £128.9m (2016: £124.4m). In the 
second-hand estate agency business, 
revenues benefited from a growth in the 
average sales value, which was 6.9% higher 
than in 2016, along with a slightly higher 
average fee charged, offsetting a fall in the 
number of exchanges, (down 3% on 2016).  
In the “Core” London market, the number of 
exchanges grew by 4%, helped by a fall in 
average values, whereas outside the capital, 
which represents 55% of second hand 
agency residential revenue, the opposite 
trend occurred with the number of exchanges 
down 5%, as a result of higher property 
prices. In both regions revenues increased 
approximately 4% on 2016.
In the new homes business, revenue grew 
by 2%, reflecting a growth in average 
transaction value of 3%, despite a 7% 
reduction in the number of exchanges.
Whilst there was muted activity in the UK 
farmland market, pending clarification on trade 
and subsidies post-Brexit, there was continued 
demand for amenity estates, especially across 
the South and South West of England. 
Our Residential Capital Markets team saw 
significant institutional investor appetite in 
student housing and private rented sector 
markets. This resulted in revenue growth  
of almost 25%, although planning delays  
and construction market challenges 
represent significant supply side constraints 
in these markets.
As a result of the above factors, the UK 
Residential Transaction Advisory business 
recorded a 7% increase in underlying profits 
to £18.7m (2016: £17.5m).
Asia Pacific Residential
The Residential Transaction Advisory 
business in Asia is focused primarily on new 
development, secondary sales and leasing 
of prime properties in selected markets. It 
excludes mixed use developments, which 
are accounted for within the Commercial 
Transaction Advisory business. Overall, the 
Asia Pacific Residential business increased 
revenues by 16% to £44.3m (2016: £38.1m) 
which represented an 11% increase in 
constant currency. This was principally 
driven by a number of high end residential 
sales in Hong Kong and an increase in 
project sales in Singapore where the 
residential market began to show signs of 
recovery following government relaxation of

18 certain cooling measures. Our residential 
business in Australia was restructured during 
the year resulting in reduced revenues but 
improved profitability. In China, the 
Government continues to impose restrictions 
on second home ownership, impacting 
negatively both sales and profitability. The 
net effect of all these factors resulted in a 
94% increase in underlying profit to £6.4m 
(2016: £3.3m), 88% in constant currency.
Asia Pacific Commercial
The Asia Pacific Commercial business 
performed strongly in 2017 , driven by 
improved revenue and profitability in Hong 
Kong, Japan, Australia and Mainland China. 
The Hong Kong market continued to be 
attractive to Mainland Chinese investors and 
our market share remained strong at 
approximately 40%. In Japan, transactional 
revenue increased by 75% following the 
completion of several significant transactions. 
In Australia the impact of previous investment 
in new talent coupled with the restructuring 
under the new leadership team resulted in an 
increase in market share, improving both 
revenue and profitability. Over the past 18 
months, we have invested significantly into 
our investment sales team in Mainland China, 
particularly in Shanghai and Beijing, the 
benefit of which came through in 2017 as 
both transaction volumes and market share 
increased. The Singapore performance  
was negatively impacted by a reduction  
in investment volumes and commercial 
leasing fees. 
Reported revenue rose by 30% to £168.4m 
(2016: £129.7m) which represented a 24% 
increase in constant currency. 
The positive effect of higher volumes  
offset business development and service 
expansion costs in the region, leading  
the Asia Pacific Commercial Transaction 
Advisory business to record a 31% increase 
in underlying profit to £26.9m (2016: 
£20.6m). This represented a 25% increase 
in constant currency. 
UK Commercial
Revenue from UK commercial transactions 
increased 18% to £101.6m (2016: £86.0m). 
Most commercial leasing and investment 
markets performed better than anticipated in 
2017 , as both occupiers and investors 
adopted a more realistic view of how and 
where Brexit-related risks might fall. The 
overall investment volume into UK commercial 
property in 2017 was just under £66bn, a 
27% increase on the year before. The 
importance of non-domestic investors was 
significant, with £31bn invested in the UK last 
year by non-domestic investors (the second 
highest volume historically). In the London 
office market the proportion was even higher, 
with 80% of investment coming from 
non-domestic investors and £8.4bn from Asia 
Pacific alone. Savills was the leading adviser 
in London for the second year in succession, 
with a market share of 30%.
Generally, investors remained heavily biased 
towards asset classes that offer comparative 
income security, and this meant that logistics 
and alternative asset classes rose in 
popularity offsetting a decline in activity in 
retail, particularly shopping centres.
The occupational markets also performed 
well, with office leasing activity in central 
London 24% up year-on-year. Furthermore, 
the total office take-up in the top six regional 
cities in the UK reached its highest ever level 
in 2017, due to a combination of a natural 
ripple effect outwards from London and the 
South East, and a degree of insulation 
against the potential Brexit risk.
The logistics sector was many investors’ 
sector of choice in 2017, although 
occupational take-up was at its long-term 
average level. Availability of prime logistics 
space remains tight across the UK, and this 
will support both rents and land prices 
going forward. Retail remained a fairly 
binary sector in 2017, with tourist-focused 
markets like London and Edinburgh 
performing well due to the effects of the 
weak pound, while the rest of the UK 
remained flat in the face of falling real 
earnings growth for UK consumers.
The strength of our national Commercial 
transaction business, supported by our 
strong international network, led to a 17% 
increase in underlying profit to £17.2m  
(2016: £14.7m).
North America
During the year, we continued to build on our 
North American tenant representation 
platform, Savills Studley, through both 
recruitment and bolt-on acquisitions. Our 
North American revenue grew by 6% to 
£224.8m (2016: £211.1m). In constant 
currency this equated to a year-on-year 
increase of 2%. Savills Studley executed 
transaction volumes 24% higher than the 
previous year, which largely offset a 
significant reduction in the large complex 
transactions for which this business is noted. 
Much of this is deferral through uncertainty 
rather than cancellation and the pipeline of 
activity for 2018 is robust. 
A number of cities and regions such as 
Southern California, San Francisco, and 
Philadelphia enjoyed strong performances 
during the year. The performance of these 
offices helped offset the effect of deferrals 
which particularly affected the Washington 
DC region in respect of Government-
related transactions.
These factors, together with the significant 
investment made in assembling and 
supporting our new New York Capital 
markets team and the lag effect of team lifts 
in California and Denver, led to a decrease  
in North American underlying profit of 59% 
to £7.8m (2016: £18.9m), a 60% decline in 
constant currency.
Continental Europe
The Continental European Commercial 
Transaction Advisory business grew 
revenue by 9% to £78.2m (2016: £71.5m). 
This was driven by the continued strength 
of our Irish business across both Investment 
and Leasing/Tenant Rep and strong 
performances from Germany, the 
Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The 
performance was also set against 
developing Logistics expertise in the 
Netherlands and Poland as well as 
significant investment in opening an office  
in Czech Republic, building Investment and 
Leasing capabilities through team lifts there.
During the year we continued to build on our 
Continental European platform with the 
acquisitions of Larry Smith in Italy and on the 
29 December 2017, the acquisition of Aguirre 
Newman in Spain.
As a result of these additional costs, the 
Continental European Transaction Advisory 
business recorded an underlying profit of 
£4.5m (2016: £5.0m), 10% lower than in 
2016, 22% on a constant currency basis.

Property and Facilities Management
Our Property and Facilities Management businesses continued to  
perform well, growing revenue by 9% (5% in constant currency) to  
£513.1m (2016: £472.8m). Underlying profit increased by 7% to £25.3m  
(2016: £23.6m), 5% in constant currency.
Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific region grew revenue by 
10% (5% in constant currency) to £300.9m 
(2016: £273.8m). The Property and Facilities 
Management business is a significant 
strength in the region, representing 53%  
of Savills Asia Pacific revenue and 
complementing our Transaction Advisory 
businesses. The total square footage under 
management in the region was up 5%  
to approximately 1.49bn sq ft (2016: 
approximately 1.41bn sq ft), primarily due to 
new contracts in Mainland China and Hong 
Kong. In Hong Kong, which represented 
approximately 55% of Asia Pacific Property 
and Facilities Management revenue, the 
business grew revenue by 7% in local 
currency. Overall the underlying profit of  
the Asia Pacific Property Management 
business grew 6% (2% in constant 
currency) to £15.4m (2016: £14.5m).
UK
Overall, our UK Property Management 
teams, comprising Commercial, Residential 
and Rural, grew reported revenue by 4% to 
£165.8m (2016: £158.9m). Following 
completion of the integration of the business 
of Smiths Gore, approximately £20.0m of 
revenue and £1.6m of underlying profit, 
which had hitherto been recognised in the 
rural property management business, was 
reallocated to the other business segments; 
adjusting for this, like-for-like revenue growth 
was approximately 17%. The Residential 
management business and the UK 
Commercial business together grew area 
under management by 22% to 
approximately 353m sq ft (2016: 289m sq ft). 
Our Residential Property Management 
businesses, including Lettings, increased 
revenue by 8%. Underlying profit for the UK 
Property Management business grew 4%  
to £11.7m (2016: £11.3m).
Continental Europe
In Continental Europe revenue grew by 16% 
(8% in constant currency) to £46.4m (2016: 
£40.1m) with growth particularly in Ireland, 
France, the Netherlands and Poland 
offsetting lower revenues in Sweden. In 
addition, the Larry Smith acquisition in Italy 
contributed revenues of £1.9m. By the year 
end the total area under management had 
increased by 94% to 106.9m sq ft, with Larry 
Smith contributing 5m sq ft and Aguirre 
Newman, in Spain, which completed on 29 
December 2017, adding a further 38m sq ft. 
The net effect of these factors was an 
improvement in the underlying loss for the 
year to £1.8m (2016: loss £2.2m).
Global Consultancy revenue increased 
by 14% to £273.1m (2016: £240.3m), 12% 
in constant currency, and underlying 
profit grew by 20% to £31.0m (2016: 
£25.9m), 12% in constant currency.
UK
Consultancy service revenue in the UK was 
up 12% at £204.9m (2016: £183.1m). There 
were strong performances in the planning 
and development teams, along with 
revenue growth in building and project 
consultancy, hotels and leisure and lease 
consultancy. Following completion of the 
integration of the business of Smiths Gore, 
approximately £14.0m of revenue and 
£1.2m of underlying profit, which had 
hitherto been recognised in the rural 
property management business, was 
reallocated to the Consultancy business 
segments. Overall underlying profit from  
the UK Consultancy business increased  
by 8% to £23.9m (2016: £22.2m).
Asia Pacific
Revenue in the Asia Pacific Consultancy 
business increased by 21% to £45.7m 
(2016: £37.9m), 14% in constant currency. 
There was significant growth in Hong Kong 
and also in China, where revenues were 
well ahead of 2016 in both the valuation and 
research consultancy teams. There were 
also improving trends in Australia, South 
Korea, Singapore and Vietnam. 
Consequently, underlying profit increased 
by 113% to £5.1m (2016: £2.4m), 104%  
up on a constant currency basis.
Continental Europe
Our Continental European Consultancy 
business, which principally comprises 
valuation and underwriting advisory 
services, increased revenue by 17% (9%  
in constant currency) to £22.5m (2016: 
£19.3m). In particular, there were stronger 
performances in Germany, France, the 
Netherlands and Spain. Underlying profit 
increased by 54% (38% in constant 
currency) to £2.0m (2016: £1.3m).

Savills plc 
Report and Accounts 2016 Following Savills Investment Management’s 
record result in 2016, the expected decrease 
in disposal activity from the liquidating SEB 
German Open Ended Funds caused revenue 
to decrease by 8% (11% in constant 
currency) to £66.5m (2016: £72.0m). This 
generated an underlying profit of £13.3m 
(2016: £17.6m). Assets under management 
(‘AUM’) increased to £14.6bn (2016: 
£13.9bn), as the £1.9bn of new capital raised 
in the year outweighed the effect of 
liquidation distributions to unit holders of the 
former SEB German Open Ended Funds. 
Transactions of approximately £4.8bn (2016: 
£4.4bn) were executed on behalf of fund 
investors, a record annual volume. This 
included £2.58bn of disposals and £2.23bn 
of acquisitions.
Investment performance continued strongly 
with the majority of our Fund products 
continuing to exceed their benchmarks over 
a five year term. Indeed this performance 
was recognised publicly when three funds 
won significant awards during the year: The 
Charities Property Fund was named Core 
Fund of the year by Property Investor 
Europe; The Diageo Core Fund was the best 
performing segregated Pension Fund (above 
£350m) at the MSCI/IPF Awards; and The 
Boccaccio Fund was the best performing 
Italian Specialist Fund at the MSCI European 
Property Investment Awards.
