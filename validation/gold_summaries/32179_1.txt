 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 12
MARKETS
We supply a wide range of essential services under the Utility Warehouse brand (gas, electricity, landline, 
broadband and mobile) to both domestic and small business Members throughout the UK; these are all 
substantial markets and represent a vast opportunity for further organic growth.
The markets we operate in are dominated by a relatively small number of former monopoly suppliers and 
other owners of infrastructure assets, although in each there are also a number of independent suppliers 
carving out their own niches, generally based on offering highly competitive introductory deals promoted 
through price comparison sites. 
BUSINESS MODEL
We have a fundamentally different business model to any other utility provider in the UK in three key respects:
•  we operate our business as a Discount Club; each of our customers becomes a Member, receiving a level 
of service commensurate with that status;
•  we are the only fully integrated provider of both energy and communications services in the country. This 
enables us to enjoy unparalleled levels of operating efficiency as we are able to spread a single set of 
overheads across the multiple revenue streams that we derive from each of our Members; and 
•  we have a unique route to market, with an ‘army’ of around 40,000 part-time self-employed Partners; 
rather than seeking to attract new Members through expensive advertising or price comparison sites, we 
instead benefit from personal recommendations by both our Partners and our existing Members.
Partners can earn a small percentage of the monthly revenues generated by any Members gathered, 
either personally, or by someone in their team. On a similar basis, we reward our existing Members with 
shopping vouchers when they introduce a new Member to the Club. 
We continue to follow a different strategy to that of our competitors in both the energy and communications 
markets, focussing on delivering an integrated multi-utility proposition that includes three key benefits: 
Savings (compared with the prices they were previously paying), Simplicity (just one convenient monthly bill 
making it easier to manage a significant part of their monthly household budget), and Service (delivered by 
our award-winning UK-based support teams). 
These benefits are supported by our commitment to treating our Members fairly, avoiding the typical 
marketing strategy adopted by our competitors of combining cheap introductory deals for new customers 
with much higher tariffs charged to their legacy customer bases. We believe their approach is not only 
fundamentally unfair on loyal customers, but less likely to create a sustainable long term business, as 
customers who have chosen to switch once based solely on the headline price on a comparison site will 
have a higher propensity to do so again when their introductory deal expires; this view is supported by 
recent switching data within the electricity market for domestic customers, where reported churn amongst 
small and medium suppliers (excluding ourselves) is now running at an annualised rate of over 30%. 
Our alternative approach is to focus on treating all our Members in a fair manner, and to give everyone 
consistently good value on all their services, rewarding loyalty and commitment with additional discounts 
and benefits available to our most valuable and long-standing Members.
