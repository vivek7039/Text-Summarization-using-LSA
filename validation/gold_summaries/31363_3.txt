Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement 
2017 was a year of significant 
achievement for Sportech PLC. 
Following a positive litigation 
ruling and the sale of our core 
UK business, the Group repaid 
£60 million of debt and returned 
£75 million to shareholders, whilst 
having sufficient cash to facilitate 
immediate growth prospects 
during the year. 
Your Board has also undergone some change during 
the year and I’m delighted to have welcomed Richard 
Cooper and Giles Vardey, who bring leading gaming 
and business experience, and Andrew Gaughan, now 
CEO, to the PLC Board. These appointments bring 
significant incremental expertise and skills to the 
Group.
The Board wishes to acknowledge Directors who 
departed the Board in 2017: Roger Withers (who had 
served as Chairman), Ian Penrose (Chief Executive) 
and Mickey Kalifa (CFO). 
In March 2017 the Group announced a conditional 
agreement to sell the Football Pools business, which 
was subsequently passed by shareholders in April 
2017. The Football Pools represented the mainstay 
of the Group’s EBITDA and in particular, the bulk of 
the UK earnings stream. The sale completed in June 
2017 and now the Group’s earnings are around 80% 
denominated in USD, with GBP representing around 
10%, Euro’s 8%, and CAD 2%. The Board anticipates 
further growth in USD contributions going forward 
and the Board will be evaluating whether the 
reporting currency for the Group should become the 
US dollar.
The current Board recognises stakeholder concern 
regarding previous investment venture returns 
and a track record of impairing investments, 
which unfortunately continued in 2017 as the book 
valuations of various historic investments have yet 
again had to be revalued downwards. Given an 
absence of an investment strategy in early 2017, to 
provide tangible growth opportunities, the Board 
elected to return capital to shareholders thus de-
risking investor capital.
Indeed, the Group made two significant returns of 
capital to shareholders during the year. This was the 
first time in its recent history that capital has been 
returned to shareholders. £21 million was returned 
in March 2017 via a Tender Offer and, following a 
required Court approved capital reduction, a further 
£54 million was returned by way of a special dividend 
in December 2017.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Following the sale of the Football Pools and 
significant capital returns to shareholders, it became 
inevitable that having a UK-based executive 
management team was not an appropriate structure 
for the Group going forward. Following the 
announced decisions by UK-based senior executives 
to leave the now US-focused Group, a cost reduction 
exercise commenced to streamline the UK cost base. I 
am pleased to report that the Board has executed on 
this plan and has reduced the UK corporate cost base 
significantly going forward.
At all times during this process, consent has been 
sought, and been given, by the regulatory authorities 
where change in management is a condition 
precedent. The Group continues to enjoy excellent 
relationships with these regulators.
Formal Sale Process
In October 2017, after a number of unsolicited 
external approaches, the Board decided that it 
would consider formal offers for the Group and 
commenced a Formal Sale Process. The Board and 
senior management invested considerable time over 
many months in diligently managing this initiative; 
meeting numerous interested parties and presenting 
the business capabilities and potential. However, the 
Board, together with its advisors, concluded that none 
of those approaches were likely to result in an offer 
for all or a material part of the Group that the Board 
would be able to recommend to shareholders, and the 
termination of this process was therefore announced 
on 14 March 2018.
Strategic Review
The Strategic Review, announced on 18 September 
2017, concluded that Sportech has significant 
potential for long-term value creation through 
a combination of: growing its core businesses; 
diversification; and benefitting from the possible 
liberalisation of sports betting in a number of US 
states.
Following the departure of the previous senior 
executives, Richard Cooper (a Non-Executive Director 
and Chair of the Audit Committee) and I commenced 
a thorough review of the financial and contractual 
affairs of the Group. The Group views “exceptional 
items” as simply that, items that are exceptional in 
nature and size (the de minimis being the materiality 
threshold applied by the auditors) and which if to 
recur, are not, therefore, exceptional, or separately 
reported items which we understand to be the 
preferred usage of the FRC.

Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
A number of provisions have been made for onerous 
contracts or potential bad debts as this process 
unfolded. Some of the significant project and 
investment cessations have been as follows:
� In January 2010, the Group announced a joint 
venture (“JV”), launching a sports gaming 
business in India. £3.1 million was invested in 
that JV up to 31 December 2016, which by that 
date had all been expensed. The JV was almost 
dormant in 2017, and by February 2018, the 
JV was terminated as minimal revenues were 
recognised, and the JV had ongoing costs with 
limited potential for returns.
� In December 2013, the Group announced plans 
to build a proposed 10,000 sq.ft. sports bar, 
restaurant and betting facility in the town of 
Norco, Southern California. This site had not been 
developed, currently lies vacant and during 2017 
a further provision of £1.2 million was made for 
the onerous lease and other associated liabilities. 
Alternative use options are currently being 
reviewed.
� In October 2015, the Group opened its first 
branded sports bar (“Striders”), restaurant and 
betting facility in downtown San Diego, California. 
This operation was a joint venture with local 
operators. The venue has not been as successful 
as the previous executive team had originally 
forecasted and the Group is in dispute with its 
partners and accordingly a provision of £1.3 
million has been made for onerous contracts.  
The Board are reviewing its options in relation  
to this investment.
� Additionally, the Group undertook a review of 
non-core assets and, in the Netherlands, following 
the award of a new five-year licence in June 2017 
to provide the exclusive right to conduct tote 
betting on horseracing, the Board decided to 
revisit the potential sale of that business. I am 
pleased to report that in March 2018 we executed 
a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain 
regulatory conditions and anticipate completing 
on this disposal in H1 2018. This business has  
been included in these accounts as an asset   
held for sale.
� The Board are further examining the value of 
surplus real-estate in North America, to assess all 
options to extract further value for shareholders. 
The Group owns two freehold sites in 
Connecticut; a nine-acre site in New Haven and a 
seven-acre site adjacent to the airport in Bradley. 
However, the Group does operate a significant 
venue onsite at each of these locations, which 
therefore restricts its flexibility.

Regulatory framework and    
US Sports Betting 
The possibility of the US market moving towards a 
broader regulation of sports gaming continues at 
pace with a number of states preparing to enact 
legislation if the US Supreme Court permits.
Furthermore, the governing bodies of certain 
significant US sports have lobbied hard for an 
opening-up of legislation. Through the Group’s 
existing regulatory, commercial and customer 
network, the Board believe there are significant 
opportunities to leverage these relationships and as 
a result of this, significant time has been invested 
in assessing the optimal platform for Sportech’s 
B2C and B2B businesses to capitalise on this 
potential momentous change. The Board anticipates 
announcing the launch of a Sportsbook utilising a 
reputable third-party vendor in H1-2018.
Shoreline Star LLC Agreement
As part of the acquisition of the US racing business 
from Scientific Games in 2010, the Group acquired 
a contract with Shoreline Star LLC (“Shoreline”). 
This contract provides a share of profits to Shoreline 
from new forms of gaming within the US state of 
Connecticut, for 25 years after the commencement of 
legalised new forms of gaming. The dominant clause 
of this contact reads:
“Under the terms of the amended contract, Shoreline 
Star shall now receive approximately 50% of profits 
after tax from these new forms of gaming for a 25-
year period (with a ratchet downwards commencing 
after five years) following commencement. Any 
payments under this revised contract will only occur 
after Sportech fully recover any capital investment 
from additional cash flows generated.”
The “downward ratchet” provides for a reduction in 
profit share paid to Shoreline Star LLC, from 50% to 
end year five, then 40% to end year ten and 30% for 
remaining fifteen years.
I raise this now purely to ensure shareholders are fully 
aware of this material contract when assessing the 
potential net returns to Sportech PLC from the advent 
of US Sports Betting, or other forms of enhanced 
gaming that benefit the Group within the State of 
Connecticut.
Sportech has significant potential for 
long-term value creation through: growing 
its core businesses; diversification; and 
benefitting from the possible liberalisation 
of sports betting in a number of US states.”

Outlook and Trading Update
Venues
Q1-2018 revenue growth in Venues has been higher 
than in Q1-2017, but below our expectations.
The Stamford location continues to build market 
positioning and financial momentum, but the pre-
opening business plan was overly optimistic and the 
actual and now anticipated timeline for the business 
to reach revenues and profits, commensurate with 
targeted initial investment returns, will take well 
into 2019. However, in order to address certain 
opportunities, we are at an advanced stage of 
recruiting experienced F&B and Group Sales expertise 
to build that side of the business aggressively going 
forward and to bring it in line with revenues and profit 
levels that this high quality and well-located sports 
and wagering bar/restaurant should be producing. 
The output and results of these actions is unlikely to 
have a material impact until Q3/Q4 of 2018 due to 
the management recruiting, and rebuilding of local 
awareness for the facility.
Wagering revenues softness in the Venues business is 
primarily from our digital platform and at Stamford. 
This is being addressed through a renewed digital 
focused marketing plan that is concentrated on 
combating out-of-state digital Advanced Deposit 
Wagering (“ADW”) operators that have recruited and 
taken our Connecticut resident customers into their 
own ADW digital platforms, all based in Oregon. 
This business and revenue recapture and digital 
development will be further augmented and 
supported through the anticipated gaming bill SB 
276 coming into force and effect, late this spring, 
for which the Group has led the lobby with our 
Connecticut General Assembly and Department of 
Consumer Protection regulatory offices. The gaming

bill, in essence, seeks to explicitly make illegal the 
taking of wagers from Connecticut residents within 
Connecticut unless being taken by the authorised 
pari-mutuel wagering operator; which of course is 
Sportech Venues. The Group will be aggressively 
enlisting the cease and desist actions of the 
Connecticut Attorney General’s office in upholding 
this law when it comes into force. The Group will 
combine an aggressive marketing, advertising and 
customer rebate programme that messages and 
focuses around taking back customers from the 
businesses operating illegally from outside the State 
of Connecticut.
Racing and Digital
The component revenue parts of the Racing and 
Digital businesses, including one-time sales, core 
contracted and recurring tote services across all 
regions, digital B2B services and Bump 50:50, are 
broadly trading in line with our expectations. 
Costs across all the businesses are broadly in line with 
management’s expectations and our sales pipeline 
remains a key focus for the year. It will now be the key 
variant in achieving or exceeding our internal revenue 
and profits expectations for 2018.
Cash position
Net of customer balances, the Group’s cash position 
at 31 March was £12 million. The initial net proceeds of 
the sale of the Venues business in the Netherlands are 
expected to be £2.6 million, receivable in June/July 
2018.
This is both an exciting and challenging time for the 
Group as it continues to navigate through certain 
historic issues and present a transparent and realistic 
overview of the Company.
The Board and core management, led by Andrew 
Gaughan, the new CEO, remain focused on executing 
a strategy to capitalise on the significant potential 
a US Supreme Court repeal of the Professional and 
Amateur Sports Act (“PASPA”) could deliver.
The senior management team remain resolute in its 
proactive campaign with the Connecticut General 
Assembly and associated stakeholders in positioning 
Sportech as the obvious licensee to conduct sports 
betting within that state.
The Group is well advanced in securing a Sportsbook 
partner in anticipation of regulatory easing and 
the Board assures shareholders that the core 
management team continues to provide testimony, 
evidence and insight to the political debate on this 
critical topic. In addition, the senior management 
team have commenced discussions with their 
business clients and others across the US in preparing 
them for the opportunities and challenges ahead.
Finally, I would urge you to visit our revised corporate 
website, www.sportechplc.com, which in addition 
to stock exchange regulated news, provides regular, 
non-regulatory updates to shareholders about your 
Company.
