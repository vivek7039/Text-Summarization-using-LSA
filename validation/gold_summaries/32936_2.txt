equivalent, above the guidance range for the year of  
255,000 – 265,000 oz. (2016 production: 261,159 oz).
Average realised price of gold equivalents was US$1,162 per oz 
for the year (2016: US$1,136 per oz).
Total Cash Costs increased by 11.7% to US$507 per oz, 
influenced by the stronger rouble, while All-In Sustaining  
Cash Costs inched up by 1.8% to US$664 per oz.
Cash inflow from operating activities decreased by 6.0%  
to US$131.0 million (2016: US$139.3 million)

Interim dividend of £0.0498 per share paid for H1 2017  
(2016: Interim dividend of £0.05 per share).
Mnogovershinnoye (MNV) – New JORC-compliant reserve 
estimate at MNV doubled ore reserves and supported the 
extension of life-of-mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial 
results from the ongoing near-mine exploration programme 
indicating resources for additional years of operation. New 
exploration licences were received for two areas adjacent to MNV. 
Novoshirokinskoye (Novo) – Updated resource and reserve 
estimates for Novo supported an increase in gold equivalent 
ounces by more than 70%, but at lower grades. The planned 
expansion of ore mining and processing capacity to 1.3 mtpa  
is ongoing and is now expected to achieve its full capacity in  
the year 2020.
Belaya Gora –A pre-feasibility study (PFS) was developed for 
Belaya Gora including plant upgrades and the treatment of ore 
from the nearby Blagodatnoye deposit (finalised and released  
in early 2018). Mining at Belaya Gora continued to focus on 
processing low-grade ore stockpiles pending the completion  
of an ongoing project review.
Kekura – Preparations made for construction and work advanced 
on a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) and updated JORC-
compliant mineral resource and ore reserve estimates (finalised 
and released in early 2018). 
Baley Hub – De-watering programme continued for existing 
Taseevskoye open-pit with a view to de-risking the project and 
allowing for further reserve confirmation, with attention now 
turned to finding new water disposal solutions. On the ZIF-1  
Tailings licence, the Board approved funding for design work  
on a possible heap leach operation.
Unkurtash – Scoping study completed and released, and 
discussions held with potential partners for joint project 
development.
The Company’s Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy 
targeting a payout of 20% of net cash flow from operations.

the Board of Directors, making a total distribution of £0.104 per 
share for the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: £0.104 per share). STRATEGIC REPORT
