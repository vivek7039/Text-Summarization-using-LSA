 “Arqiva’s strong financial 
results are driven by 
excellent operating 
performances in T errestrial 
Broadcast and T elecoms & 
M2M”
We are focusing on core business 
activities that drive profitable growth and 
shareholder value in our quest to become 
the most efficient and effective provider 
of communications infrastructure in the 
UK. We will continue to play a central role 
in helping to enable an innovative and 
vibrant digital economy here in the UK.
The first point worth noting, and 
celebrating, is the strength of our 
financial performance. It has been 
another excellent year for Arqiva, as we 
continue to see the reward from the 
strategic capital investment decisions 
over recent years, with our operating cash 
flow after investing activities improving 
significantly. The strong, and sustained, 
financial improvements are driven by 
a number of factors, including major 
programme rollouts (700MHz Clearance, 
DAB, 4G and smart metering), an 
improvement in programme execution 
and our ambitious cost reduction 
activities. Our on-going commitment to 
our FutureFit programme will ensure that 
we continue to strengthen our operating 
efficiency for the future.
Our strategy for growth 
Our ambition is to be central to every 
vital connection that people in the UK 
make, every day. This means ensuring 
we remain competitive in our existing 
core markets as technology and demand 
for data drives change, and being at the 
heart of decision making about those 
markets. This has been evident with the 
DTT platform on which we worked with 
Broadcast Networks Europe and other 
global industry representatives to secure 
the continued protection of use of the 
DTT spectrum; as well as working with 
major broadcasters and Ofcom to ensure 
we are at the heart of the programme 
to clear spectrum to be used for mobile 
data services (i.e. our 700MHz Clearance 
programme). The next big evolution in 
our core markets is the emergence of 5G. 
In March 2017, the UK Government 
released “A 5G Strategy for the UK” 
supporting the views of the National 
Infrastructure Commission report. 
The strategy lays out the ambition 
and actions required to create an 
environment that positions the UK as 
a “global leader in the next generation 
of mobile technologies and digital 
communications”. The report states that 
to deliver the high speed, high capacity 
capabilities of 5G will likely require the 
deployment of a significant number of 
small cells. 
We are already well placed to play 
a leading role in the deployment of 
5G technology which will bring major 
benefits to consumers in the form of 
faster mobile data connections. In 
February 2017 Arqiva announced a 
partnership with Samsung to run the 
first UK 5G field trials using fixed wireless 
access in the 28GHz spectrum for which 
we have a national licence. In recent 
months we have also acquired a further 
licence to use this spectrum which 
covers Central and Greater London and 
bolsters Arqiva’s existing spectrum band 
ownership. The trial is now in operation 
in Arqiva’s London offices over the 
summer and showcases its solution to 
demonstrate what superfast connectivity 
will mean for UK business and residents.

Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017
The main drivers of growth were 
in T elecoms & M2M and T errestrial 
Broadcast, with revenues up 18.5%
1 
and 6.3% respectively. A significant 
proportion of this has come from 
recurring revenues from the core 
telecoms towers business, DTT platform 
and radio contracts, and the Group’s 
smart metering network. Added to this 
we’ve seen greater revenues driven by 
customer improvement programmes, 
specifically accelerations to 4G 
equipment upgrades to assist MNOs in 
meeting coverage requirements, and 
meter sales in relation to the smart water 
metering contract with Thames Water. 
Satellite and Media benefitted from new 
HD channel sales, a new agreement with 
Al Jazeera Media Network for global 
teleport distribution services and foreign 
exchange gains.
The visibility of revenues with a 
contracted order book of £5.7 billion, 
inflation-linked pricing, and the 
opportunity to increase utilisation of 
our infrastructure, places Arqiva in a 
very strong position to continue to 
deliver stable profitable growth. Our 
on-going and significant investment 
in digital broadcast infrastructure; 4G, 
5G, in-building solutions and small 
cells underlines Arqiva’s commitment 
to support the UK’s ambition to have 
a vibrant and globally competitive 
economy.
Alongside our growth strategy, our 
transformation programme, ‘FutureFit‘, 
is lowering our cost base; streamlining 
processes, modernising and making 
our systems more robust, resulting 
in improved customer service and 
operational delivery.
Operational delivery 
We have continued to successfully deliver, 
to our clients satisfaction a number of 
large-scale projects which leverage our 
tower infrastructure, including smart 
energy and water metering. 
During the year our smart energy 
metering contract for the North of 
England went ‘live’ bringing new, and 
recurring, revenue streams into the M2M 
business. The rollout of the network 
is currently at 92% coverage and the 
rate of rollout to consumers’ homes is 
expected to accelerate over the next 12 
months following service user testing. 
Following the excellent delivery and 
results on the smart water metering 
contract with Thames Water, our 
customer has taken the decision to 
accelerate their network deployment. 
This will help to achieve coverage of 3 
million homes several years earlier than 
originally planned in order to realise the 
benefits of extended coverage sooner. 
The Group is progressing with the DAB 
rollout programme for the BBC, and has 
completed upgrades to the analogue 
radio network as part of the BBC New 
Radio Agreement. Additionally the 
Group is now completing the final sites 
of the present phase of its commercial 
local DAB programme, meeting the 
government’s target of 90% coverage 
during this financial year; and with the 
final sites in this phase expected later 
this calendar year. At present there is no 
definitive timetable set for the switchover 
from analogue to digital; however the 
new Minister of State for Digital and 
Culture, Matt Hancock, has reconfirmed 
that a review of switchover policy will 
take place when digital radio accounts for 
more than 50% of total listening. 
Activity in relation to the 700MHz 
clearance programme has increased as 
we move into the programme delivery 
phase. Arqiva is responsible for a wide 
range of services required as part of 
the programme including spectrum 
planning, network design, programme 
management, infrastructure changes, 
service continuity, asset replacement and 
retuning of broadcast transmitters to 
enable broadcasters to move into a lower 
frequency.
Within the Satellite and Media business 
unit, technology improvements 
have been implemented to increase 
transponder capacity on existing 
transponders as well as exiting certain 
low margin contracts. UKDTH has 
achieved growth of HD channels.
Outlook 
This is an exciting time for the business 
with improvements in financial 
performance and operational efficiency. 
Combined with the continued leveraging 
of our critical national infrastructure we 
are well placed to benefit from emerging 
market opportunities, such as 5G. I am 
confident that our strategy, together with 
the support of our people, will continue 
to deliver our objectives and enable us to 
grow as a business.
