 Maintaining a strong portfolio of businesses
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present the Annual 
Report for 2017, a year in which DMGT 
demonstrated once again the benefits 
of maintaining a strong portfolio of 
businesses that have the potential to 
deliver attractive long-term returns for 
our shareholders. This has been a year 
of transformation as we have made 
significant changes across the Group. We 
have established new strategic priorities 
and we are better positioned to deliver 
long-term shareholder value. That said, 
this year’s financial performance has 
been affected by challenging market 
conditions and the continued volatility 
in the wider media industry, however, 
DMGT has benefited from the resilience 
provided by its diversified portfolio. 
Your Group has also continued to invest 
to take advantage of the trends in both 
B2B and consumer digital markets. 
The strategic focus on operational execution 
under Paul Zwillenberg, your CEO, resulted 
in DMGT maintaining a double-digit adjusted 
operating margin.
We saw encouraging signs of growth from 
investments in several initiatives designed 
to deliver long-term organic returns, albeit 
with reduced expectations for some B2B 
businesses that are facing particularly 
challenging market conditions and which 
resulted in impairments that adversely 
affected our statutory results.
We have continued to take a disciplined 
approach to capital allocation, investing to 
expand our market positions in key sectors. 
During 2017, enhancing our financial 
flexibility has also been one of our strategic 
priorities, with disposals and healthy cash 
flow reducing net debt to 1.4 times EBITDA, 
the lowest level for over 20 years. The Board 
is therefore pleased to recommend a 3% 
increase in the final dividend per share for 
2017, giving a total dividend for the year 
of 22.7 pence per share, an increase of 
3% continuing DMGT’s long-standing 
commitment to delivering sustainable 
annual real dividend growth.
In Consumer Media, dmg media’s 
performance demonstrated that it is 
possible for a modern news media company 
to prosper in a digital world. Our Mail titles, 
in print and online, have continued to 
produce highly valued content for their 
global audience. Providing quality, popular 
journalism has resulted in circulation 
outperformance. In addition, an unparalleled 
cross-media advertising proposition in 
print and digital formats across the Mail 
and Metro titles has benefited performance. 
While print advertising continues its secular 
decline, MailOnline continues to win 
audiences across each platform it partners 
with, delivering strong levels of digital 
advertising growth. 
In our B2B businesses, the requirement to 
have fully integrated data analytic solutions 
has become an increasing priority across all 
industries and our operations are already at 
the forefront of this trend. A major milestone 
was reached this year with the launch of 
Risk Modeler on the RMS(one) platform, 
DMGT’s first truly enterprise class solution. 
This was achieved alongside the release 
of an unprecedented number of new risk 
models. Our Education Technology (EdTech) 
business, Hobsons, is bringing predictive 
analytics and improvements to the customer 
experience across its Naviance, Starfish and 
Intersect platforms. Our European property 
information businesses are using their 
modelling expertise with large data sets 
to launch new products which will enable 
faster decision-making in the insurance and 
banking sectors. Continued investment in 
our events business has supported a strong 
launch programme where innovative organic 
growth is being pursued internationally. 
Beyond operational execution and 
enhancing financial flexibility, one of the 
main considerations of the Board is to 
ensure our portfolio is in optimal shape to 
harness market growth dynamics, as well as 
withstand market volatility. During the year, 
DMGT unlocked significant value by reducing 
its holding in Euromoney Institutional 
Investor PLC (Euromoney) to around 49%. 
DMGT has benefited from the resilience 
provided by its diversified portfolio, 
during continued challenging 
market conditions.

flexibility to pursue its own strategy. 
Refocusing and disposals within our 
Consumer Media and B2B divisions have 
enabled us to focus on the most attractive 
growth opportunities. Going forward, 
although we recognise the benefits of 
spreading risk across a diversified portfolio, 
there are clear advantages to operating in 
fewer sectors, especially in terms of resource 
allocation and our ability to expand our 
market shares in the most attractive sectors.

The implementation of our Group strategy 
is overseen by the Board of Directors, which 
maintains the high standards of governance 
our shareholders expect. The Governance 
Report sets out the framework for operating 
performance and shareholder value that 
is central to the growth of DMGT. 
I am pleased that Tim Collier joined as the 
Group Chief Financial Officer during the year. 
Tim’s prior experience working for portfolio 
companies in B2B information, events and 
media sectors with a significant US presence 
is aligned with DMGT’s businesses and 
overall Group focus. I am confident 
he will help to lead DMGT to further success.
I would like to thank our Non-Executive 
Directors for their contribution over the past 
year with the Group benefiting from their 
skills and experience at both an individual 
business and Board level. During the year 
François Morin joined DMGT’s Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. François brings an 
international perspective relevant to the 
Group’s global operations and experience of 
regulatory matters across a range of areas. 
Sadly, following a short illness, Nicholas 
Berry, Non-Executive Director, died in 
December 2016. Nicholas had served on 
the DMGT Board for nine years, providing 
invaluable advice and insights across 
a wide range of areas, particularly our 
leadership programmes.

Throughout its history, DMGT has relied 
upon the talent, experience and skills of its 
employees through their innovation and 
entrepreneurial drive. We also recognise 
that the talent development in critical skills 
must keep pace with our strategic ambitions 
both through leveraging our existing teams 
as well as supplementing our abilities 
with leading-edge external experience. 
For more information on our talent 
development programmes please refer to 
the Our People and Our Communities section. 
As Chairman of the Board, I want to thank 
all our employees for their dedication, 
hard work and significant contribution to 
the Group as well as their wider community. 
Sadly, this came into sharp focus in 2017, 
as DMGT employees supported the relief 
efforts following the Grenfell Tower fire and 
Hurricane Harvey, tragedies that struck at 
the heart of communities where our people 
live and work.

Our Communities, pages 32 to 35
At the senior management level, 
remuneration and incentives drive focus 
on performance aligned to our strategic 
priorities. Our value creation metrics 
and related payments are set out in the 
Remuneration Report.

The Board and I remain confident in 
DMGT’s prospects for long-term growth. 
Our focus in the coming year is to continue 
to execute against the new strategic 
framework, which will position DMGT 
for the next wave of growth, as well 
as manage expected continued market 
volatility. We remain confident that through 
our strong entrepreneurial and innovative 
capability, DMGT will be able to benefit 
from the opportunities being brought by the 
increasing pace of change and complexity 
in our industries. Through harnessing our 
growth opportunities and investing in 
the best ideas we remain confident that 
DMGT will deliver good long-term returns 
to shareholders.
