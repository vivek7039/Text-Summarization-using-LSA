 Hampton-Alexander Review, November 2016.
Not many people predicted the political 
outcomes seen over the last 12 months, not 
only in the UK, but around the world. It was 
certainly an eventful year.
But good businesses become stronger when 
they are put to the test and I am delighted to 
report that, despite uncertainty caused by the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU, we have not only 
demonstrated the resilience of our business 
but also shown how our strategic approach 
enables us to respond to such issues.
In the weeks following the EU referendum 
there was a peak of uncertainty around the  
full impacts that would be felt by businesses 
and the UK as a whole. For us in very broad 
terms, we considered the potential impact  
on consumer confidence affecting our retail 
business and what the result could do  
to business confidence, in particular the  
choice of global organisations to locate  
large parts of their businesses in London.
Our strategic approach is based on long  
term trends. We track consumer and occupier 
expectations and key themes impacting our 
business to ensure we address these in creating 
Places People Prefer. As the worlds of work and 
leisure become increasingly connected this  
has led to our assets becoming more mixed use,  
so that people can fulfil the needs of multiple 
demands on their time. Our London office 
campus approach and multi-let retail centre 
focus has proved to be a real differentiator  
in this respect, creating not only outstanding 
buildings but enabling us to make substantial 
improvements to the overall environments  
in which they sit.
Many of our investments over the year have 
been to structure our portfolio around these 
themes and of course work on the majority  
of them started before 23 June 2016. We had 
already positioned our business to respond.
So despite the uncertainty caused, British Land 
has performed well and I would like to thank 
everyone who works for and with us for their 
contribution during this unpredictable time. 
Underlying Profit for the year was £390 million 
up 7.4%. The valuation of our portfolio was 
marginally down 1.4% with EPRA NAV down 
just 0.4% at 915 pence per share with both 
occupier and investor demand remaining  
good over the year. Significantly, valuation 
performance in the second half was stronger 
than the first.
The Board has recommended a fourth quarter 
dividend of 7.3 pence per share making a total 
of 29.2 pence for the year. Together with the 
movement in net asset value, this brings total 
accounting return to 2.7%. We have proposed  
a first quarter dividend of 7.52 pence per share 
and 30.08 pence for the financial year ending  
31 March 2018 representing a further 3% 
increase, signalling our confidence in  
growing income over the medium term. 
Last year I commented that macro-economic and 
political risks had affected the FTSE 100. Shares  
in real estate have been significantly impacted by 
uncertainty. As a largely domestically focused 
business operating in sterling, UK REITs are more 
exposed to the implications of Brexit on the UK 
economy than the majority of the FTSE 100. 
Experience also shows that gaps between 
share price and reported values expand during 
times of uncertainty and there continues to  
be a wide range of views on the potential  
impact of the UK’s decision to leave Europe 
on our markets.
So while our business is in good shape we 
acknowledge that the environment is more 
uncertain. We have led our sector in a number  
of outstanding deals reflecting the quality  
of our portfolio. Just a couple of weeks after  
the EU referendum we exchanged on the sale  
of Debenhams’ flagship store on Oxford Street 
for £400 million, on terms agreed before the vote. 
And in March 2017, together with our JV partners

Includes 70 placements on our Starting 
Out in Retail programme, with 75% 
moving into long term employment. 
1.7% apprentices in our tier 1 supply 
chain pilot study as we work towards  
our 2020 target of 3%.
Oxford Properties, we exchanged contracts for 
the sale of The Leadenhall Building for a headline 
price of £1.15 billion, the most expensive building 
ever sold in the City of London. 
We’ve also had good letting activity over the year; 
solid evidence that our properties are delivering 
what our customers want. As a result our portfolio 
is virtually full at 98%. In a changing world, 
sustainable places are becoming increasingly 
sought after and continue to create value as they 
are both resilient and well positioned to respond  
to changing customer needs. We are proactively 
designing new buildings with a focus on health, 
wellbeing and productivity of the consumers  
and employees who will use those buildings.  
In addition, initiatives to deliver our Local Charter 
make positive local contributions and help our 
places become part of their local communities. 
As the Government’s Minimum Energy  
Efficiency Standards have the potential to affect 
property values, our award-winning efficiency 
programme has positioned our portfolio  
well and we have become a partner of RE100, 
committed to using 100% electricity from 
renewable sources. Our target for 3% of our  
UK supplier workforce to be apprentices by  
2020 also aligns with Government ambitions 
and our Supply Chain Charter supported  
our first Modern Slavery Act Disclosure.
We continue to be recognised for our leading 
stance on sustainability issues, following our 
2016 Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Sustainable 
Development. Our industry-leading energy and 
carbon reductions resulted in British Land being 
named European Sector Leader in the 2016 
Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark for 
the third year running, and winning the CIBSE 
Test of Time Award 2017. We have cut energy 
intensity by 35% and carbon intensity by 44% 
across our portfolio since 2009, as we make 
strong progress towards our challenging 55% 
reduction target by 2020. 
Details of the changes to our Board and 
Committees during the year, and since  
the year end, are set out in the governance  
reports which begin on page 60.
