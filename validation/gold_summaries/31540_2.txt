 We safeguard over 5 billion passenger 
journeys every year worldwide. 
Transport operators are recognising the potential for more powerful, 
integrated command and control systems which not only protect the 
public but help to deliver a better passenger experience, both in and 
around the stations and on the vehicles themselves. 
30 years  
of serving  
customers  
where it  
matters most.
We protect the world’s largest  
Gas-To-Liquids plant, Shell Pearl in Qatar, 
with over 340 cameras across the site.
The complexity of the task facing our Oil & Gas customers is 
enormous: safeguarding on-site personnel; protecting offshore 
and onshore assets; and monitoring hazardous and explosive 
areas, often in remote locations under extreme temperatures.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 02 We monitor the highest grossing casinos 
in Las Vegas, New York, and Singapore.
Gaming is one of the most technically demanding, highly regulated 
leisure industries in the world. Monitoring vast, crowded facilities in 
low-light conditions where massive amounts of cash constantly 
changes hands creates a distinctive and challenging surveillance 
environment for our clients.
We have a deep and unique 
understanding of our clients’ 
issues and challenges. 
And, we draw on this to create solutions they can 
rely on completely – giving them peace of mind 
by securing the people, assets, and livelihoods 
that they are responsible for protecting.
We secure 60% of the UK’s  
nuclear power stations.
Our commercial and public sector customers require sophisticated 
yet user-friendly solutions to protect critical infrastructure, often

great technical complexity.
