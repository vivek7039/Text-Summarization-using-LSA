Strategy
•  The Board is committed to the delivery 
of C4X Discovery’ s (“C4XD’ s”) vision to 
become the world’ s most productive 
drug discovery engine by exploiting 
cutting-edge technologies to design 
and create best-in-class small molecule 
candidates targeting a range of high 
value therapeutic areas.
•  C4XD focusses on generating a high 
value pre-clinical asset portfolio that 
will drive revenue through early stage 
licensing deals with the pharmaceutical 
industry. Existing fee-for-service 
agreements have been discontinued 
during the current financial year.
Partnerships
•  The Company continues to enhance its 
core state-of-the-art target identification 
and drug design capabilities through 
strategic partnerships:
 – A multi-target risk-sharing alliance 
with Evotec AG (“Evotec”) was 
announced in September 2016.
Discovery Engine progress
•  C4XD’ s proprietary drug asset portfolio 
has grown from three programmes in 
2014 to eight programmes across a 
number of therapeutic areas.
•  Disease areas of focus are inflammation, 
neurodegeneration, and opportunistic 
areas (e.g. immuno-oncology, addiction 
and diabetes).
Senior appointments
•  Brad Hoy, Chief Financial Officer, and 
Dr Craig Fox, Chief Scientific Officer, 
were appointed to the Board of 
Directors in November 2016.
