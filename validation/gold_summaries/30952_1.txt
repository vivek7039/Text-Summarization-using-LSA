  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  9
1.0 Strategic Review
Chief Executive’s Review
It is pleasing to be able to report a strong set 
of results for 2017. In particular, cash generation 
has once again been very strong, with net cash 
growing from £2.2m to £7.0m during the year, 
despite spending £1.4m on capital expenditure 
and £1.5m on the cancellation of share options.
Operations
We have succeeded in our aim for 2017 of 
driving the existing business and continuing 
to reduce cost. Gross margins have improved 
at a greater rate than the increase in sales.  
We have sold around 15,000 analysers and 70 
million tests during the year and cemented 
our place as number one supplier of Beta 
Hydroxybutyrate ( β-HB) reagent in the USA, 
and number two worldwide in Hemoglobin 
point-of-care products.
During the year we completed the restructuring 
of our manufacturing operations by closing our 
manufacturing facility in Poland. Production 
volume was shifted to our factory in Barleben, 
Germany and customers successfully 
transitioned away from the older style cuvette 
previously made in Poland. In Barleben we have 
invested in modern production equipment 
including new automated equipment for 
the manufacture and packaging of the Quo-
Test cartridge. At our Elkhart facility, where 
we manufacture a number of wet chemistry 
products, we have a medium term programme 
to update the facilities to improve quality and 
volumes.
Point-of-Care
EKF’s point-of-care business model continues 
to be to sell analysers into the market and 
then benefit from the ongoing revenue 
stream generated by sales of the dedicated 
consumables. Over the last five years we have 
sold over 65,000 analysers for use worldwide, 
and each year we supply a growing number of 
tests for use on these. 
Hematology
Sales of Hematology products have increased 
by 10% to £12.9m (2016: £11.7m). Sales of Hemo 
Control (sold in the USA as HemoPoint H2) 
have built on the strong growth in 2016, rising a 
further 7%, while DiaSpect revenues have risen 
by a further 23%.
Diabetes
Diabetes revenues are up by 13% at £11.5m 
(2016: £10.2m). The Saudi tender won in 2015 
was completed during the year, and this has led 
to an increase in Quo-T est and Quo-Lab sales of 
14%. There has been further success for Biosen 
sales which have risen by 10%.
Central Laboratory
Central laboratory sales have grown by 5% 
to £12.6m, from £12.1m last year, again driven 
by sales of β-HB Liquicolor reagent which 
are higher by a further 17%, having risen by 
a very significant percentage in 2016. We 
have continued to promote our Altair 240 
analyser through an increasing portfolio of 
specialist distributors. Sales of other Central 
Laboratory products have been stable. We have 
discontinued a number of the marginal former 
STI products.
New and updated products
We have concentrated in 2017 on widening 
the range of regulatory approvals for our 
existing product ranges. In particular we have 
conducted a number of clinical trials in the USA 
in anticipation of submitting applications for 
FDA approval in the USA for our DiaSpect Tm 
and Quo-Test products. Quo-Test is also in the 
lab testing phase of its China FDA registration 
and we have secured registration for it in 
Brazil alongside Hemo Control, DiaSpect Tm 
and Quo-Lab. POC Connect, our connectivity 
solution for our DiaSpect Tm handheld analyser 
was launched in November 2017. We will soon 
be showcasing our new and updated Lactate 
Scout 4.0 product. As noted above, we are 
working to secure commercial launch of our 
sTNFR biomarker (for early detection of 
end stage renal disease in diabetic patients), 
alongside a number of partners.
Outlook
We are looking forward to finalising our two 
FDA applications in the first half of 2018, and 
to update on progress with our sTNFR project. 
At the same time, we anticipate receiving 
completed registrations for Beta 
Hydroxybutyrate ( β-HB) in Mexico, Brazil and 
Colombia as well as the Indian registration of 
DiaSpect Tm all in the first half of 2018. 
We are continuing to work hard to increase 
efficiency and reduce costs by investing in 
automation and streamlining processes. We are 
confident that we will continue to see growth in 
the business on a steady and sustainable basis.
