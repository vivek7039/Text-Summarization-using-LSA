Prior year comparatives
The financial year to 2 March 2017 
was a 52-week year and the 
financial year to 3 March 2016 was 
53-week year. In order to provide  
a clearer comparison throughout 
this report, year-on-year growth  
in numbers relating to revenue, 
underlying profit and underlying 
earnings per share are shown 
usingÂ a 52-week comparative, 
which excludes the final week 
ofÂ the 2015/16 financial year. 
AllÂ other statutory comparatives 
and numbers shown at the balance 
sheet date reflect the financial 
statements and do not exclude 
theÂ 53rd week of the prior year.
Performance measures  
The performance of the Group  
is monitored internally using  
a variety of statutory measures 
such as total revenue and profit 
before tax and alternative 
performance measures (APMs) 
such as underlying profit before  
tax, like for like sales and return  
on capital. APMs are not defined 
within IFRS and are used to  
assess the underlying operational 
performance of the Group.  
As such these measures should  
be considered alongside 
IFRSÂ measures.
â€ 
  Definitions of all APMs are 
included in the glossary on 
pageÂ 175.
2016/17
