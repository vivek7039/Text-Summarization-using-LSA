 Chairman’s statement
Bob Ivell
Chairman
Overview
In a challenging year characterised by 
both political and economic turbulence, 
I am pleased to report that the Group 
made good progress in implementing 
the programme of strategic initiatives to 
extend the appeal of the Carpetright brand 
and to address the significant legacy 
issues within its property estate. The 
acceleration of the refurbishment 
programme extended it to over 40% of 
UK stores by year end, well ahead of the 
original target, and is a great example of 
the pace and energy the executive team 
is bringing to these initiatives. Recent 
evidence shows that retailers must adapt 
to combat tougher trading conditions.  
With this in mind, we know we 
need to continue to innovate as we 
strive to differentiate ourselves from 
the competition.
While there is much left to do, we made 
tangible progress across the year in 
key areas such as product offering, 
promotional effectiveness, brand 
perception, store standards and customer 
service. The strategic update on pages 
6 to 16 provides more details on our 
progress against our plan.
Results and dividend
Total revenue for the year ended 
29 April 2017 increased by 0.2% to 
£457.6m (2016: £456.8m), reflecting 
further store closures as we continued 
to rationalise our estate. In challenging 
market conditions, UK like-for-like sales 
declined by 0.5% with an increase of 2.5% 
in the Rest of Europe. Underlying profit 
before tax decreased by 21.3% to £14.4m 
(2016: £18.3m). After the impact of 
separately reported items, statutory profit 
before tax was £0.9m (2016: £12.8m).  
Underlying earnings per share decreased 
to 16.4p (2016: 20.8p) and basic earnings 
per share were 1.0p (2016: 14.9p).
The Board continue to prioritise the use of 
cash for the acceleration of the strategy 
by investing further in the existing store 
estate, while also reducing the fixed 
occupancy costs as quickly as possible.  
As a result, it has taken the decision not 
to pay a final dividend (2016: nil).  Based 
on our current outlook we do not expect 
this position to change in the current 
financial year.
The Board
The composition of the Board was 
unchanged in the year. Much of our 
time has been spent overseeing the 
implementation of multiple strategic 
initiatives and providing an appropriate 
level of challenge to the executive on the 
Group’s response to the tougher trading 
conditions. Further details of the Board’s 
work can be found in the Directors’ report 
starting on page 30 of this Annual Report.
Our people
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank the more than 3,000 colleagues 
working in our stores, distribution centre 
and support offices for their hard work 
and dedication across the year. Their 
commitment to delivering outstanding 
service to our customers is endorsed by 
increased levels of customer satisfaction 
as measured by our Net Promoter Score.  
I am delighted that a significant number 
of our colleagues now participate in our 
SAYE share schemes, enabling them to 
share in our future success.
Summary and outlook
In common with other retailers in the home 
improvement sector in the UK, we have 
experienced more challenging trading 
conditions over recent months. We are 
expecting the consumer environment to 
remain equally testing in the year ahead 
as the uncertainties created by the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU persist. Delivering 
a turnaround in these conditions is not 
easy, but we continue to believe that the 
strategic plan we are implementing will 
ensure the business better capitalises 
on its market leading position and 
provides resilience against weaker 
trading conditions.
While we cannot control external market 
conditions, we have a wide-ranging 
programme of self-help measures on 
which to concentrate and we believe these 
have significant potential to improve the 
performance of the Group. I am confident 
that these will deliver long-term profitable 
growth for the benefit of our shareholders.
