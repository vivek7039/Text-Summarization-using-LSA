BOWLEVEN AT A GLANCE
An Africa-Focused  
Oil and Gas Company
Bowleven plc has strategic interests in key hydrocarbon licences in Cameroon. 
It currently has a 25% interest in an offshore, shallow water permit in Etinde 
and a 100% interest in Bomono, an onshore permit. Our vision is to deliver 
transformational shareholder value through monetisation of our discovered 
hydrocarbons. Creating value from these assets and managing risk are core 
deliverables to our shareholders.
Where We Operate
The West African state of Cameroon has an established hydrocarbon industry with a history  
of oil production from the Rio del Rey Basin.
The Group has strategic equity interests in two permits in Cameroon, the offshore shallow water 
Etinde Permit (non-operated) and the Onshore Bomono Permit (operated).

Our Portfolio
Etinde
The Etinde Permit (formerly MLHP-7 block) was awarded an 
Exploitation Authorisation in July 2014. The production sharing 
contract based Permit has a term of 20 years with an option to extend 
for a further ten years. The licence sits in the prolific Rio del Rey Basin. 
The IM-5 well drilled in 2013, encountered liquids-rich hydrocarbons 
at sufficient volumes to underpin a development scheme within the 
EA framework.
Bowleven has an 25% interest currently. SNH has a right to back-in 
the PSC, which would have the impact of reducing Bowleven’s interest 
to 20%.
Bomono
The Bomono Permit is located in an onshore extension of the Douala 
Basin. The acreage is characterised by numerous surface oil seeps, 
but is under-explored using modern exploration methods. We have 
identified multiple Tertiary and Cretaceous age prospects and leads, 
as well as the hydrocarbons identified in the Moambe and Zingara 
exploration wells drilled in 2015.
