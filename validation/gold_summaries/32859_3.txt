In the face of the intense scrutiny that 
followed, executive management focused 
successfully on the business: we retained our 
clients’ support, saw a good recovery in new 
orders, protected our liquidity, reduced our 
capital intensity, and continued to focus on 
strong execution.
Our response to the investigation
Clearly, for much of 2017 , the Board’s 
attention was dominated by the SFO 
investigation. In May, we took steps to 
ring-fence the investigation from Petrofac’s 
day-to-day business operations, and 
ensure that we responded to the SFO.
Our response included: formation of a 
dedicated Board Committee to govern this 
matter; the appointment of a senior external 
specialist to oversee the Company’s 
management of, and response to, the 
investigation; the restriction of Group Chief 
Executive Ayman Asfari to his operational 
duties; and the suspension of Group Chief 
Operating Officer Marwan Chedid, who 
resigned from the Board. It is important to 
stress that these latter actions do not in any 
way seek to pre-judge the outcome of the 
SFO’s investigation. Further details of the 
investigation and our response are set out 
on page 78.
Enhancing our compliance
Prior to the instigation of this external 
investigation, steps had been taken to 
further enhance the Company’s approach 
to compliance, including a root and branch 
review of all related policies and processes, 
as detailed on pages 64 and 65. In August 
2017 , a new Compliance and Ethics 
Committee was formed. The inaugural 
report of this Committee is set out on pages 
88 and 89. These measures ensure that we 
can continue to be confident in our people 
and processes.
Operational progress in 2017
Operationally, 2017 was a good year.  
The Board kept close oversight of progress 
against the business strategy. We took a 
particularly close interest in the headway 
the management team is making in 
delivering organic growth and further 
differentiating the business. We also 
received regular updates on the 
deployment of new digital technologies, 
and the role they can play in bringing 
continual incremental improvements  
to our service offering.

MAINTAINING A STRONG BOARD FOR THE FUTURE
2017 revealed Petrofac’s 
underlying resilience.  
We continued to execute 
effectively, maintain  
our bidding discipline and 
enhance return on capital. 
For 2017 , our main intention was to deliver 
on the themes I highlighted last year: 
focusing on execution, delivering organic 
growth, and reducing capital intensity. 
By the middle of the year, however, events 
had been overtaken by the instigation of  
an investigation by the UK Serious Fraud 
Office (SFO). The Board took swift action, 
formulating a strategy to run and protect 
the business whilst responding to, and 
engaging constructively, with the SFO in 
relation to the investigation.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Separately, at the Annual General Meeting 
in May 2018, we will be delighted to 
recommend to shareholders the appointment 
of David Davies as a Non-executive Director. 
Reflecting on our financial performance
In the face of the challenging environment, 
we were pleased to deliver a business 
performance net profit of US$343 million. 
Post exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements, we reported a net loss 
of US$29 million. With good performance 
on capital management and net debt  
falling to US$612 million, we demonstrated 
our strong financial discipline and our 
determination to reduce capital intensity. 
We also chose to re-base our dividend in 
May 2017 and this prudent approach was 
broadly welcomed by investors. We are 
therefore proposing a final dividend of 
25.30 pence per share. 
Against this backdrop, I do want to thank 
all Petrofac shareholders for your loyalty. 
During the year, we benefited from a frank 
and constructive dialogue with our key 
shareholders and, as this Annual Report 
should demonstrate, the Board is 
determined to repay your confidence.
Looking forward to 2018 and beyond
For 2018, we expect the market 
environment to remain similar to 2017 .  
We will continue to be competitive and 
maintain our bidding discipline. However, 
we do benefit from good visibility of 
projects to be awarded during the year, 
and will continue to ensure we maintain  
our cost competitiveness through our 
focus on operational excellence.
From an operational perspective, our 
approach will continue to be characterised 
by these three themes: flawless execution, 
reduced capital intensity, and organic 
growth. At the same time, the Board will 
ensure that we continue to engage with 
the SFO.
One of our intentions for 2017 had been  
to review the way in which the Petrofac 
values are understood and applied across 
the Group. This remains on the agenda  
for 2018, to ensure the values – and the 
behaviours associated with them – are 
clearly understood and consistently  
applied every day alongside our focus  
on business performance. 
Of course, the market environment 
remained competitive with clear evidence 
of overcapacity. The Board was encouraged 
that we saw a strong recovery in new 
orders while, for those projects we did bid 
for, we maintained our bidding discipline. 
We secured more than US$5.2 billion in 
new orders and extensions in 2017 from 
both existing and adjacent markets.
Once again, our safety performance was 
most impressive, as further articulated in 
the Group Chief Executive’s statement and 
the Corporate Responsibility section of  
this report. Even so, there is no room for 
complacency and we must continue to 
retain our focus in this area.
Maintaining a strong Board for the future
The Board aspires to lead by example  
and live the Petrofac values: safe, ethical, 
innovative, responsive, quality and cost 
conscious, and driven to deliver.
It was a particularly busy year for the Board, 
and I want to thank all Directors for their 
individual contributions and determination  
to see the Group through this challenging 
period, whilst ensuring Petrofac continues  
to deliver for its stakeholders. 
The Board aims to have first-hand 
knowledge of the business, and our visit  
to Aberdeen in October reminded us of  
the pricing pressures we face whilst 
demonstrating the level of professional 
commitment across the Group. I also took 
the time to visit the Upper Zakum field 
development in the UAE and the Greater 
Stella Area development in the UK, whilst 
the full Board visited two of our Indian 
engineering offices in January 2017 .
There were some changes to the Board 
during the year, with the resignation of  
both Jane Sadowsky and Thomas Thune 
Andersen. Having led the Remuneration 
Committee since 2010, Thomas made a 
particularly strong contribution, for which  
I thank him. 
I am confident that the Group will, going 
forward, continue to benefit from a strong, 
diverse, multi-disciplinary Board, with a 
good ratio of Non-executive to Executive 
Directors. In particular, we look forward  
to working with Sara Akbar, who joined  
the Board in January. Sara’s in-depth 
knowledge of the Middle East’s oil and gas 
sector promises to be a strong asset. 
To ensure that the leadership team can 
deliver on these objectives, the Board has 
concluded that restrictions imposed on the 
Group Chief Executive in May 2017 are no 
longer appropriate. Ayman will resume full 
executive duties with immediate effect and 
re-join the Nominations Committee. He will 
continue to fully respect and support the 
process and independence of both the 
SFO investigation and the sub-committee 
of the Board with delegated responsibility 
for this matter.
Succession planning will remain a top 
priority. During 2017 we were reassured 
that there is a strong pipeline of talent 
coming through at all levels. In 2018  
we expect the business to take a more 
forensic approach to talent management.
After an 1 1-year tenure, I have decided to 
stand down from the Board, and would  
like to thank my fellow Directors for their 
support. I know that, with René Médori 
succeeding me, the Board will remain in 
safe hands. His wide international 
experience and understanding of growing 
multi-national businesses, the global 
landscape, well-established governance 
and regulatory knowledge, provides an 
important level of continuity. As a result of 
René’s change in role, Matthias Bichsel will 
assume the role of Senior Independent 
Director in May 2018.
Finally, I want to thank all our employees  
for their continued commitment during a 
challenging year, and throughout my tenure 
on the Board. In particular, I would like to 
pay tribute to our Group Chief Executive 
Ayman Asfari and the wider leadership 
team. It is encouraging to see how hard  
he and his executive team are working  
to deliver on our collective commitments,  
and position the Group for success over 
the longer term.
