BRENDAN HYNES, CHAIRMAN | 18th September 2017
I am delighted to be able to report another year of 
considerable progress for Swallowfield and one in which we 
have seen real benefits from consistent focus on the elements 
of our ‘Building a Better Swallowfield’ strategy which we first 
put in place in 2014. Sales, profitability, earnings per share  
and shareholder value have again increased significantly, 
through a combination of both organic growth and successful 
acquisition activity.
RESULTS
2017
1 
Revenue translated at 2016 exchange rates
2 
Adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share are calculated before exceptional items and 
amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles. 
3
 Underlying operating profit is calculated by adding back the charge for share-based payments to  
adjusted operating profit. This measure was adopted as the charge for share-based payments is a  
material £1.76m (2016: £0.22m), and is intended to provide a more representative reflection of the  
trading performance of the Group.

CHAIRMAN’S FOREWORD
Our business comprises two complementary streams and it 
is pleasing that both have performed well over the course 
of the year. Our manufacturing business focusses on the 
development, formulation, and supply of personal care and 
beauty products for customers which include many of the 
world’s leading brands. Through continued investment and 
execution of our Drive Category Focus, our offering to those 
customers has become increasingly differentiated, which has 
the dual benefit of a positive impact on margin contribution 
and also improving our competitive advantage, thereby 
making the Group more resilient.
Over the last three years we have developed, both organically 
and through acquisition, a growing portfolio of brands that are 
owned and managed by the Group and which we control from 
formulation through to distribution. The acquisition of The 
Brand Architekts in June 2016 has significantly accelerated 
this owned brand segment of our business and brought critical 
mass to our portfolio. This now represents 24% of Group 
revenues in the period. 
DIVIDEND 
Further evidence of our confidence in the business can be 
seen in the Board’s intention to propose a final dividend of 
3.5 pence. Together with the interim dividend already paid of 
1.7 pence this represents a total dividend for the year of 5.2 
pence, an improvement of 68% over the prior year (2016: 3.1p). 
It remains the directors’ intention to align future dividend 
payments to the underlying earnings and cash flow of the 
business, taking in to account the gearing and the operational 
requirements of the business. 
 
BOARD SUCCESSION
After eight successful years as Group Finance Director,  
Mark Warren has decided to retire from his full-time executive 
career and therefore will be stepping down from the Board. 
Mark has played a significant role in helping the business grow 
and develop over that period and the Board and his colleagues 
in the business are grateful for his contribution and wish him 
continued success in the future.
Advanced notice of Mark’s intentions has allowed the Board to 
engage in a thorough and structured search for his successor 
and we are pleased to announce that Matthew Gazzard will be 
succeeding Mark. Matthew has extensive experience in senior 
financial leadership roles. He served as Group Finance Director 
for four years at Thatchers Cider during a period of substantial 
growth for that business where he delivered the financial 
support required to underpin both the development of the 
Thatchers brand itself and the company’s manufacturing 
facilities. Prior to that he spent nine years as both Group 
Finance Director and ultimately CEO of British Ceramic 
Tiles where he successfully navigated the business through 
challenging times and to a merger with Ceramic Prints Ltd.
Matthew will join Swallowfield on 2 October 2017 and work 
alongside Mark until the end of the calendar year to ensure a 
smooth and thorough handover. Matthew will formally replace 
Mark on the Board with effect from 1 January 2018.
OUTLOOK 
We have delivered another significant improvement in 
business performance in the year helped by the acquisition  
of The Brand Architekts and major new product launches in 
our manufacturing business.
We expect the strong momentum in our branded business 
to continue, supported by a steady stream of new products, 
innovation and continued strong support for our brands across 
our retail customers.
In our manufacturing business, the outlook is solid with a 
steady flow of new product development (NPD) and new 
contract wins that will positively impact the year ahead. 
As indicated previously, this needs to be balanced against 
the normalisation of volumes on particularly large product 
launches that bolstered H2 FY16 and H1 FY17 performance. 
In line with the industry, both business segments have been 
challenged by increasing material and packaging costs 
resulting from the fall in sterling and global inflationary 
pressures.  Our teams have put in place a wide range of 
programmes to mitigate the impact of these increases and 
we believe that these measures and our strong overall trading 
momentum will compensate.
Having successfully integrated The Brand Architekts, we 
continue to be alert to further acquisition opportunities should 
they offer the potential to build incremental shareholder value.
Over the course of the year we have strengthened both 
sides of our business with an improved ability to deliver the 
innovation, quality and service demanded by our customers. 
This combined with the progress made on our owned brands, 
gives us confidence that we are well positioned for the future.
