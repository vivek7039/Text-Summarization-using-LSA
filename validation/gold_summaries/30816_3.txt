Chairman’s statement 
I am pleased to report on a strong set of results for the year ending 31 December 2017 that show the 
excellent progress towards the strategic objectives agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year. 
 
Business performance 
Highlights in the period were: 
 
 Total revenues up by 42% to £6.9m compared to £4.9m in FY 2016 
 Monthly recurring revenues up by 55% compared to FY 2016 
 Total users increased by 45% since 31 December 2016 
 Bullhorn expansion and strengthening relationship offers further opportunities for growth 
 Launch of integration into Microsoft Dynamics CRM, the second largest CRM in the world 
 
In addition to the improvements seen across our key financial growth metrics I am also pleased to 
report that the Group’s focus on client satisfaction and client retention has resulted in steadily improving 
metrics in these areas. Furthermore, the Group’s relationship with its key strategic partner - Bullhorn 
CRM - has continued to strengthen across Bullhorn’s global footprint. This presents a significant 
opportunity for the Group as Bullhorn has recently announced acquisitions which will significantly add 
to their global footprint. 
 
In July 2017 we confirmed that the Company’s lender, Barclays, agreed to provide an improved three-
year revolving credit facility of £1.85m to replace the previous £0.9m two-year term loan, which enabled 
management to invest in the business with more confidence. 
 
Following the half year results in September 2017, institutional investor demand was sufficiently strong 
that the Board were able to recommend a new share placing, raising £5.7m of equity finance (before 
costs) at a price of 143.5 pence per share. 
 
This additional funding, combined with the enhanced Barclays facility has ensured that the investment 
capital is now in place to confidently support further product development and sales and marketing 
expansion, in addition to broadening our CRM partner reach during 2018. 
 
Our strengthened balance sheet when combined with our growing monthly recurring revenue base, 
increasing product capabilities, strong user growth and improved customer retention, gives the Board 
comfort that the business is well-placed to continue delivering its focussed growth strategy through 
2018 and beyond. 
 
This improved position allows for more investment in sales and marketing which, combined with product 
enhancements delivered and planned, will create further opportunities to integrate the CloudCall 
platform with additional CRM platforms, creating a broader route to market and facilitating further 
accelerated growth in users and recurring revenues over time.

Outlook 
Following our most recent equity raise, the Board has conducted a review of the levels of investment 
in our platform and sales channel development to optimise the cash resources available to ensure our 
ambitious growth targets are delivered in 2018 and beyond. 
 
Based on this planning activity the Board is confident that the business is moving into 2018 stronger, 
more resilient and well placed to deliver on its growth strategy. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their drive and commitment throughout 
the year and look forward to 2018 being another year of strong progress against the clear and exciting 
growth strategy that has been set out for the business.
