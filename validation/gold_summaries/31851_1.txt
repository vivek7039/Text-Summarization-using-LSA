 I can report that the business has made 
good operational progress during the 
last reporting period. At the heart of that 
progress is our focused strategy to:
 > build customer loyalty, ensuring 
that all visits to our venues are an 
excellent experience;
 > drive continued profit improvement 
from existing sites; and
 > expand the estate into new 
profitable locations.
Building customer loyalty
Customer loyalty is determined by many 
factors. We do not take anything for 
granted with employees in all areas of our 
business contributing fully to this goal.
 > Our drinks purchasing team is 
continuously seeking new products 
and looking to premiumise, innovate 
and evolve our customer proposition 
through new products, service quality 
and brand support. Cocktails, which 
comprise 23 per cent of our total drink 
sales by value, are a good demonstration 
of the success of this team’s approach. 
Our two brands currently list in the 
region of 100 different cocktails and 
change menus four times per annum to 
ensure that there is always something 
new. Last year we introduced more than 
130 new serves.
 > Our food development team is always 
seeking to innovate with new dishes 
and ways in which to make the service 
delivery faster and more consistent. We 
regularly introduce specials to determine 
whether a new dish could become part 
of the regular menu. In a small number 
of venues, we are currently trialling a 
reduced number of menu options with 
encouraging results, delivering important 
benefits such as reduced wastage, labour 
savings and purchasing economies.
 > Our people development teams are 
continually enhancing training and 
recruitment programmes to ensure 
that we have front line staff capable of 
providing outstanding customer service.
 > Our sales and marketing teams promote 
our proposition particularly well. By 
getting close to and understanding our 
customers, through both social media 
and in our venues, they ensure that 
our customers’ needs are fulfilled. 
Our pre-booked revenue, which has 
grown consistently year on year, is a 
key driver of like-for-like sales. In the 
reporting period, £17.1 million of our 
income was pre-booked. We also monitor 
standards very closely through customer 
feedback scores and a “mystery visitor” 
programme, and results are reviewed 
weekly by the Senior Management T eam.
 > Our operations teams are ultimately 
responsible for the business delivery, 
and have to plan and co-ordinate the 
right resources to ensure the customer 
enjoys an excellent experience.
STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Customer loyalty is determined by many factors. We do not take anything for granted 
with people in all areas of our business contributing fully to this goal.
Driving profit improvement from existing sites requires a focus on both sales and costs, 
which is integral to the way that all our teams are managed.
Six openings are planned for the new financial period: three Revolutions 
and three Revolución de Cubas.
Summary
  >  Positive set of results for the 
financial year ended 1 July 2017.
  >  Existing site portfolio achieving 
positive like-for-like sales** of 
+1.5 per cent.
  >  Six new bars opened in the 
reporting period and are 
trading strongly.

06 Driving profit improvement from 
existing sites
Driving profit improvement from existing 
sites requires a focus on both sales and 
costs, which is integral to the way that all 
our teams are managed. 
 > Premiumisation of our drink and food 
offerings and strong brand identities 
differentiate our business model and 
customer offer. We are conscious that, 
in a challenging marketplace, we do 
not overprice and therefore monitor 
competitor prices very closely to ensure 
we continue to be competitive and take 
advantage of our premium positioning.
 > Driving sales is the most important 
activity of our sales and marketing 
teams, which constantly produce new 
campaigns and work with brand owners 
to build promotions to drive footfall and 
to encourage customers to increase 
spend. For example, cocktail master 
classes are very popular – in the last 
year we achieved £4.7 million of 
incremental sales and have recently 
launched an online retail option for our 
flavoured vodkas. During the year, we 
recruited two corporate sales managers 
to also develop this part of the market. 
Their early results are encouraging and, 
in particular, our Christmas bookings for 
2017 are significantly ahead of last year. 
 > Our finance and IT teams play a critical 
role in providing the systems and 
reporting to facilitate running an efficient 
business. Significant IT developments 
have been undertaken in the year to 
support the sales, operations and people 
development teams. Our finance team 
has had much to contend with in the 
last year and it is now very clear that 
our accounting systems and processes 
were in need of upgrading. Improvements 
have been made, and will continue to 
be made, in this area to provide a more 
robust financial infrastructure and in 
so doing bring additional benefits.
*  Restated – see Note 1(b) of the consolidated financial statements for an explanation and analysis of the prior year adjustments included in respect of the profit for the 53 weeks ended 2 July 2016.
** Like-for-like sales are defined as total retail sales from bars that have been trading continuously for at least 12 months.
*** Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional items and bar opening costs (see reconciliation table on page 18 of the Financial Review).
 > As ever, it is the operations team at the 
“sharp end” of the business which drives 
sales through outstanding operating 
standards and marketing effectively to its 
customers at a local level. Payroll is our 
biggest cost and it has risen significantly 
in recent years as a result of the increases 
to minimum wage and living wage. Our 
efforts to meet these structural challenges 
have not been quick enough, but we are 
introducing new systems that will result in 
improved labour scheduling and better 
control of this significant cost.
Expansion of our estate
Our property team is driving significant 
value through its site selection and 
property development activities. During 
the reporting period, we opened two 
Revolutions in Southend and T orquay and 
four Revolución de Cubas in Harrogate, 
Aberdeen, Reading and Glasgow. 
Revolution in Macclesfield closed at 
the end of May 2017 but reopened in 
September 2017 after the period end. 
Shortly after the period end we opened 
a Revolución de Cuba in Belfast and 
now trade from 69 venues (55 Revolutions 
and 14 Revolución de Cubas).
Sales levels at the new sites have been 
excellent. Our primary objective at opening 
is to ensure that we provide an outstanding 
customer experience and our venues are 
resourced accordingly. Newly trained staff 
are unable to achieve full efficiency initially, 
but this strategy aims to ensure good 
feedback scores and good word of mouth 
marketing and achieve significant repeat 
business. Additionally, there are significant 
marketing costs associated with a launch, 
and therefore new sites do not make a full 
contribution in their first year of trading 
(and, in some cases, can take a full year 
to reach normal operating maturity and 
efficiency). We believe this is the right 
approach for the long-term health and 
viability of these new venues, a belief 
which is being borne out in practice by 
the achievement of very strong returns 
in the second year of trading.
Six openings are planned for the new 
financial period: three Revolutions and 
three Revolución de Cubas. Belfast 
Revolución de Cuba opened in July and 
new Revolutions are planned to open 
before Christmas in Inverness, Solihull and 
Putney. Two further Revolución de Cubas 
are expected to open in the second half.
The property team has built a very strong 
pipeline with three further sites that could 
potentially open in the second half of the 
current financial period, but given that our 
developments are primarily funded from 
internally generated cash resources, they 
are planned for early in the 2018/19 financial 
period. The pipeline being developed 
beyond that is considerable and we would 
expect to be able to open at least six sites 
per annum for several years onwards.
Results
The year-on-year growth in total revenue 
of +9.2 per cent and adjusted EBITDA*** 
of +16.0 per cent reflects good progress 
despite the absorption of significant cost 
headwinds affecting the whole sector. 
Operating profit was £3.7 million (2016 
Restated*: £5.3 million) but this was after 
charging exceptional items of £4.3 million 
(2016 Restated*: £1.4 million).
Employees and management teams
I would like to acknowledge the dedication 
and commitment demonstrated by all 
our employees.
The results of the Group represent a 
collective effort and I would like to thank all 
of our employees for their support during the 
year and for their contribution to our results.
