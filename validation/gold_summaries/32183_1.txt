 I’m pleased to report on the significant strategic and operational 
progress made during the financial year as we continue on our mission 
to be the best electrical retailer in Europe. This is the first time I’m 
reporting as CEO but, fundamentally, our approach has not changed 
and nor do I expect it or want it to: we remain relentless in pursuing 
our goal to be the best electrical retailer in Europe and, through 
focusing on our 4Cs strategy, we are confident we can deliver against 
that objective. 
We have a business model that differentiates us from our competitors, 
“The AO Way”, as set out on pages 36 and 37. While we obsess about 
each element, it isn’t the individual components of this model which 
give us our competitive advantage; it’s the way that we stitch them all 
together through our culture of caring more, making things easier for 
the customer and being exceptional in the moments that matter. That’s 
what makes us different. Our culture is absolutely crucial to us so, 
together with John, I’m looking to protect it, nurture it, and further 
embed it across the Group, particularly in our newer territories.
Looking back at the year, we have strengthened our foundations for 
future growth. In Europe, we opened our new regional distribution 
centre in Bergheim, near Düsseldorf; we have built a state-of-the-art 
recycling facility in the UK, we have added new categories to our 
offering in both the UK and Europe and, in launching computing, 
we have developed systems and infrastructure to operate a different 
distribution model, which we can leverage for future category 
roll-out across territories.
Trading this year has been mixed (particularly for our UK business). 
In the first half of the year, in the UK, our investment in marketing and 
brand translated into encouraging sales growth with some tailwinds 
from stamp duty changes in March 16. In the second half of the year, 
trading in the UK became more challenging as we began to feel the 
impacts of dampening consumer confidence following the UK’s vote 
to leave the EU, subsequent price inflation and a slow‑down in the 
UK housing market.
However, our customer service metrics remain exceptional across all 
of the countries in which we operate because we make it our mission 
to care more and we continue to innovate to create the best customer 
experience for tomorrow. This has helped us to continue to gain 
market share in our categories and countries, notwithstanding the 
challenging trading environment in the UK.
We remain as committed as ever to doing business The AO Way 
and continuing to deliver outstanding results for our customers, 
our people, our supplier partners and our investors. Our online 
market-leading proposition and the solid foundation we have built 
in mainland Europe have positioned us well for the future. Since year 
end we completed a share placing which will ensure our balance sheet 
is suitably capitalised to support our continued growth and increasing 
scale as we deliver our strategy. We will continue to be bold but 
responsible on where we allocate our resource.
In the past year we have demonstrated how to scale up in new 
countries and how to expand and grow product categories. When the 
time is right, we will replicate this approach in new geographies and 
categories. We have strengthened our foundations for growth and in 
line with our strategy we will continue to focus on and drive AO 
own-branded sales. Although our brand awareness has continued to 
grow during the period, it remains our greatest challenge and the key 
to longer-term success; we must push to drive this metric. We will 
achieve this through highlighting and explaining why customers 
should shop with AO: it’s simply that we care more. Going forward we 
will continue to work hard to ensure that AO becomes a household 
name and the obvious choice when shopping for electricals.
Further details on our performance in the year under review are set 
out in the next few pages. Put simply, I am proud to say that it has been 
another great year for AO thanks to our outstanding team of people. 
We will continue to execute our strategy in the year ahead and focus 
on demonstrating to more customers that The AO Way is the best way. 
It is easy, it can be trusted and we simply care more. This is 
our differentiator.
