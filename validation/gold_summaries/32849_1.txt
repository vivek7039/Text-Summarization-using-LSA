On a 100% basis.
A successful and eventful year
2017 has been an exciting year for Polymetal, with significant 
progress made on the Kyzyl construction and the Amursk 
POX expansion. Both projects are on track and will launch 
within a few months. We further advanced our growth 
pipeline with the initial resource-and-reserve estimate on 
Nezhda joint venture reaffirming the economic attractiveness 
of the asset and justifying our development approach; we 
have also secured an option to consolidate our ownership. 
During the year, we invested in Prognoz, the largest 
undeveloped silver asset in Russia and progressed with 
pilot plant testing at Viksha, our first platinum group metals 
(PGM) project.
We have substantially increased our resources this year. 
Reserves at Nezhda
2
 were confirmed as 2.0 Moz of GE at  
4.0 g/t with an exploration upside of 8.9 Moz of additional 
resources at 5.0 g/t. At Prognoz
2
, where we have begun 
drilling, according to historical estimates there is a high-grade 
resource of 292 Moz of silver at 586 g/t with excellent 
exploration potential. An updated reserve estimate at the 
Komar gold deposit reported an increase of 524 Koz of 
gold with the grade stable at 1.8 g/t. We are now planning 
to transport more than 2 million tonnes of ore from Komar 
to our Varvara processing site, doubling the anticipated 
production rate. 
Operationally, we met the production guidance comfortably, 
growing GE production 13% year-on-year to 1.43 Moz. 
Just one year after launch, Svetloye delivered superior  
results while Komar provided strong support to our Varvara 
operations. Other mature mines generally performed in line 
with expectations, with the exception of Mayskoye where 
open-pit production has been delayed until 2018 in order  
to rectify recovery issues. By the end of the year we also 
achieved a record 97.2% recovery at our flagship 
Amursk POX hub.
Full-year gold production of 1,075 Koz, a 21% increase  
year-on-year, allowed Polymetal to join the prestigious  
1 Moz club, the second gold company listed on the  
London Stock Exchange to achieve this impressive milestone. 
Robust financial performance
Despite peak capital spending at Kyzyl and the Amursk POX 
expansion, in addition to our investment in new development 
projects, Polymetal delivered meaningful free cash flow, 
totalling US$143 million in 2017. There were some cost 
pressures during the year due to the significant 15% 
appreciation of the Russian Rouble, driven by the rebound 
in oil prices, which pushed TCC up to US$658/GE oz in 2017 
(2016: US$570/GE oz). However, this was partially offset by 
the best performance in gold prices since 2010, with 13% 
annual growth.
This enabled us to deliver a net profit for the year of  
US$354 million. In line with the new dividend policy, the 
pay-out ratio for regular dividends has been increased to 
50%. In 2017 , dividends of US$138 million (US$ 0.32 per 
share) were paid out and a final dividend of US$129 million 
(US$0.30 per share) is proposed.
Health and safety still a key focus
Although there has been some improvement in our health 
and safety performance, there is no room for complacency 
since, sadly, we have to report the death of two employees  
in 2017 . We continue to view this as unacceptable and remain 
committed to our zero-fatalities target, as our enhanced 
critical risk management system gains traction.
At the same time, we have received wide-spread recognition 
for our sustainability initiatives, both here in our home market 
and internationally. Most recently we were awarded a top 
ranking for environmental responsibility among Russian 
metals and mining companies by the World Wildlife Fund; 
Sustainalytics positioned Polymetal as an outperformer in 
the metals and mining industry, ranking it first among its 
peers and fourth globally among the 44 mining companies  
included in the report; our performance on the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index was assessed as above industry 
average and up 28% over the previous year. We were also 
awarded the highest score for Corporate Governance and 
Anti-Corruption in the FTSE4Good Index.
Anticipating the future
2018 looks set to become another transformational year for 
Polymetal. The launch of the Kyzyl project is scheduled for 
the third quarter and is much anticipated both within the 
Company and by all our stakeholders. This, in turn, should 
allow us to move closer to finalising decisions on two further 
investments by the end of 2018, namely the construction 
plans for Nezhda and the feasibility study for a second POX 
line at Amursk. We expect further production growth in 2018, 
with this predominantly driven by Kyzyl but also from Komar’s 
ramp-up to 2.2 Mtpa and from our existing mines continuing 
to deliver stable performances.
Last, but by no means least, I wish to thank our employees 
for all their commitment and professionalism. It is their 
efforts that have helped to shape the Company over the 
last 20 years and this should be celebrated, along with 
the anniversary itself. I am optimistically looking forward 
to the next decade in our history and to us all playing our 
parts in this new chapter of Polymetal’s story.
Vitaly Nesis
Group CEO
We have made significant progress in 2017

Exceptional investment prospects
Polymetal’s focus on its particular strategic 
and competitive strengths – in selective mining, 
processing refractory ores and trading precious 
metal concentrates – has established a company 
with the enviable position of being both able to 
acquire or explore attractive investment 
opportunities, and also to deliver on them.
High-grade assets
Our choice of high-grade assets and strategic use 
of a hub-based system generates free cash flow 
through the cycle and maximises returns on 
investment, while at the same time reducing 
project development risks.
Investing in greenfield exploration
Reserve quality and low-capital intensity are 
fundamental to our continuing investment in 
greenfield exploration and how we appraise  
M&A opportunities.

PROGRESS UPDATE
Svetloye Albazino/Amursk Komar and Varvara Kapan
In 2017, the Svetloye 
heap leach operation was 
ramped-up to full capacity, 
making a substantial 
contribution to the Group’s 
strong performance. Just one 
year after launch, Svetloye 
delivered superior results  
with GE production of 106 Koz  
compared with 23 Koz in  
2016 and was the lowest 
cost operation, with TCC of 
US$313/GE oz, on the back 
of exceptional operational 
delivery and positive 
grade reconciliations.
In 2017 , Albazino/Amursk 
achieved record gold 
production of 269 Koz,  
up 10% year-on-year,  
while advancing the 
debottlenecking project. 
The production increase  
was primarily driven by higher 
hourly productivity and recovery 
levels, as well as significant 
improvement in head grades. 
At the Amursk POX plant, a 
record recovery of 97 .2% was 
achieved in Q4 2017 , due 
mostly to the automation of the 
material flow control system 
and expansion of the water 
treatment section.
Almost 2 Mt of Komar ore  
was railed to the Varvara hub 
resulting in record GE 
production of 130 Koz, up 
54% year-on-year. In 2018, 
additional Komar ore will 
displace the lower-grade 
material from the Varvara 
deposit, increasing production 
and reducing costs at the 
Varvara processing hub.  
To further streamline logistics 
and reduce haulage costs, a 
new railway spur has been 
commissioned at Komar.
In 2017, full year gold 
production at Kapan  
reached a record 50 Koz of 
GE. The strong operational 
performance at Kapan 
was driven by increased 
processing volumes and 
improved head grades on 
the back of ongoing  
measures to debottleneck 
the underground mine and 
improve recovery levels.  
This will continue in 2018 
along with active exploration 
within the region.

PROGRESS UPDATE
Kyzyl Amursk POX expansion POX-2 project 
Kyzyl is one of the best development-
stage gold projects in the world. With its 
large high-grade reserves, long mine life 
and low-capital intensity, it is set to create 
significant shareholder returns
Construction activities are now focused  
on the installation of smaller technological 
equipment and Kyzyl is on track to 
produce the first concentrate in Q3 2018. 
First ore has already been mined from 
the open-pit ahead of schedule in 
January 2018. 
There is a strong demand for concentrate 
from multiple offtakers with the first 
contract signed in Q1 2018.
Expansion of Amursk POX plant targets 
an increase in POX capacity, enabling 
Polymetal to retain approximately 50% of 
Kyzyl concentrate for in-house treatment, 
as opposed to a third-party offtake.  
This is expected to improve effective  
gold recovery from concentrate,  
as well as bring down processing  
and transportation costs.
The debottlenecking project at the 
Amursk POX is progressing on schedule. 
Polymetal plans to ramp up the 
debottlenecked POX plant in the  
second half of 2018, in time to take first 
feed from the Kyzyl concentrator.
Polymetal is continuing to undertake 
extensive metallurgical testwork 
and evaluate its ability to use high-
temperature (230-240C) POX technology 
to process high-carbon Kyzyl concentrate 
and third-party feedstocks. The project 
will enable Polymetal to materially 
improve the economics of refractory gold 
projects by increasing gold recovery 
from concentrates and bringing down 
processing and transportation costs, 
and will also strengthen Polymetal’s 
commercial position on the concentrate 
market vis-à-vis offtakers. A decision 
on construction of the second POX is 
expected in late 2018, in conjunction with 
the ramp-up of Kyzyl and an investment 
decision on Nezhda project.

venture in Yakutia (Russia) for the 
development of a high-grade refractory 
gold deposit. The initial Ore Reserve 
estimate (JORC) for Nezhda reaffirmed 
its economic viability with open-pit ore 
reserves
2
 estimated at 15.5 Mt of ore  
with an average GE grade of 4.0 g/t for  
2.0 Moz of GE contained. Additional 
mineral resources are estimated at  
55.9 Mt of ore with an average GE grade  
of 5.0 g/t for 8.9 Moz of GE contained. 
Production is currently projected to 
startduring in 2022.
Prognoz is the largest undeveloped 
primary silver deposit in Russia. 
Polymetal acquired 5% in January  
2017 with new terms negotiated to 
consolidate a 45% stake in the property. 
The transaction is expected to close in 
the first half of 2018. Mineral resources

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 16 OUR CAPITAL OUR BUSINESS OUTCOME
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
FOCUS ON HIGH-GRADE ASSETS
Return on investment in the precious metals industry is reliant on 
grades and mining conditions. We achieve better returns and lower 
risks from our project portfolio by setting appropriate thresholds  
on head grades and largely focusing on open-pit mines.
HUB-BASED SYSTEM 
Our centralised hub-based system handles ores from different 
sources, achieving economies of scale by minimising processing 
and logistics costs, as well as capital spending per ounce. 
This facilitates production at otherwise uneconomical  
medium- and small-sized near-plant deposits.
STRONG CAPITAL DISCIPLINE 
We engender a strong focus on capital discipline throughout the 
business; maximising risk-adjusted return on capital is our priority  
in all investment decisions. We do not retain excess cash and 
return free cash flow to shareholders through substantial dividend 
payments while retaining a safe leverage level.
EXEMPLARY GOVERNANCE 
We believe that good corporate governance is key to the ongoing 
success of the business and value creation for our shareholders. 
We are compliant with all regulatory requirements and are 
recognised as sustainability leaders in the countries in which we 
operate, adopting best practice in nurturing relationships with all  
our stakeholders in government, industry and the communities.
INVESTING IN EXPLORATION 
Investment in both greenfield and near-mine exploration provides 
us with a cost-effective increase in our reserve base and, along with 
successful acquisitions, is the key source of our long-term growth.
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
We pride ourselves on our operational excellence and 
delivering on our promises to shareholders. Despite difficult 
trading conditions, we beat our production guidance for the

POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 18 MARKET TRENDS
While 2016 was quite volatile, 2017 saw the global 
economy pick up with many assets, including 
major indices, rise in value and close the year on a 
bullish note, all against the backdrop of heightened 
geopolitical instability and tightening monetary 
policy across the board. The markets witnessed 
three interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve 
during the year and a benchmark increase by the 
Bank of England, for the first time in a decade, 
while the EU Central Bank declared victory over 
deflation, signaling a potential end to their loose 
monetary policy.
Gold
The precious metals sector was no exception, displaying 
positive price momentum in the course of the year.  
For the second year in a row, gold became one of the best 
performing assets following consecutive price declines  
from 2013-2015. The gold price grew by 13.5% – its biggest 
annual gain since 2010 – and outperformed all major asset 
classes other than stocks. This performance was primarily 
supported by a weakened US Dollar, as well as heightened 
investor uncertainty on the back of geopolitical instability and 
a potential pullback on increased P/E ratios and expensive 
stock valuations, which fuelled investor flows into gold in 
order to manage risk exposure. Although gold was traded 
within a narrow range of US$1,200–1,300 for most of the 
year, it closed at US$1,297/oz compared with US$1,146/oz  
in 2016, averaging US$1,257 for the year and recording a 
year-high of US$1,351 in the third quarter. 
However, gold demand remained under pressure in 2017 , 
down 7% to 4,072 tonnes over 2016. The decline was driven 
by substantially lower retail investment demand and lagging 
ETFs, which only added one-third of 2016’s inflows. On the 
other hand, buying from the official sector recorded a 
substantial gain of 36% year-on-year as Russian and Turkish 
central banks continued to bolster gold reserves. Technology 
demand recorded its first year of growth as the use of gold in 
smartphones and vehicles continued to increase, ending a 
six-year downtrend. Physical demand remained relatively flat 
over the previous year, while jewellery demand posted its first 
annual increase since 2013, however remaining weak in a 
historical context. 
Gold and silver mine output, on the other hand, continued 
to slow down due to substantial production losses seen in 
Indonesia and China on the back of environmental concerns 
and a crackdown on illegal mining. This has resulted in 
the plateauing of global output, which many believe to 
be the start of a multi-year downtrend, at least at current 
price levels.
Silver
In 2017 , silver underperformed gold ending the year on par 
with its 2016 average of US$17.0/oz. This was primarily 
driven by lacklustre interest from investors on the back of 
stronger performances from equities and a sharp decline 
in investment demand. ETF holdings also weighed on silver 
price dynamics, posting a decrease over 2016. Meanwhile, 
in 2017 , industrial demand for silver grew by roughly 3% 
on the back of increased demand from the solar and 
automotive sectors. Mine output recorded a modest 
decrease year-on-year due to production declines in Chile 
and Australia, as well as in Guatemala where resource 
nationalism disrupted production at one of the largest 
primary silver mines. 
Platinum group metals
2017 was an interesting year for PGMs, primarily led by 
palladium’s stellar performance. Palladium outperformed 
every other precious metal in 2017 , gaining more than 
50% and reaching a price of more than US$1,000/oz 
something not seen since the start of 2000. Platinum,  
on the other hand, rose only 4% as the market share of 
diesel-powered vehicles – where the metal is primarily  
used – declined in favour of petrol cars. As a result, platinum 
prices remained under pressure, while palladium prices 
benefited from the boost in global petrol car demand. 
Moreover, palladium prices were further bolstered due to  
a substantial supply deficit on the back of mining issues  
in South Africa.

Precious metals market summary 
 Gold     Silver
Mine production around the world
Year-on-year mine production recorded a modest decline 
in 2017 , marking what many believe is the beginning of a 
sustained downtrend in gold mine output, which is set to 
continue during 2018. At the global level, environmental 
concerns and a crackdown on illegal mining were the  
driving forces behind the drop in output in 2017. Of equal 
significance is the broader issue of a reduction in project 
pipelines, as a consequence of lower gold prices and wider 
project development challenges across the sector, and the 
fact that new mine starts in recent years have mainly 
served to fill the gaps left by production losses elsewhere. 
The league table of the biggest gold mining countries in  
2017 remains unchanged: China, Russia and Australia. 
Our operating environment  
In Russia, the mining industry is the second-largest sector 
after oil and gas. However, despite the country’s vast 
resource potential in precious metals, it remains largely 
underexplored with a lack of investment in the sector, due 
mainly to low gold prices and the limited availability of foreign 
debt and equity investments stemming from international 
sanctions introduced in 2014.  
For the Russian economy as a whole, 2017 proved to be a 
year of moderate improvement as the oil price continued the 
positive price momentum it gained in 2016, finishing the year 
at US$60 per barrel. The Russian Rouble also strengthened 
by 15% year-on-year from 67.1 RUB/USD in 2016 to 58.3 
RUB/USD in 2017. Conversely, this had a negative impact 
on the mining sector, resulting in an increased dollar value of 
rouble-denominated operating costs across the board and 
lower Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
Although Kazakhstan and Armenia have a significantly 
smaller share in global gold mine production, these countries 
have a strong growth profile, attributable to a good climate 
for foreign investment in the sector as well as some 
government incentives. The economics of Kazakh gold 
mining was also supported by the moderate devaluation of 
the Kazakh Tenge (5% stronger against the US Dollar year-
on-year), while the Armenian Dram remains the most stable 
currency in the Former Soviet Union.
How we respond to these trends
We continue to utilise our 20 years of experience  
in mine performance optimisation and the pursuit  
of high-grade and high-optionality assets in order  
to ensure resilient economics against the backdrop 
of commodity price and FX volatility. Our strong 
performance in 2017 , with a record 1,433 Koz  
of GE produced and a net profit of US$354 million, 
re-affirms the success of our approach and  
sets us on the right track to deliver on our  
long-term strategy. 
In order to limit our exposure to risk, in the process 
of project approval, our stress tests are carried  
out with a 20% discount to spot prices and a  
10% increase in operating costs, ensuring that  
our operations can be sustained even under  
volatile market conditions. Similarly, we continue  
to review the prices used for our reserve and 
resource statement on a regular basis to reflect 
market fluctuations.
