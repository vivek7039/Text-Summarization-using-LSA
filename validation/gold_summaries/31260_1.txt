Chief Executive’s  
Statement
John Homer | Chief Executive
Overview of the year
It is disappointing that the focus on a healthy underlying Group 
performance from continuing operations appears to continue to 
be diverted by the outcome of the remaining legacy contract.
The overall focus of our strategic plan is built around continuing 
with the six strategic priorities identified with an increased focus 
on our people, our quality first approach and further investment 
in technology.
Cash
Our continued focus on driving a cash culture throughout the 
business has made good progress in the year. The emphasis 
on cash being the responsibility of the operational divisions with 
reports and measures being provided by the finance function is 
starting to have the desired effect. The cash balance at the end 
of the year of £17.01 million is testament to the progress that 
has been made.
Our focus on the type of work to be undertaken will be to 
continue to build on the core strengths and capabilities of the 
Group. It is intended to continue to play to our strengths in the 
Water sector while looking for growth in other areas to reduce 
our reliance on this market and mitigate the cyclical effects of 
the AMP procurement cycle. 
Utilities losses
At the interim update we announced that the division achieved 
a break even position for the first six months trading. Since 
that date we have experienced serious difficulties on the work 
stream undertaken for Virgin Media on the term contract for 
telecoms work. Our activities have become embroiled in the 
difficulties that this customer has been experiencing and this 
has led to fragmented and inefficient working patterns. The 
division is heavily engaged in dialogue with this customer to 
achieve a satisfactory resolution to this problem. 
Operations
It is pleasing to be able to report good progress is being seen 
on improving the operational performance of the remainder of 
the Group. Our short term target of achieving 3% net return 
on sales is firmly within our sights. Our vision of 5% margins in 
the future is achievable by continuing to enhance our offering 
upstream into design, project investment and by delivering 
more efficiently. The employment of our direct labour force and 
operation of our own plant fleet will assist our drive for margin 
growth. The use of off site build techniques will combat skill 
shortages and ensure that quality of workmanship is achieved.
Order book
The markets in which we operate remain buoyant and the need 
for investment into the infrastructure of the nation continues 
to grow. We continue to exercise critical judgement over the 
orders we take into the business and ensure that effective 
governance is in place at all stages of securing work. Our order 
book for construction in 2018 stands at £299 million (2016: 
£225 million).
Safety
It is pleasing to see that our Health and Safety performance 
has improved significantly during this year. From a 2016 AFR 
of 0.11 which represented five RIDDORs we are currently 
running at 0.04 which represents two RIDDORs for 2017. Our 
efforts in compliance with procedures and focus on behaviours 
have helped in this achievement. It is however clearly apparent

that a focus on this at all times is a must and a slight slip in 
concentration can lead to a hazard causing an accident.
People and culture
People remain the key to our success and we intend to build 
on our achievements in this area. Our offering of leadership 
and management programmes has been refreshed and is 
now accredited under the new Apprenticeship Levy. Two 
programmes have commenced and feedback is positive. Our 
assessment of potentials for growth and succession planning 
continues to serve us well and this approach is improving with 
maturity of its use in the business. 
We have started re-evaluation of our entire Employee 
Experience agenda and workshops have been held at the 
Leadership Briefing sessions so that everyone has the chance 
to contribute to the future culture of the Group. This has been 
well received. It is an undisputed fact that our people and 
our culture are the single largest competitive advantage that 
we have.
We have committed wholeheartedly to the Apprenticeship 
programme through our own in-house academy. We currently 
have 7% of our workforce engaged on this programme.
Technology
During this year we have continued to invest in our digital future 
and progressing our BIM agenda. A decision was taken in the 
middle of the year to defer the application for British Standard 
certification until this was embedded in the business. The 
certification will be applied for in early 2018. A commitment to 
Viewpoint 4 Projects as our Common Data Environment (CDE) 
has been made and we are rolling this out across the business. 
A lot more work needs to be done on this to realise the full 
efficiency potential that exists.
Supply chain
Investment continues to be made into the creation and 
development of the supply chain required to support our 
growth. Supplier relationships are reviewed regularly on a 360 
degree basis. A number of interactive workshop sessions have 
been held throughout the year. It is pleasing to see our creditor 
days recorded at 43 which is an incremental improvement on 
52 in 2016 and 60 in 2015. It is intended that we continue to 
seek to improve our performance in this area. 
Skills shortage
We continue to focus on both our positive employee brand 
and alternative methods in order to combat the skills shortage. 
It is clear that our ability to attract and retain the right quality 
and quantity of people to undertake work is a driver for us. 
Our efforts on the training and development front are showing 
good results. We are particularly pleased with our approach to 
the new government Apprenticeship Levy and intend to build 
further on this success
Conclusion
The business is well positioned for growth going forward. 
A solid order book for construction in 2018 of £299 million 
coupled with a strong cash balance of £17.01 million recorded 
at the year end provides a solid baseline to drive performance 
going forward.
Our continued focus on ensuring rigorous governance in 
contract selectivity and operational control, coupled with the 
advancement of our Employee Experience programme will 
ensure that momentum is achieved on achieving our goals.
