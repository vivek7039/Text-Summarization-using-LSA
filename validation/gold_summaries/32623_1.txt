CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STRATEGIC REVIEW 
WE ARE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT, IN A 
CHALLENGING YEAR FOR THE GROUP, WE HAVE 
CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS WITH 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGY.
We are pleased to report that, in a challenging year for the Group due 
to the significant business interruption suffered as a result of the flood 
at Standfast & Barracks in December 2015, we have continued to make 
good progress with the implementation of our strategy, which comprises:
• international expansion; 
• market penetration;
• lifestyle product extension; 
• British manufacturing capability; and 
• acquisitions.

THE BRANDS 
This segment incorporates global trading from our internationally 
recognised brands and includes our overseas subsidiaries in the US and 
France. In addition to Sanderson, Morris & Co, Harlequin, Zoffany, Scion 
and Anthology, the Brands now include Clarke & Clarke and Studio G, 
which were acquired by the Company in October 2016. 
Fiona Holmes joined the Company in October 2016 as Managing 
Director of Brands, a role in which she has responsibility for all of the 
brands apart from Clarke & Clarke and Studio G, which operate on a 
standalone basis. Fiona is playing a key role in further developing and 
delivering our strategic ambitions.
Total Brands sales increased during the year despite the impact of the 
flood at Standfast & Barracks. Total Brands sales increased by 12.8% 
compared with last year to £76.6 million. This included an 18-week 
contribution from Clarke & Clarke of £7.3 million. Underlying Brands 
profit from operations increased by 14.3% to £9.2 million.
Excluding Clarke & Clarke, total Brands sales were up 2.2% during the 
year at £69.3 million. In the UK, Brands sales decreased 4.0% to £38.4 
million, reflecting the flood along with challenging UK trading conditions. 
Sales in the US grew by 8.3% in reportable currency, down 5.2% in 
constant currency, to £9.2 million and were impacted by the flood. 
The US is our second largest market and is strategically important, 
meriting our recent investment in more directly employed sales 
representatives and an intended investment in our second directly 
controlled showroom, in Chicago, to add to our recent investment in  
our flagship showroom in New York. 
Brand sales in Western Europe were up 22.4% in reportable currency, 
up 7.9% in constant currency, to £8.5 million with most regions 
performing strongly, particularly the Republic of Ireland, up 7.9% in 
constant currency to £1.9 million. Other highlights include sales in 
Scandinavia, up 15.8% in constant currency to £2.5 million, and growth 
in Eastern Europe, up 3.6% in constant currency to £2.3 million. 
Global licensing income is a key part of our strategy and an important 
developing income stream for the Group. It extends our lifestyle 
offering and gives our brands greater consumer awareness both in the 
UK and internationally. Income was up 25.6% in reportable currency, 
13.1 % in constant currency, to £2.6 million. Substantial growth has 
been achieved by our bedlinen and blinds partners in particular, with 
range extensions into new product areas and new licensing agreements 
in the US and China. 
HARLEQUIN INCORPORATING SCION AND ANTHOLOGY
Harlequin remains the UK’s leading mid-market contemporary brand. 
Its worldwide sales reduced 1.3% to £31.3 million in reportable currency 
compared with the same period last year. Sales in the UK decreased by  Walker Greenbank PLC

7.2% and were particularly impacted by the flood at Standfast & 
Barracks. In the US, sales were up 5.3% in reportable currency, down 
8.2% in constant currency, and sales in Western Europe have grown 
30.6% year on year in reportable currency, 14.9% in constant currency. 
The Scion brand has recently celebrated its fifth anniversary and 
continues to grow well with its fifth collection, Lokho, and its first 
children’s collection, Guess Who, both having been well received. 
This cutting edge, accessibly priced brand continues to be a success 
with young, aspirational and fashion-aware customers. Scion has also 
quickly become established as a valuable brand for licensing partners 
where the contemporary and graphic nature of the designs translates 
particularly well.
The Anthology brand, launched in April 2014, also continues to show 
strong growth. The range now includes five innovative collections of 
wallcoverings complemented by a growing range of fabrics, which are 
design-led and aspirational while remaining inherently suitable for 
contract applications.
ARTHUR SANDERSON & SONS INCORPORATING THE 
MORRIS & CO. BRAND
Sales were up 4.7% at £22.5 million in reportable currency compared 
with the same period last year. The flood at Standfast & Barracks 
continued to impact UK sales, which saw a decline of 1.2% compared 
with the same period last year. However, sales in the US saw significant 
growth, up 18.9% in reportable currency, 4.1 % in constant currency, 
and sales in Western Europe were up 16.8% in reportable currency, up 
3.1 % in constant currency. Sanderson’s Woodland Walk collection has 
been the brand’s best-selling collection for several years now and has 
been universally appreciated as quintessential Sanderson. 
The Morris & Co. brand enjoyed a very positive sales performance last 
year driven by the launch of the Pure Morris collection. This collection 
interprets William Morris’ iconic designs in a new neutral colour palette. 
This has broadened the brand’s appeal, making it more accessible to a 
wider audience, working equally well in both traditional and 
contemporary settings.
ZOFFANY
Zoffany is positioned at the upper end of the premium market. 
Total sales grew by 3.5% compared with the same period last year  
to £12.2 million in reportable currency. This growth has been driven  
by sales of recent collections which reflect the focus on design strategy 
and direction to position the brand for sustained growth. Sales in the 
US were up 11.9% in reportable currency, down 1.9% in constant 
currency, and sales in Western Europe were up 12.8% in reportable 
currency, down 0.4% in constant currency. 
CLARKE & CLARKE 
Clarke & Clarke’s two brands, Clarke & Clarke and Studio G, are at the 
more affordable end of the market, complementing the Group’s 
existing Brands. Studio G launched its first collection in spring 2016, 
comprising of four books in a variety of modern styles of which the 
highlight was Lustro, a book of three glamorous velvet designs, which 
are practical, competitively priced and widely appealing. Total sales for 
the first 18 weeks of ownership grew by 6.8% compared with the same 
period last year to £7.3 million in reportable currency, with performance 
in line with the Board’s expectations. 
MANUFACTURING
Our Manufacturing capabilities are one of the Group’s key assets and 
differentiates us from our peer group. They are an integral part of our 
growth strategy. The flood at Standfast & Barracks had a significant 
impact on our Manufacturing activities, with the result that total 
Manufacturing sales fell 6.7% to £32.0 million, leading to a decrease  
in profits of 58.7% to £1.0 million. 
This shortfall has been mitigated by interim insurance payments. 
The factory has recovered from the flood and is back in full production 
and the Company’s Milton Keynes warehouse was fully stocked with 
the Company’s printed textiles by the financial year end. The 
construction of flood defences to protect the Standfast & Barracks 
factory has also been completed.
ANSTEY WALLPAPER COMPANY
Sales at Anstey, our wallpaper printing business, fell 9.1 % to 
£16.9 million. Third party sales in the UK were down 23.3% and third 
party export sales were down 6.2%. Internal sales to our own Group 
Brands grew by 9.7%, reflecting a higher level of new product launches 
compared with the prior year. Sales were impacted by the consequences 
of the Standfast & Barracks flood but, as the weakness of sterling feeds 
through, we see a great opportunity to grow sales overseas.
STANDFAST & BARRACKS
Standfast, our fabric printing factory, saw a decrease in sales of 3.7% 
to £15.1 million as a direct result of the flood in December 2015. 
Third party sales in the UK fell by 28.9% while sales to our own Group 
Brands increased by 17.7%.
As a result of the flood, Standfast has experienced a period of significantly 
disrupted production and loss of stock, machinery and profits. To date we 
have received £16.9 million in insurance receipts, covering costs plus 
business interruption losses and interim cash flow requirements, with 
further business interruption reimbursements expected. 
During the period, two of the digital printing machines were replaced 
with next-generation digital printers with higher throughput and 
additional capabilities.
SUMMARY
Despite the significant challenges faced as a result of the flood in 2015, 
I am pleased that we have been able to continue to invest in our Brands 
both in the UK and internationally. 
We have also made significant progress in growing our licensing 
income, boosting our lifestyle product extension and greater consumer 
awareness. We have successfully completed our first significant 
acquisition since 2003 with the purchase of Clarke & Clarke, which will 
accelerate the Group’s market penetration and extend our reach in the 
US. Furthermore, we have made some key senior appointments which, 
combined with our ongoing investment in our key UK manufacturing, 
will help to drive growth in 2017 and help to further develop and deliver 
our strategic objectives.
