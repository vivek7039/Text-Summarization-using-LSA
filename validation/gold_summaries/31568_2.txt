“We are fast approaching the second anniversary of Blue 
Prism’s admission to AIM and these results show just how far 
we have come in a short period of time. The significant sales 
momentum we have seen this year and the 609 software deals 
we have signed - more than 3 times the number signed in the 
prior year - underscores our confidence in our product and the 
market’s readiness to engage in the potential of RPA.
As we move in to the new financial year, we will continue to 
focus on the many ways in which this commercial momentum  
is being driven. Our opportunity for geographic expansion 
continues to broaden; our sales partners are highly engaged 
and effective, continuing to deliver long term, valuable 
customers; and we are investing in educating developers, 
partners and customers on the power of RPA and the required 
skills to take advantage of it. Our rapidly growing Technology 
Alliance Program, which increasingly positions Blue Prism as the 
‘Operating System’ for digital workforce deployments, presents 
us with further opportunities to develop new revenue streams.
The Group has had a strong start to the first quarter of FY2018  
and as such now expect revenues for the full financial year to be 
comfortably ahead of existing market expectations. Funded by 
the anticipated net proceeds of the Placing we have announced 
today, the additional investment planned for FY2018 to support 
our global growth is expected to increase our revenue growth in 
the next financial year. The 2018 financial year shows every sign 
of being yet another exciting year of growth for Blue Prism. ”
