Results
The financial year to 30 April 2017 was our 
third full year as a public company for Rosslyn 
Data Technologies plc after the listing on AIM in 
April 2014. The platform we have built over the 
last three years has received significant accolades 
this year, culminating in receiving a Microsoft 
Data Platform of the Year finalist accreditation 
in October 2016, confirming our belief that the 
progress we have made in developing a 
cloud-based solution is significant.
This year, growing both our partnerships and our 
direct sales client base has been both challenging 
and rewarding. We deployed a significant element 
of the IPO funds into our partnership, sales and 
marketing strategies, whilst ensuring we did 
not miss any developments that would enable 
the business to transform to profitability and 
organic cash generation. As previously reported, 
the progress this year was not as rapid as we 
would have liked; Brexit, the US presidential 
election and difficult trading times for some of 
our Partners and clients has led to a 
slowdown in the delivery of some larger 
contracts. Group revenue £3.6m (2016: £3.9m). 
Despite this we have been able to manage 
our cost base and we are now able to see 
a timeline when cash flow break-even and 
profitability occur; although we are not yet 
complete, we believe there is a strong chance 
of this occurring this new financial year. 
We ended the year with net cash balances 
of £0.3m (2016: £1.9m). Following the share 
placement on 15 May 2017, the Board believes 
that we have adequate cash resources to 
take the Group through to break-even and 
cash generation.
Strategy
The Group’s strategy has developed from last 
year with the appointment of Roger Bullen as 
CEO; our aim now is to establish the platform 
as a significant player in cloud-based analytics, 
delivering far more than the “Spend” environment 
we have focused on for the last three years. 
We are committed to growing revenues and 
profitability through a dual-track strategy of 
acquisition and organic growth. The acquisition 
of Integritie, now a 100% owned subsidiary 
in May 2017, demonstrates our determination 
to add new products and revenue streams to 
our platform and introduce new customers 
to the cloud.
Whilst we look at acquisition opportunities, 
to increase our scale and offering, we will also 
focus on developing the current relationships 
with our partners. We have been able to add 
more partners to our portfolio and have 
significantly expanded our relationship 
with Dun & Bradstreet, the world’s largest 
data provider. We have confidence that these 
partnerships and relationships will continue to 
grow and flourish. We are particularly excited by 
the new opportunities we are discovering with 
our partners in North America and we are 
hopeful that we can continue to expand our 
footprint in this region in the months ahead.
Our direct sales operation has delivered some 
notable wins this year, in all the regions in which 
we operate – the UK, Continental Europe and 
the US – and have managed to grow our average 
annual contract value considerably, up by more 
than 50% (£50k – £77k) since IPO. We are 
particularly excited by the new opportunities 
we are unearthing in the “highly sensitive” data 
market around the world. We will continue to 
market to this sector in the months ahead.
Our staff
Our business would be nothing without our 
innovative and hard-working staff. From the 
development team to the client support staff, 
it is an end-to-end effort. Each role is critical 
to our continued success. On behalf of the 
Board I would like to thank all of them for their 
outstanding efforts in the last year and look 
forward to working with them and the new 
enlarged team in the current year.
Outlook
The 2017–18 financial year is going to be a 
year of change within the firm. The Integritie 
acquisition has doubled the size of our business 
and will deliver a number of new opportunities 
for us. Our partnership strategy continues to 
develop and is coming to fruition in the US; 
these partnerships have the potential to deliver 
the majority of our revenue over the coming 
years. This, alongside the strengthening traction 
within our direct sales, makes this an exciting 
year for us.
Recent announcements demonstrate 
the high regard major players within the 
data and analytics industry hold Rosslyn, the 
RAPid platform and the Knowledge Capture 
environment. Converting these relationships 
into scalable revenue streams is key for our 
growth and our future. I am optimistic that 
recent product launches and the innovation 
we continue to deliver will drive the results the 
Company and our shareholders deserve.
