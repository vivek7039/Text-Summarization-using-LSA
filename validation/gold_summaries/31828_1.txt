 Overall how would you describe the  
performance of the Company last year?
I think we had a very satisfactory financial year 2017 
and I am pleased with the outcome.
Revenue growth was really strong at 24%. I’m always 
most interested in our gross profit growth and that was 
equally pleasing for me, being up 13% despite last year 
containing a one-off benefit that we knew would not 
repeat. So, excluding that, in underlying terms growth in 
gross profit was 16%. Our growth would indicate that once 
again we have taken further market share in our sector.
The gross profit growth resulted in 10% adjusted EBIT 
growth (16% underlying, i.e. excluding the 2016 one-off 
procurement-related profit benefit), while we continue 
to invest in new capabilities. That, combined with another 
year of strong cash generation, resulted in the special 
dividend we’ve proposed alongside these results.
But time doesn’t stand still and we are now focused 
on the opportunity to do it all again in 2018. 
Did any technology area or business line 
particularly stand out for you in 2017?
All our major business lines showed good growth in the 
year. Our security and services businesses were perhaps 
the two standout performers, delivering very strong growth.
Our security business has been one of our key strengths 
for many years now. We saw strong underlying growth in 
this area, which was further assisted by purchases related 
to organisations preparing themselves for General Data 
Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) compliance, which will be 
enforced from 25 May 2018. This is a significant challenge 
for the majority of our customers and there is a lot more 
work required in this area, which is therefore a good 
opportunity for us moving forward. General security risks 
continue to grow in complexity and frequency and are 
now a major boardroom priority, highlighted by high profile 
events like the WannaCry attacks. Softcat was particularly 
proactive in advising and assisting customers on these 
types of threats.
We have invested significantly in our own services 
capability and we continue to work with a number of third 
party organisations to complement our internal offering. 
Particularly in areas such as hybrid cloud migration and 
mobility, in many cases customers are looking to Softcat 
to provide a complete solution rather than trying to stitch 
various technology components together themselves. 
We completed a large number of projects in these areas 
using tried and tested expertise and templates.
OUR COMPANY WORD OF THE YEAR

is strong.
Q&A
with Martin Hellawell
Chief Executive
Strategic report
7 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s statement continued 
Y ou have six branches now; how did they each perform?
Yes, that’s right; we have branches in Marlow, London, 
Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol but have also 
recently announced that we intend to open a seventh location 
on the South Coast in the first half of this new financial year. 
All existing branches met expectations and achieved 
positive growth. For me the standout performers were 
Manchester and London. We very much enjoyed our first 
full financial year in Scotland and are delighted with the 
number of new Scottish customers who are trading with 
Softcat since we became established there.
What about the markets you serve?
The SMB and mid-market remains our largest segment 
and, despite our market leadership position, continues 
to grow very nicely from a very large base. Our public 
sector business saw very strong growth again this year 
and the enterprise segment also outpaced overall Company 
growth and it’s pleasing to see us tapping into that opportunity. 
The vast majority of our business is in the UK but we assist 
an increasing number of our customers with their 
requirements outside the UK.
How have you performed against  
your business model this year?
In essence, our business model begins by recruiting large 
numbers of new employees into the organisation to help 
support and further augment our growth. Most sales 
people join straight from university or at early stages of 
their career. This has been supplemented by a successful 
apprenticeship scheme which has been recognised with 
a number of awards this year. We take more experienced 
people into the organisation for other positions, notably 
in services. Finding the right people to join the Company 
is never easy and perhaps our biggest challenge as a 
business, but we had another excellent year of recruiting 
excellent new talent into the organisation.
Once in the organisation, we strive to be a great place to 
work and to fully motivate our employees. While we are 
well known for this and have received many accolades 
over the years, we are far from complacent and as the 
business gets bigger the employee engagement challenge 
doesn’t become any easier. Last year in our annual employee 
engagement survey we recorded our highest ever employee 
net promoter scores and our score for personal morale was 
exceptionally high, and opportunities for training and 
development is our most improved area over the last 
five years.
If we employ the right people and they are fully engaged 
with the business, we believe our employees will provide 
exceptional customer service. We believe this is the key 
to our success and providing exceptional service is at the 
very heart of our model. Again, we aren’t perfect and know 
that while once again our customer satisfaction survey 
produced outstanding results and our customers continued 
to increase the amount of business they do with Softcat, 
we can still get better and we are very much “on it”, which 
was our Company phrase of the year in 2017 and is the 
theme of this Annual Report.
Which accolades and milestones  
of note have you received this year?
I was delighted Softcat was named as the overall largest 
Microsoft licensing partner in the UK and we also received 
awards from a number of other vendors. These include 
Partner of the Year awards from HPE, Mimecast, Veeam 
and others. 
What is your latest view on  
cloud and how it is affecting you?
It is a very consistent view with what we have been saying 
for the last five years and there are several levels to this. 
We see an increasing proportion of our software licensing 
business transition to a cloud-based platform. For example 
we may previously have sold Microsoft licensing agreements 
for Office which were installed by customers on their sites. 
Today, many customers are choosing to consume Office 
from the cloud with Office 365.

In terms of customers running their own legacy applications 
many have come to the conclusion that they should continue 
running on their own infrastructure, while a preference is 
often given to consuming new applications from the cloud. 
This results in the majority of our customers favouring 
some form of hybrid IT, using some combination of their 
own infrastructure and the cloud.
Some customers may effectively outsource the management 
and possibly ownership of that infrastructure to a third party. 
This is often known as the private cloud and a small part 
of Softcat’s business is running private cloud environments 
for our customers. 
For reasons of control, security, cost and the difficulty of 
porting legacy applications to the cloud, customers’ own 
infrastructure and private cloud infrastructure still has its 
place. Indeed we have seen several instances of customers 
moving back from the public cloud to the private cloud 
environment. Overall, however, we see a continuing trend 
from customers to transition towards the public cloud for 
an increasing number of workloads. Softcat has subsequently 
grown a strong Microsoft Azure business over recent 
years and is working with a number of customers on the 
Amazon AWS platform.
Consequently Softcat sees a growing opportunity to 
develop our services and support business by helping 
customers migrate to a hybrid and public cloud 
environment. We can then work with customers to support 
and manage those environments. This is effectively an 
opportunity to augment our already very large subscription 
licensing business, a part of the business we’ve been well 
known for throughout our history and received many 
plaudits for.
The move to the cloud reduces the hardware opportunity 
as customers need fewer servers and storage as a result. 
But this impact shouldn’t be overly exaggerated as these 
transitions always take longer than anyone predicts and 
the requirement for computer and storage capacity continue 
to increase exponentially as data volumes further expand, 
and with new waves of technology such as artificial 
intelligence this will further accelerate.
As a Company which has evolved from the software world, 
we still have a relatively low market share in the datacentre 
infrastructure business. By helping customers intelligently 
migrate to the hybrid cloud world and by taking share from 
our competition, we believe that we can continue to grow 
our business in this segment despite the changing market. 
That’s exactly what we did very successfully in the last 
financial year. 
In terms of what you do,  
what do you want to be famous for?
We define our business into three broad categories – 
workplace technology, which is all the standard technology 
on or around a customer’s desk; networking and security; 
and cloud and datacentre. All areas are affording us plenty 
of opportunity and we continue to expand our offering in 
each. In the workspace area our managed print offering 
has gained significant traction. Last year we expanded 
our range of extended support services particularly in 
the networking area and this has added considerable 
incremental business and profitability for the Company.
In particular, we want to be the best in cloud and traditional 
subscription software. We want to be the go-to security 
company in the market and the partner of choice for cloud 
and datacentre. There’s plenty to do but we’re well on 
our way.
WE’RE ON IT
Strong performance from our 
new offerings such as 
managed print and contractual 
support services.
Strategic report

And your transition to Chairman? How is that going 
and when will the new Chief Executive be announced?
I haven’t started transitioning to the role of Chairman and I 
am still fully focused and totally committed to being Chief 
Executive of Softcat until a new Chief Executive is on board 
and in place. That will take the time it takes and we are not 
working to any set deadline. That said, the search for the 
new Chief Executive is progressing. I am delighted with the 
way the organisation has responded to the proposed change, 
fully embracing the continuity provided by my transition to 
the Chairman role and the opportunity to kick on under 
new leadership. 
I very much look forward to passing the baton of leading 
Softcat to my successor and to my continued involvement 
as Chairman.
How do you see the opportunity ahead?
While we have performed well for many years now and have 
enjoyed 48 quarters of top-line and bottom-line growth, 
the opportunity ahead of us feels larger than ever. If you 
just take the list of the top 100 VARs in the UK and put our 
turnover against the aggregated total, that gives us c.6.5% 
market share. And there’s a lot more than 100 VARs out 
there. So that gives us at least 93.5% of the market still to 
go for. Our sales force strength and the breadth and depth 
of our capability have never been better and there’s great 
momentum in the Company. Despite questions around the 
economy, our exit from the EU and public sector policy, the 
market for what we do feels quite buoyant. We’re lucky to 
have a very broad portfolio and our customer-centricity 
and flexibility allow us to move quickly to the areas in the 
market where there is most demand, which makes us far 
less vulnerable to more challenging technology segments.
The opportunity is there for the taking but we are well 
aware that only constant hard work, hunger and excellent 
execution will allow us to take it.
We can extend that opportunity by considering further 
geographical expansion both locally and internationally 
and by considering acquisitions. We will continue, as we 
always have done, to consider both extremely carefully 
and cautiously.
I would like to thank our employees for taking the opportunity 
last year and for all their tremendous support, commitment, 
hard work and camaraderie during 2017 and over my last 
eleven years with Softcat. I would also like to thank our very 
valued customers, who continue to be a pleasure to work 
with and who keep pushing us on to ever greater things. 
And finally I would like to thank our business partners, who 
continue to give Softcat a tremendous amount of support 
for which we are extremely grateful.
And to close, Martin, how has  
financial year 2018 started for you?
Our financial year starts on 1 August and as I write this we 
are approximately ten weeks into the new year. It’s very 
early days and there is still all to play for but we are where 
we would like to be at this stage.
