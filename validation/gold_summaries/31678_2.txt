were strong and in line with our 
expectations, driven by student

margin, reflecting the strong 
locations of our student 
accommodation developments 
and a full-year contribution from 
Fresh Student Living, which was 
acquired in FY16

share to give a total dividend of 
6.6 pence, up 10.0% in line with 
our progressive dividend policy

IPO, equivalent to 6.0 pence on 
a full-year basis)

performance, with a net cash 
inflow from operating activities of 
£19.2 million (FY16: £15.1 million

received in October 2017 , relating 
to forward sales agreed before 
the year end

at 30 September 2017
