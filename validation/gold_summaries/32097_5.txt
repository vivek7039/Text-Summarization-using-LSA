SIGNIFICANT RETURNS TO

THROUGHOUT ECONOMIC CYCLES 
AND THEREFORE OVER THE 
LONG TERM
Increased VOH leads to 
increased operating 
proﬁt and underlying 
cash ﬂows
Cash ﬂows and debt 
facilities allow us to 
further invest in ﬂeet 
whilst continuing to 
provide returns to 
shareholders in excess of 
our cost of capital
During periods of growth 
ﬂeet size and VOH 
increases
During periods of 
contraction we 
maintain utilisation by 
selling vehicles
This leads us to 
generate cash
This allows us to pay 
down debt whilst 
continuing to provide 
returns to shareholders 
in excess of our cost 
of capital

SUPPLIERS
We partner directly with LCV manufacturers and the 
vehicles that they supply are a key resource for our 
business. We have close working relationships with each 
manufacturer and engage with them regularly – 
both in annual pricing negotiations and throughout the 
calendar year.
EMPLOYEES
Our employees are key to the success of the business and 
therefore our relationships with our employees are vital.  
Maintaining high levels of customer service and managing 
our operations is the key long term value driver in 
our business.
COMMUNITIES & 
THE ENVIRONMENT
We always strive to be a good neighbour and give back to the 
communities that we operate. From employees sleeping outdoors to 
sponsoring vaccine programmes we actively encourage employees to 
engage with the communities that accommodate us.
We take our wider responsibility to the environment seriously and are 
constantly searching for ways to ensure our business is sustainable.
SHAREHOLDERS 
AND LENDERS
We regularly engage with 
the shareholder and lender 
community throughout the 
year but particularly around 
full year and half year results 
announcements.
Shareholders and lenders 
provide the capital we need 
in order to run our business.
CUSTOMERS
 We pride ourselves on 
delivering market leading 
levels of customers service. 
Our latest NPS scores were 
41% across the Group. 
We aim to grow this to 50% 
in the medium term.

CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S 
REVIEW
I have undertaken an initial 
strategic review of the Group and 
it is clear that there is scope for 
significant growth within both our 
current and adjacent markets.
Group
Since joining Northgate in January 2017 I 
have been impressed by the professionalism 
and hardworking attitude of all our team 
members. Northgate’s business model and 
market position is robust and we are well 
positioned to take advantage of significant 
growth opportunities that exist. 
I have undertaken an initial strategic review 
of the Group and it is clear that there is 
scope for significant growth within both our 
current and adjacent markets. 
Today, we operate in territories with eight 
million LCVs that are supplied to customers 
via three fulfilment models: ‘ownership’ 
where the vehicle is purchased; ‘contract 
hire’ where the vehicle is hired for a 
committed term, typically of several years 
and ‘rental’ where the vehicle is hired and 
can be returned at will.

Based on research conducted by OC&C using data  
from MSI, BVRLA, DFT, SIMI. Used vehicle 
transactions reflect primary transactions only. 
Market defined as LCV only.
The LCV purchase, contract hire and rental 
markets together generate annual revenues 
of c.£16bn across our three territories. 
Today, we participate in c.£11bn of this 
spanning rental, contract hire and second 
hand LCV trading. 
Growth in the contract hire and rental 
markets has been particularly strong driven 
and is driven by three factors: 
 | First, by a cultural shift away from asset 
ownership, as customers feel less need to 
own vehicles outright; 
 | Second, through the attraction of a 
low initial deposit followed by certainty 
in ongoing cash flows afforded by 
contract hire and rental models versus 
a high initial cash outlay coupled with 
uncertainty around the residual value 
associated with outright purchase; and 
 | Third, by the attraction of lower ‘whole 
life costs’ as third party provision of 
vehicles and the management of them 
results in lower overall costs for the 
customer than direct ownership. 
We believe that these factors are driving 
a structural trend in the market that will 
underpin strong growth for the contract hire 
and rental sectors in the coming years.
Blending this market analysis with a review 
of our relative competitive advantage in 
each segment has identified four attractive 
growth opportunities in areas where we 
have the ability to win.
