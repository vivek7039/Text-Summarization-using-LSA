SUPPORTING THE 
GROUP’S STRATEGY
My objective as Chairman is to help ensure the Board creates 
maximum value for shareholders over the long term. We do 
our best to balance opportunity against risk and to lead the 
organisation in an ethical way.
This Corporate Governance Report is intended to give an 
insight into how the Board operated in 2014 to achieve these 
aims. Full details of the Company’s governance arrangements in 
compliance with the Principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code are included on pages 94 to 97. 
As you will have read in the Chief Executive’s Report on pages  
4 to 6, 2014 has been a year in which the business has achieved 
strong returns and is well placed to continue to deliver its 
strategic goals. The year has seen economic and consumer 
recovery gather momentum which has helped stimulate 
improved sales in our shopping centres and retail parks. Our 
newly created VIA Outlets investment will provide exciting 
opportunities for Hammerson. Our investment in this sector 
is a key differentiator of our business. Last year I said that I was 
particularly struck by the capabilities of the management team 
and their energy and vision and one year on I remain impressed. 
I want to thank them and indeed all our people for delivering  
a strong performance in the year.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company complied  
in full with the provisions of  
the UK Corporate Governance  
Code published in September  
2012, which applied 
throughout the financial year 
ended 31 December 2014. 
60 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 An effective Board
As Chairman I am responsible for ensuring that your Board works 
effectively under my leadership in support of the Group’s strategy.  
In last year’s Annual Report I reported on my intention to change the 
structure and frequency of Board and Committee meetings during 
2014. Board agendas have been revised and some items moved to  
the agendas of the Committees in order to enable the Board to spend 
more time discussing investment, marketing and development. Senior 
executives have met with Non-Executive Directors both formally and 
informally to discuss specific projects. The Board has evaluated the new 
approach and I can report that the Directors are satisfied with the way 
the Board is operating. Further detail on this year’s internal evaluation 
of Board effectiveness can be found on page 67 of the Corporate 
Governance Report.
One of the recommendations from the 2013 external Board 
effectiveness review was to introduce an electronic board paper  
portal as a more efficient, secure and sustainable way of disseminating 
Board papers. A project to explore suitable software was managed  
by the Company Secretary and her team. Following an evaluation 
exercise, a provider was chosen and the software implemented.  
It is now being used for the Board and all Committees and feedback 
from Directors indicates that it has been received very positively.
Board changes and succession planning
Since my last report to you a number of changes have happened  
to the Board and its Committees. After the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) in 2014 we said goodbye to John Hirst at which point Jacques 
Espinasse took on the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee.  
Gwyn Burr assumed the role of Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee after the AGM, having been appointed to that Committee 
in February 2014. 
Anthony Watson will be stepping down at the conclusion of this  
year’s AGM, after nine years on the Board. On behalf of the Board  
I would like to thank Anthony for his commitment to the Company 
and the valuable and significant contribution he has made as a 
Non-Executive Director. Anthony has been a member of the 
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees and was Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee from January 2006 to April 2014.  
He has held the role of Senior Independent Director since January 
2010. I would also like to add my personal thanks to Anthony for the 
significant role he has played in ensuring that the Board meets  
its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders in these roles.
Jacques Espinasse will have served on the Board for nine years  
in 2016 and has indicated his intention to step down from the  
Board at the AGM in 2016.
In July, we decided that all Non-Executive Directors would become 
members of the Nomination Committee and so membership 
increased by three. The Nomination Committee report can be  
found on pages 68 to 70.
I am delighted to welcome Pierre Bouchut, who was appointed to the 
Board on 13 February 2015 and a report on the recruitment process is 
described in the Nomination Committee report on page 70. His strong 
financial expertise combined with an in-depth knowledge and 
experience of the retail industry in an international environment 
complement the skills of the Board.
In light of Anthony Watson’s decision to stand down from the Board  
in April 2015, the Nomination Committee considered possible 
successors to the role of Senior Independent Director in consultation 
with all the Board and the Company Secretary. I am delighted that 
Terry Duddy has agreed to accept the role and he will be appointed 
with effect from 22 April 2015. He has both the right personal  
qualities and deep commercial and shareholder relations experience, 
culminating in his years as Chief Executive of Home Retail Group. 
It is my responsibility to ensure that Board members have 
independence of mind and action and that the Board as a whole  
has an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, experience  
and background. This has been in my mind as the changes noted 
above have taken place. Further changes to the Board will continue  
to reflect these points as well as the long-term demands of the 
business as it develops in the coming years. 
Changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board and I remain committed to following best practice in 
corporate governance. I am pleased to report that the Company 
complied fully with the Code in 2014. Following the publication  
by the Financial Reporting Council of a revised edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in September 2014, we have already 
taken steps to comply with the updated requirements. We plan  
to comply fully with these requirements in 2015.
