 Joint Chief Executives’ Review  
and Finance Report
The Group has completed £583.0 million of 
sales and purchases during 2014. The increase 
in investor appetite for multi-let light industrial 
property, particularly in the UK, has enabled 
us to sell pro tably £315.3 million of property. 
Despite increased competition, we have still 
managed to acquire £267 .7 million of property 
on terms that we believe offer excellent value 
and future growth potential. 
At the property level, our portfolio that is 
owned or co-owned, comprises 4.2 million 
sq m or 45.4 million sq ft at a passing yield of 
8.5%, occupancy of 86.0%, and over 6,000 
tenants, none of whom account for more than 
1 .2% of the entire rent roll. All three regions 
(UK, Germany and Benelux) made signi cant 
contributions to the  nancial success in 2014.
Our management platform now comprises 
15 of ces spread across Europe which is 
an enormous asset to the business and an 
acknowledged market leader at managing this 
type of property. Implementing the strategy

IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY
Hansteen has a buy, work and sell business 
model. We endeavour to buy assets when 
they are at a relatively low point both in relation 
to the property cycle and at the asset level. 
In particular, we like to buy properties with a 
vacant element. We then apply our particular 
brand of intensive management to increase the 
occupancy, increase the rent and reduce the 
irrecoverable costs. Ideally, we then crystallise 
the value added at a relatively strong point in 
the cycle.
In the years 2008 to 2013 the markets were 
both depressed and distressed. During that 
period we acquired £1 .6 billion of property 
and sold £649.0 million from the owned or 
co-owned portfolio. The acquisition prices 
paid were low and in virtually all cases the 
acquisitions were directly or indirectly from 
banks that had taken control following a 
borrower defaulting on a loan.
In 2014, with the market gathering momentum, 
the  gures were £315.3 million sold and 
£267 .7 million purchased. Given a market with 
improving liquidity all aspects of our strategy 
were positive.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (“KPI’S”)
FINANCIAL KPI’S
We believe that returns are best measured 
by looking at normalised pro ts and valuation 
growth. 
Normalised Total Pro t for the year to 31 
December 2014 increased by 41 .0% to £65.3 
million (2013: £46.3 million). Normalised Income 
Pro t, which excludes pro ts or losses from the 
sale of properties (i.e. essentially the repeatable 
earnings of the business), increased by 22.3% 
to £48.2 million (2013: £39.4 million).  
This is the ninth consecutive year in which 
Hansteen’s Normalised Income Pro t has 
increased. Normalised Income Pro t per share 
increased by 14.5% to 7 .1p (2013: 6.2p). 
The table below sets out the results for 
Normalised Income Pro t and Normalised Total 
Pro t including our share of associates.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report In addition to pro ts in 2014 all regions produced positive valuation 
growth. The total uplift of £135.8 million was the highest in any 
year for Hansteen. As a result the Group’s EPRA Net Asset Value 
at 31 December 2014 was 102p per share (2013: 91p), an increase 
of 12.1%. This combined with dividends paid in the year of 5.4% 
equates to a return in excess of 17.0%. Excluding adverse currency 
movement and the LTIP provision, the underlying performance 
increased by more than 20.0%.
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO
In total, the portfolio that is owned or co-owned 
by Hansteen is valued at £1 .6 billion, has a rent 
roll of £137 .7 million per annum and 14.0% 
vacancy. If the portfolio was fully occupied at 
our view of market rents, the rent roll would be 
£171 .4 million per annum, re#ecting a yield of 
10.6%. 
Hansteen’s attributable property investments, 
at 31 December 2014, was valued at £1 .2 billion 
(2013: £1 .1 billion). Had the currency remained 
unchanged throughout the year, the portfolio 
would have been worth an additional £59.1 
million. At 31 December 2014, this attributable 
portfolio comprised 3.2 million sq m, an increase 
from 2.8 million sq m at the start of the year 
mainly due to the acquisitions in Germany and 
the Netherlands. The portfolio has a yield of 
8.6% (2013: 8.7%). The analysis of the portfolio

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report PROPERTY VALUATION
The value of the total portfolio under 
management has increased by £135.8 million  
or 9.2% from December 2013. The wholly 
owned portfolio increased by £62.9 million with 
the three UK funds increasing by £73.0 million. 
Hansteen’s share of these fund increases was 
£25.1 million giving an attributable valuation 
increase to Hansteen of £88.0 million from 
31 December 2013. 
The value of the German portfolio increased by 
€44.0 million or 6.0%. The UK wholly owned 
portfolio increased by £8.6 million or 7 .6% and 
the Benelux portfolio valuation increased by 
€23.7 million or 8.2%. The Netherlands portfolio 
purchased in June 2014 accounted for all of the 
increase in the Benelux.
HPUT II values have increased by £18.7 million 
or 11 .4% and AIF values increased by £49.1 
million or 13.1%. The value of Saltley Business 
Park in Birmingham, which is now owned in a 
50/50 joint venture with Brockton Capital LLP , 
has also increased by £5.2 million or 16.8%. 
ASSET MANAGEMENT PLATFORM
The platform has grown further during 2014, 
mostly in the Netherlands following the portfolio 
acquisition in June 2014. We opened a new 
of ce in Utrecht bringing the total number 
of of ces to 15. During 2014, the team have 
secured 1,776 new leases and lease renewals 
across the total portfolio generating £39.2 
million of new or renewed annualised rental 
income. This is more than twice the number 
handled in 2013 (850 new leases and renewals) 
and highlights how well the regional asset 
management teams have performed this year. 
Our asset managers are focussed primarily on 
direct tenant relationships and the marketing 
of vacant units either for sale or to rent. They 
are also heavily involved in the management 
of the properties in their region, although the 
day-to-day management of our properties is 
undertaken by local property managers who 
are contracted on a third-party basis. With a 
substantial platform in place across all our 
regions, we are ideally positioned to absorb 
additional properties without a corresponding 
proportionate increase in costs. As we continue 
to take the marketing of our properties in-
house, the fees paid to third party marketing 
agents relative to rent generated from new 
lettings and lease renewals has decreased 
further during 2014. Letting fees paid were £0.8 
million on new lettings and renewals of £39.2 
million compared to letting fees of £1 .0 million 
on new lettings and renewals of £24.6 million 
in 2013.
OCCUPANCY AND PASSING RENT
Like-for-like net occupancy (measured by taking 
the vacant area at the start of the year, adding 
vacancy on purchases and then comparing 
with the vacancy at the end of the year) has 
improved by 195,000 sq m across the portfolio 
under management. This represents 4.6% 
of the total portfolio under management at 
31 December 2014 or 29.2% of the vacant 
area at the start of the year. This excellent 
achievement has come through a combination 
of letting vacant space and selling vacant units, 
both important components of the Hansteen 
business model. For the third year in a row, all 
three of our core regions have contributed to 
this increase in occupancy.
The passing rent of the portfolio under 
management at the start of the year was 
£134.9 million per annum. The net effect of 
sales and acquisitions was a rent increase of 
£5.2 million per annum, the reduction due to 
exchange rate movements was £4.1 million per 
annum and the closing rent was £137 .7 million 
per annum. This resulted in a net like-for-like 
improvement of £1 .7 million or 1 .2%.
Germany
Germany, which accounts for approximately 
50.3% of Hansteen’s attributable property 
investments, has again performed well with 
like-for-like income, occupancy and value, all 
improving during 2014. The passing rent in 2013 
was €62.1 million per annum and the net effect 
of sales and acquisitions was a rent increase of 
€3.6 million per annum. The closing rent at 31 
December 2014 was €67 .2 million per annum,

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report a net improvement of €1 .6 million per annum 
or a 2.4% improvement in the like-for-like rent 
roll. The like-for-like occupancy improvement 
totalled 26,000 sq m. At the end of the year the 
portfolio had 185,000 sq m vacant, representing 
11 .5% of the total #oor area (2013 vacancy: 
12.3%).
In 2014 we also completed the re nancing of 
both the HBOS and UniCredit debt facilities 
which were due to expire in October 2014 
and February 2015 respectively. A  ve-year, 
€235 million facility has been provided by a 
consortium of lenders led by Landesbank 
Hessen-Thüringen Girozentrale (Helaba). We 
have hedged 80% of the interest on the loan, 
resulting in an interest cost of 3.5% per annum 
at the time of re nancing, excluding fees. HSBC 
provided a  ve-year, €108 million facility which, 
with a €55 million interest rate hedge, gave an 
interest cost of 2.9% per annum at the time 
of re nancing, excluding fees. The combined 
terms equated to an all-in average rate of 3.8% 
per annum, including fees. We were delighted 
to secure these well priced facilities with new 
lenders and Hansteen has already built on the 
relationship with HSBC who also provided the 
bank debt for the acquisitions concluded at the 
end of the year.
Seven properties in Germany were sold for 
€23.2 million generating €3.0 million of pro t 
above the December 2013 valuation and €4.9 
million above gross acquisition costs. The 
biggest of these was our Delta Forum estate 
in Ginsheim-Gustavsburg which was sold to 
a fund managed by CBRE Global Investors 
for €16.0 million. With the estate almost fully 
occupied, it was identi ed as ripe for sale and 
because the light industrial property sector had 
not been previously recognised by institutions, 
the sale was a signi cant step forward for both 
Hansteen and the whole sector.
A portfolio of nine properties (the “Pisces 
portfolio”) was purchased in December 2014 for 
€56.6 million, adding 140,000 sq m of space to 
the portfolio. There is currently 19.0% of good 
quality, lettable vacant space which presents a 
signi cant opportunity to increase income and 
capital values. The rent roll stands at €5.3 million 
per annum and when fully let, the portfolio 
is expected to produce rent of €6.7 million 
per annum. In addition, Hansteen has also 
exchanged a conditional contract to purchase 
a further estate for €1 .5 million with the 
transaction expected to complete by the end 
of the  rst quarter 2015. The acquisitions were 
funded from existing cash resources along with 
a new €40.0 million,  ve-year loan facility which 
has been agreed with HSBC. The assets are all 
located in regions which we know well and will 
be managed by our existing regional teams.
Netherlands, Belgium  
and France
At 31 December 2014, Benelux accounted for 
approximately 20.1% of Hansteen’s attributable 
property investments, increased from 14.2% at 
31 December 2013 due to the acquisition of the 
new portfolio announced in June 2014, referred 
to in more detail below. 2014 has been a very 
successful year with signi cant increases in 
like-for-like rent and occupancy. The passing rent 
in 2013 was €13.8 million per annum and the 
net effect of sales and acquisitions was a rent 
increase of €14.6 million per annum. The closing 
rent at 31 December 2014 was €29.4 million 
per annum, a net like-for-like improvement of 
€1 .0 million or 3.4%. The like-for-like occupancy 
improvement was 46,000 sq m or 43.4% of the 
vacancy at the start of the year. The portfolio 
ended the year with 143,000 sq m vacant or 
18.1% of the total #oor area.
In June 2014 a large portfolio of 41 estates 
in the core Randstad area of the Netherlands 
was acquired for €106 million. This followed a 
complex set of transactions where Hansteen 
had previously purchased 50% of a loan 
secured against the portfolio from Unicredit 
Bank AG. Following the acquisition of the 
Unicredit loan, Hansteen agreed to acquire the 
remaining 50% of the loan from ING, subject 
to a new €60 million  ve year loan from ING. 
Hansteen also agreed to break the swaps on 
the loan at a discount to their market value and 
subsequently agreed a consensual deal with 
the borrower, Lancelot Land BV , to acquire the 
underlying property assets.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report Hansteen has made a net investment of £40 
million of equity in the transaction which has 
contributed almost £27 .0 million to the IFRS 
pre-tax pro t. £4.0 million of  nance income 
relates to the unwinding of the discount on 
the loan that was secured on the portfolio 
and £3.2 million of operating income arose 
when the loan was satis ed in exchange for 
the properties on which it was secured. The 
valuation uplift subsequent to the acquisition 
of the entire portfolio was £19.5 million. During 
the six months of Hansteen ownership, the 
Dutch asset management team has already 
produced some impressive results reducing 
the vacancy from 22.7% to 18.5%.
 
A multi-let of ce property at Louvain La 
Neuve in Belgium where we had achieved 
full occupancy was sold for €6.1 million, 
generating a pro t of €0.6 million. Over the last 
18 months, the asset management team in the 
Benelux re-geared several leases and let almost 
all of the vacant space, to a range of local and 
national occupiers. With the property almost 
fully let, it was sold to a local investor, following 
a brief marketing exercise.
The French portfolio comprises two properties 
totalling 56,000 sq m with an annual rent roll of 
€1 .7 million.
UK
The size of the owned or co-owned UK 
portfolio changed signi cantly during 2014 
with a considerable number of disposals as 
well as further investment in HPUT II and the 
acquisition of additional units in AIF . The total UK 
portfolio as at the year-end comprised 1 .8 million 
sq m with a rent roll of £62.4 million per annum, 
a vacancy of 14.5% and a value of £765.5 
million. Hansteen’s proportion of that portfolio 
was £356.3 million, approximately 29.6% of 
Hansteen’s attributable property investments.
UK WHOLLY OWNED 
At 31 December 2014, the wholly owned 
UK portfolio had a rent roll of £8.9 million 
per annum and a value of £121 .2 million, 
representing a yield of 7 .4% with a vacancy 
rate of 18.3%. Included within this value are 
three development sites totalling 70.8 hectares 
valued at £6.7 million. Like-for-like occupancy 
increased by 3,600 sq m or 7 .4% of the opening 
vacancy and like-for-like rent (once rent free 
concessions expire) increased by £0.3 million.
AIF
AIF has had a particularly active and successful 
year as the UK team has implemented various 
asset management strategies across the 
country to improve the rent roll and occupancy

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report as well as to sell assets into the buoyant UK 
market. The results are impressive with an 
improvement in like-for-like rent of £0.3 million 
and an increase in like-for-like occupancy 
of 75,000 sq m. At 31 December 2014, the 
portfolio was valued at £425.5 million, had a 
rent roll of £36.9 million per annum, a yield on 
the passing rent of 8.7%, and had a vacancy 
rate of 14.4%.
During the year we acquired a further 9.2% 
stake in AIF for £26.0 million increasing our 
share in the fund to 36.7%. The additional stake 
was purchased from three vendors at a price 
of 46.5p per unit, the March 2014 property 
valuation. Since then, the value of the AIF 
properties has increased by 9.9%. A further 
4.1% holding was purchased in February 2015 
for £11 .0 million bringing our total holding to 
40.8%. 
HPUT
The biggest single portfolio sale was completed 
in October when HPUT was sold, in two 
transactions, for a total of £146.1 million (after 
the deduction of rental top-ups). 41 assets 
were sold to a fund advised by Brockton Capital 
LLP in a partnership with Dunedin Property for 
£110.5 million. A separate 50/50 joint venture 
between Brockton Capital and Hansteen 
acquired Saltley Business Park in Birmingham 
for a net price of £35.6 million, an asset which 
Hansteen will continue to manage. The 42 
assets were sold at above the September 
2014 valuation and generated pro ts of £22.4 
million over gross acquisition cost. The total 
return of the fund was 55% (an IRR of 9.7%) 
and Hansteen has enjoyed the high income 
distributions together with asset management 
fees. HPUT played a key part in the return of 
Hansteen to the UK market and its success led 
to the establishment of a second fund, HPUT II 
and our re-capitalisation of AIF .
HPUT II
The Fund has acquired 35 properties in ten 
separate transactions during the year, and 
disposed of 15 properties, nearly all as part 
of larger UK portfolio sales. At 31 December 
2014, the portfolio consisted of 76 assets 
totalling 336,000 sq m with a value of £182.5 
million, a vacancy of 15.6%, a passing rent roll 
of £14.1 million per annum and a yield on the 
passing rent of 7 .7%. Like-for-like occupancy has 
increased by 6,800 sq m with the like-for-like 
rent roll remaining broadly #at.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report During the year, the Company raised £46.3 
million, net of expenses, through the issue of 
44.8 million new shares and 300,000 share 
options were exercised. As at 31 December 
2014, there were 685.0 million shares in issue 
(2013: 641 .1 million) with a further 1 .5 million 
shares under option at exercise prices below 
the market price at that time and 22.6 million 
potential shares in relation to the LTIP giving 
709.1 million shares for dilutive measures (2013: 
651 .3 million). As at 31 December 2014 IFRS 
Diluted NAV per share was 95p (2013: 85p) and 
EPRA NAV per share was 102p (2013: 91p).
FOUNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
Our policy of buying value during the downturn 
and working the assets has generated capital 
and income returns well in excess of 10% per 
annum since the current LTIP measurement 
period began in January 2013. If continued, this 
performance will potentially trigger the Founder 
LTIP arrangements. The potential LTIP award 
can still only be estimated at this stage as the 
out-turn depends entirely on the performance of 
the business over the three year period ending 
31 December 2015. To the extent that growth 
in EPRA NAV plus dividends exceeds 10% 
per annum compound over three years, the 
Joint Chief Executives will each receive shares 
equating to 12.5% of the out-performance. 
In the  rst two years of the LTIP measurement 
period, EPRA NAV growth plus dividends 
amounted to a gain of 31 .7p per share. This 
represents a 38% total return. The EPRA NAV 
per share  gure requires the inclusion of a 
number of shares to re#ect a possible LTIP 
award on the basis of what the award would 
be if the measurement period were taken for 
only the two years to 31 December 2014 (22.6 
million shares). The impact of these shares is 
to reduce EPRA NAV per share from 105p to 
102p. The IFRS pre-tax pro t includes a charge 
of £13.6 million related to a potential LTIP 
award and associated National Insurance (NI) 
contributions. Only the effect of the associated 
NI contributions on the LTIP awards affects the 
NAV because, in accordance with IFRS, the 
charge for the potential LTIP award excluding 
the NI contributions is credited back through 
equity.
CONVERTIBLE LOAN STOCK
In July 2013 Hansteen issued a €100 million 
convertible bond. The money raised was 
instrumental in enabling our purchase of 
Ashtenne and the debt re nancing in Germany. 
None of the conditions that would allow a 
bondholder to convert were met during the 
year; therefore the dilutive impact of the bonds 
is excluded from EPRA NAV . The bonds are 
convertible from July 2016. However, there are 
conditions under which the bonds are capable 
of conversion in 2015 which current trends 
would support. The principal terms of the 
bonds are detailed in the notes to the  nancial 
statements.
GEARING
Net debt was £416.3 million at 31 December 
2014 (2013: £432.2 million). Debt includes a 
mark-to-market adjustment of £18.4 million  
(2013: £16.2 million) for the convertible bond. 
Excluding the mark-to-market adjustment of 
the convertible bond, net debt to property 
value at 31 December 2014 was 41 .1% (2013: 
49.3%) and net debt to shareholders equity at 
31 December 2014 was 58.8% (2013: 75.0%) 
re#ecting our continued policy of maintaining 
gearing at a prudent level.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had 
borrowings of £526.5 million (2013: £492.9 
million) of which £239.6 million was swapped 
at an average rate of 0.9% and £96.0 million 
was capped at an average rate of 2.1%. The 
average all-in borrowing rate for the Group at 31 
December 2014 was 3.8% (2013: 3.7%).
The aggregate net assets of the Group’s 
associates at 31 December 2014 were

Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report FUNDING
In February 2014, Hansteen completed the 
re nancing of two facilities in Germany. Both 
the UniCredit and HBOS facilities were fully 
repaid and two new  ve-year facilities were 
secured with Helaba (€235.0 million) and HSBC 
(€108.0 million). Both banks were new to 
Hansteen. 
The acquisition of the Pisces portfolio in 
Germany in December 2014 utilised another 
facility with HSBC for €40.0 million, of which 
€34.2 million was drawn, expiring in December 
2019. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had total 
bank facilities of £438.3 million (2013: £391 .8 
million), of which £433.8m were drawn (2013: 
£391 .8 million). Borrowings are in the same 
currency as the assets against which they are 
secured. Cash resources at the year-end were 
£110.3 million (2013: £57 .8 million).
As a result of securing the new facilities 
detailed above, the weighted average debt 
maturity at 31 December 2014 had increased to 
3.8 years and the weighted average maturity of 
hedging was 3.1 years.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report CURRENCY
Hansteen reports its results in Sterling. As at 
31 December 2014, approximately 52% (£349 
million or €448 million) of the Group’s net assets 
were denominated in Euros. A natural currency 
hedge arises from the Group maintaining 
borrowings denominated in the same currency 
as the assets that they secure. To minimise any 
adverse changes in the Sterling: Euro exchange 
rate, and a resultant decrease in NAV , Hansteen 
has entered various foreign currency contracts. 
During the year, Hansteen replaced its two 
€100 million currency options, with two new 
€100 million options, expiring in June 2016, 
at a rate of €1 .3/£1 . In addition, the Group has 
hedged €83.5 million of its expected future 
net Euro income with four options expiring at 
six monthly intervals between 30 June 2015 
and 31 December 2016. These options are to 
put €83.5 million and call for GBP at varying 
rates from €1 .3/£1 to €1 .45/£1 with an overall 
weighted average of €1 .366/£1 . The aggregate 
of all of these currency options amounts to 
€283.5 million providing hedges against 63% 
of the Group’s €448 million Euro net assets at 
31 December 2014. The options expiring on 30 
June 2016 and 31 December 2016 were entered 
into during the year. The aggregate premiums 
for the options entered into during the year 
were £3.7 million.
After taking into account the various currency 
hedges, even in a particularly stressed position 
of the Euro collapsing by 16.8% to €1 .50:£1 
from the year end rate, the Group would only 
lose approximately £24.0 million or 3.6%  
of its net asset value.
The Group’s hedging policy, which is regularly  
reviewed by the Board, is as follows:
• Hedging instruments are used to cover a 
substantial proportion of Group Euro net 
assets and estimated net Euro income for 
the short-term.
• Hedges are implemented at levels which 
the Board believe are cost effective.
• Hedging is employed as an insurance policy 
against the impact of a signi cant fall in the 
value of the Euro against Sterling rather 
than a means to speculate for pro t.
MARKETS
Although the investment market in our sector 
in the UK has improved signi cantly in a short 
time, it feels as if this momentum will continue 
for a while due both to the proliferation of 
well priced capital (both debt and equity) and 
to the gradual but real improvement in the 
occupational market and resulting rental growth.
We believe the investment market in our sector 
in Germany is also improving and, as with 
the UK, we may be surprised by how far and 
fast values improve.  Over the last year our 
experience has been of a con dent, successful 
economy bene tting from low interest rates and 
an arti cially low currency. In our world that has 
translated into a strong occupational market, 
a competitive job market, rising construction 
costs and rising house prices, providing  
a positive back drop to our activities. 
The Benelux market is lagging behind Germany 
and the UK both in terms of the strength of the 
occupational market and investment values but 
it appears to be following a similar path.
PROPERTY CYCLE
Having a view on the property cycle is vital in 
setting the direction of the business over the 
next few years. Our business will be affected 
by the broad economy, interest rates and 
the availability of money and currency/cross 
border risks. Although every property cycle is 
unique, this current one is particularly different 
and dif cult to read due to the unprecedented 
and ongoing intervention in  nancial markets 
by the world’s central banks resulting in what 
looks likely to be a long period of relatively low 
growth and low interest rates. It feels to us that 
the current strength in both the occupational 
and investment markets has further to run and 
although there are clearly signi cant geopolitical

Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report risk concerns, were they to materialise, a 
diverse, high-yielding industrial property 
portfolio is likely to be as good a place to be 
invested as any.
OUTLOOK
As a Pan-European business that reports in 
Sterling there are risks, both currency and 
otherwise, relating to the stability of the 
euro zone. We do our best to mitigate these 
both by our choice of investment regions and 
hedging the currency risk to a large extent. 
However, notwithstanding this the outlook 
for the business is excellent.  We have a high 
yielding, diverse portfolio of properties valued 
at substantially below replacement cost. The 
regional network of of ces and teams that 
we have established over the last ten years 
has proved to be  rst class at operating the 
business. Our portfolio still has a valuable 
vacant element to drive the rent roll and rents 
which look set to grow as the economies in 
which we operate improve. Risk adjusted 
returns from industrial property look high 
relative to many other investments and there is 
a signi cant weight of capital looking to invest.
