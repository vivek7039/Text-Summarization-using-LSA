DISCIPLINED
APPROACH
Our investment strategy is focused on our long-
term sustainability. The up-gauging of our fleet 
through the addition of A320 and A321neos to 
the fleet plan delivers a significant cost per seat 
benefit, as well as supporting an increase in 
market share in slot-constrained airports.
