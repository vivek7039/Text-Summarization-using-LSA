Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 7
The Group’s ability to deliver its  
best ever performance was, once 
again, testament to the success  
of our long-term strategy for growth;  
founded on the two pillars of 
international expansion and 
discipline diversification. 
Our international footprint covers 28  
countries, and most crucially, encompasses 
some of the world’s fastest growing and 
exciting recruitment markets as well as more  
mature and well-established locations that 
continue to have significant scope for 
additional growth. 
The breadth of solutions we can provide to 
our clients, from permanent, contract and 
interim recruitment through to recruitment 
process outsourcing is also a key point of 
differentiation in our ability to provide a true 
end-to-end recruitment offering to both 
candidates and clients.
ASIA PACIFIC  
(40% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Revenue was £370.2m (2016: £348.6m), 
net fee income increased by 16% (11%*) 
to £136.6m (£131. 1m*) (2016: £1 17 .6m) and 
operating profit increased by 21% (14%*)  
to £17.7m (£16.8m*) (2016: £14.7m).
One of the key strengths of the Group is its  
presence in both established and emerging  
recruitment markets and nowhere is this more  
prevalent than in Asia Pacific. The Group 
operates in 13 countries and has an 
unrivalled footprint across the region. 
In Asia, the Group’s most profitable single  
country, Japan, enjoyed yet another record  
year in both Tokyo and Osaka, reinforcing 
our market-leading position in this exciting  
market. Hong Kong, another of the Group’s  
well-established scale businesses, also had  
a record year whilst market conditions 
in Singapore remained more challenging. 
Across our emerging markets, all businesses  
delivered record performances and 
continued to grow net fee income  
and market share.
Australia had a good year and a particularly 
strong fourth quarter: benefiting from our 
footprint of offices covering five states, 
our focus on margin growth in the SME 
market and high growth disciplines such 
as technology, digital and contract. New 
Zealand had a record year with the Group’s 
successful sponsorship of the recent British 
& Irish Lions Tour helping to further build our 
brand profile and market-leading position. 
Resource Solutions continued to grow  
its client base across the region, winning 
a number of multi-country contracts with 
new clients. A new Global Service Centre 
was opened in Manila during the year  
to complement our existing site in India.
UK  
(29% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Revenue was £569.6m (2016: £480.6m), 
net fee income increased by 16% to 
£100.9m (2016: £86.7m) and operating 
profit increased by 84% to £11.8m  
(2016: £6.4m).
In the UK and particularly in London  
and the South East, candidate and client  
confidence levels remain somewhat cautious. 
However, activity levels in certain sectors 
and disciplines were strong. In London, 
growth was strongest across technology, 
legal, financial services and commerce 
finance. In the regions, growth was broad-
based with St. Albans and Manchester  
in particular delivering the strongest rates  
of growth, benefiting from a focus on 
SMEs and the trend of a number of large 
businesses moving operations outside  
of London.
Resource Solutions continued to 
deliver impressive rates of growth and 
encouragingly won several clients in new 
industry sectors including retail, mobile 
telecommunications, fintech and property 
management. 
EUROPE  
(23% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Revenue was £189.1m (2016: £147.0m), 
net fee income increased by 34% (26%*) 
to £80.6m (£75.5m*) (2016: £60.1m) and 
operating profit increased by 168% (149%*) 
to £11.3m (£10.5m*) (2016: £4.2m).
The Group has a geographic footprint 
that spans nine countries. Performance 
was outstanding across the region with 
both net fee income and operating profit 
increasing significantly year-on-year. 
Belgium, Germany, Portugal, the 
Netherlands and Spain all delivered net fee 
income increases in excess of 20%. Our 
French business, our largest in the region, 
grew net fee income by 18% and delivered 
a significant increase in operating profit.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
(8% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Other International encompasses Brazil, 
Canada, South Africa, the Middle East 
and the USA. Revenue was £36.9m (2016: 
£22.3m), net fee income increased by 93% 
(87%*) to £27.1m (£26.2m) (2016: £14.0m) 
and operating profit increased by 16% 
(41%*) to £1.1m (£1.3m*) (2016: £0.9m).
Market conditions in Brazil remain challenging 
but it has been positive to see our business 
deliver in excess of 50% growth in net fee 
income year-on-year. Our new business  
in Canada has started well whilst in the US,  
although financial services remains tough,  
other market sectors, particularly technology  
and digital, continue to be strong. The Middle 
East was largely flat year-on-year whilst in 
South Africa we are seeing good growth 
from Sub-Saharan markets as our brand 
presence grows across the region. 
BOARD CHANGES

Senior Independent Director will step up

year strongly. As a result, we look at the 
year ahead with confidence.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND DRIVERS
TALENT SHORTAGES 
WORLDWIDE
Talent shortages are set to intensify further, even in countries 
experiencing modest growth. Demographic changes continue  
to be a key driver, particularly across Asia. As the European 
job market begins to grow after ten years of stagnation, the war  
for talent shows no sign of slowing. In talent short markets, 
specialist recruitment firms can excel and are in greater demand  
to add value to the hiring process, especially when compared 
to speculative channels like social media or advertising.
KEY DRIVERS 
– Growing middle class across Asia 
– Ageing populations 
– Globalisation driving demand for bilingual talent 
– Legislative and industry changes
OUR RESPONSE 
– Ability to head hunt ‘passive’ talent – channels like LinkedIn  
 can’t replicate 
– Specialist teams quick to recognise new areas of demand 
– Long-standing, genuine relationships, we know who  
 is ready to move 
– Innovative marketing campaigns like ‘Pulang Kampung’

KEY TRENDS STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 9
 
RPO GROWTH
The RPO market, according to leading market research agency  
Nelson Hall, is predicted to grow by 15% annually through to  
2019. Growth is being driven by increased globalisation of the  
workforce as organisations increasingly look for one integrated 
provider with global solutions. Companies are also looking 
to benefit from best practice, economies of scale, global 
standards and measurement as well as a drive for greater 
efficiency across supplier relationships. Whilst cost saving  
is one key driver, this is now balanced with a desire for  
a higher quality candidate experience.
KEY DRIVERS 
– Increasing globalisation of the workforce 
– Organisations moving from multiple outsourcing partners  
 to smaller numbers 
– Demand for global technology platforms to provide  
 common HR standards 
– Blended service requirement: where business partners  
 feed requests to lower cost sourcing centres
OUR RESPONSE 
– First recruitment business to set up an outsourcing  
 arm in 1997 
– Client dedicated service with quality focus: ability  
 to deliver total talent management 
– Cutting edge, proprietary software TalentSource:  
 our end-to-end talent management platform 
– Global service centres in Manchester, Hyderabad,  
 Johannesburg, Jacksonville and Manila
 
SPECIALISATION
Businesses are looking for ever more specialist skill-sets.  
In particular, the rise of digitalisation and changes in technology  
are driving growth in professional skills-sets and new disciplines  
of expertise. The marketing function is a good example of this  
with a shift in demand from general marketers to digital 
specialists and now, niche roles like Pay Per Click (PPC),  
Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and retargeting specialists 
are increasingly common. The proliferation of digital channels 
is also driving demand for niche technology skills like robotic 
process automation, cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI) 
and business intelligence.
KEY DRIVERS 
– Disruptive technologies and innovation 
– New industry and sector creation e.g. big data 
– Rise in financial technology (fintech) driving demand  
 for hybrid skills 
– Switch from generalists to channel experts 
–  Regulation driving demand for compliance, risk, audit  
 and legal experts
OUR RESPONSE 
– Strategy of discipline diversification 
– Agile approach – able to quickly build new teams  
 and replicate across our business 
– Sector specialists who’ve worked in industry, deep  
 understanding of client/candidate needs 
– Relationship driven network means we are able to  
 work across geographies to relocate specialist talent
