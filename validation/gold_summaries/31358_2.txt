GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
Commenting on the results and 
prospects, Mike Love, Non-Executive 
Chairman, said:
“The current trading performance of 
the Group is positive with orders for 
both Dillistone Systems and Voyager 
Software ahead of the same period 
in 2017 – with the former more than 
25% up on the same period in 2017 
and the latter having one of the best 
quarters for new business orders in  
its history.
 Our GatedTalent product, launched 
in October 2017, has been very well 
received with a growth trajectory that, 
we believe, will lead to it becoming the 
dominant product in its market space 
within a year.
 Recurring revenues for 2017 were at 
record levels and, despite the ongoing 
investment in product development, 
cash reserves have held up well. 
Overall, despite the evident pressure 
on new licence sales in 2017 and the 
loss for the year of £0.071m, going 
into 2018 the Group believes that it is 
now in a stronger position in its core 
markets than in recent years.
 This confidence in the future allows 
us to recommend a final dividend 
of 0.5p and we anticipate reporting 
further positive progress as the year 
progresses.”
