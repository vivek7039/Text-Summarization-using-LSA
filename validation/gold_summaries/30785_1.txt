 Summary
 → Our dedication to providing our clients with first class 
service and value remains undiminished and is key to 
how we manage the business. Our unique strategy 
leaves us better placed than ever to achieve long-
term success.
 → Mears has evolved its strategic focus towards housing 
management and Placemaking activities where we are 
using our broader service capability to create stronger, 
more sustainable communities. As a part of this, 
Mears is also building new homes as part of managing 
regeneration and to support our clients’ overall asset 
management plans. 
 → The Government has already announced major 
commitments to housing, meaning investment will grow 
over the coming years, with the removal of the rent cap 
in 2020 giving additional confidence to our clients. 
 → We firmly believe in our long-term Care strategy and that 
Mears is best placed to benefit as the market evolves. 
The Group will increasingly focus its care bidding activity 
towards those clients, where there are likely to be 
opportunities to provide a complete housing service.
Our financial performance in 2017 was disappointing and 
I understand the importance of delivering against our financial 
targets. Whilst some of the short-term challenges in Housing 
could not have been anticipated, it was frustrating that a 
number of other opportunities, which could have helped 
mitigate these challenges, did not develop quickly enough. 
Nonetheless, I am pleased with the progress made over the 
last year across the entire Mears business and on a range 
of important indicators.
I am particularly excited by the prospects for the Mears Housing 
offering over a medium-term time horizon. The Mears 
operations are performing very well and I am encouraged that 
this excellent performance is putting us in a good position to 
secure new opportunities. The pipeline of opportunities 
for Mears has never been greater. Given the nature of the type 
of work for which we are bidding, the contracts we secure are 
increasingly of longer duration, with multiple work tasks. 
Some of the most significant of these current bidding 
opportunities will be awarded in 2018, although 
commencement dates may not be until 2019. 
“  Our highly focused strategy in the 
Housing and Care markets, built on 
service leadership and sustainable 
pricing, continues to give me great 
confidence in the future. ”

Annual report and accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s strategy overview continued
In 2017, the value of new contracts secured was below our 
expectations. This was due to two particular factors: firstly,  
we did experience a reduced level of some traditional repairs 
and maintenance work coming to market and secondly, we 
have seen some competitors being very aggressive on price. 
Mears will continue to focus on bidding only at sustainable 
pricing levels.
The market has seen some reductions in capital discretionary 
expenditure levels in the last two years. This is due to a number 
of factors and we have in most circumstances been very 
supportive of our clients’ approach to these reduced spending 
levels. In the same period, social housing landlords have been 
focusing more on new-build activity to address the significant 
housing shortage, a clear Government priority.
The Government has already announced major commitments 
to housing, meaning investment will grow over the coming years, 
with the removal of the rent cap in 2020 giving additional 
confidence to our clients. The strategic evolution of our business 
means we can now access opportunities that previously would 
have been out of our reach. Mears has evolved its strategic 
focus towards Housing Management and Placemaking activities. 
In line with this, Mears is also building new homes as part of 
managing the regeneration and delivery of affordable housing 
for clients, to support their overall asset management plans. 
The Group has become a leading housing management 
business in the UK, directly addressing the issues resulting 
from rising levels of homelessness. 
We firmly believe in our long-term Care strategy and that 
Mears is well placed to benefit as the market evolves. We have 
concluded the restructuring of our Care business, exiting 
those contracts where low pricing, lack of longevity and 
uncertainty of spend did not allow us to deliver a high quality 
service at sustainable margins. We will continue to be highly 
selective going forward.
Looking ahead, we need to communicate more clearly the 
fundamental role played by Care within our Housing business. 
To understand the link between Housing and Care, one 
needs to understand the demographics of our social housing 
customers. Almost half of social housing is occupied by 
a single resident, with a very high proportion of people aged 65 
or older. In addition, where single residents are below 65 years 
old, there is a disproportionately high number of people who are 
disabled and/or living with multiple conditions that require 
care support. Almost one quarter of social housing is occupied 
by two people; however, a significant proportion of these are 
single parents. Whilst very few contract opportunities have 
our Housing and Care services being tendered together, it is 
vital in Housing that we can show that we have a deep 
understanding of the needs of our service users. This has 
become even more important as we have developed our 
housing management services, where tenancy management 
and care provision are increasingly directly linked. A 
significant proportion of our Housing customers have 
personal challenges and needs, and it is our capability and 
awareness of this which has underpinned our success. 
I envisage that the Group will increasingly focus its Care 
bidding activity towards those clients where there are likely 
to be opportunities to provide a complete Housing service.
We continue to see interest from Local Authorities to procure 
new care accommodation for supported living and extra 
care services which, in the majority of instances, involves 
a combination of funding, build, property management and 
care provision which is seen as a compelling service offering. 
We are currently on site in respect of three such schemes and 
there is a good pipeline developing. 
Our dedication to providing our clients with first class service 
and value remains undiminished and is key to how we manage 
the business. Our unique strategy leaves us better placed 
than ever to achieve long-term success.
“  We have developed a 
broader service offering to 
meet our clients’ needs. ”
We need to communicate more  
clearly the fundamental role played  
by Care within our Housing business
