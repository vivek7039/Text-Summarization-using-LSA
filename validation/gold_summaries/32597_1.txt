CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
I am delighted to report 
on a year that saw 
record sales and profits 
whilst continuing to 
invest in the key 
strategic areas that 
further improve our 
customer proposition.
Andrew Wass
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
When we joined AIM in June 2015, we 
were very confident that, with continued 
targeted investment of the funds from 
our IPO, we could build on the £24m 
revenues we had achieved in FY15, by 
improving our customer proposition 
through strategic investment into staff, 
systems, inventory and marketing, and 
expanding our presence in Europe.  
I am thrilled that we have surpassed 
those expectations, having more than 
doubled our revenues to £56m, whilst 
increasing profitability to an all-time high.
