4 I am pleased to be announcing another year of strong  
results due to our clear, consistent strategy, the dedication  
of our people across the business and the strength of our 
management team. Our total revenues during this 53 week 
period have increased by 12% to £392.0 million (2016: 
£350.5 million) and this has led to a rise in adjusted profit 
before tax of 5% to £42.9 million (2016: £40.9 million). 
One of the key measures for shareholders, adjusted earnings 
per share (EPS), has risen by 5% to 61.39p (2016: 58.35p), 
reflecting a continuous upward trend, and I am delighted to 
announce a rise in the full year dividend of 5%. As ever, we 
have delivered excellent returns for our shareholders and over 
the last five years, our EPS has risen 56%.
Our Managed Pubs and Hotels have had another very strong 
year, with like for like sales rising by 3.7%, outperforming  
the market once again. Food sales have grown ahead of this 
rate, while our accommodation business has performed 
exceptionally well, with a rise in occupancy rates increasing 
like for like sales by 6.4%.
The Tenanted Inns division has had a year of consolidation 
while we reviewed our strategy. We have a clear vision of 
where we can add value to the tenanted partnership and  
how to build solid foundations for future growth. It will  
be a long term process, but I look forward to updating you  
on progress in the coming months and years.
The Fuller’s Beer Company continues to produce an 
interesting and award-winning range of beers and ciders  
and brands such as Frontier, our delicious craft lager, have 
grown sales and taken Fuller’s into new listings. 
During the year, we appointed Simon Dodd, who used to  
run the Premium City pubs for Fuller’s Inns, to the role of 
Managing Director of The Fuller’s Beer Company. He brings 
a real customer focus, a keen understanding of consumer 
trends and a new approach to the role.
In another personnel change, John Keeling will be spending 
more time in a beer ambassador role, promoting Fuller’s both 
in the UK and globally and I am delighted that he has handed 
the Head Brewer baton to Georgina Young, who he has 
mentored and developed since she joined us in 1999. 
Dividend
The Board is pleased to announce a final dividend of 11.55p 
(2016: 11.00p) per 40p ‘A’ and ‘C’ ordinary share and 1.155p 
(2016: 1.10p) per 4p ‘B’ ordinary share. This will be paid on 
27 July 2017 to shareholders on the share register as at 
23 June 2017. The total dividend of 18.80p per 40p ‘A’ 
and ‘C’ ordinary share and 1.88p per 4p ‘B’ ordinary share 
represents a 5% increase on last year and will be covered 
3.3 times by adjusted earnings per share.

Michael is a keen skier and still races for the 
Vintners’ Ski Team – where he has been known 
to pick up the odd gold medal. He first took to 
the slopes at the tender age of four and a half 
when his father put him in the car, put the 
car on a plane, and took him to Adelboden 
in Switzerland.

“ OUR FOOD IS OUR 
REPUTATION AND  
WE TAKE PRIDE IN 
MAKING FULLER’S 
AS FAMOUS FOR 
OUR FOOD AS IT 
IS FOR OUR BEER.  
IT’S OUR CRAFT”
PAUL DICKINSON 
DIRECTOR OF FOOD
PASSION. 
INNOVATION. 
PERFECTION.
T
he Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild is the foundation 
for our food business. It is the route by which 
we recruit, develop and inspire our teams. It is 
designed to ensure consistency in our dishes, 
without limiting creativity and from Kitchen 
Porter to Head Chef, there is always something 
new for everyone to learn.
Bringing our chefs and our suppliers together 
has helped to build on the family values that run 
through the heart of Fuller’s. A chef who has seen 
a fish smoked, a cow milked or an ice-cream 
churned has a better appreciation of the flavours 
in, and the passion behind our ingredients. It helps 
to inspire them to create exciting dishes and it 
builds a relationship with the supplier that creates 
a lasting and sincere partnership.
The Fuller’s Chefs’ Guild was the start of the 
Fuller’s Kitchen initiative. With social media and 
billboard advertising bringing our chefs to life 
and our Chef of the Year competition now in its 
second year, we are on the right path to achieving 
our goal of becoming famous for our food. And we 
are attracting the right people, at all levels, to 
build the kitchen teams of the future.
