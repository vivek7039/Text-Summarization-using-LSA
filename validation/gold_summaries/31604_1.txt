 10 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s review
easyJet delivered a robust performance in the 2017 financial 
year. During the period the airline continued to make good 
progress in its purposeful growth strategy, making disciplined 
investments to maintain and grow its market-leading positions 
in Europe’s primary, slot-constrained airports. easyJet’s  
focused capacity growth of 8.5%, includes a number of 
time-sensitive opportunities in slot-constrained airports such  
as Amsterdam, which is now full. Over seven million more 
passengers flew with easyJet this year, representing an 
increase of 9.7%, at historically high load factors of 92.6%. 
This reflects the strength of easyJet’s network and 
customer proposition.
The airline’s disciplined strategy will enable it to be a 
structural winner within its chosen markets in the European 
short-haul market. 
Total revenue increased by 8.1% to £5,047 million  
(2016: £4,669 million).
Revenue per seat is broadly flat at £58.23 (down 4.5% at 
constant currency
(1)
), driven by:
• The persisting low fuel price environment, resulting in high 
levels of market capacity growth (7.4% growth in easyJet’s 
markets).
• An aggressive pricing environment which saw net ticket 
revenue per seat fall by 7.8% at constant currency.
• Ancillary revenue
(2)
 which grew by 17.8% to £986 million as 
high load factors and consumer-focused initiatives helped 
to offset ticket pricing pressures.
• Within this, non-seat revenue increased by 9.3% to  
£89 million, supported by strong inflight sales of easyJet’s 
enhanced product offering.
easyJet’s focus on rigorous cost control continues to deliver 
excellent results and supported the investment in operational 
resilience. Headline cost per seat increased by 2.4% to 
£53.52 driven by an adverse headline foreign exchange impact 
of £308 million (£3.56 per seat) and the costs of disruption, 
which remains a major industry challenge. At constant 
currency the headline cost per seat decreased by 4.4% as 
easyJet continued to benefit from its hedged fuel position. The 
overall cost performance is driven by:
• Fuel cost reduction of 19.2% per seat at constant currency.
• Lean initiatives in: 
 – airports and ground handling, leveraging easyJet’s scale 
across the network; 
 – engineering and maintenance savings in the supplier 
base; and
 – reduced navigation charges. 
• Up-gauging of fleet with the delivery of an additional 21 
186-seat A320 and two A320neo aircraft and retrofitting of 
49 existing 180-seat A320s to 186-seats.
This helped to offset:
• A continued increase in the combined impact on cost from 
disruption of EU 261 claims and an increasingly congested 
European aviation infrastructure.

Building momentum
(1) Constant currency is calculated by comparing the 2017 financial year performance translated at the 2016 financial year effective exchange rate to 
the 2016 financial year reported performance, excluding foreign exchange gains and losses on balance sheet revaluations
(2) Ancillary revenue includes revenue from the provision of checked baggage, allocated seating and change fees, and also includes non-seat revenue 
which arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and inflight sales. 
Our planned approach of 
achieving number one or 
two positions at Europe’s 
leading airports, friendly 
and efficient customer 
service and a continuous 
focus on sustainable cost 
control has put easyJet at 
a strategic advantage 
during a period when there 
have been bankruptcies 
and some airlines have 
struggled operationally.
