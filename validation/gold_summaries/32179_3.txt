 Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 4
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
I am delighted to report another successful year for the Company with adjusted profits, 
earnings and dividends all reaching record levels. Looking at the figures from continuing 
operations, adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 9.1% to £53.3m (2016: £48.8m), and 
statutory pre-tax profits reached £40.9m (2016: £35.1m), on revenue down by 0.6% to 
£740.3m (2016: £744.7m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 7.2% to 53.3p 
(2016: 49.7p), and statutory EPS increased to 38.0p (2016: 32.8p).
This performance was achieved in the face of challenging market conditions, with the 
strong headwinds we have seen over the last few years persisting during the first half of the 
year. And while the record gap between standard variable energy tariffs and aggressively 
priced introductory deals started to narrow during the autumn, this happened too late to 
provide any positive impact on our service and customer numbers for Q3. 
As previously reported, we responded to this more favourable environment by making 
a change to our Partner compensation plan at the beginning of Q4; this gave Partners 
the opportunity to accelerate some of the residual income they would earn on new 
Members who switched all their utilities to us. 
This enhancement, combined with our more competitive market position, led to an 
increase in Partner activity as we progressed through Q4, taking full year customer and 
service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively 
– an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. Within this total, there has 
once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016: 
76,764) residential Members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband, 
mobile, gas and electricity).
We received a number of further endorsements from Which? during the year, 
recognising both the value we offer and the quality of service provided by our UK-based 
membership support teams. In addition to being ranked amongst the top suppliers 
for all our core services (Energy, Broadband/Telephony and Mobile) in each of their 
sector surveys, we received Recommended Provider awards for both our Broadband 
and Mobile services. Further to this, we were delighted to receive the accolade of Best 
Telecom Services Provider at the recent Which? 2017 Annual Awards ceremony. In 
addition, we received four awards from Moneywise, and were voted UK National Public 
Champion (and named as a finalist in the Business of the Year category for companies 
with a turnover of €150m or higher) in the European Business Awards. These third party 
independent endorsements are a testament to our customer-centric approach, our 
commitment to treating our members fairly, our ongoing mission to be the Nation’s 
most trusted utility provider, and the significant resources invested in delivering the best 
possible customer service.

RESULTS OVERVIEW
Our adjusted profit from continuing operations (i.e. excluding the contribution from Opus) reflects the 
continuing modest organic growth over the last two years in the number of services we are providing to 
our Members, an increased proportion of revenues from higher margin telephony services, and a one-off 
recovery of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter roll-out programme under our energy 
supply agreement, counterbalanced by recurring customer acquisition costs which were higher this year 
(primarily due to Daffodil), continued investment in headcount and increased spending on IT. We also 
generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in 
Opus (see below), taking our total post-tax profit to £95.0m (2016: £31.8m).
Revenues fell slightly due to lower average energy prices (following an industry wide reduction in retail gas 
prices during the spring of 2016, and an increasing proportion of our customer base taking our cheapest 
‘Double Gold’ tariffs), a reduction in average energy usage (reflecting the progressive impact of the energy 
efficiency measures that have been delivered by the industry over the last few years and the success of our 
own LED light bulb replacement service), partially offset by an increase in telephony revenues due to higher 
prices, more services, and a greater proportion of customers taking fibre broadband.
We received £71.1m in cash for our 20% stake in Opus Energy Group Limited (‘Opus’) following its 
acquisition by Drax Plc in February 2017; this transaction generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m 
which is included in our results for the year, alongside a contribution of £2.2m from our share of its profit 
up to the date of disposal.
Dividend
In line with previous guidance, we are proposing a final dividend of 25p (2016: 24p), bringing the total for 
the year to 48p (2016: 46p); this represents an increase of 4.3% compared with last year, and will be paid 
on 28 July 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7 July 2017 subject to approval 
by shareholders at the Company’s AGM which will be held on 20 July 2017. We remain committed to a 
progressive dividend policy consistent with the underlying strong cash generation of our business.
Proposed Share Buyback
We previously announced our intention to carry out a tender offer this summer, under which we would seek 
to return to shareholders the cash we received from the sale of our stake in Opus; we have now decided to 
reduce the maximum size of this tender offer to £25m. 
This will provide greater flexibility for the Company to take advantage of the strategic opportunities that 
we expect to arise over the next few years, resulting from the rapidly changing political and regulatory 
environment for the services we supply.
Full details of the tender offer will be included with the AGM documents which will be sent to all 
shareholders shortly.  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 6
Churn
Our churn remains significantly below prevailing industry levels, and we are encouraged by the clear 
downward trend that has started to develop since last autumn. We attribute this to a combination of factors 
including a reduction in the gap between standard variable tariffs and introductory deals, increased 
investment by us in retention activities, and the steadily improving quality of our customer base. It is 
particularly encouraging that this has been achieved against an industry background which has seen 
record numbers of households switching their energy supplier over recent months.
Proposed Energy Price Cap
It is encouraging that both the major political parties included a commitment in their recent General Election 
manifestos to address one of the main issues within the energy industry, namely the practice by many large 
suppliers of using the higher margins earned on disengaged legacy customers to offer significantly cheaper 
deals which are only available to those who switch. If implemented, we believe these manifesto proposals will 
create a fairer energy market, with lower energy bills for millions of disengaged households who are currently 
paying more than they should, simply because (for whatever reason) they are not switching supplier on a 
regular basis.
In particular, we do not share the view widely expressed by some of the other large suppliers that a 
widespread cap on standard variable tariffs will be damaging to competition, as the wide choice of 
attractively priced tariffs from the vast majority of independent suppliers who do not exploit their customers 
in this way would remain available. Indeed, the only tariffs that might cease to be available will be the 
relatively small number which are being unfairly cross-subsidised by those who are shouting the loudest 
against this proposal.
In our view, the protection of disengaged consumers requires such an absolute cap to be retained over the 
medium term (albeit that it will need to be reviewed on a regular basis and set at a level which enables 
efficient suppliers not engaged in predatory pricing to earn a reasonable margin), or replaced in due 
course by a long-term relative price cap as suggested recently by John Penrose MP and endorsed by many 
independent suppliers.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
We are encouraged by the results from the soft launch of our Home Insurance service. We anticipate 
volumes will start to improve from their current low levels as we start marketing this new service more 
pro-actively, and remain confident that Insurance has the potential to make a material contribution to the 
financial performance of the group in due course.
The downward trend in energy prices which has prevailed for over three years has started to reverse, with 
rising commodity prices being accompanied by higher regulatory, distribution and policy costs. This has 
led to higher retail prices for both standard variable tariffs and fixed price introductory deals, albeit that the 
gap between them has narrowed. Although undoubtedly positive for us, this gap still remains significantly 
wider than we would have liked, due partly to the continuing practice by some suppliers of simultaneously 
offering both an expensive Standard Variable Tariff (‘SVT’) and a cheap introductory fixed price deal, and 
also the decision by a number of new suppliers to price their energy at near zero gross margin in order to 
attract market share.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
CONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 7
The energy market remains polarised between the ‘Big 6’, who are broadly maintaining or increasing 
profitability whilst losing customers, and a rapidly increasing number of independent suppliers at the 
other end of the spectrum, who are largely gaining market share but (almost without exception) incurring 
significant losses whilst doing so. All of these market participants are reliant on the same wholesale costs 
and use similar distribution channels (namely price comparison sites and bulk switching initiatives) to attract 
customers who generally choose their new supplier based predominantly on price and, in many cases, 
will switch again as soon as they reach the end of their introductory fixed-price period. And although new 
suppliers enjoy a significant initial cost advantage by being exempt from certain policy costs, these cease 
to apply as they gain scale. We find it difficult to understand how in the face of these market dynamics, this 
multitude of sub-scale competitors can develop a viable long-term business model.
Project Daffodil, our innovative free LED light bulb replacement service, has gathered momentum over the 
course of the year, and has now been provided in over 40,000 households. We are now installing free 
light bulbs in around 3,500 households each month; this is available to both new and existing Members 
who have switched their energy and telephony services to us. Daffodil reduces household electricity usage 
for the vast majority of Members receiving this benefit, which goes a long way towards narrowing the gap 
between our energy prices and the introductory tariffs available elsewhere; this has been a major factor 
behind the improvement in the quality of new Members joining the Club, as well as encouraging existing 
Members to add additional services in order to take advantage of this valuable benefit.
In March, we launched a number of films featuring Joanna Lumley as the new face of Utility Warehouse, 
explaining who we are and the benefits we provide to those looking to save money (by joining as a new 
Member) or make money (by becoming a Partner). These new tools were well received, and we have since 
seen an encouraging increase in the number of new Partners joining the business.
We have also taken steps to simplify our customer proposition, replacing the previous choice of benefits 
available to Double Gold Members with an extra 10% discount on the fixed monthly cost of their 
broadband (including landline rental) worth between £31.80 and £46.79 per year.
The mobile app we launched around 12 months ago has gained widespread acceptance, with around 
65,000 Members using it each month to submit meter readings, top-up their mobile and/or CashBack card, 
track their mobile usage, and find their nearest CashBack retail outlets; further functionality will be added in 
due course, including being able to manage their insurance cover.
Our smart meter roll-out programme has been hampered by the persistent failure of one of our meter 
operators (“MOP”) to meet their agreed service levels; in addition to slowing our rollout programme, this 
also affected our ability to install pre-payment meters in a significant part of the country during the second 
half of the year, leading to a temporary small rise in delinquency levels. Notwithstanding these challenges, 
we have now appointed a new MOP to take over this work, and successfully installed over 100,000 meters 
(around 10% of our current base).
We continue to increase our investment in IT and have completed a number of important IT projects during 
the year including strengthening our cyber-defences, PCI compliance, launching Home Insurance, and 
preparing for the mass rollout of smart metering. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 8
By virtue of our unique route to market and focus on treating our Members fairly, we have found a balance 
which combines sustainable growth in both service numbers and profitability, thus creating real long term 
value for all our stakeholders. We remain focussed on growing our business to one million households (and 
beyond) over the medium term.
ROUTE TO MARKET
Significant numbers of new Partners continued to join the business during the year, with an improvement 
in both the quality and quantity of new recruits since our annual sales conference in March. At the year 
end we had 41,717 registered Partners; this was below the level we reported 12 months ago largely due 
to our decision last autumn to start providing automatic refunds to many of those who join the business, 
but find themselves unable (for whatever reason) to take advantage of the opportunity we offer to build an 
attractive and secure part-time additional income. These early automatic refunds, combined with the natural 
underlying level of cancellations we would normally expect to see after 12 months, led to a larger reduction 
in the total number of registered partners over the period than would otherwise have occurred.
Whilst it is more challenging for Partners to gather new Members and build their Utility Warehouse 
businesses when there are such large pricing differentials in the energy markets, we have been pleased to 
see many of them still achieve significant success during the year by focussing on the unique strengths of 
our proposition and the exclusive benefits we offer. 
We have invested in providing them with new tools to help them meet this challenge, including the new 
suite of films featuring Joanna Lumley, as well as continuing to improve the personal development and 
training programmes we make available, free of charge, to both new and existing Partners. 
It is encouraging that despite the absence of ‘loss leader’ introductory deals for new Members, the combined 
impact of our improved training courses, effective Partner incentive structure, the unique multi-service 
proposition and attractive benefits we offer to our Members, means we are continuing to see a consistently 
high proportion of new Partners making a successful start to building their Utility Warehouse business. 
BOARD CHANGES
We were delighted to welcome Andrew Blowers as a new independent non-executive director, who joined 
the Board in November. Andrew is currently a non-executive director of AA PLC, the UK’s leading provider 
of roadside assistance, and of CETA Insurance Limited, a specialist online insurance provider. His career 
spans over 25 years in the UK financial services industry, including as founder and CEO of Swiftcover.com, 
Chairman of IIC NV, and an executive director of Churchill Insurance. He is already bringing a valuable 
new perspective to the Board.
As previously reported, Julian Schild, became Chairman of the Audit Committee following the retirement 
of Michael Pavia at last year’s AGM. Andrew Blowers has replaced Julian as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, and Beatrice Hollond has become Chair of the Nomination Committee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) encourages the Chairman to report personally on how 
the principles in the Code relating to the role and effectiveness of the Board have been applied.
As a Board we are responsible to the Company’s shareholders for delivering sustainable shareholder value 
over the long term through effective management and good governance. A key role of mine, as Executive 
Chairman, is to provide strong leadership to enable the Board to operate effectively. 
We believe that open and rigorous debate around key strategic issues and risks faced by the Company is 
important in achieving our objectives and the Company is fortunate to have non-executive directors with 
diverse and extensive business experience who actively contribute to these discussions. 
Further detail of the Company’s governance processes and compliance with the Code is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Statement. 
OUTLOOK
Recent Trading
Our annual sales conference took place on 18/19 March 2017, and was attended by over 5,000 Partners. 
At the event, we announced the launch of our Home Insurance service to Members, the introduction of new 
films featuring Joanna Lumley, and a simplification to our ‘Double Gold’ bundle making it more competitive 
and easier to promote. 
Since making these changes, the quality of new Members being gathered by Partners has remained 
exceptionally high, with over 50% switching all their services to us. The number of new Members is running 
slightly ahead of the levels we saw during the corresponding period last year, and we are also seeing 
encouraging numbers of new Partners joining the business.
Energy Prices
Following an extended period in which falling energy commodity prices outweighed the additional costs 
of renewing and extending the distribution network, replacing nuclear and coal-fired generating plants 
that are approaching the end of their useful lives, rolling-out smart meters, funding capacity incentives, 
and paying for the various renewable energy programmes which have been introduced, wholesale energy 
prices have increased significantly since last autumn. This has exerted significant upward pressure on retail 
energy prices, with both standard variable prices and the cheapest introductory deals having increased by 
around £90 and £140 respectively for a typical domestic customer.
It appears that the incoming Government is committed to introducing a widespread cap on standard 
variable tariffs. Whilst the timing of implementation, the level at which the cap would be set, and the 
specific details of whom it would affect are unclear, we strongly welcome this proposal as we believe it 
will create a fairer energy market and make it more difficult for suppliers with large legacy bases to use 
the profits they are earning from disengaged customers to fund cheap introductory deals to those who are 
switching. Whilst the gap between SVTs and the cheapest introductory deals is likely to narrow, the market 
will remain highly competitive, and there are many suppliers who will be unaffected by the proposed price 
cap who will be able to continue offering attractive tariffs to those looking to switch. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2017 10
Our wholesale arrangements, retail pricing structure and low cost base mean the impact of this price cap 
(when implemented) on our profitability is likely to be significantly less than other major suppliers.
Regulatory
The Competition and Markets Authority published their final report on the domestic energy market during 
the year. Whilst we welcomed their proposals to remove the current restrictions on discounts, bundling, and 
the number of tariffs each supplier can offer, we believe they are fundamentally misconceived in believing 
their proposed database of disengaged customers will achieve anything other than greater bureaucracy, 
more costs and increased confusion. We hope this proposal will be quickly abandoned once the mooted 
price cap on standard variable tariffs takes effect. 
Our programme to roll out smart meters for all our Members is well underway, with around 100,000 
(largely dual fuel) meters having been installed by the beginning of June 2017. The programme is expected 
to gather pace over the coming months and we anticipate making good progress this year towards the 
2020 target date. As previously highlighted, the financial benefits from this programme (excluding any 
timing differences which may arise between when costs are incurred and when they are recovered) will 
depend on the speed and efficiency of our roll-out relative to other suppliers. However, the continuing 
delays in finalising the specification of SMETS2 meters, in getting them certified, and in the smart Data 
Communications Company (‘DCC’) testing schedule, have led many commentators to question whether the 
original target completion date for this programme is still achievable, and the level of fulfilment costs (which 
will ultimately be borne by consumers) from trying to do so. 
We remain concerned at the high and increasing costs imposed on the industry in order to comply with 
government policy, much of which seems to be imposed with inadequate thought given to delivering such 
initiatives in a way that will minimise costs, which ultimately get passed on by suppliers to customers 
through higher bills. Examples include the current faster switching initiative, the Green Deal programme, the 
establishment of Smart Energy GB, the structure of the smart meter roll-out programme, the over-engineering 
of the specification for the DCC, and the unrealistic time-frames which are invariably adopted for any 
industry change. 
Regulation has an important role to play in ensuring the energy markets are operating in a transparent 
manner, creating a framework which encourages real competition, protecting the rights of consumers, 
and ensuring they receive a fair deal for their energy. However, it is not clear that the right balance has 
recently always been struck. There needs to be a clearer understanding of the need to reduce the burden of 
regulation which ultimately falls on those least able to afford it – namely domestic customers.
We are disappointed that deregulating the domestic water supply market was absent from the new 
Government’s manifesto; this would have created an exciting new opportunity for us to add the supply of 
water to the existing range of utilities we offer, further extending the benefits to consumers of our integrated 
multi-utility approach. We urge the Government not to miss the chance to introduce competition into this 
market, which would ultimately lead to more choice, lower prices and better service for over 27 million 
households who are currently forced to buy from a local monopoly water supplier.

Prospects
Successfully navigating the constant stream of changes flowing across all the sectors in which we operate is 
challenging, however our experienced senior management team have demonstrated a consistent ability to 
do so in a way which creates significant and growing value for all our stakeholders.
Our mobile proposition is currently more competitive than ever before, due to the imminent abolition of 
EU roaming charges, and the recent improvements we have made to data allowances for some Double 
Gold members. Combined with our recent award from Which? as the UK’s best provider of Broadband 
and Mobile services, these are expected to further reduce mobile churn and increase penetration over the 
coming year.
Sales of Home Insurance policies are expected to increase as we add further underwriters to our panel, 
and progressively start marketing this service to both new and existing Members over the course of the 
year. Whilst our ambitions for the current year are extremely modest, this service has the potential to make 
a material contribution to the business in due course.
Our strategy of achieving consistent high quality growth through delivering savings, simplicity and 
exceptional customer service continues to bear fruit. We have seen a significant improvement in the 
proportion of new Members who are switching all their services to us over the course of the last two years 
(from c.35% to over 50%); these better quality customers have the highest expected lifetime value, although 
they cost significantly more to acquire. Based on recent levels of Partner activity and membership churn, we 
anticipate the number of services we supply will increase by between 5% and 10% over the coming year. 
From a financial perspective, the modest growth in the number of services added over the last few 
years, combined with higher customer acquisition costs (due to both faster growth and better quality new 
Members), and an increasing investment in IT, mean that our adjusted pre-tax profits from continuing 
operations for the current financial year, as previously announced, are likely to be at a similar level to the 
year just ended. The benefit from faster organic growth will, if current trends continue, be reflected in our 
reported results for the following financial year.
In the meantime, and in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the steadily improving quality of our 
membership base and the good visibility it provides over future revenues and margins, means that we 
expect to increase our dividend to 50p per share for the current year. Our intention going forward is 
to bring our dividend pay-out ratio back to around 85% of adjusted EPS over the medium term, whilst 
maintaining our progressive dividend policy.
It only remains for me to thank my boardroom colleagues for their support and all our staff and Partners for 
their loyalty and hard work during the past year, and to wish each and every one of them success in the 
years to come.
