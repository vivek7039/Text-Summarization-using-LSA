 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
STATEMENT
CAPITALISE ON 
EXISTING AND FUTURE 
OPPORTUNITIES
Simon Litherland
Chief Executive Officer
This year we have continued to make good progress delivering 
our long-term strategic goals. The challenges we face in all our 
markets have been well documented, however our continued 
focus on meeting consumer needs, successfully executing our 
commercial plans and driving cost efficiency has translated into 
a strong full year performance. We have delivered revenue and 
margin growth and our adjusted EBITA* increased by 5.1%, 
enabling us to deliver an 8.2% increase in the full year dividend.
Generate profitable growth in our core markets
GB
The GB soft drinks market, as measured by Nielsen, has for the 
first time in several years seen value growth ahead of volume. 
Thanks to disciplined revenue management we have led the 
value growth in the soft drinks category and successfully 
protected our profitability in response to rising costs driven 
by underlying cost inflation and the weakening of sterling. 
Margins improved in the second half of the year following 
the implementation of revenue management changes.
In the carbonates category, we have continued to focus 
on no and low-sugar offerings. Despite a highly competitive 
grocery market, Pepsi MAX has continued to gain volume and 
value share and we have seen an excellent performance from 
the R Whites brand, following the introduction of a premium 
range last year. In GB stills, whilst we have seen a decline in 
revenue, our performance trajectory has improved year on 
year and, encouragingly, we have returned to volume growth. 
Robinsons and Fruit Shoot have faced pricing pressure in 
grocery, largely due to aggressive private label and branded 
competition. Whilst we anticipated a weaker final quarter, it 
was worse than expected due to the poor weather in July and 
August. Warm weather during the school holidays is particularly 
beneficial to our portfolio of still brands.
We have continued to benefit from a strong performance 
in our portfolio of immediate refreshment packs, while in 
the leisure channel we have won or retained major accounts 
such as Mitchells & Butlers, Marston’s and KFC.
Our recent innovations, which we believe offer significant 
future growth opportunities, have performed well and 
now represent 5.4% of total revenue. Purdey’s, a healthier, 
more natural energy drink, is resonating with consumers 
and increased its retail value by 55% this year. In the second 
half of the year we launched Robinsons Refresh’d and 
we are really pleased with its early performance, achieving 
£4m retail sales value in 19 weeks since launch. This 
ready-to-drink format offers naturally sourced ingredients 
and no added sugar, enabling consumers to enjoy tasty, 
healthy hydration at only 55 calories per bottle.
France
The soft drinks market, as measured by IRI, has remained 
subdued, reflecting both the poor summer weather and 
the continued impact of the consolidation of procurement 
by grocery retailers. Despite these headwinds, our revenues 
increased, driven by the growth of our branded portfolio. 
We have focused our juice brand marketing on the organic 
Pressade brand and have seen consumers respond positively 
to the introduction of the “Bonjour” range of breakfast time 
We have again demonstrated 
our ability to deliver both our 
short-term financial goals and 
our long-term strategic priorities 
in the face of a challenging 
external environment.

ANSWERS TOPICAL 
SHAREHOLDER QUESTIONS
How do you see the consumer environment, any 
adverse change in consumer behaviour this year?
We have yet to see any material change in consumer 
demand for our products in any of our sales channels 
in GB. In Ireland, the retail environment has remained 
deflationary and in France, the consumer environment 
has remained stable this year. The macroeconomic 
environment in Brazil has been challenging this year for 
consumer goods companies, and soft drinks has been 
affected as have many other categories. There is pressure 
on disposable incomes, unemployment has remained 
high and so people have been cutting back.
Why has proﬁ t after tax gone down?
Profit after tax is a statutory measure and takes into account 
one-off costs that have been incurred. In our case the bulk 
of these one-off costs relate to our business capability 
programme and cover things such as scrapping old assets 
and dual-running costs of old and new lines. Adjusted 
EBITA* which adjusts for these one-off costs generated 
growth of over 5%. 
Are you feeling more or less conﬁ dent on the 
prospects for Fruit Shoot in the USA than last year? 
We have made steady progress over the last 12 months, 
growing distribution and market share. As we head into 
2018 we are clear on our priorities of delivering consistent, 
quality in-store execution. Improving availability on-shelf, 
great feature and display as well as building awareness 
through sampling and trial are all key areas to focus on.
juices. In addition, Fruit Shoot has continued to grow, benefiting 
from the recent introduction of new flavour variants and the 
launch of a higher-juice Fruit Shoot range called Fruizeo, 
that uses spring water and has no added sugar. 
Ireland
The year has seen continued success in Ireland, with growth 
in both our own brand portfolio and the Counterpoint wholesale 
business. Growth in Counterpoint has been further boosted 
by additional business in Dublin following the successful 
completion of the acquisition of East Coast in January. Our 
owned brands, including Ballygowan and MiWadi, have grown 
whilst 7UP declined in a competitive lemon and lime category.
Realise global opportunities in kids, family and 
adult categories
After a very successful first year in Brazil, we have seen the 
well-publicised macro environment challenges have an adverse 
effect on consumer spending and FMCG categories. Our focus 
has been twofold. Firstly, we have looked to protect margins 
in the short term to ensure our business is well positioned 
now and for the future. We have increased prices to offset high 
cost inflation, yet continued to take share thanks to our strong 
in-store execution. Secondly, we have continued to invest in 
the long-term opportunities we see; we continued to expand 
our brand portfolio including continuing the roll out of Fruit 
Shoot, and we have extended our geographic reach through 
the acquisition of Bela Ischia, where we will exceed the 
planned R$10m cost synergies. We believe we are taking 
the right actions to build a strong, sustainable position for 
future long-term growth.
We continue to invest in our international business for 
long-term growth, and our efforts to improve the profitability 
of the business unit are delivering results. In the United States 
Fruit Shoot has made steady progress this year. We continue 
to work with PepsiCo to grow the presence of singles outside 
of the convenience & gas channel into areas such as foodservice 
and leisure. In the grocery channel, we are now lapping the 
first year of multi-pack in market. We have retained key listings 
and retailer feedback has been positive as we head into year 
two. The focus is to ensure we deliver the best experience in 
outlet. Alongside this we are working behind the scenes to 
optimise the supply chain framework to improve profitability. 
To date we have seen enough proof points to support our 
belief that there is a meaningful opportunity for us to invest in, 
but is still too early to call it a long-term success.
Continue to step-change our business capability
We are now two years into the three year business capability 
programme and this year we have a seen a significant amount 
of progress. Our Leeds site is now close to completion, 
with both the big and small PET lines up and running and 
the automation of the new warehouse due for completion in 
the coming months. Our London site is now fully operational 
with a new flexible PET line and on-site warehouse completed. 
The site that has seen the most change this year is Rugby, 
where we have installed three new can lines and started the 
groundworks for the new warehouse and aseptic line that will 
come on-stream next year. We are ahead of schedule on the 
delivery of benefits, with £3m feeding through to the bottom 
line in 2017.
In October, we announced the proposed closure of our 
Norwich site in 2019. Subject to completion of consultation, 
production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot is then proposed to 
transfer to our other GB sites, with additional PET lines proposed 
to be installed to accommodate this. We are fully committed 
to treating our employees fairly and with respect, and will 
be providing a full support package including redeployment, 
assistance to find jobs elsewhere and redundancy packages. 
Upon completion of the proposed works in early 2019, 
we will then be in a position to realise the full benefits of the 
programme from 2020 in line with previously stated guidance. 
As well as greater production efficiency, we will benefit from 
reduced distribution costs and will be able to unlock a working 
capital benefit by carrying lower inventory. Free cash flow 
conversion should accelerate significantly, as capital 
Purdey’s
Purdey’s was relaunched in 2016 to target the demand 
for a more natural energy drink. Purdey’s is a multivitamin 
juice drink that contains vitamins and natural botanicals to 
give a natural lift. It has performed well with consumers 
and increased its retail value by 55% this year. In 2017, 
we introduced Purdey’s in a 250ml can format, helping 
more people to thrive on the go.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
A strong performance for GB carbonates this year, 
especially Pepsi MAX, are you conﬁ dent you can 
repeat this next year?
2017 was an excellent year for our carbonates portfolio, 
especially Pepsi MAX. We extended the range with the 
launch of MAX Ginger and this combined with MAX Cherry 
has helped bring more consumers into the brand. 2018 is a 
difficult one to call with the arrival of the Soft Drinks Industry 
Levy (SDIL) in April. This is the single biggest event to impact 
the category in memory and brings with it a level of uncertainty 
as to how consumers will react to different prices on-shelf 
for higher and lower sugar products. What we do know for 
certain is that we have a great range of brands and offerings 
to offer consumers and we are working closely with our 
retail customers to minimise the impact.
Do you expect stills to be in growth next year?
Whilst Stills didn’t meet our expectations this year, it is an 
improved performance. For 2018 we have really exciting 
plans for GB stills that we’re confident will resonate with 
consumers. Robinsons is the nation’s most trusted soft 
drinks brand and we’re continuing to reinvigorate the brand, 
and are resetting the squash category into ‘good, better, 
best’ through Fruit Creations, aimed at older families, and 
a premium cordials range aimed at adults. J2O has a new 
look and feel to link with Spritz more clearly, and has an 
improved liquid which falls under the Soft Drinks Industry 
Levy. Fruit Shoot continues to evolve to target a wider 
range of occasions. There will be more to come on Fruit 
Shoot which we’ll talk to you about later in the year.
How is the business capability programme 
progressing?
Investment at our Leeds and London sites is nearing 
completion with only the automation of the warehouse 
at Leeds to be completed in the next couple of months. 
At these two sites we have generated both production 
and logistics benefits as the new lines run more efficiently 
and on-site warehousing reduces road miles. At our Rugby 
site we have installed three new can lines and groundworks 
have started for a new on-site warehouse and aseptic line. 
In 2017, we have generated £3m of benefits ahead of our 
original estimate of £1m this year. 
expenditure reduces to more normal levels from 2019 and 
benefits continue to accrue. The benefits go beyond cost 
savings and lower stock levels, as this state of the art network 
provides a broader range of pack sizes and configurations to 
enable our commercial teams to participate more effectively 
in the market. We continue to roll out the programme to other 
business units, with the closure of our Nangor Road distribution 
centre in Ireland and the outsourcing of logistics, and the saving 
of over £5m of overhead cost across the Group.
Build trust and respect in our communities
Being trusted and respected in our communities has been 
a core pillar of our strategy since 2013. We set ourselves 
stretching 2020 goals, reflecting the issues we face as a 
business and as a society more broadly. This year we have 
taken the opportunity to review our sustainable business 
programme to ensure that it is focused on the issues that 
matter most to our business and to our stakeholders. The 
result of this is a programme which focuses on three key areas 
where we believe we can make a real difference – Healthier 
People; Healthier Communities; and Healthier Planet. As part 
of our review, we have decided that from this year we will 
embed our sustainable business report into our Annual 
Report, reflecting the importance we attach to growing Britvic 
in a way that builds trust and respect with our stakeholders. 
Helping consumers make healthier choices has been a key 
plank of our sustainable business strategy since 2013. We 
have continued to make progress in this area through our 
three-pronged approach: reformulation with no compromise 
on taste or quality, through which we have removed over 
20bn calories from GB diets on an annualised basis; innovation, 
where our pipeline is heavily weighted towards low/no-sugar 
drinks which comprised of 68% of all projects across the

outside of GB
Robinsons Fruit Creations
In 2017 we launched Fruit Creations, 
containing twice the fruit of the core 
Robinsons range and more juicy and 
fruitier flavours created specifically 
for grown-up taste buds.
While April 2018 brings 
uncertainty with the 
introduction of the Soft Drinks 
Industry Levy in GB and 
Ireland, we are well placed 
to navigate it thanks to the 
strength and breadth of our 
brand portfolio and our 
exciting marketing and 
innovation plans. This, 
combined with our continued 
focus on revenue and cost 
management, means we 
remain confident of making 
further progress next year.

Group; and marketing responsibly through our Responsible 
Marketing Code, where we do not advertise high sugar 
products to under 16s and have led all advertising in relation to 
Pepsi with sugar-free MAX since 2005. By next April, 72% of 
our total portfolio and 94% of our owned brands will be below 
or out of scope of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in GB and 69% 
of our total portfolio and 79% of our owned brands in Ireland. 
Helping communities to thrive through being a good 
employer and good neighbour is the second plank of our 
sustainable business programme. This year our Great Place 
to Work Trust Index – our measure of how our employees 
feel about working at Britvic – rose for the fourth consecutive 
year to 75%. 
We have focused on minimising our impact on the 
environment through efficiency measures and new technology 
as part of our investment in the GB supply chain. Once fully 
commissioned our new lines will reduce our water and energy 
consumption, for example in our East London factory the new 
PET line runs at twice the capacity of the older lines and is 30% 
more energy efficient. We also eliminated over 300 tonnes 
of plastic bottle packaging in GB through our supply chain 
investment programme in 2017. 
Outlook
We have again demonstrated our ability to deliver both our 
short-term financial goals and our long-term strategic priorities 
in the face of a challenging external environment. 2018 brings 
the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in GB and 
Ireland. We recognise the significance of this event for the 
industry and the high level of uncertainty it will create in the 
short term. However, we have prepared well and, with our 
great portfolio of brands and our strong marketing and 
innovation plans, we believe we are well placed to navigate 
it. This, combined with our continued focus on revenue and 
cost management, including the benefits of the business 
capability programme, mean we feel confident of delivering 
further progress next year. Further forward, as the business 
capability programme approaches completion, we will see 
additional cost and cash flow improvements, creating a 
strong platform for an exciting future for Britvic.
