 I am delighted to present my first Chairman’s statement as a public company 
on behalf of the Board of GYG plc. 
2017 was a milestone year in the Group’s development, with a successful 
IPO on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange in July while also 
delivering another year of strong growth. The IPO raised £6.9m which was 
used to settle pre-existing shareholder loan notes, accrued interest and 
fees and expenses in relation to the IPO and by the end of the year, net 
debt had been reduced to ¤6.7m. Prior to the IPO, significant highlights 
included the acquisition of ACA Marine in March.
As such, our strengthened financial position provides us with  
a strong platform to support future growth and development 
of the Group. The enhanced credibility and profile that we have 
gained as a result of the IPO will continue to help us secure 
larger orders and develop further growth opportunities to 
generate long-term value for shareholders.
RESULTS
We have delivered solid revenue growth in the year, up 14.7%  
to ¤62.6m (FY16: ¤54.6m), reflecting a good performance 
across all divisions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% to ¤7.2m 
(FY16: ¤6.7m), with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%  
(FY16: 12.2%). We ended the year with a solid balance sheet 
and maintained cash at ¤6.2m at 31 December 2017 (¤6.2m at 
31 December 2016).
DIVIDEND
As stated in our Admission Document, the Board has adopted 
a progressive dividend policy with growth in line with the 
growth in future earnings and the Board is therefore pleased to 
recommend a total dividend of 3.2 pence per ordinary share 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, reflecting the 6 months 
from IPO to the financial year end. If approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 29 May 2018, 
the dividend will be paid on 15 June 2018 to shareholders  
on the register on 4 May 2018. The ex-dividend date will be  
3 May 2018.
CURRENT TRADING & OUTLOOK
We have had an encouraging start to 2018, with trading in line 
with the Board’s expectations. The Group had a busy first 
quarter in refit including a number of jobs that were pushed 
back by the 2017 hurricanes and has seen significant growth  
to the forward Order Book, having signed some major new 
build projects which will come on-stream later this year and 
during 2019 and 2020. Management are highly focused on 
delivering growth across the divisions in 2018, and the wider 
GYG team is strongly motivated to continue to deliver  
a premium quality service to our existing and new customers.  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our 
colleagues across the world for their continued hard work to 
deliver these results. The Group is well positioned to continue 
to create long-term value for all shareholders.
