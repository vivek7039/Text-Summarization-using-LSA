 2 MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017
Chairman’s Statement
Gleeson Homes exceeded 1,000 unit sales for the first time, 
increasing volumes by 12.1% to 1,013 units (2016: 904 units). 
Gross margins on plot sales strengthened to 33.0% as a result 
of changes to site mix, increase in selling prices and robust 
cost controls resulting in a 16.9% increase in operating profit 
to £22.8m (2016: £19.5m). Taking advantage of relatively 
low land prices in its target areas in the North of England, 
the division increased its land pipeline by 2,304 plots and  
24 sites. 
Gleeson Strategic Land increased operating profit by 17.6% 
to £12.0m (2016: £10.2m) by continuing to secure attractive 
residential planning consents and satisfying demand for 
development sites from both medium sized and large 
housebuilders.
Profit before tax increased by 17.0% to £33.0m (2016: 
£28.2m). Profit for the year attributable to equity holders  
of the parent company was £26.2m (2016: £23.0m). 
Earnings per share grew by 13.8% to 48.5p (2016: 42.6p). 
Return on capital employed increased by 220 basis points to  
25.4% (2016: 23.2%).
  
Market context
Demand for low cost homes in the North of England was 
very strong with long queues forming on launch days at new 
development sites. 
Affordability for low income families buying a Gleeson home 
remained attractive and mortgage availability continued 
to support the young first time buyers who make up a large 
proportion of Gleeson Homes buyers. 
The Government’s White Paper on housing, published in 
I am pleased to report a 
milestone year for volumes and 
another excellent year of growth 
in margins, profit and cash.

February 2017, was supportive of the approach to affordable 
housing on which Gleeson Homes’ business model is based 
and contains proposals which will, if adopted, make it easier 
for the division to secure planning permissions.
Gleeson Strategic Land continued to experience strong 
demand from both medium-sized and large housebuilders for 
consented land in high value areas in the South of England 
and attracted multiple bidders for all of its land sales. 
Land
We remain one of the few developers building low cost homes 
on brownfield sites in challenging communities and such 
sites continue to be available at relatively low cost. Gleeson 
Homes’ land pipeline grew by 2,304 plots and 24 sites to a 
record high of 141 sites (2016: 117), comprising 11,588 plots 
owned or conditionally purchased (2016: 9,284). The division 
will continue to commence building on sites as soon as a fully 
implementable planning permission is obtained.
Gleeson Strategic Land continued to source developable 
sites in the South of England. During the year it obtained 
planning consent on 6 sites; and entered agreements 
involving 6 new sites, potentially providing development 
opportunities on an additional 1,846 plots. Demand  
for prime sites with planning consent in the South of  
England from a wide range of housebuilders remains 
extremely strong. 
Employees
The Group’s strong performance during the year reflects the 
dedication and hard work of our employees.  
On behalf of the Board, I would like to congratulate and 
thank them very warmly indeed. MJ Gleeson plc: Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 3
The average number of employees during the year increased 
to 370 (2016: 314). The actual number of employees at the 
year-end was 405 (2016: 333). 
Dividends 
Reflecting the Group’s strong financial performance and 
our confidence in the prospects for the current year and 
beyond, the Board is recommending a final dividend for  
the year of 17.5 pence per share (2016: 10.0 pence per 
share). Combined with the interim dividend, this will give  
a total dividend for the year of 24.0 pence per share  
(2016: 14.5 pence per share), an increase compared to  
the previous year of 65.5%. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”), the final dividend will be paid on  
14 December 2017 to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 17 November 2017. The Board aims to maintain 
ordinary dividend cover between two and three times for 
the foreseeable future.
Summary
We have started the new financial year in a strong position. 
Robust customer demand and continuing site availability will 
allow Gleeson Homes to continue to grow volumes and profit. 
Following the achievement in June of the division’s interim 
target of 1,000 unit completions per annum, the Board has 
now set a new target of 2,000 unit completions per annum 
within 5 years. Meanwhile, Gleeson Strategic Land continues 
to experience strong demand for consented greenfield sites. 
Against this background, the Board is confident that the 
Group has significant scope to grow both revenue and profits 
in the current year and beyond.
