Biffa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholder
It is a pleasure to introduce Biffa’s first annual 
report, following the Group’s return to the 
public markets in October 2016. This was 
achieved in uncertain IPO market conditions 
in the aftermath of the widely unexpected 
Brexit result. The confidence shown in Biffa 
by existing and new shareholders alike was 
therefore hugely gratifying.
The Group Executive Team, ably led by CEO 
Ian Wakelin, have transformed the Group’s 
prospects in recent years; a relentless focus 
on customer retention and acquisition, 
operational delivery and safety has resulted  
in consistent improvements in profitability. 
A detailed business plan is in place to 
continue to drive Biffa’s growth over the 
coming years, both organically and through  
a selective pipeline of synergistic acquisitions 
in markets that we thoroughly understand. 
Biffa has an experienced and highly 
respected management team, around 7500 
dedicated employees and now also the 
capital structure is in place to continue to 
evolve the business over the coming years.
Biffa is in a good financial
position, with a robust
balance sheet and 
good cash generation
Steve Marshall – Chairman
Performance
The Group has delivered good full year 
results, which were fully in line with the 
Board’s expectations at the time of the IPO. 
Revenues of £990.4m were 6.8% ahead  
of prior year and Net Revenues
1
 rose 8.3%  
to £898.8m, driven by growth in our I&C, 
Municipal and RR&T divisions. Underlying 
Operating Profit
1
 rose 18. 1% to £73.8m  
with the Underlying Operating Profit margin 
increasing to 7 .5% from 6.7%, reflecting  
our ongoing focus on the optimisation of 
operations as well as growth. Year end  
Reported Net Debt
1
 was £246. 1m, and 
therefore below 2.0x Underlying EBITDA
1
. 
Ian Wakelin’s Chief Executive's Statement  
on pages 10 to 1 1 of this report covers the 
business performance across the Group in 
some detail, and also our strategic priorities.  
The Group’s financial reporting for the  
past year is made more complex by the 
refinancing and exceptional costs associated 
with the IPO. These and certain other items 
resulted in the Group reporting a statutory 
loss after tax of £10.9m (prior year £5. 1m) 
as explained in Michael Topham’s Financial 
Review on pages 24 to 25. As a result of 
these other items, the commentary in the 
Operating Review on pages 20 to 23 has 
utilised underlying performance measures.

Strategic Report
The Board of Biffa considers that health, 
safety and wellbeing is the highest priority 
within the business and is committed to 
keeping our people, our customers and  
the public safe by promoting high standards 
on all our sites, premises, and in all our 
activities detailed in pages 34 and 35 of this 
report. In the year, key safety performance 
measures, including statutory RIDDOR and 
Lost Time Injury (LTI)
1
 continued a long-term 
trend of improvement, equating to a three-fold 
reduction in accident rates over the past  
five years. 
Board, Corporate Governance  
and Employees
Your Board believes that the effective 
stewardship of the Group is enhanced  
by the wealth of experience and range of 
expertise of its members. Together, we are 
committed to building a stronger Group for 
the future and delivering sustainable value  
to our shareholders and improving services  
for customers. 
Our Governance Report sets out and 
explains the processes we have put in place 
to deliver long-term success whilst also 
ensuring that the Group complies with all 
applicable laws and regulations, and meets 
the requirements of our shareholders and
their representative bodies.
Ahead of the IPO in October 2016, we were 
pleased to welcome two new Non-Executive 
Directors to the Board, both of whom bring  
a significant breadth and depth of expertise  
in leading successful and growing listed 
companies. David Martin, who serves as 
Senior Independent Director, was previously 
Chief Executive of Arriva. Ken Lever, who  
was appointed Audit Committee Chair, was 
previously Chief Executive of Xchanging plc 
and Group Finance Director at Tomkins plc. 
My thanks to Ken and David, to other Board 
colleagues and above all to the Group 
Executive Team for their very considerable 
commitment to Biffa over the last 12 months. 
Achieving a successful IPO whilst maintaining 
focus on driving the business forward, is a 
considerable undertaking.
I would also like to thank the Group’s  
loyal employees for their hard work and 
commitment this year. We were pleased  
that employees also directly participated  
in Biffa’s listing through the receipt of free 
shares under the share-award scheme.  
This summer Biffa will also be launching  
a new Sharesave plan, offering  
employees the opportunity to participate  
in Biffa’s success going forward.
Capital Allocation
The Board is committed to ensuring the 
efficient allocation of capital. The Group has  
a strong balance sheet and has strong and 
predictable free cash flow generation. With  
a clear strategy for sustainable profitable 
growth, reinforced by strict controls over 
capital expenditure and good working capital 
management, the Board will continually 
review organic growth opportunities, value 
enhancing acquisitions and shareholder 
returns to ensure it operates with an  
optimal capital structure.
Dividend
As previously stated, the Board has adopted 
a progressive dividend policy that will balance 
shareholder returns with our commitment to 
investing for long-term growth. The Board is 
recommending a maiden dividend of 2.40 
pence per share, to cover the approximately 
five-month period since listing in October 
2016 to the end of the financial year 2017 . 
This is expected to be paid following receipt 
of approval to pay a dividend at our  
Annual General Meeting, (AGM) to be  
held in July 2017 .
In future years, the Group intends to pay 
interim dividends in December in the relevant 
financial year and final dividends in July of the 
following financial year, with the amount being 
paid in an approximate one-third (interim) and 
two-thirds (final) split. The Group intends to 
pay annual dividends based on a targeted 
dividend pay-out ratio of approximately 35% 
of consolidated annual Underlying Profit  
After Tax.

Together we will 
create further value 
by delivering 
against the Group’s 
strategic priorities”
Looking Forward
The Board anticipates that the next 12 
months will bring more opportunity and see 
further progress for Biffa. We have a strong 
management team in place and I am 
confident that together we will create further 
value by continuing to deliver against the 
Group’s strategic priorities. I look forward  
to the next stage of our journey.

Chairman
