Q&A with Interim 
Group Chief 
Executive 
Q. How would you describe current US B&GA market conditions?
A. The B&GA market is looking positive. It showed good growth in 
2017 – in the USA growth was 3.1% in the first half and 4.1% in 
the second – and, as we look into 2018, we are encouraged by a 
positive outlook for the US economy, with expected continued 
growth in GDP underpinned by tax reforms. Within the different 
customer segments, charter traffic demonstrated particularly 
strong year on year growth. 
 In the first half of the year, Signature grew in line with the market 
despite the short-term impact of combining the two commercial 
books of Landmark and Signature and transitioning key customers 
onto new commercial agreements. In the second half, we 
outperformed a more buoyant B&GA market as the new commercial 
agreements bedded down and new traffic patterns established. 
Q. What is the enlarged Signature network capable of?
A. Signature now has 198 locations across the world. Of the top 200 
B&GA airports in the US, Signature is present at locations where 
68% of fuel is burned, and we are located at key B&GA centres 
outside the US, in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. These 
are in the places that our customers want to fly to and where they 
know they will receive the same industry-leading service from our 
highly trained Signature team. We have built relationships with these 
customers and we continue to invest in the quality of experience and 
in the quality and range of our infrastructure, our service offering 
and our technology, so that they continue to choose Signature. Our 
goal is to continue to grow operating profit ahead of the market.
Q. How does Aftermarket Services fit with the Group going forward?
A. Ontic offers us scalable investment opportunities that have an 
attractive return on invested capital and enable us to grow our 
portfolio of IP-protected products. The team has demonstrated 
real diligence and expertise on the evaluation of prospective 
licences and we are now regarded as a trusted counterparty for 
maturing and legacy aircraft parts that are either replaced through 
wear and tear or as part of regular service cycles. Furthermore, 
as our scale has increased, our key OEM partners have shown 
an increased willingness to grow their relationships with us, as 
demonstrated by the steady stream of new licence deals we have 
agreed, particularly in the latter part of 2017 . As we announced 
on 1 March 2018, we are currently conducting a strategic review 
of the ERO business, although there is no certainty that this will 
result in a transaction being agreed. Strategic Report

Q. What would you say are the priorities of the new Group  
Chief Executive?
A. BBA Aviation completed its annual strategic review and goal 
setting process at the end of 2017 and our goals have been 
cascaded throughout the Group. As a member of the Executive 
Management Committee, Mark has been deeply involved in the 
process and, as Group Chief Executive, he will take responsibility 
for delivering them. Having spent ten years with BBA Aviation in 
a range of senior roles he has a detailed knowledge of how the 
business works and will be able to hit the ground running.
 I have no doubt that his key priority will be to maintain the 
momentum that we have achieved in recent years – not just 
in business performance but in all the underlying things that 
contribute to it: our focus on service and growing our offer to the 
customer; our focus on understanding the customer through 
better use of data; and the deployment of new technology to 
improve our processes and make us more efficient operators. In 
this regard, Mark has been a key facilitator of our recent investment 
in Victor, a leading on-demand private jet charter company, where 
we will explore, in partnership, cutting edge ways to better serve 
the passengers, operators and aircraft owners using our network. 
And, finally, that we continue to deploy capital wisely.
 Mark shares my determination to ensure that BBA Aviation is a 
safe place to work and a great place to work and that we remain 
committed to being a responsible company. This is valued by our 
employees and by potential employees and we want to make sure 
that we continue to attract and retain the best talent. 
Q. What can you say about the review of BBA Aviation’s  
capital structure?
A. BBA Aviation is now predominantly focused on the B&GA 
market. It was therefore appropriate that we reviewed our capital 
requirements and leverage appetite ready for the next stage of our 
development. Our cash generation characteristics are very strong 
and we believe an increase in our leverage range is appropriate, 
hence the increase in the range to 2.5x–3.0x. We ended the 2017 
financial year towards the bottom end of this range.
 We will continue to deploy capital where we see the opportunity 
to generate good risk-adjusted returns and our investment 
priorities are focused on delivering organic underlying operating 
profit growth above B&GA market growth and investing in bolt-on 
acquisitions and IP licensing arrangements at Ontic. The Group 
remains disciplined in its approach to the allocation of capital, with 
the overriding objective being to enhance shareholder value. 
 The Board has a progressive dividend policy with the aim of 
increasing dividends in line with long-term underlying growth in 
earnings. Any surplus cash after satisfying the investment  
opportunities of the business and funding dividends will be 
returned to shareholders.
Q. Of what are you most proud?
A. I have greatly enjoyed this period as Interim Group Chief Executive. 
Of course, I knew the business well having been a member of 
the Board since 2013, but this role has given me a completely 
different perspective. I am extremely proud of our people – they 
have truly risen to the challenge and delivered in what has been a 
very busy year. Their energy, their commitment, their integrity and 
their focus on the goal has got us to where we are today and has 
established the momentum that we take into 2018.
 I am also very proud that we have proven we can deploy a large 
tranche of capital very effectively. Landmark was a large and truly 
transformational addition to the Group and has been integrated 
very successfully, putting us in a great position to move forward.
