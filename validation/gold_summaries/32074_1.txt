Strategy
This year we continued to focus on implementing 
our strategic plan, broadening our appeal to 
organisations hungry for data analytics, broader 
data insights and increasing the number of 
strategic partners. In addition, this year we also 
included looking into a “buy and build” strategy 
to identify new and alternative technologies that 
were available in the market for managing and 
handling complex unstructured data solutions 
to sit alongside our structured data capabilities.
During the year we made new investments 
in developing our product suite on the RAPid 
platform, adding new tools and functionality 
to the mix whilst ensuring the RAPid platform is 
scalable and user friendly and provides a satisfying 
user experience for our partners and clients. 
We also invested funds in the development of 
an HR analytics product suite utilising the core 
technologies from our other applications and 
demonstrating the versatility of the platform.
We continued to focus the funds raised at IPO 
to increase our sales capabilities. Recruitment 
of quality people with the requisite knowledge 
and experience continues to be a challenge, 
but we have maintained our sales headcount 
levels through the year, and where possible will 
continue to add to the sales and partnership 
business development teams necessary to fulfil 
the Company’s growth ambitions. As an offset, 
we have been able to reduce the development 
and administration overhead which has led to 
an overall decrease in the number of employees 
compared to previous years.
This year we struggled to deliver revenue 
growth; this was predominantly caused 
through a decrease in our partner revenues as 
our key strategic partner in the US completed 
a business transformation, reducing our 
revenues considerably over the year. In addition, 
we suffered a number of smaller partners 
in Europe closing their business or failing. 
Whilst the majority of revenues came from 
our direct sales team, we are starting to build 
considerable traction through our partnership 
strategy introduced last year, particularly in 
the US. We have developed a number of new 
partnership agreements and continue to roll 
this programme out around the globe. The 
Board has not wavered on the belief that this 
strategic diversification of the revenue stream 
is important to attaining our targets and will 
enable us to accelerate our route to market. 
In addition to these activities, prior to the year 
end, we announced our intention to purchase 
100% of the share capital of Integritie (UK) Limited 
This transaction completed on 16 May 2017 
and provides the Company with the opportunity 
to deliver a total data solution to our clients 
and partners.
Outlook
Since the year end we have completed our 
strategic investment in Integritie (UK) Limited 
and raised additional cash to enable us to take 
the Company through to positive EBITDA. 
We continue to make investments in growing 
the RAPid platform capabilities, including the 
onboarding of the Integritie suite of products 
(Knowledge Capture), enabling us to transform 
a number of on-premise solutions for those 
clients who are now wishing to move towards 
a cloud environment. 
Our new products, although beyond our 
traditional spend and procurement environment, 
sit alongside the RAPid offering and enable clients 
to achieve a more holistic view of their enterprise 
data and also to tie many document and ERP 
formats together. Whilst spend continues to be 
the backbone of our revenue streams we are 
seeing developments in the market that enable 
us to expand our offerings to include services 
covering compliance, complaints, workflow 
management, risk, corporate social responsibility 
and people. We are excited about the new 
opportunities these products and the acquisition 
offer to our current sales channel, our clients 
and our partners’ clients. 
Our deepening relationship with Microsoft 
ensures that our product remains at the cutting 
edge of technological development, enabling 
scale and efficiencies to be achieved at the best 
possible cost. Microsoft recognised the RAPid 
platform as one of the top cloud-based platform 
products in October 2016 and also recognised 
Rosslyn as a preferred partner, issuing us with 
their “Co-Sell Recommended Partner” status, 
a significant achievement for us.
In addition we have signed a number of new 
contracts. Notable amongst this new business 
are the contracts with major global businesses 
both in the US and Europe, which have brought 
a highly diversified client base and provide us 
with excellent opportunities to demonstrate 
the value of the RAPid platform to our partners 
and clients. I look forward with confidence 
to the 2017–18 financial year. 
We are seeing the benefits from the investments 
that we have made and the product suite is 
becoming extremely well known and competitive 
in the market. I would like to join John O’Hara 
in thanking our employees, without whom 
none of this would be possible.
