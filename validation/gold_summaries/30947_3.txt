 Chairman’s statement
Fit for an exciting  
future of growth
I am delighted with the progress made operationally and geologically  
in 2017 as well as with our long-term goal of balance sheet optimisation. 
This has been demonstrated with our enviable track record of meeting 
our production and cost forecasts, as well as the delivery of our 
ambitious brownfield exploration programme which we believe  
is now starting to bear fruit.
Whilst a complex permitting situation in Peru  
and unpredictable precious metal prices have  
at times impacted both the management of our 
core assets and our ability to execute our drilling 
campaigns, Hochschild Mining has maintained a 
consistent strategy over the last few years which 
places geological expertise at the heart of how 
we manage our deposits and how we generate 
further low cost organic growth in the long-term. 
The Board is pleased, therefore, to be able to 
recommend an increased final dividend of 
$1.965 cents per share.
Operationally we were able to continue to grow 
our output, reaching another Company record in 
2017 with key contributions from Inmaculada 
and San Jose (both production records) and a 
vastly improved performance at Pallancata. With 
a positive gold price performance, we were still 
able to generate solid cash flow throughout the 
year despite a fall in profitability due to a rise in 
overall costs. With regards to our balance sheet, 
we took a decisive step in January 2018 with the 
early redemption of the high yield bonds, issued 
in 2014 to finance the construction of 
Inmaculada, using existing cash and lower

mining methods may change but our commitment to safety 
remains constant and is one of our values which we are not 
willing to compromise.”

cost local Peruvian debt. We are now in  
an advantageous financial position with a 
manageable debt profile and the firepower to 
meet the requirements of our brownfield and 
greenfield programmes, consider acquisitions 
and continue to return capital to shareholders.
T owards the end of the year we started to 
receive some positive results from our 
brownfield drilling campaigns. In particular, 
I would like to mention the geological 
developments at Inmaculada which have 
confirmed our long-held confidence in the 
prospectivity of the district and I look forward 
to the team continuing to add high quality 
resources in 2018 and beyond. The majority of 
our assets are still underexplored and following 
positive changes to the permitting process in 
Peru, I believe that our organic growth 
programme is beginning to gain real momentum. 
Furthermore, it is pleasing to see an increasing 
number of greenfield targets come through the 
pipeline as well as some earn-in joint venture 
opportunities being evaluated.

Where we are
Hochschild has grown its production 
since 2012 by almost 90% and in that 
time we have reduced our costs by 
over 40%. We are still focusing on 
organic growth whether through our 
ambitious brownfield exploration 
programme at our current mines or 
through greenfield prospects spread 
across the Americas.
We made solid progress in 2017 with our 
brownfield aims – undertaking mapping 
and geophysics studies, securing surface 
drilling permits from the Peruvian 
government and subsequently starting 
our drilling campaigns at Arcata, 
Inmaculada and San Jose.
Safety and environment
As mentioned in my statement last year, an 
accident at the Inmaculada mine early in 2017 
resulted in two fatalities. With great regret, we 
disclosed that a second accident occurred at the 
Arcata mine in July 2017 which also claimed the 
lives of two colleagues. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to again convey our deepest 
condolences to the families of the victims 
involved. Our resolve to make Hochschild Mining 
a safe place to work is as strong as ever and 
management has responded by instigating a 
wide-ranging programme to reinforce our safety 
culture which: includes senior management 
reviewing all high-risk activities; involves even 
more frequent training; focuses on initiatives 
to motivate and incentivise safe working; and 
implements the most up-to-date safety risk 
management information systems. Over the 
course of a mine’s life, geological conditions  
and mining methods may change but our 
commitment to safety remains constant and  
is one of our values which we are not willing 
to compromise.
Our focus on environmental performance 
continues to be one of our key priorities. During 
2017, we introduced a new environmental 
corporate objective as part of the Company’s 
overall Performance Objectives Plan (the base 
for calculating employee bonuses), which has 
historically been only based on production, 
safety and financial indicators. We believe that 
this new objective will help us in further 
promoting a strong environmental culture, 
achieve our goal of operating with the least 
environmental footprint possible and generate 
long-term value for our stakeholders.
Our people
Our employees are pivotal to the Company’s 
performance and, to them, I wish to express my 
gratitude for their contribution in making 2017  
a record year of profitable production. I also wish 
to thank my fellow Board colleagues for their 
support over the year. I am delighted that 
Dionisio Romero Paoletti joined the Board at the 
start of the year as a Non-Executive Director, 
bringing a wealth of business experience in Peru 
and internationally. Finally, I wish to express the 
Board’s utmost gratitude to Enrico Bombieri 
who, having served as a Non-Executive Director 
since 2012 and as Senior Independent Director 
for four years, retired at the end of 2017.
Outlook 
After an encouraging year for metal prices in 
2017, particularly for gold, the prospects for 
precious metals in 2018 remain strong with 
robust global equity markets and inflation on the 
rise. We are aiming to continue our long-term 
growth strategy based around low cost 
brownfield investment, selective greenfield 
exploration and a targeted approach to 
acquisitions. Safety, operational excellence  
and cost control will remain of paramount 
importance and we will also continue repaying 
debt as and when the opportunity arises.
