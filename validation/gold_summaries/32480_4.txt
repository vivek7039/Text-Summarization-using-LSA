Yorkshire Water at a Glance
We provide some of life’s 
most essential services to the 
people and businesses of the 
Yorkshire and Humberside 
region, playing a key role in 
the region’s health, wellbeing 
and prosperity.
We do this by supplying water and waste water services, 
and being custodians of essential infrastructure and the 
natural environment.
We do all of this for about £1 a day for the average  
customer, amongst the lowest water and waste water  
bills in the country.
