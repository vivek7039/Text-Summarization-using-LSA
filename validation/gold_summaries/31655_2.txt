Driving LFL growth by attracting new 
customers, increasing the frequency 
of visits of existing customers and 
raising the spend per game.
In FY2017 , our LFL revenue grew by 3.5 per cent. 
Games volumes were up 3.1 per cent with spend 
per game up 0.5 per cent. Our approach is to 
increase dwell time and gain a greater share 
of customers’ leisure spend as well as drive 
game volumes in our centres.

Continued unrelenting focus on improving the customer 
experience through planned investments in technology, 
training our people, marketing and ensuring we have 
the right products available.
Refurbishment 
programme
Our refurbishment programme 
generates improved sales and 
profitability at existing centres 
through investment in the bowling 
experience (including the introduction 
of VIP lanes), new external signage, 
an upgraded bar offer and the 
introduction of the new Hollywood 
Diner concept. These upgrades 
attract new customers, drive game 
volumes, support higher prices and 
encourage a higher spend per game.
In FY2017 we refurbished/rebranded ten 
centres and have an average return on 
investment (ROI) greater than 33 per cent. We 
have between seven and ten refurbishments 
planned for FY2018 and we are confident 
we can continue to deliver above ROI 
expectations as we continue to roll out 
our family-focused model.

Continue to enhance our existing estate so we deliver a

Conversion of the 
Bowlplex estate
Following the acquisition of Bowlplex 
in December 2015, 11 centres 
became part of the Group. We will 
refurbish and rebrand these centres 
as Hollywood Bowl, bringing them in 
line with the higher standards across 
the remainder of the Group’s estate.
We refurbished and rebranded four Bowlplex 
centres in FY2017. The average revenue for the 
Bowlplex centres has increased to £1.81m from 
£1.69m in the prior year.

We have now refurbished and rebranded seven Bowlplex

centre for FY2017 was £1.81m – an increase of 7.1 per cent over 
the prior year. The final four Bowlplex centres will be rebranded 
in FY2018.
Development of 
new centres and 
acquisitions
There are significant growth 
opportunities via new-build centres 
and from the acquisition and 
rebranding of bowling sites 
from other operators.
Southampton opened in December 2016, 
Derby in April 2017 and The London O2 in 
June 2017. These centres have delivered 
higher than expected returns.
Dagenham opened in October 2018. We have 
signed for a new centre in Liverpool, and also 
with intu in Watford and Lakeside. All plan 
to open in 2019. We also have a number of 
other key opportunities in advanced stages 
of negotiation.

This year, we opened three new centres, in fantastic locations, 
which are all performing above expectations. We will continue to 
expand our estate and look for profitable opportunities to grow, 
opening an average of two new centres per annum, dependent 
on meeting our acquisition criteria and rental expectations.
Focus on People
Our people underpin our business. 
Attracting and retaining top talent 
is a key priority for the Group.
This year we ran our Centre Manager and 
Assistant Manager In Training programme. We 
introduced a new talent programme, ‘Senior 
Leadership Development’. The success of 
these programmes is clear: in FY2017, 52 
management positions were filled internally, 
a 10.6 per cent increase on FY2016.
