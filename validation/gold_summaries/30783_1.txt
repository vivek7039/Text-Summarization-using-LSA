Operational Review
2017 marked a strong year of growth for Alpha,
both in revenue and in our investment in staﬀ
and infrastructure.
During the year, we increased our client numbers
by 39%, bringing our total number of clients to
310. Pleasingly, the fact that our revenue has
grown at a higher percentage is a reﬂection of the
larger trades that we are doing and the increasing
size of our clients. 
We will continue to focus on growing our client
base by penetrating our existing corporate
marketplace in the UK, alongside continued
expansion into the institutional marketplace and
overseas sectors.
Europe in particular presents a very exciting area
of expansion for us. During the ﬁnancial year we
have recruited staﬀ for our London oﬃce who are
ﬂuent in foreign languages which has enabled us
to steadily expand into select European
territories. As a result, we successfully onboarded
our ﬁrst European clients in the second half of
the ﬁnancial year.
Whilst we are constantly looking for ways to
acquire new clients, we remain dedicated to
providing the very best levels of service to our
existing client base. To ensure this, my co-founder
Jon Currie has recently moved into a role focused
on enhancing our service delivery and is working
collaboratively with our clients to improve our
customer insights and perpetuate our high levels
of client retention. Further operational progress
was made with the expansion of our FX Analysis
team and through obtaining regulatory approval
to sell derivative products. As well as providing
additional beneﬁts to our existing clients, both
developments will undoubtedly increase our
appeal to prospective clients.
Aside from penetrating our traditional corporate
marketplace, we have targeted the institutional
and funds marketplace, which presents a valuable
growth opportunity for Alpha. As such, we have
created a team with a wealth of experience in
institutional FX and tailored our technology and
service solutions to meet investment managers’
speciﬁc and increasingly complex needs.
Throughout the course of this year we have also
continued to invest in the ongoing development
of our technology platform which has proved to
be an important element of our advisory service
oﬀering and this will continue to be a focus
moving forward. Our online currency
management platform has been developed
in-house and we believe, aﬀords us a strong
Chief Executive’s Statement
“Everyone at Alpha passionately believes our IPO marked the start of
our journey, not the end. We took Alpha public to avoid the ‘destination
mentality’ and now have the opportunity to continue developing a very
special business.”

competitive advantage. It provides our clients with
a tailored and comprehensive overview of their
currency exposures and is subsequently allowing
them to manage and report on these exposures
more eﬀectively, whilst reducing the time and
costs involved in doing so. We believe that our
bespoke platform oﬀers customers a greater
insight into their hedging activities than our
competitors and has become a key diﬀerentiator
in a short space of time, helping us with both
customer acquisition and retention, as well as
margin protection. In light of this, we made the
important decision to migrate to a new Cloud
Application Platform in February 2018 which
oﬀers richer functionality, greater customisation
and increased scalability.
Technology is an important cornerstone of the
business and we have a strong technology
development roadmap in place, and further
functionality will be introduced during 2018 to
enhance the platform. A reﬂection of the
importance we place on our technology is the fact
that our team of developers has grown from 2 at
the start of the year to 9.
In December, we relocated our head oﬃce to
London to bring all our team under one roof in
order to support the unique culture which
ultimately underpins our success. We have
already seen the beneﬁts of a single, larger oﬃce,
with wider skill sharing, stronger relationships
being forged and a positive atmosphere of
camaraderie and collaboration.
People
When we listed Alpha in April, we underestimated
how inﬂuential it was going to be in helping us
acquire exceptional talent. Our plc status has
served as a testament to Alpha’s success and
future ambitions, enabling us to attract high
calibre individuals in a relatively short space of
time, and with a noticeable shift in the volume
and quality of inbound applications.
As planned, total headcount increased from
30 to 51 during the course of the year.
Of these new recruits, 11 joined the Front Oﬃce
team to continue the rate of client acquisition in
the UK corporate market, as well as penetrating
overseas territories from our oﬃce in London. As
always, we expect staﬀ contributions to increase
incrementally as individuals develop along the
learning curve, and I am pleased that yet again,
new starters in FY17 outperformed those in FY16
- a trend I expect to continue due to the
compounding eﬀect of surrounding great people
with more great people, alongside our evolving
service and infrastructure and the growing
reputation of Alpha in our target markets.
The majority of remaining new team members
joined our Technology team, spearheading new
product development and technological
innovation, with a particular focus on evolving
Alpha’s online currency management platform
and payment functionality, as well as developing
custom platform solutions for our clients.
Thank you
The bedrock of our business has always been our
people, and I would like to thank everyone who
has got Alpha to this stage in its journey. Your
commitment and vision is helping to build a
business that is driving change within the
industry, as well as a culture I feel incredibly
privileged to be a part of.
Last but by no means least, I would like to thank
you, our shareholders who believe in our vision
and are helping us to take Alpha to new heights,
whilst accelerating positive changes within our
industry. 
Outlook
Everyone at Alpha passionately believes our IPO
marked the start of our journey, not the end. We
took Alpha public to enable our growth ambitions
whilst ensuring we could maintain the
entrepreneurial culture that got us here in the
ﬁrst place. We now have the opportunity to create
a very special business, with a clear vision and
growth strategy. I look forward to being able to
report back on further progress achieved in the
current year.
