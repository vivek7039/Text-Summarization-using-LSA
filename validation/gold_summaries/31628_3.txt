Chairman
Dear shareholders
This has been an important year for Euromoney. When CEO 
Andrew Rashbass defined our new strategy in March 2016, 
we said that 2017 would be a year of transition with a return 
to growth in 2018. Our 2017 results actually show a year of 
“transition plus”, using the strong US dollar to invest in our 
business and still deliver improved results compared with last 
year. Equally, the reorganisation of our management structure 
and the creation of the new Group Management Board has 
had a telling effect on performance. 
Independence
Euromoney magazine was first published in 1969 and the 
Company has benefitted ever since from the careful stewardship 
of Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT) as the majority 
shareholder. In January 2017 DMGT reduced its holding in 
Euromoney to 49% by a secondary placing of Euromoney shares 
and a buyback by Euromoney of its own shares. The Company’s 
balance sheet is now independent of DMGT, increasing 
Euromoney’s financial flexibility.
DMGT’s foresight in enabling Euromoney to become 
independent and its continued strong shareholder support 
are welcome and appreciated. Their decision has helped 
Euromoney accelerate the implementation of our strategy for 
the benefit of all shareholders. 
Dividends 
During the course of the year, the Company approved a new, 
progressive dividend policy with an increase in the dividend 
pay-out ratio from approximately 33% to approximately 40% of 
adjusted diluted earnings per share, subject to the needs of the 
business. The reduction of the shares in issue following the share 
buyback, combined with the increase in pay-out ratio, enabled 
the Board to approve a 26% increase in the interim dividend to 
8.8p per share which was paid to shareholders in June. In line 
with the new policy, the Board is recommending to shareholders 
a 33% increase in the final dividend to 21.8p per share to be 
paid on 15 February 2018, giving a total dividend for the year 
of 30.6p (2016: 23.4p).

With independence comes responsibility, and the shape 
and composition of our Board and Committees is changing. 
Good progress has been made in recruiting new independent 
Non-Executive Directors, reconstituting Committee 
memberships, appointing a Senior Independent Director, 
making sure that our Board is more diverse in its make-up 
and appointing the Company’s first General Counsel, who 
also acts as Secretary to the Board. Although this work is not 
complete the momentum is reassuring.
The coming year
As the strategy becomes embedded in how the Group operates, 
I have decided now is the right time for me to hand over the 
Chairmanship of the Company. It has been a privilege to 
serve on the Euromoney Board for over 20 years including as 
Chairman for the last two. Our results demonstrate that the 
strategy which the Company is implementing is working and 
I am confident that I hand over the chairmanship to David 
Pritchard with the Company in a strong position. David will 
lead the process to appoint a new Chairman and be Acting 
Chairman in the meantime.
Our results demonstrate that the strategy under Andrew’s 
leadership is working and I am confident that Euromoney 
is in a strong position. 
May I thank our shareholders, my Euromoney colleagues and 
fellow Directors for your support. I look forward to watching 
the Company go from strength-to-strength and becoming a 
3.0 information business.
As we continue to operate in challenging times, the dedication 
and skill of Andrew, the Group Management Board and our 
staff across the world remain the defining feature of this 
remarkable Company.
