This year we have achieved strong progress 
against the strategic priorities that we identified 
despite a challenging and uncertain environment. 
Through this strategic focus we have increased 
our market share, evidenced through our 
like-for-like sales
a
 outperformance of the market 
this year and have taken steps to position the 
Group well for the year ahead. 
I	am	delighted	by	the	increasing	momentum	in	our	sales	performance 	
during	a	period	which	has	seen	mixed	results	across	the	sector.	The	cost 	
headwinds	facing	the	industry	have	impacted	profits	as	we	expected 	
and	our	adjusted	earnings	per	share
a
	were	down	1.4%	as	a	result. 	
However,	I	am	encouraged	by	the	results	across	the	business	which 	
show	success	in	the	steps	being	taken	to	better	position	the	Group 	
in	the	evolving	market. 	
This	year	the	Directors	are	recommending	the	payment	of	a	final	dividend 	
of	5.0p	per	share	making	a	total	of	7 .5p	for	the	year.	Given	the	uncertain 	
macro	environment	it	is	our	intention	going	forward	to	determine	a	full 	
year	dividend	paid	only	in	the	form	of	a	final	dividend	dependent	on 	
several	 factors	 including	 both	 current	 performance	 and	 future	 prospects.
On	behalf	of	the	Board	I	would	like	to	thank	our	46,000	people	across 	
the	business,	without	whom	the	progress	made	over	the	course	of	the 	
year	would	not	be	possible.	Now,	more	than	ever,	our	people	are 	
demonstrating	the	ability	to	adapt	to	the	ever-changing	environment 	
we	operate	in,	all	the	while	continuing	to	delight	guests	and	offer 	
great	 experiences.	
We	take	our	responsibilities	to	pensioners	seriously.	In	July	we	reached 	
an	agreement	on	the	2016	triennial	pensions	valuation	with	the	scheme 	
trustees.	This	resulted	in	an	unchanged	level	of	cash	contributions 	
through	to	2023	to	eliminate	the	scheme	deficit	with	a	potential	additional 	
payment	of	£13m	to	be	made	into	escrow	in	2024	should	further	funds 	
be	required	then.	I	am	delighted	that	we	reached	a	positive	agreement 	
for	both	the	Group	and	the	trustees.
There	have	been	no	changes	to	the	Board	during	the	year.	I	remain 	
pleased	with	its	composition	and	I	believe	we	have	the	right	balance 	
of	skills	to	drive	the	business	forward.
Our	market	continues	to	be	challenged	by	increasing	external	cost 	
headwinds	and	macro	uncertainty.	In	this	context,	we	shall	remain 	
focused	on	the	identified	strategic	priorities	which	best	position	the 	
Group	to	grow	long-term	shareholder	value.
