 Chief Executive’s Review
with volume growth in all regions except North 
America where growth remained challenging. 
SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose’s adjusted operating profit was 
£30 million higher as it benefited from lower costs 
from a single production facility and a one-off 
inventory sell-down. Food Systems’ adjusted 
operating profit was £19 million lower with a 
significant decline in Europe where sales were 
constrained by a consolidation of our blending sites, 
which took longer than expected, and a credit issue 
which restricted access to the Russian market. 
Sales of New Products, which represent products in 
the first seven years after launch, grew by 22% in 
the year. Sales from New Products have grown by a 
compound average growth rate of 43% over the past 
five years.
Bulk Ingredients had a particularly strong year  
with adjusted operating profit increasing by 54% 
(32% in constant currency) at £129 million. This 
performance was driven by strong commercial 
execution, good US bulk sweetener demand, robust 
margins, and solid manufacturing performance 
across the plant network. The relatively well-
balanced North American corn wet milling industry 
also benefited the business.
Our joint-venture businesses performed well with 
profits 16% higher at £32 million. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations increased by 37% (16% in constant 
currency) to 47.1p.
Overview of Group performance
Tate & Lyle delivered a strong performance in  
the year. Both business divisions delivered profit 
growth with Bulk Ingredients delivering particularly 
good results, driven by excellent commercial 
execution and solid manufacturing performance.
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 40% (20% in 
constant currency) to £271 million. Movements in 
foreign currencies, especially the strength of the US 
dollar against sterling, increased adjusted profit 
before tax by £40 million.
Speciality Food Ingredients performed well with 
adjusted profit up 21% (5% in constant currency) at 
£181 million. The business, excluding SPLENDA
®
 
Sucralose and Food Systems, delivered an increase in 
adjusted operating profit of 8% in constant currency, 
We continue to perform well and to 
build a stronger business

www.tateandlyle.com 15 Chief Executive’s Review continued
Cash generation during the year was excellent. Adjusted free 
cash flow was more than three times higher than the prior 
year, and more than covered the dividend. Net debt was 
£18 million higher at £452 million, with a £57 million adverse 
impact from foreign exchange translation offsetting the strong 
free cash flow generation.
Overall, the Group’s performance in the year was extremely 
encouraging. With both divisions performing well, higher 
operating margins, and a robust balance sheet, the Group is 
well positioned for the future. 
Strategic progress
We have a clear corporate strategy which we have executed 
against in a disciplined way since the 2011 financial year – to 
focus on growing Speciality Food Ingredients supported by 
steady earnings from Bulk Ingredients. During the year we 
continued to make good progress against this strategy.
Consumers across the world are increasingly looking for 
healthier nutrition, particularly given the rising incidence of 
obesity and diabetes worldwide. Our Speciality Food 
Ingredients business is well-placed to help our customers 
meet these demands, as our ingredients help to reduce sugar, 
calories and fat, and also to add fibre, in consumer products. 
We are steadily bringing new products to market to address 
these consumer trends, both through in-house innovation and 
by establishing strategic partnerships. During the year, we 
expanded our range of texturants with the launch of CLARIA
®
 
Bliss, a clean-label starch which provides great taste and 
texture to products such as dairy desserts and chilled ready 
meals. We also developed our sweetener range with a new 
crystalline version of DOLCIA PRIMA
®
 Allulose, a rare sugar 
with a similar taste and texture to sucrose but only a very small 
fraction of the calories. Overall, we invested £37 million in 
research and development in the year, an increase of £8 million, 
part of which was driven by foreign currency translation. 
In March 2017, we announced an exclusive partnership with 
Sweet Green Fields, one of the largest fully integrated global 
stevia players, to distribute their innovative stevia ingredients, 
and bring their leading stevia-based sweetening solutions to 
our customers worldwide. Early customer interest in our 
expanded stevia offering has been encouraging.
We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets.  
During the year, we increased our applications and technical 
service resources in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and  
our sales and applications resources in the Middle East.  
Our vision and strategy 
Our vision is to become a leading global provider of 
speciality food ingredients and solutions. 
Our strategy is to deliver this vision through:
• A disciplined focus on growing our Speciality Food 
Ingredients business
 – deeper customer engagement
 – continuous innovation
 – stronger positions in higher-growth markets
• Driving Bulk Ingredients for sustained cash 
generation to fuel this growth.

Driving efficient operations
We manage Bulk Ingredients for steady earnings. In the mature 
markets this division operates in, we aim to deliver this by: 
• optimising product mix and margins
• maintaining capital expenditure discipline
• continuously driving productivity and efficiency
• maintaining a mix of tolling and non-tolling contracts
• reducing exposure to commodity markets where we can, by 
dampening volatility by using conservative hedging strategies; 
actively managing co-product sales; and investing in the corn 
elevator storage network to secure raw material supply.
16 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2017 Main product lines
Bulk Ingredients main product lines largely serve 
mature and consolidated markets.
Bulk sweeteners
Bulk sweeteners provide sweetness and 
mouthfeel to regular carbonated soft drinks, 
confectionery and other foods and drinks.
Industrial starches
Industrial starches strengthen and improve the 
surface conditions of paper and cardboard and 
are also used in adhesives for building products. 
Acidulants
Acidulants are used mainly to enhance flavour 
and preserve foods, beverages and 
pharmaceuticals. 
Commodities
Commodities include co-products such as corn 
gluten meal and corn gluten feed (sold mainly as 
animal feed) and corn oil. 
We also produce some ethanol at our Loudon, 
Tennessee facility as a means of optimising the 
production balance and efficiency.
Key market factors
Industry capacity utilisation
Our bulk ingredients are produced mainly at four 
large corn wet mills in the US and two smaller mills 
in Europe. Supply/demand balance is a key driver of 
profitability in the US corn wet milling industry and 
the industry was well balanced in the year . 
Corn market
The US corn wet milling industry processes around 
10% of the US corn crop. Recent harvests have been 
strong with corn inventory high and prices relatively 
low and stable. Corn is largely a pass-through cost.
Carbonated soft drinks
Demand in the US for regular carbonated soft 
drinks, the main end-market for our bulk 
sweeteners, declined by 0.7%
1
 in the year. 
Re-deploying capacity
We seek to manage the long-term gradual decline 
in demand for our bulk ingredients by steadily 
re-deploying primary capacity in our corn wet mills 
to support growth in Speciality Food Ingredients.
Global consumer trends
The market for speciality food ingredients is 
being driven by a number of global 
consumer trends.
Healthier
With obesity and diabetes on the rise worldwide, 
consumers are looking to reduce calories, sugar 
and fat, while also adding beneficial ingredients 
to food and drink such as fibre and protein.
‘Clean-label’
Consumers want to understand the ingredients 
on food and drink labels. Increasingly, they are 
choosing products with labels with ingredients 
that they feel are less processed, or they perceive 
to be simpler or ‘natural’.
‘Free from’
Intolerance to certain ingredients is leading to 
increased demand for allergen-free foods such 
as gluten-free and dairy-free.
‘On the go’
People have busy lives and sometimes 
convenience can come at the cost of healthy 
nutrition. Consumers are demanding food and 
drink that offers fast, ‘grab-and-go’ nutrition,  
but which also makes it easier to make 
healthier choices.
Meeting consumer demand
Our ingredients and solutions help our customers 
meet growing consumer demand for healthier 
food and drink. We leverage our deep technical 
expertise and understanding of categories such as 
dairy and beverages to provide our customers with 
the solutions they need. 
Sugar and calorie reduction
Through our wide portfolio of speciality 
sweeteners and fibres, we create solutions that 
reduce sugar and calories without compromising 
the sweetness and texture consumers want. 
Enrichment
Our diverse portfolio of fibres offers a range of 
nutritional and functional benefits – from fibre 
enrichment to sugar and calorie reduction – 
while delivering exceptional digestive tolerance.
Texture
Our range of starches provides key functionality 
for foods such as thickening, shelf-stability and 
fat reduction, while still providing the texture 
consumers want.
Stabilisation
Through our in-depth knowledge of ingredients 
and complex food systems, we create customised 
stabiliser systems (highly functional ingredient 
blends) that ensure products maintain stability 
and appetising texture throughout their shelf life.

www.tateandlyle.com 17 We are also in the process of more than doubling the size of 
our applications laboratory in Singapore. This facility will 
provide customers with access to more sophisticated analytical 
equipment and services, including pilot-plant scale food-
processing equipment, to enable them to perform product 
trials on site.
Significant benefits have been realised from the re-alignment  
of the SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose business we undertook in the prior 
year. The implementation of a rigorous value-based approach to 
securing volume, and the consolidation of production into a single 
facility in Alabama, US, has helped to increase profitability and 
position sucralose as a more focused, low-cost and sustainable 
business. During the year, we also celebrated the 40
th
 anniversary 
of the discovery of sucralose. This ingredient has helped to 
reshape the global sweetener landscape by enabling our 
customers to create a wide range of great-tasting, low-calorie 
foods and beverages for consumers. Since its discovery in 1976, 
the amount of SPLENDA
®
 Sucralose produced by Tate & Lyle has 
been enough to replace over 19 million tonnes of sugar in the 
human diet, which is the equivalent of removing 77 trillion 
calories from consumers’ diets globally.
Food Systems had a challenging year as we worked through 
some key changes. In Europe, we consolidated our blending 
facilities from three sites to two to lower our cost base going 
forward. We also refocused our site in Germany on applications 
and solutions development for customers. In China, we decided 
to simplify our go-to-market approach by selling our interest in 
Jiangsu Tate & Lyle Howbetter Food Co., Ltd. back to our 
partner. Together, these actions will allow Food Systems to 
serve its customers better and re-position the business for 
future growth. 
Bulk Ingredients had a very strong year. The decision and steps 
taken in 2015 to re-align our European business and focus 
Bulk Ingredients predominantly on the relatively more stable 
North American market have served us well. Our objective is 
for Bulk Ingredients to deliver steady earnings from the core 
business and to dampen volatility in Commodities, and we 
continue to take the necessary actions to prosecute this 
strategy. We have evolved our operating model to provide a 
greater focus on product mix and margin management, and we 
remain focused on tight cost control. We continue to invest in 
our plant network for long-term efficiency gains, and to drive 
productivity across our broader supply chain network.
Progress against 2020 Ambition
In November 2015, we communicated our 2020 Ambition to 
further strengthen our business with three key outcomes.  
Our progress against this ambition is set out opposite. By way 
of summary:
• 54% of the Group’s adjusted operating profit came from 
Speciality Food Ingredients. While profits from Speciality Food 
Ingredients are growing broadly in line with our expectations, 
profits from Bulk Ingredients are well ahead of our 
expectations. The very strong performance by Bulk 
Ingredients in the year has resulted in the overall percentage 
of profits from Speciality Food Ingredients being lower than 
last year.
• Speciality Food Ingredients sales from Asia Pacific and Latin 
America grew by 6% in constant currency and have 
increased to 23% of the core business’s sales. 
• We continue to see good momentum from New Products with 
sales of US$105 million, 22% higher than last year.

As reported in our half-year results announcement, we have 
launched an extensive Group-wide review of our safety 
processes and procedures, supported by an independent 
external expert consultancy with deep experience in global 
safety assessments. This follows an industrial accident at one 
of our grain elevators in the US in September 2016 when sadly 
one of our employees and a local farmer died. We expect the 
review will conclude in the first half of the 2018 financial year.
For the 2016 calendar year, in relation to our two main 
safety-related key performance indicators, the Recordable 
Incident rate remained at 0.76 and the Lost-work Case rate 
improved from 0.16 to 0.11. Fatalities are recorded separately 
and are not included in these rates.
People
Our employees across Tate & Lyle bring a huge amount of 
energy and passion to work every day, and I would like to thank 
them for their hard work and dedication. Our strong 
performance this year is a testament to the talent and the 
commitment of our people and I look forward to working with 
them in the next financial year as we continue to execute 
our strategy.
Outlook
Turning to the outlook, we are confident the Group will continue 
to make underlying progress in the 2018 financial year.
Summary
Overall, our results for the 2017 financial year reflect strong 
delivery against our strategy and towards our 2020 Ambition.  
I remain very encouraged by our progress, as we continue to 
build a stronger business with higher-quality earnings, capable 
of delivering sustainable long-term growth.
