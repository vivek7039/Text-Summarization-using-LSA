Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code: TMO
Q&A
WITH THE CEO
What is the most important milestone Time 
Out Group reached this year?
2017 was our first full financial year as a 
listed company and achieving 59% growth 
in transaction levels driven by e-commerce 
and Time Out Market was one of our most 
important targets. By achieving substantial 
progress across our two business divisions 
we have met the high standards we set for 
ourselves, demonstrating the successful 
diversification of Time Out on our way 
to profitability. Time Out Digital has 
continued to deliver good progress and 
revenue growth across e-commerce and 
Premium Profiles; Time Out Market 
continued to go from strength to strength 
and within this context we will further 
expand the format to cities worldwide.
What were the key drivers of 2017  
revenue growth?
Increasingly selling to our global audience 
is the key driver behind our revenue growth 
which we saw increasing in the second 
half of the year, demonstrating that we are 
doing the right things. Looking at Time Out 
Digital, we are pleased that e-commerce 
substantially grew by 57% year-on-year 
as we launched new products, expanded 
into new markets and entered new affiliate 
agreements across more verticals, in 
particular in travel with its higher margins. 
The acquisitions of Time Out Australia 
and Time Out Spain further contributed 
to our revenue growth. Time Out Market, 
our other business division, had 3.6 million 
visitors in our Lisbon location in 2017 and 
62% revenue growth year-on-year (2016: 
115%) – the success of the concept as we 
roll it out globally offers a fantastic growth 
opportunity going forward.
How does Time Out intend to grow sales so 
rapidly in the highly competitive travel and 
leisure e-commerce market?
We know that 95% of our audience do 
something as a result of engaging with Time 
Out and that over 60% are from outside of 
the city – this audience is looking to spend 
and that is a huge potential for e-commerce. 
As we are already inspiring millions of 
travel and leisure decisions every year we 
no longer just write about the best things to 
do in the city; we increasingly make them 
bookable. In 2017, our customers bought 
837,000 items from us, up from 618,000 
in the previous year. We aim to further 
grow bookings by rolling out e-commerce 
functionalities to more cities, by launching 
multi-language options to attract visits and 
bookings from new audiences, by further 
enhancing the product categories, by 
making more content bookable and with 
a website redesign focusing on a closer 
connection of content and e-commerce. To 
complement our broad affiliates offering 
and further monetise traffic, we have also 
launched exclusive products like our very 
successful recent restaurant gift box which 
sold out quickly – this is a unique product 
only Time Out can deliver as it is inspired 
by editorial curation of the best of the city.
Your audience keeps on growing - what are 
the key drivers?
First, our audience values and trusts our 
content which is curated by professional 
journalists – it is this quality that attracts 
both locals and visitors, always looking 
for something new and exciting to do in 
cities around the world. Secondly, in 2017 
we have again grown our average global 
monthly audience reach by 39% and it now 
stands at 217 million. This was driven by an 
increasing social media reach which helps 
us build our brand and drive traffic to our 
“In 2017, we continued 
to drive growth for 
Time Out as we made 
substantial progress 
across our core areas. 
Increasing revenue 
growth in the second 
half demonstrates 
the successful 
implementation of our 
plan to transform this 
business.
“50 years after launching, 
Time Out is the only true 
global marketplace for 
city life. We are in the 
happiness business and 
that’s why we no longer 
just write about the best 
city experiences but also 
create and deliver them; 
every year, millions of 
customers book theatre 
tickets and hotels with 
us, buy exclusive offers or 
visit Time Out Market to 
enjoy the best of the city.”

sites. Our audience has further grown as 
a result of our global expansion, namely 
the launch of new cities in the US and in 
Germany and new print magazines as 
well as the integration of former Time Out 
franchises in Australia, Spain, Hong Kong 
and Singapore into our owned and operated 
network. 
Time Out is very well known for its 
magazines, but is Time Out now a  
digital business?
Whilst digital revenues now account for 
a majority of the Group’s revenue and we 
are excited about the consistent growth 
of e-commerce and Premium Profiles, 
the physical nature of print and Time Out 
Market have a significant role to play in the 
future of Time Out as our global community 
chooses to use multiple channels to interact 
with us. Our content is platform agnostic 
and we deliver it to wherever our audience 
wants it - through our website, mobile, 
social, print, Live Events or Time Out 
Market. It is this unique ‘clicks and mortar’ 
approach that helps us raise the profile of 
our brand and expand our global presence.
Since the opening of Lisbon, six Time Out 
Market locations have been announced - 
when will the next open and can we expect 
more announcements?
Time Out Market Lisbon continues to be an 
incredible success story; it is now Portugal’s 
most visited attraction and recognised to be 
at the forefront of the emerging global food 
hall trend. This is a trend which has been 
growing significantly around the world 
and consumers love this democratisation 
of fine food and the communal feel. We are 
proud to lead the charge in this sector and 
truly differentiate as we not only offer the 
best food of the city but also its culture. 
This makes Time Out Market so much more 
than just a food hall. The fact that Time 
Out Market Lisbon saw 3.6 million visitors 
in 2017 shows how successful and popular 
this format is. As we are expanding Time 
Out Market globally, we are set to open 
Time Out Market New York and Miami 
in 2018, followed by Chicago and Boston 
in 2019. To capitalise on the exceptional 
growth opportunity Time Out Market offers 
we secured a loan of €9 million in 2017, a 
further £20 million in March 2018 and we 
continue to explore funding options.
What are the key challenges of the  
year ahead?
The industry we are operating in is 
challenged by the so-called ‘duopoly’, 
Facebook and Google, which is now also 
joined by Amazon. The duopoly’s share of 
global advertising spend has more than 
doubled over the past four years and now 
stands at over 20%. However, what makes 
Time Out stand out in this competitive and 
fast-changing environment is its hugely 
trusted brand, real authenticity, quality 
content, a loyal and engaged audience, 
unique products and experiences we offer 
and differentiated, bespoke multi-channel 
solutions within a brand-safe environment 
for advertisers. This combination of assets 
is difficult to replicate for these tech giants 
but something advertising clients and 
consumers increasingly seek. We need to 
strengthen these assets further to continue 
to evolve as a digital, transactional business 
and to get to profitability. As for our second 
business division, Time Out Market, a key 
challenge will be the openings coming up 
of new sites in 2018 in New York and Miami, 
and in 2019 in Chicago and Boston. I am 
pleased to have a fantastic team in place 
who are highly experienced with managing 
a number of high-profile openings within a 
short period of time.
Time Out is 50 years old in 2018. A lot has 
changed but what still remains?
It all began in London in 1968 when Time 
Out helped people explore the exciting 
things that happened all over the city. 
50 years on, this is still at the heart of 
everything we do, we continue to inspire 
and enable people to make the most of the 
city. But today we are present in 108 cities 
in 39 countries around the world. Through 
all those years, this iconic brand has 
maintained its status as the go-to source 
of inspiration for both locals and visitors 
alike, making Time Out the only true 
global marketplace for city life. Our unique, 
curated content written by professional 
journalists remains as relevant now as when 
it first started – it is this authentic high-
quality content people value in times of 
fake news more than ever before and that is 
why we are able to inspire millions of people 
to have a great time in cities around the 
world.
