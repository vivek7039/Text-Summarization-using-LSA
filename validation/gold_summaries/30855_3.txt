 Overview
During 201 7 , London Stock Exchange Group continued 
to make good progress executing its growth strategy, 
delivering another year of strong performance. The 
Group has also addressed several strategic corporate, 
macroeconomic and political events.
In the early part of the year, the Group navigated the 
termination of its attempted merger with Deutsche 
Börse following the European Commission’s 
prohibition decision. We worked hard to find the 
appropriate solutions to the competition review.  
LSEG has always been committed to maintaining 
excellent relationships with all of its stakeholders, 
including the regulators in its significant markets, 
and taking into account all of the relevant factors,  
the Board concluded that it could not meet the late 
stage request from the EU Commission for 
divestment of a key Italian business.
Throughout the merger discussions, the executive 
management remained focused on the performance 
of our business divisions, through organic and 
inorganic growth, as was evident from the acquisition 
of The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices 
business. The transaction, which completed at the 
end of August, enhances and complements the 
Group’s Information Services data and analytics 
offering and will allow FTSE Russell to capitalise 
further on key industry trends.
Following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, the Group 
continues to ensure that our businesses are well 
prepared for any eventual outcome. As a systemically 
important financial markets infrastructure business, 
the Group has a responsibility to ensure the orderly 
functioning of markets and to ensure continuity of 
service for the benefit of our customers, shareholders 
and other stakeholders. With a strong global footprint 
and significant infrastructure in a number of 
geographies across the UK, Eurozone, US and Asia, 
the Group is extraordinarily well placed to adapt to 
the consequences of the eventual exit terms. On 
behalf of all our stakeholders and partners, the 
Group continues to argue strongly for a defined 
implementation period and the minimisation of the 
fragmentation of systems and processes designed to 
make the financial markets more efficient, stable and 
safe. We also firmly believe that enhanced regulatory 
supervision and regulation on a global scale will far 
outweigh any short term political benefits of location 
based policies for financial markets infrastructure.
Throughout the year, a key focus for the Group was 
planning to ensure that our systems and processes 
were ready for the major changes resulting from  
the implementation of MiFID II, which took effect 
immediately after the year end. All venues went live 
in January 2018 in one of the most extensive 
technology roll-outs the Group has ever undertaken. 
David Warren discusses the opportunities that  
MiFID II presents for the Group as the only financial 
markets infrastructure business operating on  
an Open Access basis elsewhere in this Report.
Governance
The final quarter of the year saw the announcement 
of a process for succession of the Chief Executive.  
In early October, the Board and the Chief Executive, 
Xavier Rolet, confirmed an agreement that he would 
leave the Group by the end of 2018 to ensure a 
smooth transition. Shareholders will recall that Xavier 
“ The Group remains  
well positioned for  
the opportunities  
ahead and remains 
confident of delivering 
further success and  
value for shareholders.”

Rolet had offered to step down in order to smooth the 
path for the planned merger. As a result, following  
the end of the merger process with Deutsche Börse  
in March 201 7 , it was clear to the Board that the Group 
needed clarity over succession. Unfortunately, one 
shareholder requisitioned a General Meeting to seek 
to undo the agreed plan. The Chief Executive’s 
departure was, as a consequence, accelerated, and a 
motion to remove your Chairman proposed by the 
shareholder was firmly defeated. Regrettably, this 
process disrupted the organised succession process 
and caused considerable diversion of time and 
energy. The process of appointing the new Chief 
Executive is now advanced with a strong field of high 
quality candidates. When the new Chief Executive is 
announced and appropriately integrated into the 
Group, I will step down at the AGM in 2019,  
to allow a new team to take the business forward.
The Board firmly believes that it followed appropriate 
governance principles, considering shareholders’ and 
other stakeholders’ interests at all times, but it is 
important that our actions are reviewed and 
consideration is given to any lessons to be learned. 
An external review is being conducted by Simon 
Collins, a former UK Chairman and Senior Partner of 
KPMG, who has the deep experience and technical 
expertise to undertake this work. The Board will share 
the summary of key conclusions with shareholders  
in due course.
As I said at the General Meeting in December, Boards 
must take into account all relevant information in 
making their decisions. It will never be possible for all 
of that information to be in the public domain, much 
as some may wish it to be. That is one reason why 
shareholders delegate decisions to a Board. The 
returns that result from these decisions are not 
achieved risk free. Boards are not committees, but are 
real risk taking bodies providing oversight of executive 
management and guiding the strategic direction  
of the company. I share my further thoughts on 
corporate governance later in this report on page 56. 
The events of the last quarter of 201 7 challenged the 
Board to think deeply about its role, the culture of the 
Company and the actions it takes in the best interests 
of all stakeholders collectively. I am enormously 
grateful for all the time and effort expended by the 
Board members during this period. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code demands that attendance at the 
Board and its committees are logged. In addition to 
Board and Committee meetings, the Non-Executive 
Directors of LSEG attended many more meetings 
during both the possible merger with Deutsche Börse 
and the process of preparation of the notice of the 
December General Meeting than are recorded in our 
Governance report.
At the end of the year, the Board was joined by Val 
Rahmani whose strong technology and business 
background will provide valuable expertise as we 
continue to grow our global business. As noted, in 
November, Xavier Rolet stepped down from his role as 
a Director and CEO. My colleagues and I acknowledge 
the immense contribution he made to the 
development of your Company. There have been no 
other changes to the Board’s composition in 201 7 .
As detailed in the Governance Report on page 56,  
the Board remains committed to further restoring  
the gender diversity of the Board, a process that 
Dividend policy
We operate a sustainable, progressive dividend policy, aiming to operate in a target range of 2.5–3.0x  
dividend cover.

was interrupted by restructuring ahead of the 
possible merger with Deutsche Börse. The Group  
is also a signatory to the UK’s HM Treasury Women  
in Finance Charter to improve gender diversity within 
senior leadership teams and we have set ourselves  
a stretching target of 40% female representation  
in senior roles by the end of 2020. We are currently  
at 33%.
Corporate Social Responsibility 
The Group is in a privileged position at the heart  
of the financial markets and we are pleased to 
support corporates, issuers and investors integrate 
sustainability and diversity as a core part of their 
capital raising and investment decisions. We 
continue to work closely with global and regional 
charities in the communities in which we operate. 
The selected charities focus on helping young  
people to develop vital life skills and we encourage 
employees to become actively involved in their work 
through paid volunteering days. In 201 7 , the Group’s 
Foundation donated £1.4 million to various charities.
Financial Performance
The Group has continued to deliver a strong financial 
performance across its business divisions. Total 
income grew to £1,955 million, up 18%. Adjusted 
operating profit was £812 million, while adjusted  
EPS was 148.7 pence, an increase of 19%.
Consistent with the Group’s capital allocation 
framework, we conducted an on-market share 
buyback of £200 million, an amount broadly 
equivalent to the return we would have made had the 
merger with Deutsche Börse proceeded as planned.
Reflecting the Group’s strong performance and our 
commitment to sustainable, progressive dividends, 
the Board is proposing a final dividend of 37 .2 pence 
per share, resulting in a 19% year-on-year increase  
in the total dividend to 5 1.6 pence per share. The final 
dividend will be paid on 30 May 2018 to shareholders 
on the register as at 4 May 2018.
Conclusion
I would like to thank Board members and all of our 
excellent employees for another successful year in 
the development of this great company. The Group 
remains well positioned for the opportunities ahead 
and remains confident of delivering further success 
and value for shareholders.
