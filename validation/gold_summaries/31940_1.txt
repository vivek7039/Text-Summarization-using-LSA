 Strategy
Our strategy continues to be balanced around 
growth and risk mitigation – to capture the 
opportunities of global, societal and technological 
change, whilst ensuring risk mitigation, where 
possible, in anticipation of economic, industrial, 
customer and political cycles. We achieve this 
through carefully selected diversification to avoid 
any undue dependence on individual clients, 
markets or regions of the world. Our engineering 
and consulting businesses primarily in the markets 
of Automotive, Rail and Energy & Environment are 
all linked around common long-term trends, shared 
resources wherever possible, and serve shared 
customers in many cases. Our Performance Products 
business provides links to our other businesses in 
terms of products, but also provides a longer-cycle 
business that is measured in a decade of supply 
rather than a comparatively short-term engineering 
or consulting contract. A portfolio of businesses 
that have different cycles and longevity provides 
additional resilience.
We expand and adapt these businesses both 
through organic and acquisitive actions. Organic 
development is supported by investment in 
excellent people through our apprenticeship 
programmes, graduate recruitment, and industry 
hires and by investment into the right technologies 
and the right assets. In an ever changing 
environment we focus on being ‘Agile, Adaptable 
and Ambitious’ and we look for our team and assets 
to be capable of this philosophy: it is important for 
the business to be fluid. 
Our strategy continues to be underpinned by 
long-term trends – population growth, urbanisation, 
energy security and efficiency, rising demand for 
natural resources and increasing environmental and 
emission regulations. All of these drive demand for 
innovative services and products. In many regions 
around the world, urbanisation is happening very 
rapidly and we are seeing significant infrastructure 
spend in the developing countries as they 
implement new rail-based transportation systems. 
This year we have also seen a significant focus on 
I am pleased to report another solid year of progress for Ricardo, against a backdrop 
of significant political and market change. Based on the foundation of a diversified 
strategy and an increasingly balanced business, we have navigated an uncertain and 
volatile year, with parts of our business performing strongly, some less so, providing a 
satisfactory result overall.

Ricardo is collaborating on the design, 
development and manufacture 
of the transmission of the Aston 
Martin Valkyrie (see case study ‘Ultimate 
Performance’ on pages 64 to 67)
emissions both at the local city level and in relation 
to the Paris Climate Agreement CO 2 reduction 
targets globally. These, together with the additional 
pressure brought by the intense diesel debate in 
the automotive industry, has led to an increased 
impetus around long-term electrification of vehicles, 
a short-term improvement of combustion engine 
performance and new ways of vehicle operation to 
enhance efficiency such as driverless or autonomous 
vehicles. 
These global and strategic changes require new 
technologies, strategic oversight, programme 
management and certification – this is our heritage, 
and through our future-focused technology 
roadmapping, it is our business both today and 
tomorrow. Ricardo is well placed and benefits from 
global change. By looking forward and acting at 
the right time we adapt our footprint, technology 
investment, people skills and product mix. 
Our process to enhance the future readiness 
of the business led us to invest in electric vehicle 
and hybrid technology a decade ago and to move 
into developing regions of the world early on: as a 
result, we already have the skills and connections 
to support our customers wherever they are 
with the solutions required today. As the pace in 
electrification and autonomous vehicles increases 
(across all forms of transportation), we will continue 
to be ready and will match our offerings and our 
asset base to the requirements of our customers. 
Further information on the execution of our 
strategy can be found on pages 14 and 15.
Highlights from the year
We closed the year with record order intake £366m 
and order book £248m, with good order intake 
contributions from all areas of our business and all 
core regions of the world. The Group saw growth 
in revenue of 6% to £352.1m (2016: £332.4m) and in 
underlying profit before tax of 2% to £38.3m  
(2016: £37 .7m). Using exchange rates consistent 
with the prior year, revenue and underlying profit 
before tax would have been £336.9m and £38.2m, 
respectively, both of which represent growth of 1% 
on the prior year. Further details on the results for 
the year are provided in the Financial Review on 
pages 26 to 29.
Our Rail and Environmental consultancies 
delivered strong results at both revenue and 
operating profit levels, as did our Performance 
Products business. Within Performance Products 
we were pleased to deliver our 10,000
th
 engine to 
McLaren and to be selected to design and produce 
an advanced hypercar transmission for Aston Martin.
Our Automotive business in Europe experienced 
a disrupted year of order flows which led to a 
less efficient business operation, as the industry 
digested and evaluated its product plans in reaction 
to developments such as the various referenda, 
elections, the diesel issue and the increased focus 
on electrification. The year ended with strong 
order intake in both the engines and electrification 
businesses and we are pleased to see a return to 
more normal order intake patterns in recent months 
as client plans are now more settled.

  Delivering Excellence Through Innovation & Technology   9 With the US business underperforming, a 
changing customer dynamic and the increased 
emphasis on electrification, we are repositioning 
the US business to enhance our electrified and 
autonomous vehicle service offering, led from 
California where many new entrants are based. This 
involves some changes in team mix and regional 
emphasis, and asset reduction where appropriate.
We were also pleased to welcome Exnovo to 
the Ricardo Group early in the year, bringing with 
it core expertise in the motorcycle industry and a 
good base in Italy. Post year-end we completed 
the acquisition of Control Point Corporation. This 
business brings with it additional clients and 
expertise in the classified US defence sector.
At the heart of Ricardo’s success is the ability of 
our staff to deliver excellence and create value for 
customers across industries. Some examples of 
excellent project delivery are presented in the Case 
Studies section between pages 42 and 67 . Each 
of the case studies illustrates the skills, technical 
expertise, innovation and motivation of Ricardo’s 
staff across the world:
• Tackling nanoparticle emissions: the emission 
of vehicle exhaust particles as small as just ten 
nanometres is an increasing concern around the 
world in terms of air quality and risk to public 
health. Ricardo is spearheading research into 
the measurement and control technologies, 
working with industry bodies and the European 
Commission;
• Charge of innovation: one of the major 
challenges holding back the market penetration 
of Battery Electric Vehicles (‘BEVs’) is the high cost 
of rechargeable energy storage. Ricardo is helping 
to pave the way for a new, lighter-weight and 
safer lithium-sulfur based rechargeable battery 
chemistry that aims to overcome the cost, capacity 
and safety challenges of today’s lithium-ion based 
systems;
• Semi-autonomous semi truck: the platooning 
of large vehicles represents the most attractive 
early application of automated driving. Ricardo 
engineers have developed platooning applications 
in some of the highest profile demonstration 
projects on either side of the Atlantic – and 
Ricardo has developed an enviable reputation as a 
leading innovator and technical partner for semi-
autonomous vehicle platooning, reinforcing the 
Group’s leadership position in the development of 
connected and autonomous vehicle technologies;
• Shipping steers a clear course on emissions: 
with pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions 
from shipping seen as a significant and growing 
part of global emissions, Ricardo has been 
commissioned to deliver a comprehensive update 
of the shipping emissions inventory for the UK 
National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (‘NAEI’);
• Smart monitoring: Ricardo Rail has developed 
PanMon, an innovative pantograph monitoring 
system which helps operators improve the 
reliability of electrified routes and protect critical 
infrastructure. Network Rail has formally approved 
the use of PanMon for use across the whole UK 
national rail system – a highly significant step as 
PanMon remains the only such system certified for 
use by a major network operator; and
• Ultimate performance: Ricardo has been 
selected as technical and supply partner for 
the transmission of the Aston Martin Valkyrie – 
the ultra-high performance hypercar, itself the 
product of a partnership between Aston Martin 
and Formula One’s Red Bull Racing.
Outlook
We enter the new financial year with a well balanced 
business and welcome the in-year acquisition of 
Exnovo and the recent Control Point Corporation 
acquisition post year-end. We continue to address 
and adjust to the changes in our individual markets 
to ensure we both mitigate risk and capitalise on 
the significant global opportunities which lie ahead. 
These opportunities, together with our progress, our 
people and our technology, in addition to our record 
order book, provide a good platform for further 
growth in the years to come.
