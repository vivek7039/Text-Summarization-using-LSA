 Chief Executive’s review
2017 was a period of major transformation for Circassia,  
with the Company making good progress to becoming  
a commercially-focused specialty respiratory business.  
During the year our market-leading NIOX
®
 asthma 
management products continued their strong growth,  
and in November we welcomed new NICE recommendations 
that are highly supportive for our products. We also 
established a major US collaboration with AstraZeneca 
for COPD products Tudorza
®
 and Duaklir
®
, and markedly 
expanded our specialty sales infrastructure in the United 
States. The partnership is making good progress, and with 
Tudorza
®
 US prescriptions well ahead of the trend prior to  
our involvement, we aim to increase uptake in the coming year. 
We also received compelling clinical data from large trials of 
both COPD products, and we look forward to filings seeking 
Duaklir
®
 approval and an extension to Tudorza
®
’s label.
With our revenues doubling in 2017 and our cost containment 
measures delivering tangible savings, we are driving our 
business towards self-sustainability. We intend to maintain 
this progress during 2018. We have refocused our investment 
strategy to support the ongoing expansion of our commercial 
platform, particularly in China, whilst reducing our R&D  
and corporate costs. During 2018, we will benefit from  
a full year’s contribution from our enlarged US sales team  
and our collaboration with AstraZeneca, ‘locking in’ significant 
growth potential. With a strong commercial infrastructure, 
compelling portfolio and increasingly attractive platform  
for third-party products we look forward to the coming  
year with great optimism.
Period of transformation
During the past year Circassia successfully underwent a number 
of major changes, as part of the Company’s transition into a 
commercially-focused specialty pharmaceutical business. Following 
disappointing allergy clinical results in 2016, we took the difficult 
decision to switch investment to our respiratory assets and focus on 
expanding our business. This strategy has produced positive results, 
and with our portfolio of marketed products and commercial platform 
now significantly broader, our 2017 revenues were 100% ahead  
of the previous year. 
Commercial growth
In the last 12 months we have expanded our commercial presence 
dramatically. In the United States we established a transformational 
commercial collaboration with AstraZeneca, and subsequently 
doubled the size of our field force to promote the COPD treatment 
Tudorza
®
 alongside our NIOX
®
 asthma management products. 
We also increased our commercial support capabilities, and the 
team, which includes marketing, market access, training, analytics 
and commercial operations, is now more than 50 strong. With our 
US commercial platform acting as an important factor in attracting 
AstraZeneca as a strategic partner, we plan to mirror this strategy 
in China. By building an initial sales force alongside our existing 
distributor base we plan to rapidly grow our NIOX
®
 revenues in this 
major market, and offer third-parties the opportunity to commercialise 
their products via our infrastructure. 
2017 was a period of major transformation  
for Circassia, with the Company making good 
progress to becoming a commercially-focused 
specialty respiratory business.

As well as adding Tudorza
®
 to our portfolio, our AstraZeneca 
collaboration brought the US commercial rights to late-stage  
COPD therapy Duaklir
®
. At the end of 2017 , the product successfully 
completed its US clinical development programme. As a result,  
we look forward to its filing in the first half of 2018, potentially  
further broadening our portfolio of marketed respiratory treatments. 
During 2017 we also took steps to advance our in-house pipeline, 
licensing smart nebuliser technology to incorporate in our LAMA / 
LABA novel formulation development programme. We now plan  
to out-license / partner this and our other pipeline products based  
on currently approved drugs, to leverage third-party funding for  
their development. This refocused investment strategy will enable  
us to rapidly complete our transition into a fully commercially-focused 
business, whilst retaining a financial stake in the potential future 
success of our pipeline products. 
‘Locking in’ future growth
The significant investments we made in 2017 , expanding our 
commercial infrastructure and establishing our AstraZeneca 
partnership, are designed to ‘lock in’ growth in the coming years. 
During 2018 we will benefit from a full year’s contribution from our 
Tudorza
®
 collaboration, as well as broader promotion of our NIOX
®
 
products in the United States. We also anticipate having the first 
opportunity to acquire the full US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 
during the year. In 2019, we anticipate a full year of Tudorza
®
 revenues, 
increased NIOX
®
 sales in China, and initial sales of Duaklir
®
 following 
US approval. Alongside this growth, we plan to continue our business 
development activities, seeking to further expand our portfolio through 
in-licensing, acquisition or partnering. 
Positive outlook
Having transformed our business during the past year, we look 
forward to the future with optimism. We anticipate ongoing significant 
revenue growth from our commercial portfolio, we plan to continue 
expanding our commercial platform and we expect to fund any 
payment to AstraZeneca for the full US commercial rights to Tudorza
®
 
through third-party financing or a vendor loan. With our cost 
containment measures delivering savings and our investment strategy 
focused on our commercial business we are building a strong and 
highly differentiated company. With continuing robust sales growth,  
a portfolio of exciting products and expanding commercial presence, 
we are highly positive about the coming year.
