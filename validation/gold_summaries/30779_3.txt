 Delivering  
shareholder value
Dear fellow Shareholder
Introduction and overview
I am delighted that National Express has again delivered another  
year of such strong growth. With revenue and profit both increasing 
markedly and being converted to strong free cash flow, I firmly believe 
that under Dean’s leadership we have established a sustainable 
model of growth. Equally, I am repeatedly struck by the passion, 
commitment and expertise of our staff across the Group in delivering 
the quality of services our customers rightly demand day-in, day-out.
It is particularly pleasing that these Group results have been delivered 
through growth across all of our internationally diversified business. 
North America and ALSA have both had particularly strong years 
delivering significant headline growth. The performance of our UK  
bus and coach businesses to turnaround their significant challenges 
of the first half of 2017, was impressive.
Our strategy of focusing on operational excellence, investing in 
technology and disciplined acquisition and growth in new markets 
has now been delivering for a number of years. As Dean makes clear 
in his report, while we have made important strides in each of these 
areas already, there are also significant opportunities to pursue. As a 
Board we are focused on working with and challenging the executive 
team to realise them.
Progress made with opportunities ahead
Our credentials as an industry-leading operator are strengthened 
every year. Our achievement of the highest safety awards, attainment 
of the highest European Foundation for Quality Management five-star 
rating in three businesses and consistently high customer satisfaction 
scores are testament to a focus on the fundamentals of a transport 
business that is geared for ongoing success.
Equally, however, when one stands back it is clear that we are  
in both a period of significant technological change and also an  
era when the potential application of these myriad innovations is 
presenting challenge, yes, but also exciting opportunities. This is  
now perhaps one of the most pressing challenges for a business  
like National Express: how we focus our investment and resources  
in the area of technological innovation to deliver the greatest benefit 
for our customers and shareholders.
From our industry-leading on-demand scheduling technology at 
Ecolane, through our pioneering use of smart Lytx DriveCam safety 
cameras, to our sophisticated customer pricing and payment 
methods (such as Revenue Management Systems) National Express 
has sought to invest to embrace the opportunities at an early stage. 
With the promising results from these – and other – investments,  
the Board and executive team both believe we are at the start of 
something exciting here.
Our disciplined acquisition strategy also continues to prove successful, 
as both high quality new businesses generating returns of at least 
15% are brought into the Group, but also opening additional new 
growth avenues. As Dean again sets out in his report, the emerging 
urban growth model in Geneva and in major cities in North America 
has been driven by our recent acquisitions. 
Our determination to continue to grow our existing businesses 
through the excellence and technology agendas, and these new 
avenues for expansion, provide us with confidence and optimism  
for future growth.
Dividend
It is with this in mind that the Board has again recommended a 10% 
increase in the final dividend, bringing the full year dividend to 13.51p. 
Subject to shareholder approval, this will be paid on 21 May 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018.
Finally, I would like to thank Dean and everyone at National Express 
for their continued hard work and commitment to the business and  
its core values.
