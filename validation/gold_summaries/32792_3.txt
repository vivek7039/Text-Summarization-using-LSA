  
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 9 
STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
I am delighted to report that Wizz Air’s 2017 financial year saw the Company achieve another year of market 
leading growth while continuing to deliver one of the highest profit margins of all European airlines.  Despite 
the challenging business conditions facing the European airline industry during the year, Wizz Air carried 23.8 
million passengers, an increase of 18.9 per cent. year-on-year.  The Company generated an underlying net 
profit of €225.3 million, an increase of 0.6 per cent. year-on-year, which translates to an underlying net profit 
margin of 14.3 per cent., a performance which few airlines in Europe can match.  
Capacity growth and a dedication to achieving the lowest possible operating costs are, and will remain, the 
key focus for Wizz Air. Together, they allow Wizz Air to continue to take advantage of the significant growth 
opportunity in Central and Eastern Europe and to strengthen our market leading position as Central and 
Eastern Europe’s largest low-cost carrier.  We believe that our unique position in Central and Eastern Europe, 
ultra-low-cost base, diversified point-to-point network and ability to adjust capacity quickly altogether place 
Wizz Air in an enviable position to meet industry challenges and continue to deliver significant growth and 
create long-term value for our Shareholders.   
Wizz Air’s business achieved a number of key milestones during the 2017 financial year, including: 
 continuing to grow and diversify our network by opening four new bases and announcing two future base 
openings, including our first in the United Kingdom, and launching 113 new routes. Wizz Air now offers 
more than 500 routes from 28 bases, connecting 141 destinations across 42 countries; 
 the delivery of a further twelve brand new A321ceo aircraft, increasing our fleet of Airbus A320-family 
aircraft to 79 and the average seat count per aircraft to 190 at the end of the financial year; and 
 driving load factors higher with an impressive 1.9 percentage point increase year-on-year to 90.1 per cent.   
Customers 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers for their continued support. As we expand 
our network we are delighted that many new customers throughout the region will be able to enjoy our 
services at incredibly low fares.  Enhancing the service we deliver to our customers is a constant focus for us. 
In the last twelve months we have undertaken a number of initiatives including the launch of our new 
wizzair.com website and the introduction of a simple three-step booking process for registered 
customers.  Now more than ever before, it’s faster and simpler to book the lowest fare flights with Wizz Air.  
Employees 
Our team of over 3,000 aviation professionals delivered a superior service to the 23.8 million customers who 
flew with us over the last twelve months. Our colleagues’ dedication, passion and enthusiasm for the airline 
and our customers makes the airline what it is today. I want to thank them once again for all their hard work – 
without them we would not have achieved our success to date nor will we realise the growth which we are 
targeting in the future.  
Board of Directors  
I would also like to thank the Board for its continued support and hard work in what has been another 
successful year for the Company.  During the year, we welcomed Ms Wioletta Rosołowska to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Ms Rosołowska has had an accomplished career in Central and Eastern Europe 
specialising in the consumer and marketing sector and she brings valuable and relevant experience and 
consumer insights to the Board. I know that the Board is looking forward to working with the Company’s senior 
management team and all colleagues in what will be another year of exciting growth. 
Looking ahead  
As the 2018 financial year begins we remain very optimistic for the coming twelve months.  Growth will 
continue to be a top priority for us and, with an ever stronger balance sheet, a continued focus on driving 
operating costs lower, one of the youngest, most efficient fleets in Europe and an underpenetrated market in 
Central and Eastern Europe, we believe we can continue to deliver improving returns for our Shareholders.
