We have demonstrated the
TREMENDOUS 
MARKETING  
POWER
of in-video advertising
Progress in 2017: focus and maturing technology
Mirriad’s strategy has centred on three key areas: the 
development of core technologies; the development of an 
organisation capable of supporting large enterprise‑class 
customers; and the deployment of the trading platform and 
associated in‑video ad unit deemed essential to connect 
clients’ advertising budgets to the inventory we create 
and allow our business to scale.
We have maintained our tight focus on the world’s largest 
and fastest growing advertising markets with high levels of video 
consumption. On that basis we have rebalanced our customer 
portfolio in favour of larger, more dominant players in each 
respective market including Alibaba/Youku, NBCU, RTL Group, 
Globosat and others. We expect this focus to yield results in 
terms of revenues from the second half of 2018 and beyond 
as we deploy our platform and service model. We anticipate the 
number of customers under contract to show a small increase by 
the end of 2018 as current contractual negotiations complete.
The value chain for in‑video advertising involves three parties: 
content producers, distributors (digital or broadcast) and 
advertisers/media agencies. Mirriad’s platform provides 
a marketplace for activity. 
The Group’s business is principally based on contracting with 
distributors, the primary sellers of the in‑video advertising 
inventory, and taking a share of revenue from resulting in‑video 
advertising transactions. 
Mirriad’s revenue share generally averages approximately 20%.
Our technologies are designed to make a complex problem 
simple: Mirriad receives video content; analyses it for advertising 
inventory; makes it available to our customers to sell; and ultimately 
fulfils the campaigns they have sold to media agencies and brands. 
As our technology has developed we have increasingly focused 
resources on the last steps in this process. 
2017 was an important year for technology developments as 
we solidified our capabilities for creating or predicting advertising 
inventory from premium entertainment content and naturally 
inserting realistic branded imagery into video at scale. Development 
work continued around the Marketplace platform, which will 
enable key stakeholders such as content owners, distributors 
and advertisers to transact. We also laid foundations for the 
2017 was an important year 
for technology development.

05 Marketing effectiveness
We ran the Group’s largest campaign at the end of 2017 
and into the beginning of 2018. Mirriad partnered with Youku/
Alibaba to create an in‑video ad campaign for a leading Chinese 
car leasing company, T angeche. The campaign embedded T angeche’s 
brand messages as ad units across more than 20 different shows 
over five months. This large‑scale campaign successfully reached 
the target audience and hit Tangeche’s awareness and 
consideration goals. 
We are delighted that the campaign results, independently 
researched by Miaozhen Systems, exceeded even our 
high expectations.
The campaign delivered nearly 800 million impressions. At the end 
of the campaign almost 71% of the audience had seen the ads, 72% 
of viewers thought that the inclusion of the brand in the shows 
made the scenes look more realistic and 94% of the target audience 
said they would take follow‑up action, with their intention to 
use the brand three times higher than before the campaign.
We believe that the Tangeche campaign is an excellent example 
demonstrating the marketing power of In‑Video advertising when 
delivered at scale.
The future
The path to success for Mirriad requires the Group to complete 
a number of steps. 
In 2017 and into the first half of 2018 we have concentrated 
on the first of those steps: deploying our Marketplace platform 
and services as well as establishing the In‑Video advertising unit 
through independent third party verification. This requires 
the organisation to onboard customer sales organisations at 
some of the world’s largest media companies and takes considerable 
time and effort. It also requires integration with third party systems 
either at the customer, for core services, or externally for third 
party verification and tracking of ad unit delivery. Both integration 
and onboarding are complex and time consuming but worthwhile 
initiatives, each requiring agreement with and co‑ordinated 
rollout with our customer organisations, their clients and 
other third parties.
Once the supply side of the model is operational our next 
step is to leverage demand for in‑video advertising by driving 
demand‑side awareness of the product and its benefits to 
advertisers and clients. We do this through delivery of advertising 
effectiveness research, executed locally and culminating 
in case studies on behalf of different brand categories. 
When demand is generated Mirriad has the technology and 
processes in place to fulfil transactions using Marketplace.
The final step is to achieve scale in our target markets. 
Ultimately, we believe we can drive scale in the business 
by establishing Mirriad In‑Video Advertising as a media buying 
plan line item. It is also worth emphasising that Mirriad has 
planned capabilities to support programmatic buying and can 
provide personalisation depending on our distribution 
partners’ infrastructure.

Progress in 2017: focus and maturing technology 
continued
launch of an industry credible In‑Video advertising unit capable 
of supporting media trading at scale; a third party certified, verifiable, 
consistent currency in the form of an In‑Video advertising unit is 
essential to market liquidity.
The Company has been actively protecting its IP and currently 
holds 11 granted patents, with more in process over 2017. 
Industry trends
There continues to be significant publicity around the verification 
and value of advertising media with recent comments from both 
Marc Pritchard and Keith Weed, respectively Chief Marketing 
Officers of Proctor & Gamble and Unilever, the world’s largest 
two advertisers by spend. 
In 2017 Marc Pritchard said that:
“We bombard consumers with thousands of ads a day, subject 
them to endless ad load times, interrupt their screens with 
pop‑ups and overpopulate their screens and feeds… We’re 
awfully busy, but all of this activity is not breaking through 
the clutter. It’s just creating more noise.”
While Keith Weed said at the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting 
in 2018 that:
“[Consumers] don’t care about good value for advertisers. 
But they do care when they see their brands being placed next 
to ads funding terror, or exploiting children.”
Mirriad Ad Units are designed to address these issues and more: 
bringing a new ad unit format to market requires a new metric 
that is transparent, verifiable and validated by some of the most 
respected industry measurement companies. 
We have very recently announced the results of work we 
have been undertaking for over two years concerning the 
standardisation of the Mirriad advertising unit with comScore 
in the USA and Miaozhen Systems in China. This work is critical 
in enabling Mirriad In‑Video Advertising to become a trading 
currency alongside other advertising products. The work in 
these two pivotal markets should drive more transactional 
liquidity between media owners and advertisers.
In 2017 Mirriad solved the challenge of consistent delivery 
of the ad units by finalising the development of an automated 
measurement and gating technology called the Visual Impact Score 
(“VIS”), now integrated into the Marketplace platform. VIS solves 
a formidable problem by ensuring each instance of ad exposure 
meets thresholds known to drive effectiveness such as exposure 
size and proportion, clarity, proximity to action and prominence. 
Early in 2018 Mirriad commissioned independent research from 
global measurement company comScore, which analysed a large, 
statistically valid random sample of the new Mirriad ad units. 
The audit verified Mirriad’s VIS score, with 98.5% of the tested 
ad units passing the independent audit. Full study results are 
available in a whitepaper on the Mirriad website (www.mirriad.com). 
So advertisers can now have independently verifiable certainty 
around the quality of each billable ad – essential in today’s highly 
scrutinized world of value for money and data transparency, 
especially in the two largest advertising markets in the world. 
Mirriad will continue working with multiple independent vendors 
of advertising measurement in securing further validation of the 
In‑Video advertising unit construct and its effectiveness.
