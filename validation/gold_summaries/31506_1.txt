 STRATEGIC REPORT
04 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
“
I am delighted to report on a
successful year, delivering against our
strategic objectives of growth, retention,
acquisitions, debt reduction and
operational transformation. 
”
2017 has been a year of significant and exciting activity for the
Company on the transformational journey to develop and
upgrade our products and services in order to support our
customer base of large corporates and accountancy firms in
meeting the increasing demands of tax compliance.
Growth: 
During 2017, we achieved year-on-year revenue growth of
17% (10% comparable organic growth) and contracted
annuity base growth of 12% (6% comparable organic growth)
through 114 new annuity licenses added and average order
value growth of 9%. 
This growth was achieved through a combination of activities
including the appointment of a seasoned sales and marketing
director, increased sales and pre-sales activity, incentivisation
of sales staff, better customer negotiation and the launch of
new solutions and services. 
New order intake was driven by additional technology
modules, increased user licenses and cross selling other
portfolio solutions to existing customers. In addition, several
new customers were won. 
New solutions and services launched in the year included
‘Data Entry’ which is designed to help accountancy firms
streamline the process of collecting information from data
owners, and a new service to help organisations with country-
by-country reporting.
We can further improve the sales and marketing engine but
to achieve these results without substantial investment has
been a great success and a credit to the team. 
Retention: 
During 2017, customer retention remained strong at a rate
of 95%, in line with management’s expectations. The high level
of retention is largely due to two factors, the first being that
our core technology solution (Alphatax) continues to deliver
for our customers. 2017 saw the release of the largest finance
bill in UK history and our tax content team did an outstanding
job ensuring the legislation was successfully encoded into our
core product within a timely manner. The architecture of the
technology enables us to do this on a continual basis with a
team that is well versed in the practice with documented
processes and procedures. The second is the focus and quality
of our local support teams, the members of which are
experts in both customer service and tax. These teams are
proud of our Company, solutions and services and have a real
desire to ensure our customers are responded to effectively
and efficiently.
As well as strong customer retention, we also continued to
retain our expert employees. Key activities completed in the
year included restructuring the organisation and individual
accountabilities, establishing the core leadership team,
promoting several internal staff, recruiting new talent, a change
of headquarters, modernisation of the Company brand and
the adoption of ‘agile’ development methodologies. 
I am very pleased with the way employees have embraced
change and would like to thank everyone for their
contribution. We all continue to be excited about the future
and working together to achieve our potential. 
Acquisitions: 
During 2017, we defined our vision and strategy which, along
with having a greater understanding of the market and
customer demand, highlighted a need to quickly provide a
solution to automate the collection of data – the fundamental
building block of any compliance process. 
Having evaluated various options, we completed the
acquisition of OSMO in April 2017 in return for the issue of
4.7 million ordinary shares of the Company, valuing OSMO
at £3.2 million.

05 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
OSMO is a leading provider of automated data extraction
services that currently connects to 310 versions of accounting
software packages, whether they be cloud, on premise or
enterprise versions. Using OSMO’s technology, finance and
tax teams can significantly decrease the manual workload
associated with data collection, reduce errors and risk from
re-keying data and increase the speed and accuracy of data
production. OSMO’s solution is an ideal add-on to the existing
software and services that Tax Systems already provides. 
I am pleased with OSMO’s progress to date; the team
delivered against its 2017 performance expectations and have
fitted in well both technically and culturally. We have one final
stage of the integration left which is moving OSMO’s core IT
systems and processes onto our standard operating platform
within shared services. This activity has begun and is expected
to be finished by the end of H1 2018. At that point we can
consider the business fully integrated. 
In addition, further acquisition targets were identified and
considered during the year. Disappointingly we declined to
proceed with two potential targets after finalising the due
diligence process but in both cases it was the right decision
for the business. 
We continue to actively evaluate other acquisition
opportunities but will only proceed where we believe a
business is the right strategic fit and will enhance both the
Company’s offering and shareholder value. 
Debt reduction: 
During 2017, we reduced our net debt by 16% to £20.5m as
a result of our revenue growth, customer retention rate and
excellent cash conversion. In addition, we were also successful
in recovering £0.6m of VAT relating to the fees payable on
the acquisition of T ax Computer Systems Limited (“TCSL”) in
July 2016. 
Net debt at the end of the year represented less than 3x
Adjusted EBITDA. By continuing to focus on sustainable
growth and customer retention we will be able to further
reduce our debt or utilise the facilities to fund further
acquisitions. 
Operational transformation: 
A key focus of the business has been on achieving operational
excellence through its people, processes, systems and facilities
– an absolutely critical requirement of any business but often
over looked and lacking due to the size and complexity of the
implementation of a target operating model. 
Significant time and effort has been put into defining and
achieving this, and, though there is still some tasks to be
completed, I am pleased that the majority of this work has
been done. 
Outlook: 
In summary, I’m pleased to report that we delivered against
all key strategic objectives in the year with the headlines being
revenue growth of 17% and debt reduction of 16%. Moving
forward, the Company will continue to focus on the execution
of its strategy in order to deliver against its goals and vision.
Whilst there is still work to be done to get the business to
where we would like it to be in order to maximise the market
opportunity, I am confident in our ability to achieve this. 
We believe we have the right technology platform from which
to continue to grow, in no small part thanks to the hard work
and talent of our people, whom I would like to thank for their
dedication and contribution to the ongoing success of the
business.
The Board remains confident in the ability of the business to
deliver increasing shareholder value over the coming years. I
look forward to 2018 and beyond with continued passion and
excitement.
