Since I became Chairman in January 2010, John Laing has
evolved significantly in a number of ways: it’s a simpler business,
with non-core activities divested; it’s a much more international
business, with three well-established geographical regions
and the potential for expansion into further jurisdictions; and
it’s a stronger business, with the ability to access new capital,
having undertaken a successful IPO three years ago. In addition,
we have launched two successful independent secondary
funds, JLIF and JLEN, which are the purchasers of a number
of our investments once the underlying projects reach the
operational stage.
As well as announcing our results, we are today launching a
1 for 3 rights issue to raise £210 million, net of costs. The rights
issue will enable the Group to take advantage of a higher
proportion of the attractive opportunities currently available to
it and is consistent with the Board’s intention to increase the
scale of the business over the medium term. We plan to use the
proceeds to invest in public private partnership (PPP) projects,
renewable energy assets, and in other appropriate greenfield
infrastructure assets which fit our business model and meet
our investment criteria. The Board considers the rights issue
to be in the best interests of John Laing and its shareholders
as a whole.
During 2017, as in earlier years, we kept our strategy focused
but also flexible. Our business model has stood the test of time
and allows the management team to concentrate on the core
tasks of origination of greenfield projects; active management
of construction and operational risk; and timely realisations in
order to monetise investments.
We committed capital to each of our three core regions –
Asia Pacific, Europe and North America – in the year. The US
market in particular is now showing the potential we have been
anticipating for some time. As well as two further renewable
energy projects, we invested in the I-66 Managed Lanes project
in Virginia. We continue to see strong demand for new greenfield
infrastructure in each of our regions.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
THIS IS MY LAST REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AS CHAIRMAN AND
I AM PLEASED TO BE LEAVING THE BUSINESS WELL POSITIONED
FOR FUTURE GROWTH. John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 / 09
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview
The business delivered another strong performance in 2017:
Net Asset Value (NAV) grew by 10.5% to £1,123.9 million or •
306p per share at 31 December 2017, from £1,016.8 million
or 277p per share at 31 December 2016;
Investment commitments reached £382.9 million, our •
highest ever and significantly ahead of our guidance of
approximately £200 million;
Realisations of investments were £289.0 million, again well •
ahead of our guidance for 2017 of approximately £200 million;
Our total external Assets under Management grew to •
£1,648.5 million, an increase of 12.0%; and
We are proposing a final dividend for 2017, before adjustment •
for the rights issue, of 8.70p per share made up of a base
dividend of 3.82p per share and a special dividend of 4.88p
per share.
In December 2017, Will Samuel joined the Board as Chairman
Designate and will take over from me when I stand down at the
Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 2018. In the few months
since he joined us, Will has met all the key members of
management and has already got his feet well under the table.
He brings with him a wealth of experience both as a chairman
of listed and private companies as well as from his successful
executive career. I am confident I will leave the Board and the
Company in capable hands.
During the year under review, the Board complied with all
applicable provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code
(the Code). We have an experienced Board which has been
strengthened by the addition of Will Samuel. As well as regular
Board meetings, we held reviews in June and in October 2017
to address the future strategy and direction of the business.
These recognised the robustness and flexibility of our existing
business model and reconfirmed our commitment to creating
further shareholder value from growth in NAV.
I will be sorry to say goodbye to the many members of staff
I have met and worked with during my time at John Laing and,
on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of them for their
contribution during my chairmanship and to these results in
particular. I would also like to extend the Board’s thanks to all
the Group’s stakeholders for their continued support.
Our dividend policy has two parts:
a base dividend of £20 million (starting from 2015) growing •
at least in line with inflation; the Board is recommending
a final base dividend for 2017 of 3.82p per share, before
adjustment for the rights issue; and
a special dividend of approximately 5% – 10% of gross •
proceeds from the sale of investments on an annual basis,
subject to specific investment requirements in any one year .
The Board is recommending a special dividend for 2017
of 4.88p per share, before adjustment for the rights issue.
This reflects 6.2% of 2017 realisations of £289.0 million.
The total final dividend therefore amounts to 8.70p per share,
which, together with the interim dividend of 1.91p per share
paid in October 2017, makes a total dividend for 2017 of 10.61p
per share, an increase of 30.2% over 2016, reflecting the
significant level of realisations achieved in 2017. The final
dividend will be put to shareholders for their approval at the
Company’s AGM which will be held on 10 May 2018. At the
Company’s last AGM on 11 May 2017, all resolutions were
approved by shareholders.
Our business is in good shape and, based on our investment
pipeline, we anticipate a strong level of deal flow over the
coming years in each of our core markets.
