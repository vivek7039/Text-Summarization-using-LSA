 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Chief Executive Officer’s Report
Our primary goal in 2017 was 
to become cash flow positive at the 
plc level. It took us two months longer 
than I had hoped, but we hit this target 
in February 2018. This is perhaps our 
most significant achievement to date 
and positions Nostra Terra for exciting 
growth ahead, as we seek to introduce 
larger assets to the Company with 
much more potential upside. 
Revenues for the year were £1,128,000 
an increase of 300% from 2016. Loss for 
the year was £1,044,000. In April 2017 
the Company raised £500,000 through 
an equity placing at 2 pence per share. 
Included in this were 1 for 1 warrants, 
exercisable within 12 months at 3 pence 
per share. Nearly all of the warrants 
were exercised by April 2018, raising an 
additional £738,000 for the Company.
Moving forward we will certainly 
seek to build on this success, through 
further drilling across our existing 
portfolio of assets. However, now that 
we are in a much more secure position 
financially, with a stronger balance 
sheet, we can also afford to explore 
a more ambitious acquisition plan. 
If successful this change in approach 
could significantly increase Nostra Terra’s 
growth trajectory.
My vision has always been to build 
a much larger company, built on solid 
fundamentals. The first phase of this 
plan is now complete and I am excited 
about the next phase ahead. 
United States
Pine Mills, Texas
Having secured our initial stake (80% 
working interest) in the Pine Mills oil 
field in late 2016, our operations team 
made an immediate impact. By the turn 
of the year we were able to report two 
consecutive months of profitable oil 
production at Pine Mills and have 
sustained that record every month 
since. Furthermore, Pine Mills has 
provided us with such stable and 
consistent excess cash flow that it 
has become the cornerstone of our 
turnaround strategy.
This very much confirms our 
original basis for acquiring Pine Mills 
and the subsequent strategic efforts 
we expended in the first half of 2017 to 
secure 100% of the asset. Subsequently, 
we were able to include all revenues 
generated at Pine Mills in 2017 in our 
reported figures. 
Due to the stable production at 
Pine Mills and the performance of our 
operational team, in September 2017 
we secured a hedging facility with BP 
Energy Company. This was a significant 
achievement for a company of Nostra 
Terra’s size and marked a turning 
point for the Company.
To secure the hedging facility we 
underwent a vigorous due diligence 
process. We were able to demonstrate 
an established track record of consistent 
production and the viability of our 
long-term model consolidating efforts 
made in the first half of 2017.
Permian Basin, Texas
Having secured the hedging facility, 
we were confident we would be able 
to obtain a new Senior Lending Facility. 
Initial discussions with a number of 
banks went well and this gave us 
confidence to press ahead with the 
third acquisition in the Permian Basin, 
where we would drill the Twin Well. 
This acquisition, in late October 2017, 
marked another step change in 
our delivery.
Prior to the acquisition, the 
neighbouring operator inadvertently 
drilled a well into the lease, which 
produced 350 barrels of oil in less 
than three days. Because of this 
error the neighbouring operator 
had to plug and abandon its well 
and was required to provide us 
with the well data.
It has since produced at a strong 
rate above 50bopd. From permitting 
to getting paid took less than 
four months.
We now have approximately 22 drill 
ready locations across our existing 
Permian Basin assets. Assuming 
we are able to continue growing 
production here, it is clear there is 
potential to increase significantly 
underlying value. 
We retain interest and receive 
revenues from additional assets 
located in Oklahoma, Colorado and 
Wyoming. These are not substantial 
and are considered non-core assets.
Egypt
While we’ve made positive inroads in 
the country with the Government and 
local contact, unfortunately we have 
not been able to find a solution to the 
legacy issues with the Concession’s 
operator, North Petroleum (“North”), 
and the case has now been referred 
to international arbitration. 
We have been proactive in 
suggesting solutions to the issues 
raised, and sought positive resolutions. 
Nevertheless, Nostra Terra will now 
defend its position rigorously.
Senior Lending Facility
At the beginning of 2017 we 
secured a new $5 million Senior Lending 
Facility. The initial borrowing base was 
$1.2 million at a 4.75% interest rate. 
The facility will be reviewed at least 
twice a year, meaning the borrowing 
base can increase or decrease based 
on changes in production, reserves, 
cash flow and commodity prices. 
With the progress we have made 
increasing production at Pine Mills, 
across our Permian Basin assets, 
and the considerable improvement 
in the oil price, Nostra Terra is well 
positioned to accelerate its growth. 
Outlook
With oil sector strength and 
Nostra Terra cash flow positive at 
the plc level, this is a most exciting 
time to be involved in the business. 
We already have a number of potential 
catalysts to rerate the business in our 
asset portfolio and are extremely 
well positioned to raise our sights 
in terms of new acquisitions. We 
are an attractive company to work 
with for potential targets and the 
Washington Federal Senior Lending 
Facility provides us with a great deal 
of balance sheet support.
I would like to finish by thanking our 
shareholders for their support and I look 
forward to providing more updates as 
we continue to grow the Company.
