 10 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We established TBC Bank in 1992, shortly after Georgia had 
restored its independence following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. We have since grown side-by-side with our country 
throughout its economic and political development. As Georgia 
lacked a functioning financial system at the time of TBC Bank’s 
inception, we became true pioneers in establishing a well-run 
banking institution with a long-term perspective.
We set ourselves a challenging task: to build a banking business 
that would earn trust and credibility with our customers. For that 
reason, from the outset, we adopted a customer-centric approach 
in our business. To help achieve our goal, we have sought to 
employ people who share our mindset and have created a strong, 
committed team with common values.
Over the past 25 years, TBC Bank has been growing together with 
its customers, supporting them in meeting their financial needs, 
helping them to achieve success and contributing to the entire 
country’s development.
Today, we take pride in being the largest privately-owned bank in 
the region
1
. In addition to our strong team spirit, we attribute our 
continued success to having one of the most recognised brands in 
Georgia, a superior customer experience, the best multichannel 
network and a full range of innovative services and products.
Strategy
We believe that TBC Bank’s future success depends on its digital 
competence, as customers are increasingly shifting towards digital 
banking. The banking industry is entering a digital era and we need 
to stay abreast of upcoming changes. Last year , we announced an 
updated strategy to become the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
. We remain committed to this strategy.
We are also focused on our customer experience. We have made 
significant efforts to anticipate our customers’ needs and offer 
them the best products and services. We measure customer 
satisfaction regularly to identify areas that need improvement,  
and we work diligently to enhance our offerings. We pride 
ourselves on having the highest customer satisfaction scores in 
the Georgian banking sector
2
, as well as on holding leading 
positions in the country’s broader retail industry. 
We will continue to use our strengths to keep growing with the 
market and more actively engage with our customers by creating 
innovative, value-added solutions for them. At the same time, we 
will remain focused on operating efficiency and automation to 
become more agile in our fast-changing environment.
Key achievements
In May, we successfully completed the integration of Bank Republic, 
well ahead of schedule. As a result, we have expanded our 
distribution network and increased our client base by around 
380,000 customers, all of whom now have full access to our 
innovative range of products and services. 
Another significant development in 2017 was the inclusion of our 
shares into the FTSE 250 Index, reflecting the improved liquidity 
of our shares and the increased valuation of our business. Since 
then, we have begun to benefit from a more diversified shareholder 
base and are seeing greater interest from potential investors.
Dear shareholders,
It is with great pleasure that  
I present our 2017 annual report.
As the year also marks our 25th 
anniversary, I would like to reflect  
on where we started and how far  
we have come over this past quarter 
of a century.

Overview

Strategy & Performance
Over the past year , we made good progress towards our updated 
strategy of becoming the best digital financial services company in 
the region
1.
 The number of transactions and sales conducted in 
remote channels continue to grow rapidly, as do internet and mobile 
banking penetration levels. We also launched the first Georgian-
speaking chatbot,Ti Bot, which allows customers to conduct simple 
banking transactions via Facebook Messenger . It also provides 
useful information about our products, as well as entertainment 
events and weather forecasts. The chatbot has been well received 
by our customers and has become a highly popular channel, 
attracting more than 124,000 users since its launch in March 2017.
Our strong operating performance during 2017 translated into robust 
financial results. For 2017, TBC Bank recorded an underlying net 
profit of GEL 369.2 million, up 35.1% year-on-year . In addition, our 
underlying return on equity and return on assets stood at a respective 
21.4% and 3.2%. In terms of our loan book, our loan portfolio grew by 
16.2% year-on-year , leading to a market share of 38.2%
3
.
Operating environment
2017 was another remarkable year in Georgia’s continued 
development. The country’s citizens were granted visa-free access 
to the Schengen zone, which is a significant advancement and will 
support our deeper integration with the EU countries. Visa 
liberalisation would also have a positive impact on tourism, leading 
to increased awareness about Georgia and greater tourist inflow 
from the EU. The country is already being promoted as one of the 
best places to visit, including by many reputable magazines
4
, which 
have named it in their lists of the top 10 tourist destinations.
In 2017, Georgia recorded strong economic growth with GDP 
reaching 5.0%
5
, which is one of the largest increases among 
countries in the CIS and Eastern Europe. This improvement was 
mainly driven by high tourism income and an increase in net 
exports. Another positive factor was the improvement in the current 
account deficit, which decreased to 7.1% of GDP
6
 for 9M 2017, 
compared with 11.2% a year earlier , indicating that the country is 
experiencing more sustainable economic development. 
Other important developments in 2017 included the official opening 
of the long-awaited Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway and the beginning of 
a new phase of development at Anaklia Deep Sea Port, where 
construction work started in December . These projects will 
strengthen Georgia’s position as a regional tourism and 
transportation hub, as it offers the shortest route to connect the 
economies of China and countries in Central Asia to those of 
European countries. These transportation links, coupled with free 
trade agreements with the EU, China and all major economic 
powers in the broader region, will further support the growth of 
Georgia’s economy and diversify trade exports.
Finally, Georgia regained its position among the top 10 countries in 
the World Bank’s Doing Business 2018 ranking, moving up by seven 
positions to ninth place to become the best performer in Europe 
and Central Asia. This outstanding performance in these rankings 
highlights the government’s continued efforts to improve the 
business environment and to make Georgia one of the world’s 
most attractive places to do business.
Governance
TBC Bank is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and business transparency. Our experienced Board of 
Directors takes the leading role in framing our strategy, 
overseeing our risk management and challenging our 
performance. With their diverse and unique skillsets, our 
Directors help to guide our strategic development and create 
sustainable value for our stakeholders.
I would like to thank all our Directors for their active involvement 
and valuable contribution towards our achievements in 2017.  
I firmly believe that, together, we are well positioned to realise  
our strategy of becoming the best digital financial services 
company in the region
1
. 
As already announced, two non-executive Directors, Stefano 
Marsaglia and Stephan Wilcke will be leaving TBC Bank and 
stepping down from the Board as and when suitable replacements 
are found during 2018. I would like to extend the Board’s thanks  
to both Stefano and Stephan for their important contributions to 
TBC Bank and we wish them every success in the future.
Acting responsibly 
Corporate responsibility has always been one of our overriding 
values. During the past 25 years, TBC Bank has actively supported 
culture, sports, young talent and other important social projects. 
We continue to hold a firm belief and commitment to supporting 
the community, the environment, the human rights, and our wider 
stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees and 
customers. We also aspire to conduct business in a way that 
promotes high ethical standards, values and encourages our 
employees to act with integrity and responsibility towards each 
other and our customers, partners and community.
This year, we launched an innovative platform, statusdonates.ge, 
which focuses on supporting success and features short videos 
about individuals and organisations that need financing, enabling 
people to select a specific cause that they would like to promote 
and support. 
We remain long-term partners with the Georgian Rugby Union and 
are the title sponsor of the national rugby team. In 2017, Georgia 
hosted the World Rugby Under-20 Championship and we actively 
promoted the games using our social and media channels, helping 
to attract many fans to the stadiums. This championship put 
Georgia on the international sports map and introduced world 
rugby fans to the country from a different angle.
Outlook
While we have achieved significant success over the past 25 years, 
we continuously seek ways to improve our business. We remain 
eager to go further after achieving each new accomplishment. We 
will continue to innovate and offer unbeatable digital solutions, a 
superior customer experience and tailor-made financial products. 
In 2018, we will progress towards our strategy of becoming the 
best digital financial services company in the region
1.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my deep gratitude 
to our management team, employees and partners for their 
continued hard work and dedication. I am confident that our joint 
efforts will enable us to achieve success in all our undertakings 
and create maximum value for all our stakeholders over the next 
25 years.
