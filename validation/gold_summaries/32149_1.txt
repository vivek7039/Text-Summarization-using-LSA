Strategic report Review of the Chief 
Executive Officer
Chris Loughlin
Chief Executive Officer
 Our strategy is to 
lead in the UK’s water 
and waste sectors, 
drive value through 
efficiency and invest for 
sustainable growth. 
Pennon Group achieved a strong performance in 
2016/17. Our strategy is to lead in the UK’s water 
and waste sectors, invest for growth and drive value 
through efficiency. I am pleased to say the Group is 
delivering against each of its strategic objectives 
while achieving a return for shareholders in a 
responsible and sustainable way. 
Health and safety
During the year we were shocked and saddened 
by the death of Viridor worker Rafal Swiadek at 
the Materials Recycling Facility in Milton Keynes. 
No fatality is acceptable and I want to underline 
the Group’s commitment to health and safety. 
In January 2017 we created the new role of director 
of Safety, Health, Quality and Sustainability (SHQS) 
and appointed Steve Holmes, who previously held 
the role of Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
director for Amec Foster Wheeler. He brings many 
years of senior experience in operations, health and 
safety from industries including oil and gas, nuclear, 
power and rail. 
This appointment is an important development for 
Pennon because it reflects our commitment at the 
highest level to improve health and safety by utilising 
concepts and learnings from other high hazard 
industries. Steve has a mandate from the Board to 
implement an enhanced strategy that will raise the 
Group’s performance and reinforce health and safety 
as core to Pennon’s way of working. Our ambition is 
to be the health and safety leader in the UK water 
and waste sectors and, to that end, we have launched 
our HomeSafe programme (see page 18). As we 
pursue our ambition, we can expect to see changes 
to how we evaluate and control risk, how we engage 
with our employees, and how we build greater 
leadership and accountability for health and safety. 
Leadership in water and waste 
We remain committed to delivering high quality 
services for the benefit of our customers, proactively 
seeking to understand their needs and priorities and 
making the most of new technologies and innovation 
to deliver appropriate improvements. 
South West Water once again outperformed its 
regulatory contract to achieve a sector-leading RoRE 
(return on regulated equity) of 12.6%. In addition, 
South West Water once again achieved ODI 
outperformance which has secured a net reward 
of £3.6 million in the year. 
In our waste operations, Viridor continues to be a 
leader following its significant investments in Energy 
Recovery Facilities (ERFs) in recent years. We delivered 
£107 million EBITDA, which is in excess of our target 
of c.£100 million, and now have a clear track record of 
constructing and commissioning ERFs, and delivering 
the operational and financial results. 
We continued to drive returns from recycling through 
broader ‘self-help’ measures that are reducing the 
cost base and improving utilisation of assets. It is 
22
Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 encouraging to see these initiatives supporting an 
increasing EBITDA. We are also making progress in 
commodity risk sharing with our recycling clients.
Investing for sustainable growth
Our decision in November 2016 to commit to a 
£252 million ERF at Avonmouth, near Bristol, has 
expanded our future portfolio to 12 plants. We expect 
demand for ERFs to continue to exceed capacity into 
the long term. 
The Group is actively addressing opportunities 
arising from water industry deregulation. 
In preparation for the new non-household retail water 
market, which commenced 1 April 2017, we set up 
Pennon Water Services as a Pennon Group plc 
subsidiary, ringfenced from South West Water’s 
business, to provide retail services to business 
customers. To achieve scale, Pennon Water Services 
formed a non-household retail venture with South 
Staffordshire Plc (incorporating South Staffs and 
Cambridge Water). Pennon Water Services entered 
the market with the fourth largest customer base in 
the deregulated market. 
Driving value through efficiency 
South West Water maintained its strong momentum in 
controlling total expenditure (Totex) with cumulative 
savings of £129 million and financing outperformance 
of £67 million in the first two years of K6 (2015-2020). 
South West Water is targeting to remain at the 
forefront of cost efficiency for the water sector.
During the year, we completed our Shared Services 
Review to drive value through efficiency, synergy and 
best practice. Reflecting the more integrated nature 
of our Group, we are taking advantage of the 
expertise our combined water and waste businesses 
have in terms of managing large asset bases, and in 
engineering, technology and innovation. The review 
resulted in a plan to centralise key corporate services 
and operational functions, including the introduction 
of a shared IT platform. This will achieve estimated 
savings of £17 million per year from 2019, up from 
the £11 million per year that we announced last 
year of which c.£9 million per annum has been 
secured to date.
Other efficiency successes include the Group’s 
energy trading team which has developed a portfolio 
management strategy. This addresses the energy 
demands of the Group and ensures Pennon is buying 
energy at the right price while enhancing profitability 
from the energy we generate. With South West Water 
a net user of electricity, the Group has a natural 
energy hedging opportunity representing one third 
of Viridor’s energy generation. We can now hedge 
our market position for up to five years ahead, further 
helping to protect revenues.
Balanced risk-reward  
profile across the Group
Part of our strategy as we build our ERFs, and in our 
recycling operations, is to ensure there is a balanced 
risk-reward profile that complements our water 
operations as closely as possible.
As a long-term infrastructure provider, we manage 
our risk profile by mitigating volatility through secure, 
long-term cash flows. We have made significant 
progress over the past two years in reducing risk 
and unpredictability across the Group by 
overlaying our long-term assets with long-term 
commercial arrangements, and supporting these 
with long-term financing. 
At Viridor, for example, we have increased contracted 
volumes better aligning with the life cycle of our 
assets. By negotiating long-term 25-year index-linked 
contracts with stated volumes and prices, Viridor is 
building a similar risk-reward profile to the water side 
of the business. Prior to committing to Avonmouth, 
approximately 80% of our ERF portfolio volumes 
(and associated prices) were contracted long term. 
Striking an appropriate balance between operational 
risk and reward is a key part of our strategy. This 
applies to any aspect of the Group’s operations – 
developing our recycling business, our decision 
to build the Avonmouth ERF, or our entry into the 
non-household retail market. The starting point for 
achieving the right risk-reward balance is to ensure 
the Group fully understands the differences between 
its water and waste operations. This has given us 
a strong and effective framework for identifying risk. 
Innovation and 
investment  in Plymouth
South West Water’s largest investment in its 
current five-year plan is the new £60 million 
state of the art Mayflower Water Treatment 
Works in North Plymouth. Due for completion 
by March 2018, Mayflower uses the innovative 
treatment processes of suspended ion 
exchange, inline coagulation and ceramic 
membrane filtration. This is the first time that 
this combined technology has been used in 
the UK. Mayflower will provide a secure, high-
quality drinking water supply for the Plymouth 
area for generations to come.

Strategic report We also ensure senior management are fully aware of 
how we are managing risk and how we can mitigate 
adverse impacts. At the same time, we identify 
appropriate business opportunities, especially as 
our strategy is to invest for growth in both water 
and waste over the longer term.
Sustainability is core to our business 
Sustainability is core to the Group both in terms of 
ensuring its long-term commercial viability and of 
operating in an environmentally and socially 
responsible manner. The Group has a long track 
record in partnership and innovation across a range 
of sustainability issues. Our operations are deeply 
embedded into local communities and we believe this 
is one of the reasons Ofwat responded so positively 
to South West Water’s latest business plan.
Sustainability is carefully integrated into our strategic 
thinking given the nature of our business as a provider 
of key water and waste services and the close 
relationship our operations have with environmental 
issues. Furthermore, we recognise that making 
responsible and sustainable business decisions is 
critical to achieving long-term investor confidence. 
Our decision-making on capital investment integrates 
many sustainability factors including social, community 
and environmental impacts. We use a range of tools 
to ensure we make decisions that involve more than 
purely economic or financial criteria. In the case of 
capital expenditure on our network infrastructure, 
for example, an ideal solution is always one that 
combines not just the lowest cost base but also 
a favourable sustainability score. 
There was clear evidence of the importance of 
sustainability within the Group during the year. 
In early 2017 Pennon completed its first Group 
submission to Business in the Community’s Corporate 
Responsibility Index and received a score of 90% 
(a three-star rating). Pennon is also included in the 
FTSE4Good Index. In addition, we achieved a score 
of B (Management) for the annual CDP submission 
(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) for Climate 
Change and Water, and we continue to take steps to 
effectively reduce our impacts.
Our gross greenhouse gas emissions increased by 
14%, primarily as a result of Viridor’s newly 
commissioned ERFs reaching full operating capacity. 
The ERFs burn waste that would otherwise have 
gone to landfill. This has the double benefit of 
extracting more of the energy embedded in the 
waste and substituting energy generated from other, 
predominantly fossil fuel, sources. 
Our environmental performance is an area of 
focus and further progress is needed in aspects 
such as reducing the risk of pollutions and flooding. 
In recognition of the shared importance of our 
environmental responsibilities across the Group, we 
have created the new role of director of Environment 
and, in April 2017, appointed Ed Mitchell to the role. 
Ed brings with him a wealth of experience, having 
spent eight years at the Environment Agency. Prior to 
this Ed held senior positions at Thames Water and the 
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
Our people 
Across the Group we look to attract, develop and 
retain a highly skilled and customer-centric workforce. 
At the end of the year, Pennon had a workforce of 
around 5,000 people and we continue to be a 
large employer in the south west of England. 
Our multi-award winning apprenticeship programme, 
which started in 2011, continues to go from strength 
to strength. This year South West Water recruited 
its 100th apprentice since the programme began. 
Viridor is actively committed to expanding 
the number of apprentices it employs. 
The Group also contributes to local efforts to 
develop skills for the future, an example being 
South West Water’s role as a leading partner in a 
University Technical College for South Devon, which 
places a unique focus on engineering, water and 
the environment.
Our employees supported communities through 
359 days of volunteering during the year and both 
South West Water and Viridor continue with a broad 
community education programme. Viridor has been 
shortlisted for The UBS Award for Education as part 
of Business in the Community’s Responsible Business 
Awards 2017. 
At executive level, the creation of the position of Group 
director of Human Resources is an important step in 
the Group’s evolution. The responsibilities of the role 
include developing and implementing the Group’s 
people strategy and assessing how we evolve the 
human resources model across the Group.
The success we achieved in 2016/17 owes much to 
our employees and I would like to thank all of them 
for their hard work, loyalty and dedication.
Outlook
The Group’s outlook is encouraging. In our waste 
business, our ERF portfolio is a significant investment 
in the UK’s environmental infrastructure and key to 
Pennon’s growth agenda. Construction of our ERFs 
at Dunbar and South London is progressing well 
and construction on Avonmouth is now underway. 
In November 2016 we announced that we had taken 
positive action to terminate Interserve Construction 
Limited as EPC contractor for our ERF in Glasgow 
following their continued underperformance on the 
project. Good progress has been made since this 
date in engaging sub-contractors and progressing 
construction which is expected to be complete 
within a revised timetable agreed with our customer, 
Glasgow City Council.
Once all facilities are fully operational, we 
are confident they will add to the already strong 
contribution these assets are making to the Group’s 
financial performance. We continue to work hard to 
create a balanced risk profile across our waste and 
recovery operations.
New branding
As we begin to work more closely as an 
integrated business, it is important that 
the Pennon, South West Water and 
Viridor brands also work together 
visually. The new branding underlines 
our commitment to environmental 
infrastructure, unifying us as a group 
but still reflecting the strengths of each 
business. A cost effective three-year 
programme for roll-out of the new 
branding for vehicles, sites and 
uniforms was in progress by year end.

Pennon Group plc   Annual Report 2017 We remain well 
positioned to play 
our part in the 
development of 
future regulatory 
reform
.
The Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority 
(GMWDA) has confirmed that it is seeking to exit and 
re-negotiate the Greater Manchester Waste private 
finance initiative (PFI) contract with Viridor Laing 
Greater Manchester. The PFI contract, which was 
entered into in 2009, was the UK’s largest waste and 
energy project. Diversion of waste from landfill 
remains ahead of contractual commitments and we 
are keen to ensure this progress is able to continue. 
Viridor and its joint venture partner John Laing have 
been actively engaging with GMWDA as they 
consider their options. There are provisions in the PFI 
contract for compensation to be paid to Viridor and 
John Laing on termination.
Our water business is well prepared for the future. 
South West Water is fully engaged in Ofwat’s 
programme for future water and wastewater services 
regulation as the Group prepares for the PR19 
five-year review of pricing and investment 
requirements. We remain well positioned to play 
our part in the development of future regulatory 
reform and are working to ensure our voice is 
heard in shaping the industry’s future. 
South West Water will publish its 25-year strategic 
plan during 2017/18, setting out our evolving strategic 
priorities and our path to continued strong 
operational performance. We will make every effort to 
maintain a first-class, innovative and efficient service 
that is characterised by reliability, responsiveness 
and resilience. At the same time, we will ensure our 
operations and investments enhance the communities 
we serve and that we continue our commitment to 
understanding the needs of vulnerable customers 
and offering appropriate support.
Looking ahead, our strong operational and financial 
performance shows we are delivering on our strategy 
and providing a firm foundation for further growth. 
Our immediate priority is to optimise our current 
assets and operations so that we can continue 
fulfilling our strategic objectives. In the longer term, 
we believe there is additional opportunity for 
consolidation in wholesale water. 
Meanwhile, we have a clearly articulated core strategy 
focusing on water and waste operations in the UK and 
we believe both business streams provide excellent 
opportunities. With our sector-leading dividend policy, 
our growth profile and our strong balance sheet, 
Pennon Group is well positioned to deliver further 
value to customers, communities and shareholders.

Avonmouth ERF:  
investing for growth 
Viridor, with its joint venture partners, is 
already one of the largest independent power 
generators from waste. When Avonmouth 
begins operation early in the next decade, 
it will place us in the leading position in UK 
energy recovery with 20% market share. 
Avonmouth will serve around 3.5 million people 
in the West of England and supply the national 
grid with enough electricity to power over 
30,000 homes.
The waste supply in the Avonmouth ERF 
catchment area substantially exceeds the 
plant’s own capacity as well as available 
capacity nearby. Supporting contracts 
we already have, an additional volume of 
some 800,000 tonnes is available from 
local municipal, commercial and industrial 
sources. Combustible waste market under-
capacity in the west of England extends to 
2030 and beyond, matching the UK trend. 
Viridor’s market projections are supported by 
independent third party analysis.
