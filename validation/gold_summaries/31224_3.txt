 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
A culture of innovation
Dear shareholders
During the course of 2017 the Group expanded 
its market share in the US, our key geographic 
market, by launching additional US land-based 
casinos as clients of either virtual currency-
based Simulated Gaming
TM
 or traditional real 
money regulated gaming conducted on an 
intra-State basis. In April 2017 the Group 
announced that it had successfully issued its 
first convertible loan note as a public company, 
raising gross proceeds of £2.0m in loan capital 
to continue expansion of real money regulated 
gaming and Simulated Gaming™ opportunities 
in the US, and for working capital and general 
business development purposes.
As has been widely reported, regulated  
real money Internet gaming in New Jersey  
has been growing strongly. Our Group has 
executed well in delivering operationally  
for Paddy Power Betfair plc in New Jersey, 
earning a well-deserved reputation in the  
US for technical competence, reflecting  
the reputation already hard earned in  
Europe’s toughest regulated Internet gaming 
markets. This reputation has translated  
into additional business secured in  
February 2017 for GAN in New Jersey  
with a major land-based New Jersey  
operator Ocean Resort Casino (formerly  
known as ‘Revel Casino’) nominating GAN as  
the future platform for regulated real money 
Internet gaming commencing in 2018.
GAN has become synonymous 
for quality and commitment 
to delivering the right solution 
for bricks and mortar US casino 
operators to move their retail 
business online.

Pennsylvania surprised the industry by 
legislating for major gaming expansion  
in Autumn 2017, including the regulation  
of real money Internet gaming which will  
now commence in Pennsylvania in 2018.  
The Group has long served the largest  
single casino operator in Pennsylvania,  
Parx Casino
®
 and looks forward to  
launching its real money Internet  
gaming business, subject to licensing.
Your Board of directors believes there  
is a significant opportunity for Simulated 
Gaming™ in the US. It has outperformed  
initial expectations and has become the 
centrepiece of the Group’s growth strategy.  
We commercially launched five US casino 
clients throughout the year. Outside the US, 
the Group extended its services agreement 
with a consortium of land-based gaming clubs 
in Queensland, Australia as clients of Simulated 
Gaming™ which is a market sharing many 
regulatory similarities to the US when it comes 
to Internet gaming.
We are excited about the prospects for 
Simulated Gaming™ and the performance we 
have achieved since its initial launch together 
with the increasingly compelling business  
case that Simulated Gaming™, suitably 
integrated with land-based casino operators’ 
loyalty programmes, greatly supports our 
clients’ core business of on-property real 
money gaming. We are also confident in the 
long-term potential for real money regulated 
gaming, and Pennsylvania’s recent adoption

of legislation enabling Internet gaming  
may prove to be a significant catalyst  
for re-starting the US regulatory cycle.
Our consistent progress in 2017, with our  
core products of Simulated Gaming™ and 
regulated gaming in sustainable markets, in 
what was a year of continued investment for 
GAN as we developed both our real money 
regulated gaming and Simulated Gaming 
offering, would not have been possible without 
the dedicated and talented staff employed by 
the Group in London, Sofia and throughout the 
US. I thank them for their continued efforts 
and believe the Group has become established 
as a major Internet gaming technology, 
infrastructure and services provider to 
land-based casinos in the US, consistent with 
the strategy set out during the Group’s Initial 
Public Offering completed in November 2013.
After a multi-year period of necessary 
investment, GAN has now established 
itself as a significant and highly credible 
Internet gaming technology provider to 
the US casino industry.

After four years building our US market 
position we are satisfied the Group is  
now recognised as a leading provider of 
enterprise-level online solutions to the 
land-based gaming industry in the US and 
believe significant shareholder value will 
develop going forwards as New Jersey’s 
regulated gaming market continues to grow, 
Simulated Gaming™ continues to be adopted 
by a portfolio of larger US casino operator 
clients and Pennsylvania’s Internet gaming 
market commences.
