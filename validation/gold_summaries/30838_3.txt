Strategic Report
Chairman’s 
Statement
We’re reporting on a challenging year, 
but one in which ITV has made 
signiﬁcant progress.
ITV delivered a strong operating 
performance with great on-screen and 
online viewing. Against this, net advertising 
revenue (NAR) reacted to political and 
economic uncertainty, contracting by just 
under 5% (though, as we report, this trend 
improved towards the end of the period). 
 Our rebalanced company saw continued 
growth in non-NAR revenues – from 
sponsorship, from digital and from 
production, both at home and abroad. 
We thank our former Chief Executive, 
Adam Crozier, along with the executive 
team for these important advances. 
And I’m very grateful to Ian Grifﬁths, 
who added the role of Chief Operating 
Ofﬁcer to Group Finance Director.
ITV’s mass commercial audience is at 
the heart of our offer to viewers and 
advertisers. We own the only such mass 
audience in the UK. We’ve now grown our 
share of television viewing for two years 
in a row. And our broadcast schedule 
offers the most trusted medium of brand 
advertising: where an ‘impact’ is watching 
an entire, full screen, advertisement with 
the sound up; where no impacts are fake; 
where a brand is guaranteed adjacency 
to trusted content; and where there’s 
no ad-blocking. Meanwhile, ITV Studios 
now produces for over 200 channels in 
11 countries around the world.
This underlines the enduring strengths on 
which we’ll build our new revenue streams 
in the future. So with our strong balance 
sheet we’re able to deliver good returns 
to shareholders while also investing in 
that future. In line with our dividend policy 
and reflecting the Board’s conﬁdence 
in the business and the outlook for 2018, 
the Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend  
of 5.28p, which equates to a full year 
dividend of 7.8p, up 8%.

Our award-winning daytime shows, thriving 
soaps and major dramas are a vital part of 
Britain’s national conversation, exploring 
topical social issues that deﬁne our culture. 
And as a major employer of creative talent 
in Manchester, Leeds and London, our role 
in the nation’s growing creative economy 
is very important to us. 
I’d like to thank my Board colleagues for 
their valuable support and input during 2017. 
We welcome Margaret Ewing as our vastly 
experienced new Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. And we shortly bid farewell 
to Andy Haste and John Ormerod, each of 
them having committed ten fruitful years 
to the Company. We have a clear plan to 
continue to improve the diversity of the 
Board. At the time of writing, our gender 
balance is now 40% female and 60% male. 
And we intend in the medium term also 
to widen our ethnic diversity beyond our 
current one BAME member. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I want to 
thank all ITV colleagues for their excellent 
contribution in 2017. With that quality of 
commitment, we’ll prosper in the future.
 
Sir Peter Bazalgette
Chairman
As we work hard on ITV’s next chapter of 
growth, we are thinking about our digital 
competitors. And we see just as many 
opportunities to seize as threats to ward off. 
Netflix and Amazon may compete with us for 
viewers, but they also buy our programmes 
and co-produce major new series. 
Talking of that future, we were delighted 
to welcome Carolyn McCall as our new 
Chief Executive at the beginning of 2018. 
Investors will be familiar with her background 
in media, her experience of direct to 
consumer relationships and use of consumer 
data, her ability to design and implement 
astute strategy and her understanding of 
what it is to run an international company. 
In short, she’s someone with a track 
record of delivering value to shareholders. 
As she explains, she’s already started her 
strategy refresh. 
Today, there’s quite rightly a growing 
emphasis on company culture and social 
purpose. These are qualities ITV, as a Public 
Service Broadcaster, has always kept front 
of mind  – hand in hand with entertainment. 
But now they’re in even sharper focus. As a 
producer of trusted, sourced national news, 
regional news and current affairs in an age 
of fake news, we take our contribution to 
a functioning democracy very seriously.

documentary broadcast on ITV in 2017. 8 ITV plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
A strong  
platform 
for delivery
As an integrated producer broadcaster, ITV is in a unique position 
to create and own world-class content, broadcast it on one of the 
biggest marketing platforms in the UK and distribute it globally 
through its international network. 
ITV is an increasingly global and diversiﬁed organisation, with 
signiﬁcant non-advertising revenue streams reducing its 
dependency on UK advertising.
ITV has delivered a strong operational and ﬁnancial performance 
over many years and is in a good position to continue to do this, 
underpinned by its strategic assets and competitive advantage.  
ITV is currently undertaking a strategic refresh to ensure it has a clear 
strategy and priorities which reflect what ITV needs to be in three, 
ﬁve and ten years’ time. 
Strong market 
position
The Broadcast & Online business is robust. Our on-screen and online 
viewing performance is strong and we continue to deliver unrivalled 
audience scale and reach for advertisers as well as more targeted 
demographics on our digital channels and on the ITV Hub.
Online, Pay & Interactive is a material, fast-growing and proﬁtable 
part of the business and we are building our digital business 
through our direct to consumer SVOD services BritBox, Cirkus 
and the ITV Hub+.
ITV Studios, our international content business, is now a global player 
of scale, creating, owning and managing rights and we will continue 
to grow in key creative markets, driving value from the strong 
demand for quality content.
