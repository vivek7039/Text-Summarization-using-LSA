 04 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
The Group has made 
good progress towards 
its strategic objectives.”
Overview
It gives me great pleasure to announce 
that Norcros has recorded its eighth 
consecutive year of revenue and underlying 
operating profit growth, with the result 
achieved in the year being marginally 
ahead of market expectations. The Group 
has also made good progress towards its 
strategic objectives and in particular, by 
achieving underlying ROCE of 18.4% in 
the year, ahead of target.
Group revenue for the year was £271.2m, 
15.0% higher than the prior year on a 
reported basis, 10.6% higher on a constant 
currency basis and 4.1% higher on a like 
for like constant currency basis. Underlying 
operating profit at £23.8m was 11.7% higher 
than the prior year, mainly reflecting a further 
significant improvement in performance in 
our South African business, and a first‑time 
contribution from Abode which was acquired 
in March 2016. Underlying diluted earnings 
per share was consistent with the previous 
year at 27.8p.
The recent acquisitions of Croydex and 
Abode have been integrated seamlessly 
into the Norcros Group and are performing 
in line with the Board’s expectations. I have 
been encouraged by the quality and 
enthusiasm of the management teams 
of those businesses in identifying and 
pursuing opportunities in collaboration 
with the Group’s existing portfolio, particularly 
in the areas of new business development, 
procurement and supply chain.
The Group has again delivered a strong 
cash performance, with underlying 
operating cash flow at 99% of underlying 
EBITDA (2016: 76%). The Group is in a 
sound financial position with a strong 
balance sheet and has reduced net debt 
by £9.3m to £23.2m (2016: £32.5m), 
representing leverage of 0.8 times 
underlying EBITDA.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend for the year of 4.8p (2016: 4.4p) 
per share. When added to the interim 
dividend of 2.4p (2016: 2.2p) per share 
which was paid on 12 January 2017, this 
will make a total dividend for the year 
of 7.2p (2016: 6.6p) per share, a 9.1% 
increase on the previous year.
Pension scheme
The gross deficit relating to our UK defined 
benefit pension scheme as calculated under 
IAS 19R has increased from £55.7m at 
31 March 2016 to £62.7m at 31 March 2017 
principally reflecting a reduction in bond 
yields. Notwithstanding, this position is a 
significant improvement on the £97.8m 
deficit reported at the half year, which 
had increased primarily because of the 
abnormally low bond yields following the 
EU referendum result. Despite the volatility 
experienced in the bond markets and the 
subsequent effect on our pension liabilities, 
which have little impact on scheme cash 
flows, we remain confident that our 
pension obligations continue to be 
appropriately funded and well managed.
Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary 
responsibilities is to ensure that the 
Group operates to the highest standards 
in all aspects of governance and risk 
management. Our aim at Norcros is to 
manage a growing business effectively, 
while ensuring that proper operating 
procedures and internal controls are 
maintained at all times. Transparency 
is central to this objective and you will 
find more detail about our approach and 
progress over the last year in the Corporate 
Governance section of this report.

Aberfeldy Village T ower 
Hamlets, Croydex 
“Hang ‘N’ Lock” 
system delivers 
cost savings with 
“one‑man” installation
THE CHALLENGE
Accessories provide the finishing touches to any 
bathroom but fitting larger items such as mirrored 
cabinets has traditionally been a time-consuming 
“two-man job”. When construction and fit-out specialist, 
Willmott Dixon, needed to install mirrored cabinets 
in 290 London apartments, it not only required an 
affordable yet stylish design, but also an easy and 
efficient fixing system.
THE SOLUTION
The Burwell and Westbourne triple door, tri-view 
cabinets from Croydex can be fitted by just one 
person using the patented Hang ‘N’ Lock system. 
The fully adjustable bracket enables the level of the 
cabinet to be changed after fixing holes have been 
drilled. Simply attach to the wall, adjust with the built-in 
spirit level and hang the cabinet before locking it securely 
in place. This eliminates the struggle of trying to mark 
screw holes with one hand whilst supporting a heavy 
bathroom item with the other. Both white steel cabinets 
have mirrored doors, two adjustable shelves and 
110 degree sprung hinges to maximise storage space.
THE RESULT
By enabling a single fitter to install each cabinet, 
significant cost savings in both labour and time 
have been achieved. 
Burwell and Westbourne cabinets have been fitted 
throughout the Aberfeldy development.

People
Our employees continue to be our most 
valuable asset and in recognition of this 
the Group aims to create an environment 
in which they can see their careers develop. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to 
thank the Group’s employees who have 
helped to deliver revenue and underlying 
operating profit growth over an extended 
timeframe and in particular for their 
contribution over the last twelve months.
Summary
These results demonstrate the Group’s 
resilience in the face of some difficult 
trading conditions, particularly the revenue 
growth achieved in the UK in the second 
half of the year and the continued progress 
in South Africa. The Group has delivered 
another strong performance, reflecting 
the successful acquisition strategy and the 
sustained focus on driving organic growth 
through market share gain, investment 
in new products, operational efficiency 
programmes and geographic expansion. 
The recent acquisition of Abode has 
been integrated seamlessly into the Group 
and we are already progressing revenue 
and procurement synergies with other 
Group businesses. In view of the success 
achieved in the current year and the strong 
momentum and focus on growth, I remain 
confident that we will continue to make 
progress towards achieving our medium‑ term strategic objectives.
