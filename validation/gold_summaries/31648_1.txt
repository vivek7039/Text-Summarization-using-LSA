 08 ZPG Plc Annual Report 2017
Delivering on our strategy and mission
We have made significant progress 
towards our mission of being the platform 
of choice for consumers and partners 
engaged in property and household 
decisions. During the Period, we announced 
five acquisitions, three further strategic 
investments and the launch of two new 
national marketing campaigns.
Our audience continued to grow and 
remains highly engaged with a new record 
of 648 million visits to our websites, 
of which 72% were via mobile devices. 
We launched new national advertising 
campaigns for both our Zoopla and uSwitch 
brands. Zoopla’s new campaign highlighted 
how we can help simplify the process of 
moving home, through the eyes of hermit 
crabs, the world’s most prolific home 
movers. uSwitch’s new marketing campaign 
unveiled an updated logo identity and new 
brand slogan – “Switching made simple”. 
Both campaigns resulted in record levels 
of national brand awareness. As a result 
we generated a record of over 56 million 
leads for our more than 25,000 partners 
during the Period. 
2017 has been another very exciting year for ZPG 
as we continued to help our consumers to make 
smarter property and household-related decisions 
and our partners to operate more effectively. 
The combination of our underlying organic growth 
and strategic acquisitions has made us stronger 
and more diversified than ever before, resulting 
in record revenues up 24% to £244.5 million and 
record Adjusted EBITDA up 25% to £96.4 million.
We are stronger 
and more diversified 
than ever before

Strategic report
Our cross-sell strategy to both consumers 
and partners is working. We are engaging 
our consumer audience effectively and are 
driving thousands of incremental leads 
across our platforms. In March we launched 
our innovative MovePlanner tool on Zoopla 
which helps consumers manage everything 
move-related in one place and allows us to 
generate leads for conveyancing, removals, 
insurance, energy, broadband and more. 
This tool is now generating over 10,000 
incremental leads per month for our 
Comparison partners. Zoopla is also now 
driving over 25% of the overall mortgage 
traffic to uSwitch.
We continued to attract a focused, 
transaction-ready audience to our uSwitch 
website with account sign-ups increasing 
by 60% to 1.9 million at the end of the 
Period. Consumers can now manage 
multiple products within their account and 
set reminders for contract end dates so that 
they never miss an opportunity to switch 
to a better deal. In addition, uSwitch’s app 
won numerous awards during the Period 
including ‘Most innovative use of mobile’ 
and ‘Best app’ at the MOMA Awards and 
‘Best use of mobile’ at the DADI Awards.
The cross-sell opportunity to our Property 
partners has been significantly enhanced 
through the acquisitions of TechnicWeb, 
Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Ravensworth. 
We are now able to offer best-in-class 
portal, software, websites, data and print 
services to our partners. Our MoveIT platform 
generated over £1 million in referrals fees 
for our partners and has become a net revenue 
generator for a number of agents who are able 
to earn an additional £1,000+ per transaction 
by offering additional relevant services to 
consumers including conveyancing, mortgages 
and energy switching. As at the end of the 
Period the average number of products per 
partner was up 27% to 1.4.
To reflect the evolution of the business, 
following the recent acquisitions ZPG 
will update its divisional key performance 
indicators (‘KPIs’) from FY2018 onwards. 
In Property, the Company will report 
revenue by Marketing, Software and Data 
and its total number of unique Property 
partners and average revenue per partner 
(ARPP) across the division. 
In Comparison, the Company will report 
revenue by Energy, Communications and 
Finance and its total number of Comparison 
leads and average revenue per lead (ARPL) 
across the division. Full details of the like for 
like performance under the new methodology 
(including acquisitions in both periods) can 
be found on page 40.

Acquisitions and partnerships
We completed four acquisitions during 
the Period and one following the end of the 
Period, enhancing our product propositions 
and cross-sell opportunities to both our 
consumers and partners. 
November 2016: T echnicWeb is one 
of the UK’s leading estate agency website 
design and hosting businesses. This acquisition 
has now been integrated into our wider 
business and gives our partners the ability 
to instantly refresh their online presence with 
a choice of different fully mobile-optimised 
website designs. 
January 2017: Hometrack is the UK’s 
leading provider of residential property 
market insights and analytics. This acquisition 
has helped us to further differentiate our 
products for both consumers and partners 
and has also introduced a new set of partners 
to ZPG including 18 of the top 25 mortgage 
lenders in the UK.
March 2017: ExpertAgent is a leading 
property software provider that provides 
essential systems for the day-to-day 
management of estate agent businesses. 
By integrating with existing ZPG products 
we are able to ensure all of our partners 
benefit from a choice of platforms suitable 
to their requirements.
September 2017: Ravensworth is the leading 
provider of integrated print solutions to over 
4,500 UK estate agent branches. This deal 
further enhances ZPG’s comprehensive 
product offering for its Property partners 
which now includes portal, software, websites, 
on-demand print and data services.
October 2017 (following the end of the 
Period): Money is one of the UK’s leading 
finance comparison websites, helping 
consumers to compare thousands of deals 
in more than 60 product categories 
including mortgages, loans, credit cards, 
bank accounts and insurance. 
We also made further strategic investments 
in Neos; the UK’s first home insurance 
provider that provides the latest connected 
home technology and Zero Deposit; an 
exciting new insurance product that replaces 
the need for tenants to place a security 
deposit at the beginning of a tenancy. 
Additionally we took an equity stake in 
PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based 
business which owns the leading property 
portals across the Middle East and 
North Africa.
These new acquisitions and strategic 
partnerships help to further differentiate 
our products and services.

Property
Revenues in our Property division increased 
by 41% to £122.3 million for the Period, 
driven by strong demand for our additional 
upsell products, further migration of our 
software partners to cloud-based products 
and a continuation of returning portal partners. 
This figure includes a full 12 months of trading 
from Property Software Group, which was 
acquired on 28 April 2016, as well as the 
post-acquisition trading of TechnicWeb, 
Hometrack, ExpertAgent and Ravensworth 
which were acquired during the Period. 
On a like for like basis (including acquisitions 
in both periods) Property revenue increased 
by 9%.
We saw the total number of unique Property 
partners increase by 12% to 24,962 at the end 
of the Period. This figure has been restated 
to align portal and software partner count 
under the same methodology as previously 
announced at the half year
1
. The number of 
UK Agents advertising across our Property 
platform increased by 6% to 14,775 and our 
inventory grew by 5% to over 969k listings 
at the end of the Period.  10 ZPG Plc Annual Report 2017
Chief Executive Officer’s statement and business review continued
Property continued
ARPP increased by 5% to £358 due to 
strong demand for premium portal products, 
the continued migration of software partners 
to cloud-based products and the inclusion 
of acquisitions.
The combination of strong organic 
growth and the integration of acquisitions 
enables ZPG to provide the UK’s most 
comprehensive product offering to its 
Property partners including best-in-class 
portals, software, websites, data and print 
services to help our partners market, manage 
and maximise their business opportunities. 
T raffic to our Property platform has continued 
to grow to over 48 million visits per month, 
up 6% year-on-year (YoY), delivering over 
22 million leads to our Property partners 
over the Period, with appraisal leads up 
33% YoY.
We have substantially enhanced the 
breadth of our Property Marketing 
proposition to include the provision 
of cloud-based websites via TechnicWeb 
(acquired 1 December 2016) and on-demand 
print services solutions via Ravensworth 
(acquired 1 September 2017). 
Our Property Software business is performing 
well with the continued migration of partners 
from desktop to cloud-based products, growing 
from 39% at the end of September 2016 
to 46% at the end of September 2017. 
On 28 February 2017, we acquired 
ExpertAgent, one of the UK’s leading 
cloud-based software providers, further 
enhancing our stable of software products 
and enabling us to offer even more partners 
the ability to generate additional revenues 
through the integration of our MoveIT 
and PropertyFile products into the 
ExpertAgent platform.
The acquisition of Hometrack, the UK’s 
leading provider of residential property market 
insights, on 31 January 2017, formed the 
cornerstone of our Property Data business. 
Since the acquisition, Hometrack has signed 
new deals with TSB and Bank of Ireland 
and extended its relationship with HSBC, 
and now serves 18 of the top 25 mortgage 
lenders in the UK. We have also made good 
progress on the integration of Hometrack’s 
valuation data into the overall business with 
the coverage of Zoopla’s house price estimates 
increasing to over 80% of UK households. 
Comparison 
We experienced strong levels of switching 
across all Comparison verticals, helping our 
consumers to save over £400 million off 
their household bills during the Period. 
Revenues in our Comparison division 
increased 10% to £122.2 million and we 
generated 34.3 million leads for our 
Comparison partners during the Period, 
up 13% YoY. ARPL decreased by 3% to 
£3.57 reflecting a shift in product mix 
within the Communications vertical. 
As a backdrop to this year, we saw 
exceptionally strong switching volumes 
in both the Energy and Communications 
verticals in 2016 from our market-leading 
collective switches, energy supplier price 
cuts and strong competition amongst 
communications suppliers. 
1  The total number of unique Property partners has been restated to exclude 788 legacy software customers of Property Software Group who are not paying for an active support 
contract and to include Zoopla Advertising and Data partners.

In September 2017, the CMA published 
its final report as part of its market study 
into Digital Comparison Tools (DCTs) which 
highlighted how comparison services are 
putting power into the hands of the consumer 
and driving increased competition, highlighting 
the ongoing regulatory support for the role 
of DCTs.
Our talent
We grew our team by 20% over the 
Period from 735 to 882 staff members as a 
result of both organic growth and strategic 
acquisitions. We remain passionate about 
being a market-leading employer and providing 
a world-class environment and continue 
to place significant emphasis on employee 
engagement and wellbeing by investing 
in market-leading benefits. Our London 
headquarters was recently named “One of 
the coolest offices in Britain” by Glassdoor.

Looking ahead
We are very excited by both the underlying 
growth and unique cross-sell opportunities 
we have created in each division as we 
continue our mission of being the platform 
of choice for consumers and partners engaged 
in property and household decisions. We will 
continue to invest in the business for the 
long term and look forward to launching 
more innovative products and services in 
the year ahead.
I would like to welcome all those who have 
joined the ZPG family this year and thank the 
entire team for their continued commitment.

The Energy vertical particularly benefited 
from returning switchers on fixed-term deals 
and supplier price rises, enabling us to reach 
a new milestone of over one million energy 
switches in a 12 month period. 
Our Communications vertical performed 
in line with expectations. Mobile switching 
was boosted by increased competition 
amongst suppliers and ongoing optimisation 
of the consumer experience driving greater 
lead generation and broadband switching 
benefited from strong consumer demand 
whilst fully absorbing the changes to the 
advertising standards which came into effect 
at the beginning of the year. We continued to 
develop our Finance offering and significantly 
enhanced our proposition with the acquisition 
of Money after the end of the Period. 
      Q: How do you target and identify 
strategic opportunities?
A: We continue to be one of the 
fastest growing tech businesses in the 
UK organically. However, we have also 
supplemented that growth via targeted 
M&A and strategic partnerships. We 
look to identify businesses that fit 
clearly within our strategy and can help 
accelerate our growth and market 
position or improve our product 
proposition. We are very ambitious 
and there is a lot we want to do and 
M&A and strategic partnerships have 
played an important role in our growth 
story and strategy to date. See page 12 
for more on our M&A.
      Q: Are you pleased with how the 
rollout of the MoveIt tool is going?
      A: Absolutely, but we’re really only just 
getting started. MoveIt has been 
designed to help provide new revenue 
streams to our partners and boost their 
bottom lines. It is a real win for 
consumers who now get access via 
their agent to recommended services 
and providers and for partners who 
can build their own supplier panels to 
offer far more to their customers, from 
conveyancing and removals to financial 
services products and utilities.
      Q: With almost 1,000 staff in 
multiple locations, how do you keep 
everyone up to date?
A: Making sure we have regular and 
effective internal communications is a 
critical part of ensuring employees are 
engaged and have the tools they need 
to do their job. We have a dedicated 
Employee Engagement Manager whose 
role is to lead on our engagement and 
internal communications strategy. We 
also hold regular divisional and full 
Company meetings and events to 
provide the latest updates on business 
performance, industry news and strategy.
