 CEO’s statement
Alan Foy, Chief Executive Officer
I am pleased to report on the continued strong 
business and financial performance of SMS for 
the year ended 31 December 2017.
2017 has been a year of investment in our business – 
building capacity to grow and deliver for our customers 
in the domestic smart meter rollout which stipulates that 
smart electricity and gas meters are to be offered to every 
home in the UK by the end of 2020. After transforming our 
business model in 2016 through three strategic acquisitions 
to take control of our delivery services, we have accelerated 
our installation activities throughout 2017. As a result we 
have grown to have over 2 million utility metering and data 
assets under management (+62%), generating £57.0m in 
annually recurring index-linked revenue (+38%). The scale 
of this opportunity is clear; we invested more capital in meter 
assets and added more annualised recurring revenue in 2017 
than in the two previous years combined. This is illustrated 
by continued progress to the end of February 2018, where 
our portfolio of meter and data assets stood at 2.26 million 
generating £60.7m of annualised recurring revenue.
In order to grow these installation run rates we have 
continued to invest in inventory across our business. We 
have invested in stock to ensure we are able to meet customer 
demand, we have invested in a new operational delivery hub 
in Doncaster, we have invested in our IT systems and in our 
contact centre, we have invested in our health and safety 
and compliance management, and we continue to invest in 
our field engineer capacity through our accredited training 
school. We were particularly pleased to also add further 
financial capacity to the business through the successful 
completion of a £150m equity placement in November 2017. 
During 2017 we materially began to roll out smart meter 
installations from the eight non-exclusive framework 
agreements with UK domestic energy suppliers signed the 
previous year, and were pleased to add another significant 
framework contract to this list in August. These nine 
customers supply c.2.5 million consumers and on their 
behalf we installed over 370,000 smart meters to take 
our total smart portfolio to over 420,000 meters.
Operational review
During 2017 our gas and electricity meter and data portfolio 
under management increased by 62% from 1.25 million 
to over 2 million assets. Meter assets grew by 65% from 
958,000 to 1,583,000 and data assets grew by 53% from 
294,000 to 449,000 data points.
Our primary financial KPI is our annualised long-term 
index-linked recurring revenue (derived from our recurring 
rental revenue from our installed meter and data asset base), 
which increased by 38% from £41.3m to £57.0m as of the 
end of 2017. This increase of £15.7m compares to an increase 
of £6.6m in 2016, demonstrating the size of the opportunity 
ahead of us, and is the primary rationale behind the £150m 
equity placement, which provides us with the financial 
capacity to take advantage of this opportunity.
This financial KPI is central to our long-term annuity financial 
model as, once installed, these meters provide recurring rental 
revenue for the lifetime of the assets, alongside providing 
maintenance, support and ongoing service opportunities.
Industrial & Commercial (I&C) market
SMS has a strong and proven track record in the I&C market 
and we continue to benefit from continued demand for our 
services, particularly as the government has extended the 
date for which advanced meters contribute to its smart 
rollout obligations to October 2018 in the small business 
segment. This means that not only do we support our 
contracted energy supplier customers to complete their 
meter exchange programmes, but we also then collect and 
provide meter consumption data to them and the end users 
for billing and energy management purposes. Demand for 
these services remains strong, particularly in the micro 
business category, and we expect that to remain the case 
throughout 2018.
In the I&C gas market we continue to deploy the ADM™ 
device, our advanced metering solution, which provides 
half-hourly meter read information and we now have 
103,000 of these operational across the UK (increased 
from 91,000 at the end of 2016). We continue to see 
opportunities for our ADM™ device as part of other UK 
and international utility metering solutions.
Capacity for growth
We invested more 
capital in meter 
assets and added more 
annualised recurring 
revenue in 2017 than 
in the two previous 
years combined.”

UK Domestic market
2017 saw SMS materially embark on the rollout of smart meters 
as part of the UK government’s mandated smart meter 
programme, which requires all UK households and small 
businesses to be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020.
There are c.53 million gas and electricity meters in the UK 
and, as of the end of September 2017, there were 9.44 million 
smart and advanced meters installed in homes and businesses 
across the country. The market share of “challenger” energy 
suppliers in the Domestic market has increased to c.17% at 
the start of 2017 (c.9 million meters) and SMS has framework 
agreements with nine such independent energy suppliers, 
equivalent to up to 5 million of these meter points. We 
continue to engage with all energy suppliers in the market 
and believe we provide an attractive proposition to meet 
their installation deadlines, as we have both the financial 
and operational capacity to provide certainty to deliver 
their mandated obligations.
Energy management services
We provide the tools, expertise and knowledge to help 
our customers make better energy decisions, increase 
their control over their energy expenditure and reduce their 
costs and carbon footprints. Our innovative approach to 
monitoring and managing consumption data allows us to 
extract additional value for our customers and enables us 
to provide an integrated service covering collection and 
analysis of meter consumption data and the utilisation of 
that data to identify and deliver energy reduction activity. 
Our energy services therefore both take advantage of and 
provide opportunities for increased data recurring revenue, 
as well as providing a full range of energy management 
services in their own right. In 2017 we processed and 
analysed 630,000 billing points, delivered over 300 energy 
audits and compliance surveys and continued to identify 
significant opportunities for SMS to deliver turnkey energy 
reduction projects which we expect to accelerate in 2018.
