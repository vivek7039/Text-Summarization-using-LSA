 Dear shareholder
Rank’s aim is to be the UK’s leading multi-channel 
operator. The Group looks to meet this goal through 
delivering against its five strategic pillars:
1. create a compelling multi-channel offer;
2. build digital capability;
3. develop our venues;
4. invest in our brands and marketing; and
5. use technology to drive efficiency and improve 
customer experience.
Further detail of the Group’s progress against these 
pillars can be found in the strategy and KPIs and 
operating review sections of this report.
Financial performance
Following what has been a challenging year for  
our retail businesses, the Group delivered revenue
1
  
marginally up on the prior year. However, a strong 
digital performance and improved cost discipline 
across the Group contributed to a 1% increase in 
operating profit

The Group’s UK digital business had a strong year, 
again delivering impressive revenue

 growth, up 15%. 
The Group’s UK retail businesses had a tough year, 
with declines in visits adversely impacting revenue, 
and ended the year 3%
3
 down on the prior year.
As highlighted in our recent interim results, the 
Group faced increased costs during the year following 
the introduction of the National Living Wage and 
increased property rent costs. The combination of these 
cost increases and challenging UK retail conditions 
resulted in the Group undertaking a detailed review  
of its UK organisational structure and cost base.  
This identified a number of actions that were taken  
to mitigate cost inflation and improve efficiency,  
with the Group finishing the year with total costs 
marginally lower than the prior year. 2017/18 will  
see some benefit from the actions taken during the 
second half of 2016/17 and further details can be 
found in the financial review.

Responsible gambling
As an operator, Rank is committed to minimising the 
potential for harm from gambling. This year we made 
significant steps to increase the scale and impact of 
our response regarding the prevention and detection 
of problem gambling through:
◊ a newly formed board responsible gambling 
committee (see page 68 for more details);
◊ the development of propensity models to detect 
patterns of play symptomatic of problem gambling;
◊ investment in resourcing a team solely focused on 
responsible gambling; and
◊ the development of our new Customer Solutions 
Hub in Sheffield to better support our customers.
More detail of our responsible gambling strategy can 
be found in the operating responsibly section of 
this report.
Management team changes
In September 2016, Alan Morgan joined Rank as 
managing director of Mecca’s retail business. Alan  
has held several senior positions within the hospitality 
and leisure sector. Alan’s last role was chief operating 
and commercial officer for Spirit Pub Company until 
it was sold to Greene King plc.
On Alan’s appointment, Martin Pugh became 
managing director of Grosvenor Casinos’ retail 
business after 21 months as managing director 
of Mecca.
On 30 June 2017, the Group’s human resources 
director, Sue Waldock, retired after 28 years with the 
Group. Following Sue’s retirement, David Balls was 
appointed to succeed her. David was previously 
Grosvenor’s human resources director, and will 
continue to hold this position alongside his 
Group role.
Board changes
I am pleased to welcome Alex Thursby to the board  
as a non-executive director. Alex’s appointment was 
effective from 1 August 2017, when he also joined 
Rank’s audit, remuneration and nominations 
committees. Alex will also chair Rank’s audit 
committee following the conclusion of the  
annual general meeting on 19 October 2017.
I look forward to working with Alex and to  
benefiting from his experience of developing new, 
and transforming existing, businesses with the use of 
technology platforms. Alex’s extensive experience in 
compliance and risk governance in a highly-regulated 
sector will also further strengthen the board.
Owen O’Donnell, currently chair of the audit 
committee, notified the board of his intention not to 
seek re-election at the 2017 annual general meeting 
and will therefore step down later this year having 
completed nine years on the board. I would like to 
thank Owen for his valuable contribution as a director 
during his tenure and his excellent chairmanship of 
the audit committee over the last three years.
Dividend
The board targets a progressive and sustainable 
dividend. The dividend policy reflects the strong cash 
flow characteristics and long-term earnings potential 
of the Group, whilst allowing it to retain sufficient 
capital to fund ongoing operating requirements, 
investment and balance sheet management.
The board is pleased to recommend a final dividend  
of 5.3 pence per share to be paid on 31 October 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 22 September 2017. 
This will take the full-year dividend to 7.3 pence per 
share, a 12% increase on last year. The Group’s dividend 
cover has thus reduced to 2.2 times from 2.4 times in 
the prior year.
Culture
During the year, the Group rolled out its group-wide 
values, STARS, following their launch in July 2016. 
The values of Service, Teamwork, Ambition, 
Responsibility and Solutions reflect the behaviours 
vital for Rank employees to deliver successfully  
against Rank’s strategic goals.
We understand the important role the right culture 
plays in the gaming industry and in addressing our 
responsibilities to our customers and wider society. 
Work continues to bring STARS to life for all of 
Rank’s employees.
I would like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the 
board, to thank Rank’s employees for their continued 
passion and dedication in exciting and entertaining 
our customers.
Current trading and outlook
Trading in the short seven-week period to 
13 August 2017 has been encouraging and in line  
with management’s expectations.
Rank remains in a strong financial position, possesses 
market-leading brands and has a clear strategy for 
long-term growth.
