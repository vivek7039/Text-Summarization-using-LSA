 What’s been the highlight 
of the year?
I began my ﬁrst year as CEO with 
two months visiting our operations 
across the Group and listening to our 
associates. Their enthusiasm for serving 
our customers to the highest standards 
and furthering our strategic objectives 
is extremely motivating. Their passion 
for our business and relentless focus to 
improve it makes the Group what it is 
today: the largest and most successful 
distributor of plumbing and heating 
products in the world. These results are 
a testament to their commitment.
How did the Group perform 
this year?
Ongoing revenue of £14,878 million was 
22.5 per cent ahead of last year (2015/16:  
£12,146 million) and 6.0 per cent ahead 
on a like-for-like basis*. Our gross 
margins were 40 basis points ahead 
of last year as we continue to focus 
on a better mix of higher value-added 
products and services and improving 
our purchasing terms. The Group’s 
operating expenses were 10.1 per cent 
higher at constant exchange rates* which 
included 2.6 per cent from acquisitions. 
Ongoing trading proﬁt was 24.8 per 
cent ahead of last year at £1,032 million 
(2015/16: £827 million) which included 
a £122 million beneﬁt from foreign 
exchange movements. 
Statutory proﬁt before tax of £1,180 million 
(2015/16: £675 million) is after exceptional 
gains from disposals and losses from 
impairments and restructuring costs.
To read more about our ﬁnancial 
performance see pages 26 to 33 and 
38 to 41. 
Why did you change 
the name of the Group 
to Ferguson? 
The majority of our associates work 
in the USA, which also serves nearly 
800,000 customers so it made sense to 
change and align the name of the Group 
with our largest operation. The name 
change will help us continue to raise 
our proﬁle in the USA and establish the 
strongest connection possible between 
our stakeholders and our market leading 
brand there.
Will the Group eventually 
operate exclusively in 
the USA?
The allocation of capital and other 
resources to those businesses capable 
of generating the best returns for 
shareholders is an important principle. 
Funding growth and investment in the 
USA will continue to be our highest 
priority because we generate the best 
returns for shareholders in this market. 
The plumbing and heating market in the 
USA is a huge opportunity for us: it is a 
large, attractive and fragmented market 
with excellent growth prospects. 
Our ﬁrst priority is to ensure that we 
capitalise on this opportunity. However, 
that doesn’t mean our international 
businesses are not important. Whilst  
they are smaller, they make an important 
contribution to the Group. They do not 
detract from our focus and we will continue 
to develop and invest in them too. 
The Group will present 
its 2017/18 ﬁnancial 
statements in US dollars. 
How will shareholders 
beneﬁt from this?
The vast majority of our mix of trading 
proﬁt is generated in the USA so it makes 
sense to report our ﬁnancial results in 
US dollars. Doing so will reduce volatility 
in our results in terms of the translational 
impact of foreign exchange and our 
results will better reﬂect the underlying 
performance of our business. We will 
also give shareholders a choice between 
receiving ordinary dividends in US 
dollars or in pounds sterling which they 
will be able to do from April next year.
Turning to strategy, last year 
you set out three priorities. 
How would you summarise 
your progress on each?
Priority one – generate the best 
proﬁtable growth in the USA. 
The business in the USA had a good 
year especially when you consider the 
headwinds we faced in the ﬁrst half of 
the year from commodity price deﬂation 
and weak industrial markets. 
Continued  
strategic development
I am pleased to report a good ﬁnancial performance in 2016/17  
with all of our ongoing businesses ahead of last year and a particularly  
pleasing result in the USA where we achieved good trading proﬁt growth.  
We also made rapid progress with our strategic development focusing  
more of our resources on the USA to accelerate proﬁtable growth.  
We’re continuing to work hard to improve returns in the international  
businesses, particularly in the UK, and to complete the previously  
announced disposal of our Nordic business.

John Martin
Group Chief  
Executive Our associates responded positively 
and we generated stronger growth 
in the second half with the return of 
modest price inﬂation and a recovery 
in industrial end-markets. As we start 
the new ﬁnancial year we’re generating 
good growth in all of our end-markets 
and the regional picture of growth across 
the USA is encouraging. At the same 
time as accelerating revenue growth 
we’re continuing to expand our gross 
margins through driving beneﬁts of scale 
in areas such as sourcing, increasing 
own label sales and better pricing 
discipline. We’re also continuing to invest 
in future growth by developing more 
efficient operating models including 
world-class e-commerce platforms, 
building our brands and investing in 
adjacent businesses such as Facilities 
Supply. So overall, we feel that we 
have made good progress in driving 
proﬁtable growth.
Priority two – execute UK turnaround 
and repositioning plan. 
We’re about a year into the 
implementation of our transformation 
plan in the UK and we expect that it 
will take a further two years to complete 
so it’s still early days. We’ve made good 
progress this year and we are carefully 
implementing the key initiatives to 
ensure we minimise disruption to our 
customers while continuing to execute 
at pace. 
Milestones next year include continuing 
the reconﬁguration of the branch 
network, logistics and supply chain, 
simpliﬁcation of the product range and 
the roll out of sign on glass technology. 
Drivers of proﬁtable growth
Engaged  
associates  
Well trained, highly engaged 
associates deliver excellent 
customer service. A relentless 
focus in this area drives 
customer loyalty.
Excellent  
service ethic
Our aim is to provide the 
best customer service in the 
industry, consistently across 
branches and regions.
Strong sales  
culture
We will continue to drive 
a strong sales culture. 
When our associates are 
proud and conﬁdent about 
our services, and have the 
best tools, knowledge and 
data to support them, we will 
achieve the strongest results. 
They engage with existing 
and new customers to make 
sure we are front of mind when 
it comes to bids for work.
Organic  
expansion
We want to accelerate 
proﬁtable growth through 
above market revenue  
growth and targeted branch  
expansion.
Bolt-on  
acquisitions
We complement our organic 
growth strategy with bolt-on 
acquisitions which are rapidly 
integrated into our network to 
deliver attractive returns. 
Adjacent 
opportunities
We will utilise our existing 
knowledge, skills and 
infrastructure to capitalise 
on new market opportunities. 
For example Facilities Supply  
and our B2C e-commerce  
businesses. 
Operating model 
and e-commerce 
development
We need to ensure that our 
operating model is agile 
and ﬂexible so it can adapt 
to changing customer needs 
and that we are able to ﬂex our 
cost base when required.
Increasingly our customers 
want to deal with us online and 
we must ensure we have the 
leading e-commerce platform 
in each market in our industry. 
Pricing  
discipline
We will work constantly to 
understand our customers’ 
needs more accurately and 
structure our pricing to be fair, 
consistent and transparent.
Own label 
penetration
We will systematically 
build upon and extend our 
portfolio of private label brands 
which in 2016/17 represented 
6.7 per cent of Group revenue. 
We have an opportunity to 
offer a wider range of own label 
products to our customers, 
some of which attract higher 
gross margins.

(“CRM”) platforms, master data and order 
management systems this year. 
On the logistics and supply chain side we 
added new market distribution centres 
in Euless, Texas and San Francisco, 
California this year and we have plans 
for three more in 2018. We are continuing 
to roll out our university training courses 
in the USA to ensure we have the best 
trained associates in the industry which 
we believe is key to delivering world 
class customer service (see page 22 
for more information).
Throughout this Annual Report we have 
also outlined how our strategy drives 
our thinking in all aspects of how we do 
business from how the Board operates 
and corporate governance to KPIs, 
principal risks and sustainability.
What changes have you 
made in your senior team 
this year?
I’d like to express my own thanks (in 
addition to the Chairman’s comments) in 
recognising the signiﬁcant contributions 
of Frank Roach and Dave Keltner who 
retired this year. Both were fundamental 
to the strong growth and excellent 
returns shareholders have enjoyed 
from the business in the USA over many 
years. I’d like to wish them both well in 
their retirement. 
It’s great to have Mike Powell on board 
as our Group CFO and Kevin Murphy 
as the CEO of the USA. They are 
already making a considerable impact. 
Elsewhere in the senior team in the 
USA we have promoted Bill Brundage 
to CFO and Alex Hutcherson to COO. 
Kevin Fancey has recently joined the 
business as President of Canada. 
I’m delighted that a majority of these 
positions have been ﬁlled through 
internal succession, recognising the 
strong pipeline of talent developed over 
many years within our core operations.
What about sustainability? 
How are you building 
a better business?
We established our “Better Business” 
sustainability programme (see pages 
34 and 35) following consultation with 
shareholders two years ago and we 
strive to make these issues an integral 
part of how we do business. 
This year we have made steady progress 
on our sustainability programme 
and further detail can be seen in the 
Resource and Relationships section 
(pages 22 to 25) and in the Sustainability 
section (pages 34 to 37). However, I am 
disappointed with the deterioration in 
our injury and lost workday rates. I am 
personally engaged with health and 
safety specialists from our businesses to 
ensure that we consider and act on their 
views for best practices and opportunities 
for improvement. There is also regular 
review of health and safety performance 
with our business leaders. We have put in 
place actions to address this deterioration 
and all businesses are committed to 
improving our performance in this area.
What is your outlook for 
2017/18?
US markets continue to be favourable, 
in particular residential and commercial 
markets where we generate the majority 
of our revenue. Group organic revenue 
growth* in the new ﬁnancial year has 
been about 6 per cent. Our business 
is performing well, we have a strong 
balance sheet to support our plans 
and the Board continues to look to the 
medium-term with conﬁdence.
We remain excited about the signiﬁcant 
structural growth opportunities in our 
markets and the potential for revenue 
growth, margin improvement, and 
attractive returns. 
What is your message to 
Ferguson associates?
It is our associates who make the 
difference for our customers and 
ultimately deliver value to our shareholders. 
The strong performance of the Group 
this year is attributable to them. I would 
like to thank each and every one of 
our associates for their dedication, 
enthusiasm and hard work that are the 
key reasons for our continued success. 
John Martin
Group Chief Executive
Once we’ve delivered the plan we are 
conﬁdent we will have built a better, 
more proﬁtable business by simplifying 
our customer propositions, lowering 
the cost base and optimising the supply 
chain and branch network. You can read 
in more detail about the transformation 
plan in the UK operating review on 
page 32. 
Priority three – review Nordic 
operational strategy and restore the 
business to proﬁtable growth.
We concluded the review of Nordic 
operating strategy in March 2017, 
identifying a clear and executable plan to 
return the business to proﬁtable growth. 
However, there are few synergies with 
the rest of the Group’s plumbing and 
heating activities and we have initiated 
a process to exit our building materials 
business in the region which is on track. 
In August 2017 we completed the sale 
of Silvan, the Danish DIY chain.
Thinking about the strategy 
in more detail you also 
talked last year about the 
importance of achieving 
excellent execution in some 
key areas. How are you 
making progress here?
This year we have further reﬁned our 
drivers of proﬁtable growth (see page 17) 
which set out how we will win in our local 
markets, outperform our competitors 
and drive strong ﬁnancial results. 
Our businesses are not homogeneous 
and they require customised strategies 
and each of our business units 
are prioritising them appropriately, 
depending on their local market and 
competitive environment. 
Highlights this year include excellent 
growth in our e-commerce businesses 
which now generates 20 per cent of 
Group revenue. We continue to see 
e-commerce as an efficient way to meet 
the needs of our customers using the 
current branch and logistics network 
without adding extra branch capacity. 
We are gaining momentum in the 
acceleration of own label in our 
businesses and in the USA it now 
represents 6.9 per cent of overall 
revenues (2015/16: 5.8 per cent). We  
are continuing to invest in our operating 
model, including further investment in 
*  The increase or decrease in revenue excluding 
the effect of currency exchange, acquisitions and 
disposals and trading days.
