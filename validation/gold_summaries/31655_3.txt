 Chairman’s statement
A successful year for Hollywood Bowl 
peter boddy
Following our first full year as a listed company, 
I am pleased to report that FY2017 was another 
very successful and exciting one for the Group. 
Revenue continued to grow as more than 
13 million customers came through our doors 
and enjoyed the high-quality, family friendly 
experience we offer. 
Revenue increased by 8.8 per cent to £114.0m, 
driven through like-for-like (LFL) sales growth 
in the core estate, continued investment in 
refurbishments and rebrands, and the opening 
of three new centres – Derby, Southampton 
and The London O2. Our strong balance sheet 
has been further strengthened on the back of 
positive trading, and net debt has reduced to 
£8.1m with the net debt to Group adjusted 
EBITDA ratio at 0.24 times. 
This sector-leading performance, combined 
with our excellence in operations, has enabled 
the Board to recommend a final dividend of 
3.95p per share, as well as a special dividend 
of 3.33p per share. The combination of these 
two dividends, along with our interim dividend, 
means that the business will have returned, 
subject to shareholder approval of the final 
dividend at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, £13.6m (9.08p per share) to 
shareholders in respect of FY2017. With our 
strong balance sheet, we are extremely well 
positioned for continued growth through both 
the existing estate and future openings.
I have taken enormous pleasure in seeing this 
business continue to grow and develop over the 
past 12 months. Focusing on offering a high-
quality bowling experience, with the emphasis 
on family friendly entertainment, has led to 
increased revenue on a LFL basis, with more 
customers than ever before choosing to spend 
their leisure time with us.
I am delighted at the progress we have 
made with our centre investment programme 
with the completion of four transformational 
refurbishments and six rebrands during the year. 
Basingstoke is an excellent example of our 
success. Following a £250,000 refurbishment, 
completed inside just four weeks, the Centre 
Manager has delivered one of the highest 
rates of EBITDA growth within the business. 
“ We are well-positioned to continue to 
create value for all our shareholders.”

Strategic Report We have now completed seven of the Bowlplex 
rebrands, with the final four planned for FY2018. 
The success of the Bowlplex rebrands reinforces 
what an excellent investment Bowlplex was. 
Good corporate governance continues to 
be a focus for the Board as we complete our 
evolution from private equity to PLC ownership. 
Following the Group’s IPO in FY2016, Epiris 
sold its remaining interest (17.8 per cent) in the 
business and we thank Bill Priestley and Ian 
Wood for their continued support through the first 
eight months of listing. Further details on this can 
be found in our Corporate Governance report, 
on page 50, which describes the work completed 
during the year and outlines our areas of focus 
and development for the year ahead. 
The Board recruited an additional independent 
NED, Ivan Schofield, and I was delighted to 
welcome Ivan to our Board with effect from 
1 October. Ivan brings a wealth of European 
and UK knowledge from several multi-site leisure 
businesses. He has completed a thorough 
induction programme and is providing support 
and new perspective, as well as giving challenge, 
to an already high-performing Board. 
A key component of our success is our executive 
leadership team which has done an outstanding 
job during FY2017. The four senior Directors – 
Stephen Burns (CEO), Laurence Keen (CFO), 
Mat Hart (Commercial Director) and Melanie 
Dickinson (Talent Director), have led the company 
with courage, conviction and a relentless desire 
to remain on purpose. The behaviour of the 
senior team provide the leadership and example 
for all colleagues to follow which, coupled with 
team member inductions and our ways of working, 
provides a clear cultural framework for the 
company to operate within. The strength of our 
culture delivers industry-leading performance 
in financial measures as well as the softer, 
subjective measures of customer experience 
and satisfaction.
I am also pleased to report that we have a 
high calibre management team supporting 
the executive leadership team and senior Directors. 
We have recently completed a Senior Leadership 
Development Programme with ten members of the 
team who exhibit the potential and talent to occupy 
senior executive roles. My participation in the 
reviewing and assessing of the final stages of the 
programme gave me great encouragement that 
our succession planning, and future talent 
are being successfully developed.
Our ability to adapt and modify has kept us 
relevant and accurate in delivering customer 
satisfaction, measured by our net promotor 
score and our own customer engagement 
programme. This success can be seen by 
the continual improvement in both measures 
of customer satisfaction.
Outlook
The business continues to invest across 
all parts of the Group – its people, estate, 
technology and brands. We have a strong estate 
which will continue to grow (with one centre, our 
58th, already opened in the new financial year) 
and a number of refurbishments and rebrands 
planned. Our strong balance sheet will allow 
us to undertake our strategic purpose, and 
the Group continues to perform in line with 
the Board’s expectations for the full year. I 
thoroughly enjoy my role as Chairman and feel 
enthused and confident about the year ahead. 
We are well-positioned to continue to create 
value for all our shareholders, with the whole 
team working every day to generate the right 
levels of positive energy to deliver the best 
possible experience for our customers.
I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks 
to all team members across the Group for what 
has been another successful year.
