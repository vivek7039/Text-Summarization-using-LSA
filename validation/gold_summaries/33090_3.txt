Chairman’s Statement
Strategy
Capital	&	Regional	has	made	significant	
progress	in	the	delivery	of	its	strategic	
objectives	this	year.	The	acquisition	
of	a	controlling	stake	in	The	Mall	and	
the	subsequent	successful	tender	
for	units	held	by	minorities	has	been	
transformational	for	the	Group.	
Conversion	to	a	REIT	at	the	end	of	2014	
which	was	followed	by	the	sale	of	its	
German	portfolio,	completed	shortly	
after	the	year	end,	enables	the	Group	to	
focus	all	its	resources	on	its	stated	aim	
to	become	the	UK’s	leading	community	
shopping	centre	REIT.	
The	Group	is	now	well	positioned	to	
achieve	this	objective	based	on	its	
exposure	to	a	high	quality	portfolio	of	
strong	assets,	dominant	in	their	immediate	
catchment,	which	offer	the	potential	to	
generate	significant	income	and	NAV	
growth	based	on	a	programme	of	exciting	
asset	management	initiatives	across	the	
portfolio.
Performance overview
The	timing	of	the	Mall	acquisition	means	
that	both	existing	shareholders	as	well	
as	those	who	participated	in	the	£165	
million	Firm	Placing	and	Placing	and	
Open	Offer	have	been	able	to	benefit	
from	the	upswing	in	investment	markets	
which	has	gathered	momentum	as	the	
year	has	progressed.	The	62.56%	stake	
was	acquired	for	a	consideration	of	£212	
million	at	a	discount	of	5%	to	property	
values	as	at	30	June	2014.
UK	Shopping	Centre	valuations	have	
increased	by	9.3%,	reflecting	a	mix	of	
yield	compression	and	growth	in	valued	
income.	Much	of	this	improvement	
has	taken	place	in	the	second	half	of	
the	year	as	significant	transactional	
activity	has	highlighted	the	attractions	of	
dominant	community	shopping	centre	
assets,	in	particular	the	strong	income	
characteristics.	It	is	the	resilience	of	
these	assets	and	their	ability	to	respond	
to	changing	consumer	behaviour	and	
a	market	increasingly	dominated	by	the	
internet,	retailers’	requirements	and	Click	
&	Collect	that	underpins	this.
It	is	particularly	pleasing	therefore	to	
report	an	increase	in	Net	Asset	Value	per	
share	of	11%	to	60p,	an	increase	which	
fully	takes	into	account	a	doubling	of	the	
number	of	shares	in	issue.	
Pre-tax	profit	was	£67.2	million	compared	
to	the	£7.3	million	reported	in	2013.	
Dividend
For	2014,	the	Board	is	proposing	a	
final	dividend	of	0.60p	per	share	taking	
the	full-year	dividend	to	0.95p	per	
share,	representing	an	increase	of	46%	
compared	to	last	year.
At	the	time	of	the	capital	raise	in	June	
2014,	the	Board	committed	to	deliver	on	
the	basis	of	the	issue	price	of	47p,	a	
dividend	yield	of	at	least	5%	for	the	year	
ending	2015,	and	at	least	6%	following	
acquisition	of	the	minorities	and	the	
restructuring	of	the	Mall	Fund.	I	am	
pleased	to	report	that	all	minorities	were	
taken	out	by	the	start	of	December	and	
the	fund	has	been	successfully	
restructured.	Following	conversion	to	a	
REIT,	the	Board’s	policy	is	to	distribute	at	
least	90%	of	Mall	Operating	Profit,	
allocated	approximately	equally	between	
interim	and	final	dividend	payments.	
Based	on	2014	Proforma	Mall	Operating	
Profit	we	anticipate	this	will	result	in	a	full	
year	dividend	payment	for	2015	of	at	least	
2.9p	per	share.	
Our people
This	year	has	been	exceptionally	
challenging	for	our	management	teams.	
Not	only	have	they	had	to	handle	
transactions	of	particular	complexity	at	
a	corporate	level	but	have	had	to	retain	
their	focus	on	delivering	operational	
excellence	to	our	retail	and	leisure	
operators	whilst	rolling	out	an	ambitious	
asset	management	programme	across	
the	portfolio.	Completion	of	the	Mall	
transaction	now	enables	the	team	to	
focus	all	its	energies	on	successful	
delivery	of	this	plan.	As	I	have	mentioned	
in	the	past,	the	management	platform	is	
key	to	delivery	of	our	growth	ambitions	
and	I	would	like	to	thank	all	our	staff	for	
their	role	in	contributing	to	this	year’s	
progress.
Responsible business
The	value	we	attach	to	our	people	is	
reflected	in	our	continuing	recognition	
as	an	“Investor	in	People”.	A	further

completed	during	the	year.	The	
assessment	highlighted	high	levels	of	
engagement	which	have	again	been	
critical	in	improving	the	way	in	which	we	
support	our	stakeholders	whether	they	are	
retailers,	communities	or	employees.
An	eighth	consecutive	RoSPA	Gold	Award	
demonstrates	our	commitment	to	raising	
health	and	occupational	safety	standards	
across	the	board.
A	10.2%	reduction	in	electricity	and	
gas	consumption	not	only	reduces	
the	Group’s	environmental	impact	but	
contributes	towards	improving	efficiency	
which	directly	benefits	our	retailers	and	
leisure	operators.	Further	details	are	set	
out	in	the	Responsible	Business	review	in	
the	Strategic	Report.
The Board
The	Group	has	further	strengthened	its	
corporate	governance	during	the	year	
with	the	appointment	of	an	additional	
independent	non-executive	director,	in	
line	with	the	commitment	made	at	the	
time	of	the	Capital	Raise.	I	am	delighted	
to	welcome	Ian	Krieger	who	joined	the	
Board	on	1	December	2014.	Ian	brings	
a	wealth	of	experience	gained	during	a	
40	year	career	first	with	Arthur	Andersen	
and	then	Deloitte.	Ian	has	significant	
boardroom	experience	in	the	real	estate	
and	retail	sectors	and	has	worked	with	a	
wide	variety	of	companies	throughout	his	
career.	Ian	has	joined	both	the	Audit	and	
Remuneration	Committees.
Philip	Newton	has	indicated	his	intention	
to	step	down	from	the	Board	at	the	
AGM	in	2016,	by	which	time	he	will	have	
served	nine	years	as	a	non-executive	
director.	Philip	will,	until	then,	continue	
to	be	the	Senior	Independent	Director	
and	Chairman	of	the	Remuneration	
Committee.
