Strategic report | Highlights
“The UK public has once again moved 
with Rightmove, spending 11.7 billion 
minutes on Rightmove platforms in 
2017. Our focus and innovation 
continue to make us the place that 
consumers turn to first and that 
property professionals turn to  
most often.
Our customer numbers increased to a 
record high of nearly 20,500, testament 
to our aim to provide customers with 
the most effective marketing exposure 
and the highest quality leads, as well as 
helping to drive efficiencies within their 
businesses through tools and support.
As the industry becomes more digital 
our software has become even more 
valuable to our customers with 90% of 
our Agency members making use of it 
each month. Our market leading 
position, our culture of restlessness, 
and our ambition to make our 
marketplace even more efficient 
means there are many reasons to be 
excited by the opportunities ahead for 
Rightmove, and the Board remains 
confident of making further progress  
in 2018.”
