 Results
For the year ended 30 June 2017 , the Group delivered 
revenue of £352.1m and underlying profit before 
tax of £38.3m, together with an underlying basic 
earnings per share of 55.7 pence.
As set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s 
Statement on pages 8 to 10 and the Financial Review 
on pages 26 to 29, the Group has delivered a resilient 
set of results with marginal growth in underlying 
profit before tax and earnings per share. These results 
are positive in the context of an uncertain political 
and economic climate experienced in the year, 
together with the changes within the automotive 
industry, as many of our customers plan for an 
increasingly electrified future.
The strategy of the Group has been established 
on the need to have a diversified business, both 
geographically and across market sectors. It is 
through the implementation of this strategy in recent 
years that the Group has been able to deliver these 
results, with strong performance from our Rail and 
Environmental consultancy businesses, together 
with our Performance Products business. After an 
unsettled start, the Group saw increasingly strong 
order intake as we progressed through the financial 
year, including electric and hybrid vehicles within our 
Automotive business, ending the year with a record 
order book overall for the Group.
The Group continues to pursue its strategic 
objectives through organic growth and carefully 
targeted acquisitions. The Group’s performance 
against its strategic objectives is outlined on pages 14 
and 15. We also continued to invest in research and 
development (as described on pages 24 and 25), our 
people and our facilities.

Corporate governance
The Board firmly believes that robust corporate 
governance and risk management are essential to 
maintain the stability of the Group and its financial 
health. I am reporting separately on Corporate 
Governance on pages 72 to 81 of this Annual Report.
The Board
As announced on 24 April 2017 , Ian Lee intends to 
step down as Non-Executive Director and Chair 
of the Audit Committee at the close of our AGM 
in November 2017 . I would like to thank Ian for his 
contribution to the Board, not only as Non-Executive 
Director, but also the guidance he brought as Chair 
of the Audit Committee. Bill Spencer has joined the 
Board as Non-Executive Director and it is intended 
that he will succeed Ian Lee as Chair of the Audit 
Committee with effect from the close of the AGM in 
November 2017 . Bill has a wide range of experience 
in senior financial roles and I am confident that his 
experience will be of great benefit to Ricardo.
Dividend
The Board has declared a final dividend of 13.88 
pence per share to give a total dividend of 19.3 pence, 
an increase of 7% on the prior year. This is in line with 
the Board’s policy to pay progressive dividends and 
reflects its confidence in the prospects of the Group.
Outlook
The Ricardo strategy is underpinned by trends which 
will affect an ever-increasing number of people 
around the globe; with a growing population, mass 
urbanisation, poorer air quality, climate change, 
stringent emissions legislation and resource scarcity.
These long-term trends bring with them significant 
change, and Ricardo is a business that thrives on 
change. With a record order book and a good 
pipeline of opportunities across all sectors, the Group 
has the platform for future growth and to address 
these challenges as an increasingly diverse, balanced 
and global Automotive, Rail and Environmental 
consulting business.
