 Destiny Pharma’s strategic aim is to become 
one of the world’s leading developers of novel 
anti-infective drugs.
The Board is committed to progressing 
the Destiny Pharma pipeline with the 
goal of delivering better drug 
treatments for patients and creating 
significant value for shareholders. 
The company is part of a network of 
biotech and pharma companies 
working in this sector and will continue 
to consider partnerships and licensing 
opportunities where appropriate.
Destiny Pharma plans to generate 
income and shareholder value by the 
clinical development and commercial 
exploitation of its proprietary, highly 
innovative anti-bacterial drug platform; 
the XF drug series. The XF drug 
platform is being developed to prevent 
and treat existing and emerging 
superbug infections within and outside 
of hospitals. 
The company’s intellectual property is 
already well established with 94 granted 
and three pending patents within three 
patent families, covering composition of 
matter, novel mechanism of action and 
bacterial biofilm action. The company 
has plans to develop and commercialise 
its pipeline.
Therefore, while Destiny Pharma’s 
strategy is to develop robust 
clinical packages around its drug 
candidates that make them 
attractive to pharmaceutical 
companies to license, the company 
believes it can potentially continue 
to build value through conducting 
late stage clinical development itself, 
ensuring a licensing deal need only 
be struck at the right time and on 
optimal terms for its shareholders.
Additionally, while the market for the 
lead asset XF-73 is initially in the US, 
the need for such a new treatment is 
global and Destiny Pharma also has 
the ability to enter into licensing 
agreements and collaborations for 
other territories in due course. For 
example, the agreement with CMS is 
a broad collaboration to develop the 
company’s assets in the China/Asia 
market. The company will also look to 
enter selected partnership to develop 
its earlier stage assets and apply for 
non-dilutive sources of grant and 
governmental funding, as it has done in 
the past, to assist in the development 
of its portfolio.
The Board believes that the increasing 
governmental pressure and financial 
incentives that are being implemented 
now and possibly in the future by 
leading institutions such as the WHO, 
UN, FDA and G7/G20 will increase 
further the options available for 
profitable commercialisation and 
the generation of shareholder value.

XF-73 is potent against all strains tested of 
Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSAs, killing 
the bacteria so rapidly that no bacterial resistance 
has been observed.

The key potential benefits are significant:
Ultra-rapid bacteria kill
Studies have shown the XF drugs 
killing bacteria in vitro in less than 
15 minutes; faster acting than standard 
antibiotics currently in use.
Ability to kill bacteria in any 
growth phase
This is an important feature as bacteria 
are not always actively growing. 
XF drugs are able to kill bacteria even 
when dormant.
Ability to kill bacteria within 
staphylococcal bacterial biofilms
Biofilms are an increasing problem that 
are poorly treated by current drugs as 
they act as a protective barrier for 
bacteria. They are associated with 
indwelling medical devices (for example, 
heart valves and joint replacements) and 
invasive medical devices (for example, 
catheters and endoscopes).
Active against all gram-positive 
bacteria tested to date and 
selected gram-negative bacteria
This includes clinically important and 
infection-causing strains, such as:
• Staphylococcus aureus; 
• Listeria monocytogenes;
• Propionibacterium acnes;
• Group G Streptococcus;
• Mycobacterium tuberculosis;
• Streptococcus pneumonia;
• Bacillus anthracis;
• Yersinia pestis;
• Acinetobacter baumannii;
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and
• Clostridium difficile.
All existing antibiotic resistant strains 
of gram-positive bacteria tested to 
date are susceptible to XF drugs, 
including MRSA.
No bacterial (MRSA)  
resistance is seen to emerge
No bacterial (MRSA) resistance was 
seen to emerge in a landmark in vitro 
study of bacterial resistance that 
compared XF-73 to standard antibiotics 
currently in use. The bacteria (MRSA) 
did not demonstrate any resistance to 
XF-73 even after 55 repeat exposures 
(being the longest repeat exposure 
study published as far as the company 
is aware). In contrast, MRSA rapidly 
developed significant resistance to a 
range of antibiotics tested. A second 
study using clinical bacterial samples 
from a clinical trial of XF-73 provided 
the first clinical data supporting the 
same “no resistance profile”.
The XF drugs can therefore potentially 
operate within existing antibiotic 
markets and may also be able to 
open new preventative and therapeutic 
drug markets that are closed to, or 
restricted for, traditional antibiotics 
because of the existence and/or 
threat of AMR. This threat means that 
antibiotics have to be used sparingly 
to limit the development of 
bacterial resistance.

12 Multi drug-resistant 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
can be deadly for patients in 
critical care. An estimated 
51,000 healthcare-associated 
infections are caused by this 
bacteria in the United States 
each year.
Clinical data from 
the XF-73 nasal 
programme is strong
Following a review of clinical trial data 
on XF-73 (exeporfinium chloride), it was 
awarded Qualifying Infectious Disease 
Product (“QIDP”) status in October 
2015 by the FDA. Within the QIDP 
award, the FDA also confirmed a new 
US disease indication for XF-73; namely 
the “prevention of post-surgical 
staphylococcal infections”, including 
MRSA. This represents a new US 
market for which no existing product is 
approved. QIDP status identifies XF-73 
as a drug that is intended to treat 
serious or life-threatening infections, 
including those caused by antibiotic 
resistant pathogens.
Destiny Pharma has completed five 
successful Phase 1/2a clinical trials 
with XF-73. The most recent trial was 
conducted in the US and was funded 
by the US government’s expert 
division on antimicrobial drugs, the 
National Institute for Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”), who 
reported the successful outcome from 
this trial in September 2016.
In Europe and the US, the company 
has completed five successful Phase 1 
studies. These trials, in addition to the 
latest US trial, have provided the 
following data supporting an attractive 
new product profile for XF-73.
The recent US study shows the 
potential of XF-73:
• appropriate clinical safety profile;
• well tolerated at multiple doses;
• no drug exposure in the 
bloodstream;
• rapid, anti-staphylococcal action 
in the nose; and
• antibacterial efficacy statistically 
demonstrated over placebo.

13 The medical need to combat 
surgical infections is significant 
Patient carriage of Staphylococcus 
aureus strains, including MRSA, is 
recognised as a growing problem 
and the testing of patients entering 
hospital for surgery is widespread in 
many countries, including the US. 
Landmark outcome studies (Bode et 
al 2010) have demonstrated that 
reduction of all strains of 
Staphylococcus aureus can 
significantly reduce the post-surgical 
infection rate by 60% and reduce 
mortality.
In response to these and other 
findings, in February 2013, the US 
Surgical Infection Society (“SIS”), the 
Society for Hospital Epidemiologists 
of America (“SHEA”), the Infectious 
Disease Society of America (“IDSA”) 
and the American Society of Hospital 
Pharmacists (“ASHP”) published new 
guidelines recommending that in the 
US all Staphylococcus aureus 
(including MRSA) should be 
decolonised in all cardiovascular and 
most orthopaedic surgeries. This 
represents a five to tenfold increase 
in the market size for Staphylococcus 
aureus decolonisation in the US.
In 2014, AHRQ/IDSA/SHEA 
recommended an even more 
aggressive treatment strategy, 
Universal Decolonisation (“UD”) of all 
intensive care unit (“ICU”) patients 
without screening, awarding a Grade I 
(highest) level of evidence rating. 
US hospital groups, including the 
Hospital Corporation of America, are 
now implementing UD for all patients 
entering the ICU. This market has a 
potential patient population of over 
eight million people in the US alone. 
UD of ICU patients represents a 
potentially attractive line extension 
for XF-73 where its rapid anti-bacterial 
action and attractive resistance profile 
could enable this preventative measure 
into the future.
In Europe, similar guidelines exist 
recommending decolonisation of 
Staphylococcus aureus positive 
patients prior to certain surgeries. 
The antibiotic, mupirocin, is often 
used off-label in the US for these 
applications, although it has two key 
disadvantages in that it is slow acting, 
requiring five days of dosing, and 
staphylococcal resistance to mupirocin 
can develop rapidly and become 
widespread. Consequently, many 
guidelines are accompanied with a 
resistance warning related to 
mupirocin use.
In 2016, the WHO published its Global 
Guidelines for the Prevention of 
Surgical Site Infection, which now 
too recommend the screening and 
decolonisation of all Staphylococcus 
aureus strains pre-surgery in high 
risk surgeries.
It is therefore apparent that there 
has been a move from screening 
and treatment of just MRSA carriage 
in patient populations to also now 
include all Staphylococcus aureus 
strains (MRSA and MSSA), an 
approximate five to tenfold 
increase in the number of patients 
who can benefit.

14 The commercial opportunity  
for XF-73 is over a billion dollars
There is a significant market for a new 
drug that can assist in the “prevention 
of post-surgical staphylococcal 
infections”, particularly in the US. 
There are approximately 40 million 
surgeries per year in the US alone, all 
of which expose patients to the risk of 
post-surgical infections. Of these 
patients, Destiny Pharma estimates 
that 14 million are at a higher risk of 
infection as a result of the nature of 
their surgery and the environment in 
which they are treated. These 
estimates are based on a variety of 
sources including the Office of 
National Statistics (“ONS”), National 
Health Service (“NHS”) data and 
various medical articles and journals. 
Therefore, including the potential 
future use of XF-73 within the ICU 
the company believes markets totalling 
at least 20 million patients per annum 
exist in the US alone.
The market analysis undertaken by 
Destiny Pharma and its specialist 
consultants supports the view that 
XF-73 could achieve annual peak sales 
in the US alone of over $1 billion and 
peak sales in Europe and the Rest of 
the World could be $500 million for 
the initial indication of “prevention of 
post-surgical staphylococcal 
infections” alone.
Destiny Pharma has undertaken 
independent market research of the 
product profile of XF-73. This study 
reported that the sample of 66 US and 
EU treaters (surgeons, infectious 
disease specialists and ICU specialists) 
and payers (hospital medical directors, 
pharmacy services directors, 
microbiologists and clinical directors) 
who were consulted, confirmed that 
XF-73’s target product profile is 
superior when compared to mupirocin, 
with the potential to replace mupirocin 
as the preferred treatment.
Destiny Pharma believes that there 
is significant demand for the XF-73 
product and have identified the 
following additional drivers for adoption:
• current practice guidelines have 
identified patient populations that 
can benefit while highlighting that 
antibiotic resistance as an issue with 
current products;
• from 2017, US general, acute-care 
and short-term hospitals with 
the highest MRSA infections 
will have 1% of their Medicare 
reimbursements withheld;
• on 20 September 2016, the UN 
General Assembly called for new 
drugs to tackle antibiotic resistance;
• US hospital administrators are keen 
to reduce infection to ensure high 
ratings in rankings tables;
• XF-73, having QIDP approval, 
benefits from five years of extra US 
market exclusivity;
• XF-73 could be the first drug 
approved into a new US indication 
with first to market advantages; and
• XF-73 has both QIDP and Fast Track 
regulatory status in the US.
As XF-73 is differentiated from 
antibiotics due to its superior bacterial 
resistance profile, it is likely that its use 
can be widespread, preserving antibiotic 
use and could potentially be used 
without the need for bacterial screening. 
In this aspect, XF-73 can be viewed as 
a preventative pharmaceutical more 
akin to vaccines than antibiotics.
XF-73 has the opportunity to become 
the first drug approved in the US for 
the new indication “prevention of 
post-surgical staphylococcal 
infections” and will only need to be 
compared to placebo at Phase 2b and 3 
(as no comparator exists) and could 
become the benchmark against which 
all future would-be competitors will be 
measured. This is a major attribute and 
will help drive the clinical programme 
and also the commercialisation of 
XF-73 in the US.
Global peak 
annual sales 
of XF-73 are 
projected at 
around 
$1.5 billion

15 Destiny Pharma plans to continue to 
develop XF-73 for the prevention of 
Staphylococcus aureus VAP. The use 
of an XF-73 oral cavity/throat 
treatment to prevent VAP, together 
with the potential for use of the 
product as an adjunct to nasal 
treatment in mechanically ventilated 
patients is an attractive opportunity.
XF-70 for the treatment of 
antibiotic resistant gram positive 
and gram negative bacterial burn 
wound infections
In 2016 the global topical antibacterial 
market was estimated at $6 billion.
Destiny Pharma has a strong 
pre-clinical, in vitro and in vivo, 
infection model data set which 
demonstrates the efficacy of topically 
applied XF drugs against gram positive 
and gram negative bacteria, including 
MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Acinetobacter baumannii. In some 
cases, unformulated XF drugs have 
been shown to be as active as existing, 
marketed antibiotics. 
Destiny Pharma plans to develop 
XF-70 towards a therapeutic dermal 
infection indication, and will deliver 
a pre-clinical data pack that could 
support a wide range of indications 
including impetigo, acne, atopic 
dermatitis, bacterial infected skin 
lacerations, candida skin/vaginal 
infection and treatment of serious 
bacterial burn wound infections.
The company already has data 
supporting the efficacy in serious 
bacterial burn wound infection models 
in studies conducted in association 
with the US Department of Defense.
Biofilm product opportunities
Destiny Pharma was granted a US 
biofilm patent on 3 May 2016 and will 
seek to develop and exploit product 
opportunities including research 
collaborations based around this 
emerging market. XF-73 and XF-70 
have shown the ability to act against 
Staphylococcus aureus within formed 
biofilms which are protective against 
traditional antibiotics. 
Bacterial biofilms are implicated in 
chronic and recurring infections and 
there is a growing understanding of 
their role and the value in developing 
treatments that can address this issue 
in tissue and medical device related 
infections. For example, bacterial 
biofilm is implicated in chronic lung 
infection in conditions such as cystic 
fibrosis where Staphylococcus aureus, 
including MRSA and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa are the most common 
pathogens in this condition.
Results already gained from early 
stage research have also identified 
product opportunities in Clostridium 
difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infections and bio-threat pathogens 
including anthrax, anthrax spores and 
plague from joint studies with the 
Defence Science and Technology 
Laboratory and the US Department of 
Defense. This is an area of high priority 
for the US government with the 
ongoing threat from bioterrorism.
CEO’s operational and strategic review continued
Exciting earlier pipeline of anti-infective programmes
Several additional projects have been identified for the XF platform
Destiny Pharma plans in the next 
two years to develop two additional 
products from its pipeline towards 
clinical development, and to conduct 
earlier stage research work in respect 
of biofilm action.
XF-73 for the prevention of 
staphylococcal pneumonia in 
hospital patients
There is a growing understanding of 
the link between patient carriage of 
Staphylococcus aureus with the risk 
of Staphylococcus aureus 
ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(“VAP”). Hospital acquired pneumonia 
(“HAP”) is a pulmonary infection that 
develops in patients hospitalised for 
more than 48 hours, either in the ICU 
or in other hospital wards. VAP is a 
subset of HAP that occurs in 
mechanically ventilated patients more 
than 48 hours after tracheal intubation. 
VAP accounts for approximately 90%. 
of ICU HAP and afflicts up to 20% of 
ICU patients who receive mechanical 
ventilation.
The crude in-hospital mortality rate of 
patients with Staphylococcus aureus 
infection with MRSA and MSSA are 
similar, between 29% and 36%, while 
costs for MRSA VAP are on average 
$40,734 per patient and the costs for 
MSSA VAP are $36,523 per patient.
Staphylococcus aureus is the leading 
cause of VAP in Europe and ranks 
alongside Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
as the greatest cause of VAP in US 
hospitals. There are over 1.7 million 
mechanically ventilated patients in the 
US each year who could benefit from 
preventative treatment. There are up 
to 300,000 VAPs per annum in the US 
which cost up to $1.5 billion each year 
to treat.
• A biofilm is an extra-cellular 
matrix of exo-polysaccharides, 
which bacteria form when in 
contact with a host tissue or 
indwelling medical device.
• Biofilms are notoriously resistant 
to antibiotic therapy; they form 
an impenetrable barrier to 
antibiotics.
• Slower growth rate of bacteria 
in biofilms is fundamental to 
antibiotic resistance.
Destiny Pharma plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
16 Outlook
The funds raised at the IPO will 
provide Destiny Pharma with the 
capital to develop its lead drug asset 
XF-73 through the proposed US 
clinical Phase 2b programme 
delivering a robust package for 
partnering and/or further 
development into Phase 3, which is 
the final stage of clinical development. 
The funds raised will also be used to 
develop new clinical candidates from 
its focused, pre-clinical pipeline and to 
capitalise on the commercial 
opportunities including partnering 
and licensing.
In the Board’s opinion, XF-73 has 
the potential to break the commercial 
paradigm which besets antibiotics. 
Its ‘no resistance’ characteristic 
enables widespread use (unlike 
antibiotics where use is restricted 
due to the fear of AMR). As about 
a third of the population carry the 
infection-causing bacteria 
Staphylococcus aureus 
asymptomatically, and XF-73 is 
designed to kill these bacteria in the 
patient ahead of surgery (preventing 
post-surgical infection), a large new 
market exists. The new indication has 
been recognised by the FDA through 
the QIDP status award.
Destiny Pharma believes that XF-73’s 
preventative disease indication is 
similar to a vaccine approach and 
could lead to the majority of patients 
being treated prior to surgery. There 
are a number of drivers for the 
adoption of this approach, including 
new guidelines and financial penalties 
for US hospitals with high MRSA 
infection rates.
Additional assets from the XF drug 
platform will also be progressed in the 
areas of prevention and treatments for 
staphylococcal pneumonia, serious 
bacterial burn wound infections and 
bacterial biofilm associated infections. 
Destiny Pharma will also establish a 
number of discovery stage research 
programmes through collaborations 
and where possible seek non-dilutive 
funding support.
Following the IPO and the completion 
of our CMS collaboration agreement, 
the outlook for Destiny Pharma is 
strong and our team is committed 
to delivering our strategy and 
building value.
Destiny Pharma has generated 
preliminary data on the potential 
for XF drugs to enhance existing 
antibiotic activity by co-administration 
and plans to extend these studies 
through research collaborations to 
determine if important antibiotic life 
can be reinvigorated and bacterial 
resistance combated.
The company also plans to extend 
studies of the XF drug mechanism 
of action, which may result in further 
optimisation and the ability to target 
microbial pathogens beyond bacteria 
and deliver new intellectual property.
The Directors are keen to explore the 
possibility for accelerating progress on 
some of these earlier programmes by 
entering into strategic co-development 
partnerships with sector experts. 
Concurrently, Destiny Pharma will 
continue to apply for non-dilutive 
funding grants when suitable structures 
are available. It is also the company’s 
intention to apply for US QIDP status 
for its other pipeline programmes.
