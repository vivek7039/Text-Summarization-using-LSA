Agriculture
The Agriculture division has experienced 
a challenging year. Lower farming profits 
in the USA, resulting from lower cattle 
prices, impacted sales volumes of our 
feed blocks. However, this was partially 
offset by a recovery in UK Agriculture  
as farmgate milk prices and farmer 
confidence improved. 
FEED BLOCKS
In the USA, pressure from lower cattle 
prices impacted our feed block business, 
with sales volumes, including joint 
ventures, down 4.1% year on year.  
As anticipated, the second half of the 
year saw the beginning of a recovery, 
resulting in volumes being marginally 
ahead of previous expectations.  
This gradual recovery is expected  
to continue in the current year. 
Our new low moisture feed block plant 
in Tennessee is expected to be fully 
operational by the end of December 
2017, providing access to new markets 
across the Eastern and South Eastern 
states of the USA and providing 
additional capacity as the market 
recovery continues. 
UK feed blocks performed well, 
demonstrating the strength of our 
brands, despite milder spring weather 
conditions which caused a slowdown  
in the second half. 
Overall, feed block sales were down  
2.1% on last year. 
We continue to develop opportunities  
to expand geographically. In South 
America, our trials at FAI Farms  
(a commercial research institute in Brazil) 
and the Instituto de Zootecnia near 
Ribeirao Preto, São Paulo State are 
progressing well. Completion of the 
trials is expected in the current financial 
year and initial results are encouraging. 
In New Zealand we have incorporated  
a subsidiary company and established  
a direct sales operation distributing  
to farmers through key merchants  
as we make progress towards 
establishing our feed block products  
in this important market.
Investment in research in all our 
territories continues as we demonstrate 
the continued value of our existing 
brands such as Crystalyx® and SmartLic® 
as well as the introduction of new 
products, such as FlaxLic® and 
Megastart®. The continued investment  
in research which confirms the efficacy 
of our products is the foundation  
for the success of our feed block 
business globally, and sets us apart  
from our competitors.
Despite difficult market conditions and a disappointing 
performance in our UK Manufacturing business, we have 
continued to invest in our business, which is consistent  
with our vision to be recognised as a truly international  
business at the forefront of innovation and technology  
across Agriculture and Engineering.

UK AGRICUL TURE
The recovery we witnessed in the first 
half in UK Agriculture continued into  
the second half with manufactured feed 
volumes, which includes compound feed 
and blends, increasing 10.9% year on 
year, against a national market rise of 
6.6%
1
. This is a strong performance which 
demonstrates the value we bring to our 
customers. On 5 June 2017 we acquired 
the trade and assets of Mortimer Feeds,  
a feed merchant business operating 
principally in Cheshire. This acquisition 
adds incremental feed volumes,  
converts some existing merchant 
business into direct sales, and is in line 
with our strategy of strengthening  
our presence in current locations and 
leading in dairy nutrition.
The retail business has delivered another 
strong performance, with the country 
store network across Northern England 
and Southern Scotland reporting  
an increase of 0.8% in like-for-like  
sales and a 2.2% increase in total sales 
following the opening of Penicuik,  
East Midlothian in December 2016  
and the acquisition of Horse and Pet 
Warehouse Ltd, Ayr in March 2017. 
On 31 October 2017 we acquired the 
entire issued share capital of Pearson 
Farm Supplies Ltd, an agricultural retail 
business with locations across Yorkshire, 
Lancashire and North West Wales.  
This will significantly expand our 
customer base, bring together key 
people and provide key synergies across 
the Group. The acquisition takes our 
total retail footprint to 43 locations.
The strategy for the retail business 
remains the expansion of our geographic 
reach into adjacent territories, 
redeveloping existing facilities and 
expanding our product offering to meet 
the needs of our customers, particularly 
those located in rural communities.  
As part of our strategy, we continue  
to ensure that our retail stores have  
the best possible locations alongside 
livestock auction markets and in key 
agricultural locations. 
In addition, we had a strong 
performance in agricultural machinery 
where sales achieved a record level, 
increasing 27.8% year on year. New 
tractor sales were up 42% year on year 
against a market increase of 21% and our 
market share for key brands increased  
by 3% to 19%.
The oil distribution business saw sales 
volumes decline 3.5%, which was  
a resilient performance given the mild 
weather conditions, with ambient 
temperatures during winter and spring 
higher than the prior year. Our continued 
good performance can be attributed  
to our product offer and excellent levels 
of customer service. 
AGRICULTURE OUTLOOK
Farmer confidence has returned during 
the year as a result of the increase  
in farmgate milk prices and improved 
revenues from beef and sheep leading 
to a recovery in farm incomes. We expect 
farm incomes to continue to improve 
throughout the current financial year. 
The uncertainty following the outcome 
from the EU referendum remains, 
particularly relating to the future of the 
single farm payment and support for  
UK farmers. However, in the short-term 
UK livestock and dairy prices have 
responded positively due to a number  
of factors, including the devaluation  
of sterling. 
The division is well placed both 
operationally and geographically to 
adapt to future market conditions whilst 
continuing to support the needs of our 
farming customers.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
The Engineering division had  
a disappointing year with a poor 
performance in UK Manufacturing due 
largely to a delayed contract. Despite 
this, the division made significant 
strategic progress with the highlights 
being the acquisition and integration  
of STABER into our remote handling 
business and the acquisition of NuVision. 
This takes the business into new markets 
in the USA, increases the focus on 
nuclear and its adjacent markets, and 
brings new technology and capabilities 
to the Group. 
UK MANUFACTURING 
Revenues declined in the year as a result 
of the contract delay in the first half  
of the year. As announced on 30 March 
2017, efforts to mitigate the effects of 
that delay were only partially successful. 
The impact of the reduction in revenues, 
together with poor margins on work 
completed during the year, largely  
as a result of the continuing pressures  
in the oil and gas markets, resulted in  
a loss in our UK Manufacturing business. 
We have strengthened the management 
team in the UK Manufacturing business 
in the final quarter of the financial year. 
Also, we were pleased to report on  
20 July 2017 that the delayed contract 
had been signed. This will be delivered 
throughout the current financial year 
and into the next financial year. 
Additionally, work within the  
Sellafield Vessels and Tanks Category 
Management Framework is expected to 
commence during the current financial 
year. This contract, with a value of £48m 
at the time of the tender, secures design 
and manufacturing services relating  
to Sellafield’s highest complexity vessels 
for a 10 year period. This underpins  
the growth and development of our  
UK Manufacturing business over the 
medium and long term. 
The Group’s focus on the nuclear 
industry has continued although, as 
previously reported, the pivot by part of 
the manufacturing business away from 
oil and gas to nuclear and its adjacent 
markets, including defence, has been 
slower than initially anticipated due to 
the aforementioned contract delay. 
The UK nuclear industry has benefited 
from the Government’s commitment  
to both the ongoing decommissioning 
process and the future construction  
of new nuclear power facilities. 
Consequently, the division is seeing  
an increase in the level of activity and 
engagement with the new build sector 
and is establishing itself as a strategically 
relevant partner to the international 
effort behind the new build programme.
USA ENGINEERING
On 7 August 2017, we announced the 
acquisition of USA-based engineering 
business NuVision Engineering, Inc. 
which operates from locations in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Charlotte, 
North Carolina.  
The Group acquired the company for  
an initial consideration of $11.5m (£8.8m), 
before adjustments for working capital, 
and a total consideration of up to  
$20m (£15.4m) dependent upon future 
financial performance. NuVision is 
recognised internationally as a leading 
technology and engineering solutions 
business specialising in supplying 
products and services at nuclear and 
power plant facilities, government  
waste remediation facilities and in waste  
clean-up programmes. 
The acquisition provides a strong 
foothold into USA nuclear markets  
and will enable significant revenue 
synergies with the Group’s existing 
engineering businesses, including the 
opportunity to market Wälischmiller’s 
products in the USA. NuVision is already 
a key supplier under a major nuclear 
contract being delivered by the UK 
Manufacturing business. 
REMOTE HANDLING 
During the year the remote handling 
business performed ahead of the  
Board’s expectations with high levels  
of activity, particularly in relation  
to the manufacturing of products  
for the Chinese market. Furthermore,  
the order book is at its highest level  
for several years.

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
In January 2017 we were notified that 
the Group had won the tender for the 
supply of a number of manipulators, 
including three A1000s, 36 A100s and 
four A200s, into China. Manufacturing 
commenced during the second half  
of the year and continues in the current 
financial year. This is particularly 
encouraging given the significant 
increase in the planning and 
construction of new nuclear power 
plants and forms part of the Chinese 
Government’s strategic plan to remove 
its current reliance on coal generated 
power. As part of that plan, power 
companies are mandated to include 
remote handling capability within  
the design of a new nuclear power 
station in order for it to be able  
to handle waste and potential future  
decommissioning requirements.
During the year it was confirmed by 
Statoil that funding would continue to 
be supplied for the Demo 2000 project 
which involves the development of  
a lightweight Telbot® especially for use 
on oil and gas platforms and which is 
designed to reduce risk and downtime 
during tank inspections.
On 24 October 2016 we acquired 
STABER GmbH, one of the primary 
suppliers to Wälischmiller, our German 
remote handling business, including  
all of its associated intellectual property 
for a total cash consideration of €7.9m 
(£6.98m). STABER and Wälischmiller have 
been working together closely for over 
50 years and its acquisition will help 
drive efficiencies and profitability within 
the division. 
The first stage of integrating STABER 
into Wälischmiller has been successfully 
completed, with key personnel being 
retained and working together effectively, 
and the extension of the premises  
in Markdorf, Germany is underway.  
This will provide additional flexibility  
and capacity, and consolidates both 
operations into one facility which will 
complete the integration process and  
be of significant benefit. 
Following the acquisition of NuVision  
in August 2017, which has its own range  
of heavy-duty manipulators, the Group 
has one of the most technologically 
advanced ranges of remote handling 
equipment in the world.
MANAGEMENT
To maximise opportunities and synergies 
following the strategic progress made 
during the year, we have strengthened 
the management in the Engineering 
division through the appointment of a 
Divisional Managing Director to oversee 
Engineering operations across the Group.
ENGINEERING OUTLOOK
We continue to invest in the ongoing 
development of our products and 
services within the Engineering division 
to ensure that they remain at the 
forefront of innovation and technology. 
When combined with our existing 
decommissioning portfolio and strong 
pipeline of current and potential 
contracts, the Group is well positioned 
to benefit from future opportunities and 
developments, particularly in the nuclear 
sector where our reputation as a premium 
supplier of high integrity equipment  
is already well established. 
TIM DAVIES 
Chief Executive Officer 
22 November 2017
The acquisition of NuVision Engineering, Inc. 
gives us a strong foothold into USA nuclear 
markets and will enable significant revenue 
synergies with the Group’s existing 
engineering businesses.
