Chief Executive’s Statement 
 
Operational Review 
accesso has once again made significant strides in 2017. We continue to win a range of business across the Group and geographic 
expansion continues at a good pace. New clients of varying size have deployed accesso technology for this first time this year, while 
on a geographic view, deployments have also gone live for the first time in India, Singapore, Thailand, Ireland, Portugal and New 
Zealand.  
 
We also continue to progress well with the rollout of technology related to our agreement with Merlin Entertainments Group Ltd 
(“Merlin”). With the majority of the initial investment required to deliver on that project now behind us, we are well placed to begin 
benefiting from the longer-term international expansion opportunities that we always envisaged would be available as a result of 
enhancing our global technology offering, establishing regional support networks and integrating with local payment and regulatory 
systems.  
 
We have also spent part of the year ensuring the smooth integration of Ingresso and TE2 into the accesso family. These acquisitions 
have improved both the breadth and impact of our offering and are already being set to work with our existing products to improve 
the range of solutions we can offer our customers.  
 
People 
We are acutely aware that our ability to attract and retain the best available talent across our organisation is vital to our ongoing 
success, and during the year we have introduced a number of initiatives with this goal in mind. We continue to expand our workforce 
to meet the growing demands of our scaling business and, our year end non-seasonal employee count, including those who joined as 
part of the acquisitions, totaled nearly 500 at the end of the year, up from 362 in 2016. To better integrate our functional teams we 
are currently combining three of our US East Coast offices into our largest office in Lake Mary, Florida, and we have also launched a 
substantial computer-based training initiative available for all staff. I want to thank the whole team for its commitment and endeavour 
during 2017, and we look forward to welcoming many more new faces in 2018.    
 
Established Verticals 
accesso sees its traditional verticals as theme and water park operators. We are proud to have many of the largest operators in this 
area as clients, deploying multiple product offerings across what remains a vital and growing part of our business.  
 
During 2017 we saw a number of positive developments in these verticals, with none more important than the continued roll out of 
accesso Prism, our state-of-the-art in-park wearable device. In May, accesso Prism was successfully installed as the backbone of the 
world’s first 100% queueless water park, bringing to life a long-held company ambition that has the potential to redefine our industry 
with long queue lines remaining the single greatest dissatisfaction metric amongst theme park attendees worldwide. The device has 
been well received across the board and was recognised as the most impactful new product globally by IAAPA at its Attractions Expo 
event in Florida in November. During the period accesso Prism also proved its ability to act as a replacement for our Qbot device in a 
number of successful trials, and we expect the device to be rolled out across large parts of our existing accesso LoQueue customer 
base over the next 12 to 24 months. We are excited about the opportunities that this should present to enhance revenue within our 
existing estate.  
 
Another important dynamic in these markets is the growing desire among some operators to move substantial parts of their guest 
bases to pre-committed season pass arrangements. Supported by accesso Passport, their ability to utilise monthly payment plans 
accelerated the trend. While the adjustment has led to certain changes in guest visitation behaviour, the strength and versatility of 
accesso Prism’s commercial model opens up a range of new in-park revenue opportunities. 
 
In addition to the continued deployment of our technology to Merlin, we were delighted to secure an agreement with Village 
Roadshow Theme Parks in Queensland, Australia, with four of their attractions now live with accesso Passport for ticketing, 
eCommerce and point-of-sale. This installation also included Ingresso to support the client’s third-party ticket distribution efforts, 
underscoring the value of our combined solution offering.  Wins like these are particularly important as we seek to broaden our reach 
in the Asia-Pacific region, which is now supported by offices and technology infrastructure in the region and provides a good example 
of our ability to add incremental new business on the back of global investments undertaken in recent years. The proportion of our 
queuing revenues coming from Europe also continues to increase and we have secured a commitment to add the Qsmart mobile app 
to three European properties, ensuring that all of our European queueing clients can now access our services through their mobile 
device.  
 
Adjacent Verticals 
The acquisitions of accesso Siriusware and accesso ShoWare supported both our technology offering within our established vertical 
and provided the impetus for accesso to break out beyond its traditional markets into new verticals including ski resorts, cultural 
attractions, tours and live event ticketing. Our ambition is to increase penetration in these areas and we were able to make excellent 
progress against this aim during 2017. 
 
accesso ShoWare continued to make excellent strides adding 55 new customers during the period, with 38 coming from North America 
and 17 coming from Latin America. Among these new customers were Welk Resorts, a collection of premiere destination and travel 
resorts in California; SLS Las Vegas, a luxury boutique hotel and Casino; Charleston Battery, a football club from South Carolina; and 
Museo Anahuacalli, a museum in Coyocan, Mexico. Also in Mexico, accesso Siriusware secured its largest ever agreement with 
Experiencias Xcaret, which is rolling out 400 salespoints across its 6 luxury ecotourism venues. accesso Siriusware also won its second 
European contract during the period with Watercourse Distillery Limited in Ireland, which owns the Jameson whiskey brand. This   accesso Technology Group plc 
7 
 
Chief Executive’s Statement (continued) 
 
represented a joint win with accesso Passport, which also is now used by the NFL Experience in Times Square, New York and The CNN 
Studio Tour in Atlanta, Georgia. 
 
Within accesso ShoWare we continue to make good progress in the live event ticketing space, supporting concerts given by Ed Sheeran, 
Bruno Mars, John Mayer, Green Day and Jack Johnson among others during the period. We also rolled out our complete solution for 
Toluca FC and its new 31,000 seat football stadium.  
 
Greenfield Opportunities  
Last year’s acquisitions of Ingresso and TE2 have brought a range of new capability to accesso and, in addition to supporting our 
product offerings in our existing verticals, have enabled the Group to make its first steps into a new set of entirely greenfield areas 
including London’s West End Theatre market and the Healthcare space.  
 
With Ingresso as part of our offering, we are now able to tap in to the vast third-party distribution market, helping our clients find new 
routes to buyers for their tickets while increasing the platform’s ability to serve its existing clients by significantly enhancing the range 
of inventory it can access. We have established connectivity between Ingresso and pre-existing accesso systems and the initial accesso 
clients’ inventory is now available via Ingresso’s global distribution system. This acquisition has also helped us reach further into 
London’s fragmented West End Theatre market and will, over time, allow accesso to exploit the significant inefficiencies that exist 
within the travel and leisure industry.  
 
Ingresso delivered calendar year-on-year growth of 67%, achieved with a strong showing across all its major channels and we continue 
to invest in their distribution technology paying particular attention to its high-volume, high-speed sale capabilities. Whilst our 
distribution partner, Amazon, announced post-period end that they are discontinuing their ticketing distribution business, we have 
been delighted to welcome major customer wins from Ticketmaster UK and Superbreak.com, a major UK tour operator. We see 
broader future opportunity with the focus we have made on integrating with our other accesso offerings and facilitating access to the 
wide range of third-party distribution channels that are important to our customers. As the distribution landscape continues to evolve 
and modernise, a key part of our strategy is to underpin our core ticketing technologies with multi-point distribution capabilities and 
Ingresso provides that critical infrastructure and know-how. 
 
The July acquisition of TE2 enables accesso to offer highly personalised user experiences to our customers, leveraging data-led insights 
to capture, model and anticipate guest behaviour and preferences. As previously reported, TE2 has performed well ahead of its 
business plan since acquisition, generating greater than expected levels of non-recurring services revenue and operating with lower 
costs than expected. We have made significant progress with the integration of our HR, payroll and sales & marketing teams and have 
focused on a range of product integrations initially with accesso Passport. We expect to see tangible signs of progress on this combined 
offering later in 2018.  
 
After the period end we also announced a significant win for TE2 with the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS), a six-hospital system in 
Detroit, Michigan. HFHS will leverage TE2 to digitalise and personalise the entire patient journey, using its technology to build unique 
patient profiles which can be easily integrated with existing electronic medical records. This process will enable healthcare providers 
to offer convenient and frictionless experiences in real-time, with features such as wayfinding support, concierge services, smartphone 
bill-payments and patient feedback and communication. This groundbreaking partnership will begin with technology pilots in Autumn 
2018, in preparation for full launch to coincide with the grand opening of the Brigitte Harris Cancer Pavilion, the new home of the 
Henry Ford Cancer Institute, expected in 2020.   
 
This agreement marks a bold new step for accesso beyond the leisure, entertainment and cultural markets that has been its home, 
and provides a significant endorsement of the versatility and range of technology within the Group’s portfolio.  
 
Investing in technology 
accesso aspires to be the premier technology solutions provider to the verticals it serves. To maintain this position, we continue to 
invest heavily to expand the functionality, effectiveness and robustness of our technology across our full range of offerings. In addition 
to development work carried out during the period on accesso Prism and a range of longer-term initiatives to support our growth into 
the future, 2017 saw a host of significant enhancements to our platforms. 
 
In particular, we continue to invest in readying our products for the international expansion driving our growth. During the year we 
introduced localised user-interface elements that now allows for distribution of accesso Passport in 20 languages, and added enhanced 
support for Global Sales Tax configuration including tax tiers, tax percentages and GL code linking. We also expanded our support of 
alternative payment solutions, added true-multi-language support for accesso Siriusware and opened a new datacentre in Sydney.  
 
In accesso Passport we launched Passport Exchange: our new platform enabling fully integrated third-party ticket sales, and introduced 
a full-featured API for clients desiring more direct integration. Through a new booking portal, we also now offer service management 
of date and time-based tickets helping to mitigate risk for whose operations may be impacted by cancellations due to weather or other 
external factors. 
 
We also continued to improve our accesso ShoWare product, enhancing our dynamic pricing capability, completing an important 
PayPal integration including PayPal Credits, improving event messaging technology and seatmap wizards.

Chief Executive’s Statement (continued) 
 
Information Security 
Another increasingly important element of our business relates to information security, which is at the heart of all development 
decisions. The business continues to focus increasing levels of resource and technology on initiatives to ensure data minimization, 
more robust monitoring of our applications, enhanced response capabilities and increased staff training across the whole business. 
 
The start of 2018 
accesso is pleased to report that the Group is showing good momentum at the start of 2018. We look forward to a promising year 
ahead.  
 
Financial Review 
accesso continues to deliver strong financial performance as a result of our increasingly global revenue base and diversified product 
portfolio. Our business continues to be driven forward by long term transaction-based agreements with several of the world’s leading 
operators that deliver high-quality and highly-visible revenue underpinned by long-term relationships.  
 
Alternative Performance Measures 
The Board utilises consistent alternative performance measures (“APMs”) in evaluating and presenting the results of the business. 
APMs include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted administrative expenses, adjusted net debt, and adjusted cash from 
operations. A reconciliation of these measures from IFRS is provided below. 
 
The Board views these APMs as more representative of the Group’s performance as they remove certain items which are not reflective 
of the underlying business, including acquisition expenses, amortisation related to acquired intangibles, deferred and contingent 
payments related to acquisitions, changes to earn-out considerations and share-based payments. The APMs help ensure the Group is 
focused on translating sales growth into profit. By making these adjustments, the Group is more readily comparable against a business 
that does not have the same acquisition history and share-based payment policy. Additionally, these are the measures commonly used 
by the Group’s investor base. 
 
Key Financial Metrics 
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 was $133.4m, an increase of 30.1% on the previous year’s result of $102.5m, 
benefitting from our increased global footprint, the broader range of markets we now serve and the acquisition of Ingresso at the end 
of March and TE2 in July. This growth was delivered despite challenging weather events impacting certain clients, an earthquake in 
Mexico City, unprecedented forest fires in California and to a lesser extent, European terror-related incidents. The impact of foreign 
exchange movements on revenue, or costs, was not material. 
 
accesso tracks a number of specific operational metrics that influence Group revenue as follows: 
 
• Total transactional ticket sales, including Ingresso distribution, increased 20.2%, with like for like increasing 14.8% 
• Total ticket volumes, processed via our hosted solutions, increased 30.9%, exceeding 100m for the first time. On a like for 
like basis the increase was 28.0% 
• North America now accounts for 70% of eCommerce ticket volume (2016: 89%), with Europe accelerating to 25% (2016: 9%) 
• 42% of eCommerce volume now takes place via a mobile device (2016: 35%) 
• accesso LoQueue like for like attendance data was broadly flat 
 
The gross profit margin in 2017 was 55.0%, compared to 54.0% in 2016, reflecting the improvement in our mix of revenue towards 
higher margin offerings and a higher level of non-recurring services revenues than in the comparative period. 
 
We estimate that for the full year 81% (2016: 91%) of Group revenue is repeatable in nature. This represents the proportion of Group 
revenue that is derived on a transactional basis plus annual support and annual license revenue. The decrease from 2016 is largely 
driven by the acquisition of TE2, which currently derives the majority of its revenues from professional services, but remains at a level 
that gives the Board the continued confidence to innovate to extend our product leadership and provides the opportunity to 
outperform revenue expectations through winning new business.  
 
Adjusted EBITDA and operating profit 
Adjusted EBITDA of $24.6m was up from $19.1m, an increase of 28.8%. Operating Profit for 2017 was $9.2m (2016: $10.5m), while 
adjusted operating profit, which the Board considers a key underlying metric, was $19.1m in 2017, equating to 21.7% growth when 
compared to 2016 ($15.7m). Our adjusted operating margin was 14.3% for 2017 (2016: 15.3%) but as previously identified, the Board 
maintains its view that there is potential for future improvement in this metric as the Group benefits from the step-down in investment 
across the business to support the global rollout. 
 
The tables below set out a reconciliation between Operating profit and adjusted EBITDA:

Operating profit  9,241  10,512 
Add: Acquisition expenses  1,249  - 
Add: Deferred and contingent payments  2,131  - 
Add: Amortisation related to acquired intangibles  8,591  4,227

Add: Share-based payments   1,089  987 
Adjusted Operating Profit  19,073  15,726 
Add: Amortisation and depreciation (excluding acquired intangibles)  5,531  3,387 
Adjusted EBITDA  24,604  19,113 
 
Administrative expenses were up 43.3% to $64.2m (2016: $44.8m). Adjusted administrative expenses reflect the adjusting items shown 
in the table above were $48.9m, representing an increase of 35.1% on 2016 ($36.2m) and driven primarily by a continued increase in 
headcount and operational infrastructure to support our short and medium term growth, and by the acquisition of Ingresso and TE2 
in March and July respectively.   
 
The table below sets out a reconciliation between the statutory and adjusted measure: 
 
  2017  2016 
  $000  $000 
Administrative expenses  64,204  44,813 
Net adjustments detailed above  (15,363)  (8,601) 
Adjusted administrative expenses  48,841  36,212 
 
Profit before tax of $7.2m was down from $10.1m in 2016 as the income statement absorbed the increase in non-cash charges related 
to the acquisition strategy that the Group has followed over recent years, together with the acquisition expenses incurred in the period. 
 
Profit after tax of $9.9m (2016: $7.5m) is after a tax credit for the year ended 31 December 2017 of $2.7m. Tax is covered in more 
detail below and within note 10. 
 
As a result, earnings per share (basic) were 40.83 cents for 2017, an increase of 20.3% on 2016 (33.95 cents). Adjusted earnings per 
share, were 56.73 cents for 2017, an increase of 10.2% on 2016 (51.48 cents). 
 
These results reflect a well-optimised and efficient group capable of delivering sustainable profit expansion while continuing to execute 
on its shorter-term commitments and heavily investing in its future. As time goes on, accesso expects earnings expansion ahead of top 
line growth as the business benefits from improving operating leverage as a result of investments made in products, including accesso 
Prism.  
 
Total R&D expenditure during 2017 of $20.0m, (2016: $17.9m) represents 15.0% of revenues (2016: 17.5%). The slight step down in 
this percentage from 2016, reflects the heavy initial investment in accesso Prism in 2016 and leads us on a track towards what we 
expect will be a normalised rate on an ongoing basis. Capitalised development expenditure was $12.4m (2016: $11.7m) representing 
62.0% (2016: 65.4%) of total R&D expenditure. The net benefit of development capitalisation less related amortisation, fell to $8.2m 
from $9.8m in 2016.  
 
Net debt and cash flow 
Our closing net cash balance of $12.5m (2016 net debt: $3.4m), includes balances of approximately $5.5m in respect of cash paid back 
to the Group by the sellers of TE2 to make payments to employees in lieu of a pre-acquisition option scheme over a three year period. 
In addition, cash balances totaling approximately $11.0m are held by the Group to make near term settlements to venue operators in 
respect of the Ingresso platform. 
 
These balances are beneficially owned by the Group but, while there are no restrictions on their use, they have been excluded from 
our current definition of net debt. Adjusting for these items offers an adjusted net debt position of $4.0m at 31 December 2017. 
 
Cash generated from operations of $33.1m (2016: $18.6) includes the benefit of these TE2 and Ingresso balances, and is after 
acquisition related expenses. Adjusted cash generated from operations was $21.2m for the year ended 31 December 2017, per the 
table below, and was 14.0% better than in 2016 ($18.6m). This represents an underlying cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA of 
86.2% (2016: 97.4%). This cash conversion percentage remains an indication of a business with a sustainable and strong cash 
conversion cycle.

Financing costs included interest of $0.7m (2016: $0.2m) and an arrangement fee of $0.4m relating to the extension of the Group’s 
borrowing facility. 
 
Financing and investing activities 
During the year, the Group extended its borrowing facilities, and undertook a share placing in order to fund the acquisitions of Ingresso 
and TE2. 
 
The acquisition of Ingresso Group Limited in March 2017 was funded via an initial cash investment (net of cash acquired) of $18.7m.   
 
To allow for sufficient headroom, the Group extended its borrowing facility with Lloyds Bank plc. The extended Facility provides the 
Group with the ability to draw down a total of $60m, denominated in either US dollars, GB Pound Sterling or Euros, and has a term of 
four years, with an option to extend by a further twelve months at the end of the first year. The facility is at an agreed rate of 140 basis 
points above LIBOR at a borrowing to EBITDA ratio of less than 1.5 times, rising to a maximum 190 basis points if the borrowing to 
EBITDA ratio is greater than 2.25 times. It provides an additional accordion mechanism allowing for a further $10m relating to future 
acquisitions, and includes a commitment interest on undrawn funds of 35% of the relevant interest rates above. The total available for 
drawdown is subject to a reduction of US$10m on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Extended Facility. The Facility 
had an arrangement fee of $0.4m. 
 
In July 2017, the Group announced the acquisition of Blazer and Flip Flops Inc (TE2). The cash element of the acquisition costs (net of 
cash acquired) was $69.2m and was funded via an underwritten vendor and cash placing, raising gross proceeds of $75.6m. 
 
Cash balances at 31 December 2017 totaled $28.7m (including the $16.5m of ‘excluded cash’ referenced above), while borrowings at 
31 December 2017 totaled $16.1m, versus the facility of $60m.  
 
The Board believes that the Group remains in a strong financial position at the period end, with good access to debt finance on 
attractive terms. 
 
Taxation 
On a statutory basis, the Group had a tax credit of $2.7m (2016: tax expense $2.6m). This includes an initial beneficial impact to the 
Group of changes to the US tax code that were introduced via The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulting in a revaluation of US 
deferred tax assets and liabilities to incorporate the reduction in the headline federal tax rates. This resulted in a one-off credit to 
2017 earnings of $5.1m. 
 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the US tax code benefit, the Group’s effective tax rate on its underlying earnings, was 24%.  
 
The Group has for a number of years focused on tax planning that lowers its effective rate. Taking into account the relative taxable 
territories in which the Group operates, and its growth in the relative territories, together with the benefit of the reduced US income 
tax rates introduced by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Group expects the tax rate on its adjusted earnings to be between 
21% and 23% in the short term. 
 
Dividend 
The Board maintains its consistent view that the payment of a dividend is unlikely in the short to medium term with cash more 
efficiently invested in product development and complementary M&A. 
 
Summary and Outlook 
This year has been one of significant progress at accesso, and these results reflect a business pleasing its customers, thinking about 
the future and translating its potential into financial results. While 2018 has only just begun, the Board remains confident in its 
expectations for the full year and is focused fully on delivering its growth plan.  After joining the accesso Board in 2012, I will formally 
step down in April and hand the baton to Paul Noland who I have known, trusted and worked with for more than 20 years. I can think 
of no one better suited to lead accesso through its next exciting stage of growth.
