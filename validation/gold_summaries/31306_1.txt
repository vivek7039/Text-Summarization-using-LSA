CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Introduction
The Group has made good progress at its Ukrainian fields 
during 2017, with the increase in development activity at the 
MEX-GOL and SV fields resulting in the successes of the 
MEX-109 well, which came on production in June 2017, and 
the SV-2 well, which came on production in August 2017, 
providing a significant boost to production rates.
During the year, the Group continued its work on the 
subsurface of the MEX-GOL and SV fields, utilising the results 
of P .D.F. Limited’s comprehensive re-evaluation study to plan 
additional development of these fields. This work included 
detailed reprocessing of the existing 3D seismic data, using 
the latest processing technology, with the reprocessed 
data now under interpretation. As well as the drilling of the 
MEX-109 well and the workover of the SV-2 well, the Group 
undertook workover operations on the GOL-2 and SV-6 
wells during the year to eliminate water ingress into the wells, 
but these operations were not successful and the Group is 
currently considering further remedial work on these wells. 
The Group also installed additional compression equipment, 
upgraded the gas processing facilities and pipeline network, 
and undertook remedial work on existing wells.
At the VAS field, planning took place for the acquisition of new 
3D seismic over the field and the drilling of the VAS-10 well, 
both of which activities commenced in early 2018.
Health, Safety, Environment and Security 
(“HSES”)
The Group is committed to maintaining the highest HSES 
standards and the effective management of these areas is an 
intrinsic element of the overall business ethos. Through strict 
enforcement of the Group’s HSES Management System, 
together with regular management meetings, training and the 
appointment of dedicated safety professionals, the Group 
strives to ensure that the impact of its business activities 
on its staff, contractors and the environment is as low as 
is reasonably practicable. The Group reports safety and 
environmental performance in accordance with industry 
practice and guidelines.
I am pleased to report that during 2017, a total of 448,618 
man-hours of staff and contractor time were recorded without 
a Lost Time Incident occurring. The total number of safe man-
hours now stands at over 1,444,850 man-hours without a 
Lost Time Incident. No environmental incidents were recorded 
during the year. 
Production
Average daily production from the MEX-GOL and SV fields 
over the year ended 31 December 2017 was 197,961 m³/d 
of gas, 47 m³/d of condensate and 24 m³/d of LPG (1,629 
boepd in aggregate) (2016: 157,228 m
3
/d of gas, 41 m
3
/d of 
condensate and 19 m³/d of LPG (1,321 boepd in aggregate)). 
Production rates improved significantly following the 
commencement of production from the MEX-109 well in June 
2017 and the SV-2 well in August 2017.
Average daily production from the VAS field for the year ended 
31 December 2017 was 86,242 m
3
/d of gas and 6.5 m

/d 
of condensate (608 boepd in aggregate) (Period from 4 July 
2016 to 31 December 2016: 82,624 m
3
/d of gas and 6.5 m
3
/d 
of condensate (556 boepd in aggregate)), contributing material 
volumes to the Group’s production output.
The Group’s average daily production for the period from 
1 January 2018 to 28 March 2018 from the MEX-GOL and SV 
field was 272,656 m³/d of gas, 53 m³/d of condensate and 
32 m³/d of LPG (2,169 boepd in aggregate) and from the VAS 
field was 86,214 m³/d of gas and 6.2 m³/d of condensate (606 
boepd in aggregate). 
Operations
The improving geopolitical situation in Ukraine, coupled with 
the stabilisation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia, higher hydrocarbon 
prices and improvements in the fiscal and economic situation 
over the last year, meant that the Group was able to increase 
the development programmes at its Ukrainian fields during 
2017.
At the MEX-GOL and SV fields, the Group continued to work 
with P .D.F. Limited to utilise its re-evaluation study of these 
fields, which involved analysis of all available geological, 
geophysical, petroleum engineering and well performance 
data. The continuing work included detailed reprocessing 
of existing 3D seismic data, using the latest processing 
technology, to try to improve the definition in such data. 
Interpretation of this new dataset is under way, with the 
intention of utilising it to refine the new geological subsurface 
model of the fields. This work, undertaken in conjunction with 
P .D.F. Limited, will enable the Group to refine its strategies 
for the further development of the fields, including the timing 
and level of future capital investment required to exploit the 
hydrocarbon resources.

The MEX-109 well, which was spudded in July 2016, targeted 
the Visean reservoirs (“B-Sands”) in the MEX-GOL field. The 
well was drilled to a depth of 4,873 metres, and completed 
in the B-20 Visean reservoir. It was brought on production in 
June 2017. The initial production rates were very encouraging 
and the well has been producing consistently in excess of 
90,000 m
3
/d since then. 
In early 2017, the Group entered into an agreement with NJSC 
Ukrnafta, the majority State-owned oil and gas producer, in 
relation to the SV-2 well, which is a suspended well owned 
by NJSC Ukrnafta located within the Group’s SV licence 
area. Under the agreement, the Group agreed to undertake 
a workover of the well, which, if successful, would result in 
the well being brought back into production. Pursuant to the 
agreement, the gas and condensate produced from the well 
is to be sold under an equal net profit-sharing arrangement 
between the Group and NJSC Ukrnafta. The workover 
operations were successful and production from the well 
recommenced in August 2017, providing a further significant 
boost to production volumes.
Following on from the success of the SV-2 well operations, in 
November 2017, the Group entered into a similar agreement 
with NJSC Ukrnafta, in relation to the SV-12 well, which is also 
a suspended well owned by NJSC Ukrnafta located within 
the SV licence area. The terms of the new agreement are 
fundamentally consistent with the agreement relating to the 
SV-2 well, including the equal net profit-sharing arrangement 
between the Group and NJSC Ukrnafta. Investigative work 
has been undertaken to ascertain the condition of the well and 
preparations for workover operations on the well are under 
way. It is anticipated that the workover operations will be 
concluded during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
The Group also undertook workover operations on the GOL-2 
and SV-6 wells during the year to eliminate water ingress 
into the wells. Although these operations were successful 
in preventing the water ingress, the wells did not return to 
production and are now under observation. The Group is 
currently considering further remedial work on these wells. 
Also at the MEX-GOL and SV fields, the Group installed 
additional compression equipment, upgraded the gas 
processing facilities and pipeline network, and undertook 
remedial work on existing wells.
At the VAS field during 2017, planning work took place for 
the acquisition of new 3D seismic data over the field and the 
drilling of the VAS-10 well. The acquisition of the 3D seismic is 
expected to be completed shortly and thereafter the data will 
be processed and interpreted. 
The VAS-10 well was spudded on 13 March 2018, with 
a planned depth of 3,450 metres. The well is designed to 
appraise horizons in the Visean formation, and to evaluate the 
western edge of field, at an offset of approximately 1 km from 
the nearest currently producing well. The drilling operations 
are scheduled to be completed in June 2018 and, subject to 
successful testing, production hook-up is anticipated during 
the third quarter of 2018. 
Outlook 
During 2018, the Group will continue the development of 
the MEX-GOL, SV and VAS fields. At the MEX-GOL and SV 
fields, the development programme includes revision of the 
geological model utilising the newly interpreted reprocessed 
seismic data, concluding the workover of the SV-12 well, 
planning for a new development well, investigating workover 
opportunities for other existing wells, installation of additional 
compression equipment, further upgrading of the gas 
processing facilities and pipeline network, and remedial work 
on existing wells, pipelines and other infrastructure. 
At the VAS field, the work on processing and interpreting the 
new 3D seismic data will continue, as will the drilling of the 
VAS-10 well. In addition, consideration and planning for a 
further appraisal/development well will be undertaken. It is also 
intended to undertake further evaluation of the VED area of the 
licence, which appears highly prospective on the current 2D 
seismic data and will benefit from the improved imaging of the 
new 3D seismic data. Work is also planned to upgrade the gas 
processing facilities, pipeline network and other infrastructure. 
It is also intended to commission updated assessments of the 
remaining reserves and resources at each of the MEX-GOL 
and SV fields and the VAS field, which will be undertaken by 
an independent petroleum reserves consultant later in 2018. 
The extensive re-evaluation of the MEX-GOL and SV fields by 
P .D.F. Limited, the interpretation work being undertaken on 
the reprocessed 3D seismic dataset and the ongoing revision 
of the geological model means that the Group considers that 
now is an appropriate time to undertake a reassessment of 
the remaining reserves and resources at the MEX-GOL and 
SV fields, and this reassessment is planned to be undertaken 
during the first half of 2018. Similarly, the interpretation of 
the newly acquired 3D seismic and associated subsurface 
studies, together with the data collected from the VAS-10 well 
at the VAS field, means that a reassessment of the remaining 
reserves and resources at the VAS field will also be appropriate 
by the end of 2018.

There has also been encouraging new legislation relating 
to the oil and gas sector in Ukraine, which demonstrates 
the Ukrainian Government’s stated intention to promote 
and support the domestic oil and gas production industry. 
These new measures include reductions in the subsoil 
taxes applicable to the production of hydrocarbons, which 
became effective for new wells from 1 January 2018 and for 
condensate production from 1 January 2019. Furthermore, 
there is newly announced legislation to simplify a number of 
the regulatory procedures relating to oil and gas exploration 
and production activities in Ukraine, which has passed through 
the Ukrainian Parliament and is now awaiting the signature of 
the President of Ukraine to bring it into law.
These measures, and the general improvement in the business 
climate in Ukraine, are encouraging and supportive of the 
independent oil and gas producers in Ukraine.
Finally, I would like to add my thanks to all of our staff for the 
continued hard work and dedication they have shown during 
this successful year.
