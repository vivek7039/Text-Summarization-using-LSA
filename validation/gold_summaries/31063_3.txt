 ARENA GROUP
14 Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement
Ken Hanna
Arena Group Chairman
The Arena Group listed on the 
AIM market on 25 July 2017 and I 
became Non-Executive Chairman 
on that date. The Board is currently 
made up of four directors, myself, 
Ian Metcalfe, who chairs the 
Remuneration Committee, and two 
Executive Directors. The Board will 
keep this composition under review. 
We have taken the decision as 
a Board, to adopt the highest 
standards of governance whilst 
ensuring the executive team 
continue to have the flexibility 
to manage the business without 
distraction or incurring excessive 
costs. 
There is no doubt that 2017 has 
been a successful first year 
as a public company, with the 
achievement of excellent financial 
results, successful delivery of 
several major contracts and the 
creation of a strong leadership 
team. 
The Board is pleased to recommend 
payment of a final dividend for the 
year ending 31 December 2017 
of 0.9 pence. This gives a total 
dividend for 2017 of 1.35 pence per 
share, subject to approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, on 24 May 
2018. The final dividend will be 
paid in July 2018 to shareholders 
of the Company on the Register of 
Members at the close of business 
on 8 June 2018.
The Group will continue to adopt 
the highest operational standards 
and to deliver the “Arena Standard” 
throughout its operations. We will 
also continue to explore value 
accretive acquisition opportunities 
in line with our stated strategy. 
Finally, I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my sincere 
thanks to all Arena employees for 
their hard work and dedication. In 
a very fragmented and competitive 
industry, the level of service and 
commitment demonstrated by our 
employees differentiates Arena 
from its competitors.
