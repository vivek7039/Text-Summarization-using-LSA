Market review
1
The UK pet market has increased its rate 
of growth over the past two years to a CAGR 
of 4.5% and was worth £6.8bn in calendar 
year 2016. This step forward has been 
driven by faster growth in the veterinary, 
insurance and accessories segments. 
The veterinary market grew at a CAGR of 
5.6% over this same period, which is being 
driven by the widening availability of more 
complex procedures and diagnostics, 
supported by increasing numbers of pet 
owners with insurance. In food, strong 
growth in Advanced Nutrition continued 
at a CAGR of 8.9%, balanced with a flat 
grocery food market where volumes 
are falling and pricing remains highly 
competitive. With the accessories market 
CAGR at 1.9%, this led to an overall pet 
products market CAGR of 2.1%.
The transition of the market to online has 
been consistent with our expectations, 
accelerating slightly compared with 
historical rates, reaching 11% of the 
pet market in 2016. 
Over the two year period from 2014 to 
2016 we have taken share across the 
pet market both online and offline. Overall 
we have grown our share of the important 
strategic categories including Advanced 
Nutrition, accessories and veterinary. 
From 2014-2016, our total share of the 
pet products market increased from 
19% to 20% and in the primary opinion 
veterinary market from 9% to 12%. 
Expanding like-for-like growth
Better value for customers
In the Merchandise business our focus 
is on delivering even better value for our 
customers. Value includes price, but also 
innovation, service and advice. The strong 
sales of dog accessories this year are 
continuing proof that our range innovation 
drives a positive customer response. 
And to improve further on our service to 
customers, we are refocusing our Steps 
training programme to ensure more 
colleagues can develop their expertise 
at a faster rate in more specialist areas.
We also understand there is a need to 
provide better pricing to customers. This 
will involve a move away from promotional 
offers and vouchers, and towards a 
simpler, more competitive approach. 
We therefore initiated pricing changes in 
the fourth quarter with the Switch & Save 
campaign, which highlights the value in 
our private label foods, Wainwright’s and 
AVA. The prices on our large bag private 
label dog foods are now 15-25% lower. 
Initial results from the campaign have 
been encouraging and since its launch 
in January 2017 we have seen an average 
50% uplift in the volume of products that 
have seen a price change. We have also 
seen an increase in new shoppers, 
alongside the switching of existing 
customers from branded foods into our 
own labels. In the current financial year 
we have launched price reductions across 
a number of everyday pet essentials and 
are also starting to reposition prices in 
branded foods. 
Whilst it is early days, we are encouraged 
by the improvement in the run rate of

Fast growth and embedded upside 
in our veterinary business
Our Vet Group continues to go from 
strength to strength; transacting more 
than £260m in total customer revenues 
during the financial year. In the first

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 opinion business, mature practices grew 
their customer revenues at 8%
◊
, ahead 
of the market rate of around 5%. We now 
have over 100 mature practices that are 
on average delivering income to the 
Group of more than £160,000 per year. 
Combined with our maturing practices, 
this translated into strong total JV practice 
income of £47.1m, up 24.6%. 
The average age of a practice in our Group is 
less than five years, when maturity is typically 
reached at eight years post opening; and 
having already invested the majority of cost 
required to support their future growth, there 
is an inherent embedded profit upside in the 
current portfolio. 
Our newer specialist referral centres also 
performed well and their integration is 
delivering group benefits through the sharing 
of best practice and leveraging scale.
In the year ahead, to accelerate growth in 
the existing practices, we will increase the 
number of practices with extended opening 
hours, invest further in marketing to 
increase brand awareness and customer 
care plan participation. And we continue 
to explore opportunities in the market that 
will deliver growth to our first opinion and 
referral businesses, whilst retaining a 
disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Omnichannel capabilities growing 
Our online business performed very well 
during the year, growing revenues at 53%. 
The convenience of our UK wide store 
footprint remains, with almost half the 
revenue of online orders delivered for 
customer pickup in-store. Alongside our 
ongoing improvements in website customer 
experience, there were a number of major 
initiatives launched this year:
Order in-store: our colleagues can now 
place an order for all the products in our 
extended online range from their PetPads. 
This gives store customers easy access 
to even more of our range and has already 
delivered over £2m in revenue since its 
launch at the end of the financial year, 
which we believe is driving incremental 
sales. 
Our first subscription service: ‘Subscribe 
& Save flea treatment’ exclusively for VIP 
members, allows customers to receive 
a single flea treatment through the post 
each month, which acts as a convenient 
reminder to treat their dog or cat. The 
convenience of this plan has proved very 
popular with customers, with subscription 
sales now representing 16% of our total 
licensed medicine revenues. We plan to 
extend subscription with another licensed 
medicine launch in the coming months. 
Having seen such a positive customer 
response to these developments, we 
will continue to invest and improve our 
omnichannel offer and develop our 
subscription platform in the coming year. 
A more personalised approach through VIP
We have seen more successes in the VIP 
club this year, having launched the VIP App, 
which removes the need for customers to 
physically carry the VIP card to swipe and 
build points for their nominated charity. 
We have increased the overall VIP swipe 
rate of the VIP card at tills to 68% of store 
revenues (prior year 64%), and expect the 
rate to be stable going forward.
We are successfully encouraging our 
VIPs to spend more, the longer they are 
members of the VIP club. And we are 
encouraging our VIPs to shop multiple 
brands, with nearly 500,000 members 
purchasing both products and a service, 
a number which has grown by 14% 
compared with the prior year. The benefits 
of multibrand shoppers are very clear; 
a customer who purchases online or in 
our stores, but does not use any services 
spends around £140 a year. Whilst a 
customer who also uses either of our vet 
and grooming services will spend over 
£180 on products, plus an additional 
£200 per year on services. This reflects 
the increased loyalty and shopping 
frequency of services customers. 
Space rollout and footprint development
We delivered our rollout targets for the 
year, having opened 15 new superstores 
(total 434), 50 vet practices (total 438) 
and 50 grooming salons (total 290). 
Paybacks and returns on our new and 
maturing units remain in line with our 
expectations.
In the year ahead, our vet practice and 
grooming salon rollout will continue at a 
similar pace, with openings of 40-50 vet 
practices and 40-50 grooming salons. We 
expect to open around ten superstores, 
lower than in the previous year, as we 
come closer to our UK rollout target of 
500 stores and maintain a disciplined 
approach to approving suitable new sites. 
Supporting margins 
As planned, Group gross margin declined 
by (35) bps
◊
 to 54.2%; driven by the 
dilutive mix impact of newly acquired 
specialist referral centres and increase in 
overall Services participation, which has a 
lower gross margin than the Merchandise 
business. In operating costs, the first year 
of the National Living Wage, our slower 
top line growth and gross margin dilution 
contributed to pre-exceptional EBITDA
†
 
margin declining by 38 bps
◊
 to 15.6%.
In the coming year, we will invest in 
product pricing, and widen our marketing 
campaigns, to drive sales. We will also 
see an increase in cost pressures that 
impact both gross and operating margins, 
including Sterling depreciation, another 
step up in the National Living Wage, and 
the Apprenticeship Levy. 
Introducing our new Group Chief 
Financial Officer: Mike Iddon
Mike joined Pets at Home in October  
2016 as Group Chief Financial Officer.
Mike was the Chief Financial Officer of 
New Look from 2014 until 2016. Prior to 
this, Mike held a number of finance roles at 
Tesco plc over a period of 13 years, with his 
final position as Group Planning, Treasury 
and Tax Director. Before this he held finance 
roles with Kingfisher plc and Whitbread plc. 
He qualified as a Chartered Accountant  
with Arthur Andersen.

In order to mitigate some of these 
pressures, we have already begun to 
implement a comprehensive simplification 
programme, which will deliver operational 
cost savings over the coming year. These 
will be achieved through efficiencies in 
store, a simplification of processes in our 
distribution centre, a reduction in the 
number of products we stock; and energy 
savings from the installation of LED lights 
and energy management systems across 
the store estate. This will mitigate some 
of the overall cost challenges, alongside the 
profit and margin support provided by our 
growing Services business and private label 
products, but overall, we expect to see a 
decline in Group gross margin. This reflects 
the coming year as one of repositioning the 
business, which we are confident is the right 
path for the future success of the Group.
Outlook 
We operate in a resilient market, which is 
forecast to grow at c4.5%
1
 over the next 
five years. Whilst in the near term we are 
repositioning the Merchandise business 
and investing in the customer, we are 
seeing results from our actions and believe 
this will deliver profitable growth benefits in 
future years. We will also continue the fast 
pace of top line and profit growth in our 
veterinary business. We remain a cash 
generative business, with a priority to 
invest in our core capabilities.
