Collagen Solutions plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Core business growth  
and momentum
Our core business accelerated, particularly in the second 
half of the year, with nine new commercial agreements, 
the integration of acquired businesses under one brand, 
and a new commercial organisation.
Strengthened balance 
sheet to fuel growth
We have ambitious goals to grow, and a plan to reach 
profitability. To support these goals, we recently raised  
up to £10.8 million in equity and a venture debt facility. 
Our cash position is now stronger than ever.
Exciting proprietary 
products pipeline
Our new pipeline of proprietary products addresses 
significant market opportunities and clinical needs 
in cartilage regeneration, bone and wound healing. 
New management team 
and advisory board
We made several key appointments with industry 
expertise and track records of success including our 
new CEO, our General Manager of New Zealand, 
and our Heads of Commercial and R&D, as well as 
empanelled a Scientific Advisory Board to support 
the product portfolio strategy.
We created Collagen Solutions to address a unique opportunity in regenerative 
medicine, based on a strong foundation of scientific expertise and biomaterials 
experience. Over the past year, we have seen significant changes in the business  
with a new management team, new funding, an exciting pipeline of proprietary 
products and continued core business momentum, taking us further towards  
our vision to be the industry’s first choice for regenerative biomaterials.
