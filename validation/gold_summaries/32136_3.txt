STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
This is my last Annual Report as Chairman 
after more than six years at M&S. It has 
been an extraordinary honour to serve 
this company. 
Since Steve Rowe became Chief Executive, 
he has set out clear plans to accelerate the 
pace of change across M&S. By simplifying 
the way we do things and by focusing on the 
customer, we have laid solid foundations 
for growth. We repositioned our Clothing & 
Home business, made important decisions 
about the future shape of our UK and 
International store estates, and put in place 
fairer pay and beneﬁ ts for our employees. 
It has been a year of great change outside 
M&S as well. Last summer’s vote to leave 
the European Union has caused inevitable 
uncertainty. Nobody yet knows what the 
long-term eff ect of Brexit will be. Like many 
businesses we have been impacted by the 
depreciation of sterling, but it is our job to 
seize the opportunities ahead and prepare 
for all eventualities. 
We have made some hard decisions. Some 
have led to signiﬁ cant adjustments to our 
proﬁ ts this year and also, in the case of 
repositioning our Clothing & Home business, 
to some short-term reduction in our 
adjusted proﬁ ts. However, these changes 
needed to be made for the long-term 
health of the business. Decisive action and 
strong execution have never been more 
important to compete in a fast-changing 
retail environment. These actions allow us 
to embrace the future from a position of 
strength, well equipped for a digital age 
and with a sustainable business model. 
PERFORMANCE
I believe our food is, without exaggeration, 
among the best in the world. Once again, 
we delivered a good performance in a 
tough market. Sales grew as customers 
responded to the quality of our food and 
the convenience of our stores. We are very 
pleased with the overall performance of 
the Simply Food stores opened during 
the year. The return on capital from the 
format remains compelling. With product 
innovation remaining the backbone of our 
Food business and a strong, but measured, 
store opening programme, we have a clear 
path to growth.
We repositioned our Clothing & Home 
business for sustainable growth by ending 
a damaging cycle of promotions and 
discounts. We also refocused our ranges on 
stylish, wearable, great-quality essentials. 
By implementing a sensible, competitive 
pricing architecture for our customers, 
we have seen encouraging improvements 
in full-price sales. As expected, fewer 
promotions and less discounting resulted 
in lower sales. There is much work still to 
do but we are beginning to see signs of 
recovery. Steve made it clear a year ago 
that this repositioning would have a short-
term negative impact on proﬁ ts but would 
set us up for sustainable performance and 
a stronger business in the long term. A year 
on, we are even clearer that this was the 
right thing to do. 
Our International business had a 
challenging year. However, we announced 
a clear strategy to focus on our strong 
franchise partnerships and our established 
joint ventures, and operate in fewer owned 
markets, by exiting ten owned, loss-making 
markets and 53 stores. 
Overall, adjusted proﬁ t before tax was 
£6 1 3.8m, down 10.3% on last year. However, 
due to charges of £437 .4m, Group proﬁ ts 
fell to £1 76.4m. The main elements of the 
charges relate to the cost of implementing 
the new pay and pensions arrangements, 
and the cost of the International store 
closures. I was Chairman when about half of 
these 53 stores opened and so must accept 
my full share of the responsibility for this 
disappointing result. However, consumer 
behaviour has changed in the intervening 
years. We had already signiﬁ cantly scaled 
back our ambitions in owned markets 
before we announced these closure plans, 
and just as there was a rationale for opening 
the stores then, there is one for closing 
them now. It is essential that we adapt to our 
customers’ changing needs and recognise 
the current realities of the markets in which 
we operate, despite the short-term cost. 
Having the right stores in the right places 
is also why we are reshaping our UK store 
portfolio, as we focus on having less, more 
inspiring Clothing & Home space and 
growing our Food space. At the end of this 
ﬁ ve-year programme we will have increased 
our space overall and employed more 
people. Our stores will be more relevant 
to the changing needs and habits of our 
customers in a digital world. 
This year Steve has set out clear and decisive plans. I will leave an 
M&S that is well equipped for the digital age and totally focused 
on its customers. This more relevant M&S is underpinned by eff ective 
succession planning, good governance and active shareholder 
engagement which have been my focus during my time as Chairman.

 VALUES AND PLAN A
Our values of Inspiration, Innovation, 
Integrity and In Touch run through 
everything we do at M&S. This is a business 
that tries to do the right thing and this is 
demonstrated in many ways, from our Long 
Service Awards to helping disadvantaged 
people into work, to the charity support 
delivered through Plan A. 
This isn’t new; it is part of what has deﬁ ned 
us for over a century. In 1964 Lord Sieff , 
our then Deputy Chairman, spoke about 
our values. “The main purpose of building 
up a great business should not be 
merely to make money,” Lord Sieff  said. 
“A company has its responsibilities, not only 
to shareholders but also to the staff , the 
customers and the whole community in 
which it trades. Unless it gives satisfaction, 
and even happiness to all concerned, 
it will fail in its aims in the long term.” 
His comments are as pertinent as ever 
and this philosophy continues to guide 
the way we do business at M&S.
This year marks the tenth anniversary of 
Plan A. I am extremely proud of the work 
we have done. From becoming a zero 
waste to landﬁ ll business and sourcing 
raw materials more responsibly, to our 
ambitious programmes to support workers 
throughout our global supply chain, we 
have sought to lead the way on truly 
sustainable change. We recently relaunched 
Plan A and the latest version is aimed at 
being even more relevant to customers 
and the communities in which we trade. 
BOARD CHANGES
Since I became Chairman in 201 1 I have 
consistently focused on succession 
planning as one of the most important 
tasks for the Board. Last year, after a 
rigorous process, we appointed Steve as 
Chief Executive, the ﬁ rst internal appointee 
for many years. Steve’s strategy is ﬁ rmly in 
place so this is now the right time for a new 
Chairman to take over as plans for growth 
in the longer term are developed.
After an equally rigorous process led 
by Vindi Banga and our Nomination 
Committee, I will be replaced as Chairman 
by Archie Norman in September. Archie 
brings a breadth and depth of relevant 
experience to M&S and an extensive track 
record in retail and brands. I am delighted 
with Archie’s appointment and I wish him 
great success in this role. 
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS 
AND DIVIDENDS
We know how important our dividend 
is to shareholders. Our policy remains 
progressive, with dividends broadly covered 
twice by earnings. Despite a reduction 
of 10.3% in our adjusted proﬁ ts, we have 
decided to maintain the total dividend per 
share for the year at the same level as last 
year with the proposed payment of a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 1 1.9p per share; this dividend 
remains well covered on a cash basis. 
Given the cash costs associated with our 
strategic change and the uncertain market 
conditions, we consider it is prudent 
not to make additional returns of cash 
to shareholders under our enhanced 
return programme. 
A STRONGER COMPANY
I will leave M&S a stronger company. We are 
now set up to compete, with a modern 
distribution and logistics backbone and 
excellent digital, design and sourcing 
capabilities. I have been committed to 
strong governance throughout my tenure 
and your Board today has a balanced 
breadth of talent, both among the 
executives and the non-executives.
We have worked to increase engagement 
with our shareholders and employees. 
Over the last six years, we have engaged 
our major institutional shareholders in 
depth in our business to ensure as much 
transparency as possible. Now, through 
our Shareholder Panel, we are engaging 
with our private shareholders in an 
unprecedented way. In addition, through 
channels such as my regular meetings 
with the Chair of our Business Involvement 
Groups (BIG), M&S’s network of elected 
employees, and his attendance at our 
Board, we are engaging with our people 
as never before. 
Having focused on these three pillars – 
governance, succession and engagement 
– I believe M&S is now better prepared 
for the further changes ahead. 
There is no business I would have been 
prouder to chair than M&S. I will miss being 
part of it, its values and the place it holds 
in customers’ hearts. My colleagues at 
M&S are the most dedicated I have ever 
worked with and I never fail to be impressed 
by their commitment to the business. 
They want M&S to succeed and they know 
what ‘doing the right thing’ means. 
The last six years have seen profound 
changes in retail and at M&S; technology 
has transformed the way that people shop. 
Under Steve, change will continue unabated 
– it must. To meet the challenges ahead, 
M&S must be bold, ambitious and decisive. 
It must think big and execute eff ectively. 
And, as Lord Sieff  said, it must also give 
satisfaction and happiness to its customers, 
its employees and its communities. 
Finally, I would like to thank our customers, 
our employees and our shareholders for 
their support. It has been an unforgettable 
privilege to be Chairman of M&S and 
I wish the business every success in the 
years ahead.

We are always looking for ways to develop 
our engagement with shareholders. This year 
we introduced our regular Shareholder 
Panel, where a small group of private 
shareholders is invited to participate in 
face-to-face discussions with members 
of the Board and senior management. 
For our large institutional investors and 
investor advisory ﬁ rms, we continue to hold 
our Annual Governance Event. Our 201 6 
event was hosted by the Chairman and 
attended by the Senior Independent Director , 
the committee chairmen, Group Secretary, 
and a senior representative from our 
Plan A team.
Our Customer Insight Unit constantly 
gathers feedback from our customers to 
understand what they want from M&S. Key 
insights are shared with the directors and 
are critical to informing strategy. During 
the year, customer feedback resulted in a 
number of store improvements including 
additional staff  on shop ﬂ oors. We also 
engage with our customers to create 
marketing campaigns that are relevant to 
them, such as Christmas With Love in 201 6 
and the creation of Spend It Well. For more 
on customer insight and engagement, see 
‘Market & Customer Insights’ on pages 6-7 
and 'Engaging Our Customers' on page 25. 
201 7 marks the tenth anniversary of 
Plan A, our social and environmental 
sustainability programme. Central to 
Plan A is our goal of creating a positive 
impact in society and improving people's 
lives, be they employees, customers, 
workers in our supply chain, charity 
partners or local communities around the 
world. Find out more at marksandspencer.
com/plana. This year also marks the ﬁ fth 
anniversary of the M&S Company Archive, 
whose educational and social activities 
have enriched the lives of thousands of 
local people. Visit the Archive's website at 
marksintime.marksandspencer.com.
The Board’s engagement with the Company’s 
85,000 employees is facilitated through 
our Business Involvement Group (BIG), 
a network of 3,500 elected employee 
representatives from across all parts of the 
business. Local BIG teams regularly feed 
back to National BIG, whose chairman in 
turn represents the collective employee 
voice through regular meetings with the 
Chairman and CEO, plus annual attendance 
at Board meetings. However, employee 
engagement extends far beyond BIG: One 
example from the year was a collaborative 
exercise where we asked our store 
colleagues what we all needed to do 
diff erently to Make Every Moment Special 
for our customers. Through 75 regional 
leadership events and 1,500 events involving 
all our store employees, we found new 
ways to help empower our people to put 
customers at the heart of the business 
(more about this on page 8). Engagement 
can also start in the community: Through 
Marks & Start we off ered work placements 
to over 2,900 disadvantaged people in 
2 0 1 6 / 1 7 . Over 6 5 % of those who c omplet ed the 
programme went on to ﬁ nd work, either with 
M&S or other employers. For further details 
about how we engage with our employees, 
see 'Employee Involvement' on pages 8 1-82.
