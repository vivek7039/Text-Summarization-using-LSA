Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement
Achieving 
our objectives
" We will continue to work hard  
to run our existing businesses  
as efficiently and effectively 
as possible whilst investing 
for the future..."
Peter Baker
Non-Executive Chairman 4 Finsbury Food Group  
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
We continue to make good progress  
in line with our stated aim of becoming  
a leading speciality bakery group  
in the UK. 
We have delivered a resilient performance despite  
the changing consumer and customer dynamics 
and the challenging economic environment for  
food manufacturers across the industry, which 
has made the journey somewhat slower and 
harder than expected. The Board has reviewed 
the Group’s strategy in the light of these external  
changes and has concluded that there is no need  
for any radical change of direction and we still 
firmly believe we are set on the right path to 
achieve our goal. We will continue to work hard 
to run our existing businesses as efficiently and  
effectively as possible whilst investing for the  
future and keeping a solid balance sheet that can  
be utilised, as and when the right opportunities 
present themselves.
The Board welcomed Bob Beveridge as a  
Non-Executive Director in July and he will be  
joining the Audit Committee. The new Group 
management structure has bedded in well and  
is delivering the scale opportunities and benefits  
expected, whilst preserving our largely 
decentralised site system.
The Results
The Group’s revenue for the 52 weeks was 
£314.3m, up 0.3%, on a like for like basis, 
compared to last year’s adjusted 52 week figure. 
Profit before tax at £13.0m is up from £11.8m 
in the prior period, which on an adjusted and 
like for like basis is £16.6m versus £15.7m, 
representing a 5.6% increase. Debt is at 0.7 
times EBITDA.
This result delivers on our expectations and 
has been achieved against a deflationary UK 
retail food market which is changing in terms 
of channel balance, as consumers shop in less 
traditional ways. This has led to an upswing 
in the discounter’s market share and online 
gains. Specific cost issues, that relate to the 
current weakness of Sterling and increased 
costs of the new national living wage have  
also had to be overcome through efficiency 
gains and price adjustment. The European 
business has performed strongly this year  
and has demonstrated the benefit of having  
a diversified portfolio. A full financial review  
is available further on in the Report. 
This outcome has not been easy to achieve 
and has only been possible because of our 
Board’s long-term focus on driving efficiency 
and managing costs, as well as the hard work 
of Finsbury’s committed team. This was 
demonstrated when the Board was presented 
with the results of the first Group employee 
engagement survey. The participation was 
excellent and the results gratifying, with only  
a few areas marked for improvement.  
Investing for the Future
The Group’s capital investment of £12.5m 
means we have completed, or are in the throes 
of completing, some very important strategic 
projects. A new cake line is coming on stream 
in Cardiff and there is a new IT system being 
rolled out which will give a common platform 
for the whole business. The benefits of these 
and other projects will help improve our overall 
productivity and offset increases in our cost base.
In light of the current environment, we maintain 
a strong focus on investing in our future. With this  
in mind we plan to invest in new plant, equipment  
and systems to further improve efficiency, 
product quality and our capability in sustainable  
and environmentally-responsible manufacturing. 
We continually assess our role within various 
product markets and are committed to critically 
reviewing our presence in those that are less  
successful. To this end the Company has entered  
into consultation with the workforce of Grain D’Or,  
the Group’s loss making pastry factory in North  
London, to close the site. This consultation will 
conclude mid-October.
Strategy for Continued Growth
The licensing of brands is an important part of the  
business and we have worked hard to improve 
and strengthen our relationships with existing 
licensees and we were delighted to launch a 
range of Mary Berry cakes in the second half 
of the year.
We continue to win awards for our products and  
to add to our capabilities, such as in a new cupcake  
line and an artisan bread production facility, 
both meeting the needs of changing consumer 
demands. In the same way, our new product 
development is increasingly directed towards 
providing healthier and more convenient 
products. 
Development of the foodservice channel is also 
an ongoing target for growth alongside any 
business acquisitions that meet our criteria.
Finally, on behalf of the Board I would like to thank  
everyone who works at Finsbury for delivering 
another successful year. Their passion, energy 
and contribution continues to drive the 
business forward.
