Delivering long-term 
growth responsibly
Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am pleased to report that we delivered a solid operational and 
financial performance in 2017. This was achieved against the 
backdrop of an external environment characterised by regulatory 
proposals and changes, tax challenges and intense competition. 
We provide much-needed access to regulated credit for people 
who might otherwise be financially excluded and, while we 
continue to modernise the Group in response to the changing 
needs of consumers, our values of being respectful, responsible 
and straightforward guide the way we serve our customers and 
govern our business. Led by the Board, we continued to take an 
active approach to risk management. This, together with product 
innovation and our regulatory stakeholder engagement programme, 
supports the work we have undertaken to help protect our business 
model. I was delighted to see our businesses receive numerous 
prestigious awards over the course of the year in recognition of our 
responsible lending practices, outstanding corporate culture and 
offering a great place to work, all of which are indicative of the high 
regard we are held in when serving customers, managing risk and 
developing our people. 
Our strategy
We understand our consumer segment well and are evolving the 
business to ensure our products and services suit customers' 
changing needs and circumstances. By offering a broader choice  
of more competitively priced products, including longer-term home 
credit loans and digital credit offerings, we aim to offer better 
customer value and improve credit quality. Our strategy is focused 
on delivering sustainable growth, enhancing profitability and making 
efficient use of capital. We now segment our businesses into two 
broad categories, namely 'growth' focused businesses and 'returns' 
focused businesses. Our European home credit businesses are in the 
returns category and they are managed to deliver the best possible 
level of customer service and to optimise returns. The capital they 
generate is used to fund investment in our growth businesses, IPF 
Digital and Mexico home credit, as well as delivering progressive 
returns to our shareholders. We made more good progress against 
our strategy in 2017 and it is particularly pleasing to see the strong 
performance delivered by IPF Digital. 
Regulatory update 
Consumer credit operators serving customers in Europe continued  
to face regulatory challenges during 2017, and our business was  
no exception. Rate cap proposals, changes to tax law and more 
stringent creditworthiness assessment requirements impacted how 
we do business.
As I reported in last year’s annual report, the Polish Ministry of Justice 
published a proposal at the end of 2016 to tighten the existing rate 
cap on consumer loans in Poland. There has been no further update 
on this matter and we, together with other consumer lending 
operators, continue to serve customers in this uncertain environment. 
We are also working with interested parties to encourage an 
“We are adapting our business to 
capture the opportunity that growing 
consumer credit demand offers and 
responding to a more challenging 
competitive and regulatory 
environment.”

outcome that is good for both consumers and business. As 
previously reported, our home credit business in Poland appealed 
decisions received in January 2017 from the Polish Tax Chamber  
with respect to its 2008 and 2009 financial years. At the time of our 
original announcement, we said that we intended to initiate a 
process with the UK tax authority aimed at ensuring that the 
intra-group arrangement, which is being challenged, is taxed in 
accordance with international tax principles. This has now been 
initiated and, in response, the Polish court has stayed the hearings  
of the 2008 and 2009 appeals pending resolution of this process. 
Additionally, a comprehensive set of changes to Polish corporate 
income tax came into force on 1 January 2018. The main impact for 
our business is a one-off deferred tax charge of £30 million which has 
been reflected in the 2017 financial statements. Further detail on both 
these matters is included in the financial review on pages 31 to 35.
We also faced regulatory changes in Romania where more stringent 
creditworthiness assessment requirements introduced in January 
2017 impacted growth. More recent regulatory change means that 
our business in Romania is now supervised by the National Bank of 
Romania and this is likely to lead to a further tightening of credit 
criteria and a reduction in the volume of loans we are allowed to 
serve customers. We have a good track record of adapting our 
business model to regulatory changes and CEO, Gerard Ryan 
covers current regulatory matters on page 15. 
2017 financial performance
We delivered profit before taxation from continuing operations of 
£105.6 million, an increase of £9.6 million including an £11.3 million 
positive FX benefit. We delivered credit issued growth of 6% led by  
IPF Digital and our Mexico home credit business. Group portfolio 
quality remains good and I am pleased to report that our home 
credit business in Mexico made a strong operational recovery 
following the disruption caused by two earthquakes in September. 
Further details on our 2017 financial performance are covered in  
the operational review on pages 24 to 30.
Shareholder returns
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 7.8 pence per 
share will be payable, bringing the full-year dividend to 12.4 pence 
per share (2016: 12.4 pence per share). The full-year dividend of  
12.4 pence per share represents a total payment equivalent to 
approximately 61.3% of post-tax earnings from continuing operations 
for 2017. As a percentage of pre-exceptional profit after tax from 
continuing operations for 2017, it equates to a pay-out ratio of 
approximately 36.8%, which is modestly above our target pay-out 
rate of 35%. We aim to run and develop high-return businesses 
providing good returns to shareholders while maintaining a strong 
financial profile, more of which is detailed in the financial review on 
pages 31 to 35. 
Our Board and people
As reported in my prior year statement, we appointed Justin 
Lockwood to the Board as Chief Financial Officer in February 2017. 
Justin’s knowledge of the business and financial expertise have 
enabled him to take on the challenges of this role effectively. We 
also continue our search for a Senior Independent Director to 
replace Tony Hales who has served as a director on our Board for 
more than 10 years. I am pleased to report that Tony has agreed to 
continue in his role until a suitable replacement is appointed and, as 
such, will put himself forward for re-election at our forthcoming AGM. 
Jayne Almond will step down as non-executive director of IPF with 
effect from the conclusion of our 2018 AGM. The Board would like to 
thank Jayne for her service and valuable contribution to the Group.
This year, our Board visited our home credit and digital operations  
in Poland where we heard first-hand how these businesses operate 
to deliver value to our customers, the opportunities they are seeking 
to capture and the risks they face. From my discussions with our 
teams, it is clear that my colleagues take pride in the customers they 
serve and the values that we uphold. We have strong leaders and 
talented people who are delivering on our strategy and, on behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank our team for their contribution  
in delivering the results set out in this annual report. 
Sustainability and ethics
Making a contribution to society is important to us and our 
stakeholder engagement programmes help our businesses play  
a positive role in their communities. We are an essential part of  
a competitive and well-functioning credit market, providing 
underserved consumers with an entry point to mainstream 
consumer finance in a transparent and responsible way. On  
page 17, CEO Gerard Ryan explains that a sustainable lending 
business must have a strong ethical culture embedded throughout 
the business, and this is fully endorsed by our Board. This year, we 
launched a new code of ethics and 98% of employees and 91%  
of agents completed the annual ethics e-learning programme. 
Outlook
We will continue to focus on optimising our European home credit 
operations to generate further returns, which will support investment 
in growing Mexico home credit and IPF Digital, and deliver enhanced 
shareholder value. The regulatory and competitive landscape is  
likely to remain challenging. In particular, both we and you, as our 
shareholders, are keen to hear an update from the Polish Ministry of 
Justice on its proposed reduction to the existing non-interest pricing 
cap in Poland. We will continue to work to encourage a more positive 
outcome on this matter. We have a clear plan and remain confident 
that we will continue to manage the business to deliver further 
sustainable growth and returns.
