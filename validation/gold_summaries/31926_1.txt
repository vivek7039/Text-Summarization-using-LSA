 Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s strategic review
We have 
strengthened 
our positions 
in our core 
markets
In 2017, we made good progress 
operating in our core markets: building, 
infrastructure and housing. The two-year 
portfolio simplification programme has 
enabled the Group to strengthen its 
market-leading positions, laying robust 
foundations which improve our efficiency 
and provide a platform for growth.
How would you summarise Kier’s performance 
in 2017?
From a strategic perspective, 2017 was a good year for 
Kier. We continued to simplify and streamline the Group, 
which enabled us to focus on our key clients and chosen 
markets and position ourselves for the future. Operationally, our 
core businesses continued to grow their market positions, 
especially the building and highways businesses.
Financially, 2017 also confirmed the strength of our underlying 
business. We saw organic growth in revenue and operating profit 
across the Group, and achieved a net debt position which was at 
the lower end of market forecasts. At year end, our Construction 
and Services order book was approximately £9.5bn including the 
McNicholas order book, which secures around 90% of our work for 
2018. Our Residential housing business performed well, and our 
Property division pipeline expanded to around £1.4bn, which 
will provide excellent development opportunities over the next 
ten years. 
Overall, our performance in 2017 provided further validation of our 
core market verticals – building, infrastructure and housing – we 
have chosen to pursue. These positions now firmly underpin the 
future direction of the Group and support our proposition of Invest, 
Build and Maintain. I believe we have the ability to be the UK 
market leader in these markets, and to exploit cross-selling 
opportunities between our businesses to the benefit of our clients.
What has the portfolio simplification programme 
involved and what are the implications for the 
business?
We’ve been engaged in the process of portfolio 
simplification since 2015. It has involved closing 
operations in territories where new business prospects 
have significantly declined, and selling businesses that were not 
aligned with the strategic direction of the Group, and/or did not 
deliver our minimum ROCE hurdle of 15%. For example, during 
2017 we closed down our operations in the Caribbean and in 
Hong Kong, and completed the sales of Mouchel Consulting 
and Biogen.

14 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 These activities were challenging and, in this respect, it was a 
busy year, as we undertook these changes while keeping our core 
businesses on track. Importantly, our core operations not only 
traded well but managed to gain market share and deepen client 
relationships. We also maintained the strength of the Group with 
a positive cash performance and a well-controlled pension deficit, 
creating a robust year end balance sheet. The financial impact 
of the portfolio simplification programme, together with certain 
other non-underlying items on the Group’s 2017 results,  
was a non-underlying charge of £75m (see page 54 for more 
information). The programme also generated net cash of £67m, 
the significant majority of which was invested in the Property and 
Residential divisions.
With the portfolio simplification programme now substantially 
complete, I believe we have emerged from this period a more 
agile, efficient and focused organisation with a growth trajectory 
ahead of us.
Given the scale of the exceptional charges in the 
2017 results, how has this impacted on your risk 
appetite, particularly when operating overseas?
In simple terms, it’ s important to know your clients and 
your supply chain, and have your best people available who 
understand the risks, the nature of the contract and its 
terms and conditions. The Group continues to operate overseas in 
the Middle East and Australia. While geography and local knowledge 
are critical, the principles of risk management still apply. I’m very 
mindful that one poorly performing project can impact on our 
profitability and importantly our reputation. The Caribbean 
operations have demonstrated how significant losses can be 
incurred and over the past three years we have implemented a 
very rigorous and disciplined bidding process. This, in addition to 
our review of procedures during project delivery, will underpin 
consistent operating margins and further strengthen our 
client relationships. With a broad portfolio, we are able to mitigate 
the challenges which can arise from the contracting environment.
How was the Group’s safety performance in 
2017 and how will you continue to improve 
your safety ethos?
Safety continues to be a key priority. During 2017, we 
broadened our approach to incorporate the health and 
wellbeing of our employees. We achieved an accident 
incidence rate (AIR) of 130, an improvement of 38% compared 
to 2016 and well below the average industry benchmark of 480.
Our performance in 2017 was the culmination of recent efforts to 
enhance our safety record. Our goal is to reduce our AIR to zero by 
2020, and as we continue to bring this rate down the challenge 
will be how to eliminate minor slips, trips, falls and similar 
incidents. To this end, we are exploring innovative new ways of 
communicating safety messages and engaging our employees and 
suppliers. We encourage them to share good ideas and improve 
our safety culture across all projects and contracts.
In 2017, we increased the number of Visible Leadership Tours to 
help refocus attention on safety. We also increased the coverage 
of our safety training and behavioural change initiatives across 
the Group. Ultimately, safety comes down to attitude. We run our 
sites in line with a set of core principles we refer to as the ‘Five 
Basics’ (see page 32 for more information). These principles are 
designed to promote awareness, accountability and rigour, and to 
discourage people from taking risks and shortcuts in their 
day-to-day work. 
The recent increase in fines for health and safety incidents, 
following the introduction of new sentencing guidelines in 2016, 
was a key consideration this year. In light of the new requirements, 
in 2017, we recorded a provision of £8m in this year’s results to 
cover potentially increased fines for historic safety incidents. 
However, while we support the intention and principle of the 
regime, we are mindful that the fines levied to date by the Health 
and Safety Executive have been wide ranging in value. We will 
therefore continue to monitor the situation carefully.
What sets Kier apart from the  
competition?
There are very few UK competitors who can match the 
breadth and scale of services we offer. Invest, Build and 
Maintain is at the heart of our business and demonstrates 
the range of services and operational flexibility we have within the 
Group. Indeed, we can take on any asset or project and meet a 
client’s funding, development, construction and maintenance 
requirements. We can do this either as a single activity or as a 
combination of these activities, whether it’s a property 
development, a new school, road construction or a facilities 
maintenance package.
Today, we encourage different businesses within the Group to 
pursue business development opportunities together. From 
customer research carried out during 2017, we know that our 
clients value collaborative partnerships that support their 
objectives. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. It’s about offering 
core expertise reinforced by the wider scale of the Group. Our 
unique strength is that we can offer add-on capabilities, either 
from the outset or as projects evolve, which in turn increases the 
depth of our client relationships. Currently c.30% of our revenue is 
generated from clients that work with two or more businesses in 
the Group, a trend we aim to increase.
Our strategy is focused on organic growth. We seek 
complementary merger and acquisition opportunities which will 
expand our offering and we invest in the development of the 
enlarged business. For example, Kier has a relationship with 
Highways England which was enhanced with the Mouchel 
acquisition. McNicholas, acquired in July 2017, further enhances 
our presence in power, rail and telecoms, making us a top three 
player in the UK utilities sector. Most importantly, Kier is a 
company with a good track record of delivery and is trusted by our 
clients and partners. This has played a major role in our ability to 
deliver day-in day-out.
What about Brexit and the current political 
uncertainty in the UK – how will these 
developments affect the business?
We derive strength not only from the scale of our business, 
but from the nature of the work we undertake. Firstly, we 
specialise in markets that are key focus areas for the 
UK Government, such as housing and infrastructure, where 
investment in new build or maintenance is likely to continue for 
some time. Secondly, in our Services division especially, we deliver 
essential every-day services. These services – for example school 
and hospital extensions, road network maintenance – are required 
all year round, regardless of the prevailing political agenda. This 
means we can maintain operational stability and pursue growth. 
Even with major projects that require government intervention and 
approval, our position is somewhat protected.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s strategic review continued
For example, if there were delays in major capital works due to 
Brexit, funds are likely to be redeployed into other areas – such as 
power distribution and utilities – where our core infrastructure 
businesses operate. The recent awards of the £1.5bn HS2 
projects to the CEK joint venture, in which we have a one-third 
share, shows the political commitment to infrastructure 
investment. There has been lots of discussion about the 
availability of labour and skills. To date, we have experienced no 
material change in the supply of labour. However, we are 
monitoring this situation particularly within the supply chain.
How would you define the Kier  
company culture?
At Kier, our people really live our values – Collaborative, 
Enthusiastic and Forward-thinking. This should come as no 
surprise, because our people chose these values based 
on the qualities that matter most to them. When I’m out in the 
business, I’m really pleased to see the pride our people take in 
their work, and in the legacy that we continue to build.
We work hard to maintain an open and inclusive culture where 
everyone feels welcome and can be themselves. Indeed, new 
joiners often comment on how open and welcoming Kier is. This is 
something we are keen to build on. We want to encourage people 
of all ages and backgrounds to join us, thrive and progress. Our 
Balanced Business Network and recently launched Shaping Your 
World campaign, are great examples of how we are raising our 
profile among wider groups of potential recruits.
As we grow, we want to retain the best aspects of our culture while 
evolving it to reflect the changes in our business. When we 
consider mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, we think 
carefully about cultural fit and combination, and whether a new 
business can strengthen or enhance what we have. It’s also 
important that we keep listening to our colleagues to understand 
their experiences of working at Kier. We want our people to feel 
confident that we will take action to improve things where we can. 
Our culture is hugely important to us, and is a key factor in 
attracting and retaining the people we need to drive the business 
forward. And, of course, our people are at the heart of this culture 
and make Kier what it is today. Dating back to the 1980s, our 
history is one of employee ownership, and over the years this has 
created an environment in which every individual takes a deep and 
genuine interest in the performance of the company.

  Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 17 Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s strategic review continued
How, in these uncertain times, do you ensure you 
have the right flow of people into the business?
We know that homegrown skills and labour will be critical 
in the years ahead, which is why we’re fully committed to 
making our company and our sector as attractive as 
possible. To this end, in September 2017 we launched Shaping 
Your World, which informs pupils aged 11-15 about careers in 
construction and the wider built environment. As part of this 
campaign, we have created the ‘Kier 1% pledge’ which commits 
that over 200 Kier employees will visit schools as our 
ambassadors to talk about the diverse career paths on offer 
across the Group, from quantity surveying to civil engineering. 
This activity will also help to recruit older students for our 
apprenticeship programmes and graduate schemes.
As a member of the 5% Club, we also ensure that 5% of our 
workforce is made up of apprentices and graduates. We have a 
strong track record of providing dedicated and tailored 
development to our existing employees, giving them the career 
support and guidance they require. 
Personally, what highlights or events stood out 
for you during 2017?
Throughout the year, we demonstrated that we can grow 
both organically and through acquisition. The substantial 
completion of the portfolio simplification programme was a 
significant achievement, as it enables us to move forward with 
clear focus and direction. We have invested in systems and 
infrastructure such as a new finance shared service centre in 
Manchester which creates important back-office support enabling 
the business to deliver and grow. The performance of our highways 
business also underscored the viability of our model.
What were the major corporate responsibility 
highlights of 2017?
I’m pleased to report that we made good progress in 
several non-financial areas. We made real progress in 
terms of diversity, or what we call ‘creating a more 
balanced business’. This year, for the first time, Kier employees 
participated with industry colleagues in Pride London, marching 
under the banner of ‘#buildingequality’. We also continued to 
extend opportunities to people who may find it more challenging to 
enter employment. These efforts include initiatives for ex-
offenders, school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds, 
former service personnel and workplace returnees. We are also 
proud to support the Government-backed Apprentice Diversity 
Network initiative. During the year, we focused on activities which 
help our people, our teams and the communities in which we 
operate. Highlights included the Kier Awards, held for the first time 
at a national level, to recognise outstanding examples of 
employees living the Kier values. 
We also held our second corporate responsibility (CR) forum for 
shareholders, during which we articulated our CR commitments 
and activities, including our environmental achievements, safety 
performance and social value initiatives. By communicating our 
efforts in this way, we have successfully engaged investors and 
demonstrated our commitment to value creation beyond the 
bottom line. The increase in our Business in the Community (BITC) 
score from 87% to 91% is a clear demonstration of the progress 
we have made.
We remain focused on delivering our Vision 2020 strategy – continuing to develop the 
business remains a priority.

18 Kier Group plc | Report and Accounts 2017 The end of June saw the tragic events at Grenfell Tower. We have 
been reviewing the use of cladding and projects undertaken in the 
building business and on clients’ estates where Kier provides 
either maintenance or facilities management services. The 
construction of high-rise residential tower blocks is not a core 
activity of Kier, but the discussion relating to cladding has 
extended to other types of developments and therefore 
we continue to work with clients to address their challenges.
What are your priorities for the new financial 
year?
We remain committed to delivering on our Vision 2020 
strategy, and achieving our financial and non-financial 
goals. I am particularly focused on improving the quality of 
our products and services while increasing our efficiency. I believe 
that by looking at new ways to share ideas and solve problems, 
we can develop Group-wide solutions which will provide further 
growth opportunities. 
In the coming year, we will establish a new £1m innovation seed 
fund for our teams to help make this a reality. Our newly-created 
Innovation team and the #forwardthinking@Kier plan will be critical 
to this process, as we embrace the technological developments 
that are occurring across the Group and in the marketplace. 
Consequently, we have updated one of our strategic priorities to 
reflect this focus – embracing innovation and technology across 
our business. However, as well as new investment, we continue to 
look at ways to transfer technology already used in other markets 
to our businesses such as virtual and augmented reality. We are 
looking at new ways that technology can help our clients deliver, 
for example, smart recycling where data collection can help 
councils understand the behaviours of their customers and 
intelligent technology in homes and offices which provides data 
that helps you understand the wear and tear of living and working 
in buildings.
What’s the outlook for the business, and what 
are your immediate priorities?
Following the portfolio simplification programme, we are in 
a strong position to pursue our growth strategy with a 
focus on organic growth. Within this strategy, we have set 
ourselves the goal of increasing our operating profits, on average, 
by 10% every year, and in 2017 we saw ongoing improvement in 
the quality of our earnings and margins. 
Looking ahead, we will focus on operating as efficiently as 
possible. In 2017, we invested £40m in our back-of-house 
capabilities to ensure we can optimise our performance and 
successfully assimilate all future acquisitions. The continued 
roll-out of our £70m back-office system investment, and the 
integration of our customer relationship management system, will 
provide a robust platform from which we can further streamline 
processes and drive innovation through the business. These 
investments will stand us in good stead as we move forward. 
I believe the general outlook for the business is positive, with a 
strong order book, healthy balance sheet, and buoyant core 
markets supported by government policy. 
We are now ready to take the next step on our journey, and I look 
to the future with confidence.
