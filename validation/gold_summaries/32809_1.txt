Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s Report
It gives me great pleasure to present this annual 
report, following an eventful and indeed 
transformational year for Bushveld Minerals Limited. 
We have continued the disciplined execution of  
our strategy for our three key platforms, Bushveld 
Vanadium, Greenhills Resources and Lemur 
Resources, guided by our four key principles:  
(a) commodity choice with robust market 
fundamentals; (b) attractive cost position; (c) a 
realisable path to production; and (d) scalability.
THE VANADIUM FLAGSHIP
Nowhere are these principles given better 
expression than in the development of Bushveld 
Minerals’ flagship vanadium platform:
• Vanadium – a commodity with a robust and 
growing demand profile amid a constrained and 
concentrated supply environment resulting in a 
sustained structural deficit with no significant 
new supply in the near future;
• With some of the highest primary vanadium 
grade in the world, a low-cost open-cast simple 
mining proposition and access to brownfield 
processing infrastructure that can be acquired at 
a small fraction of its replacement cost, Bushveld 
will be one of the lowest production platforms 
on the vanadium cost curve;
• The participation alongside Yellow Dragon 
Holdings in the acquisition of Vametco gives the 
Company exposure to a production asset with a 
significant share of the global vanadium market 
and with scope to scale up production in future;
• A healthy pipeline of resources and 
complementary processing infrastructure to 
support the Company’s growth aspirations.  
The acquisition of the Brits Vanadium project 
presents significant opportunities to significantly 
increase the Company’s resource base, while the 
existence of several additional brownfield assets 
in South Africa in close proximity to the 
Company’s vanadium deposits creates low cost 
and quicker opportunities for scale up.
Consequently we have crafted a vision to build the 
largest, lowest-cost vertically integrated 
vanadium company.
• The largest primary vanadium platform means 
having the largest high-grade primary vanadium 
resource base and the largest primary vanadium 
production in the world;
Executing on  
our strategy to 
deliver growth
“ The acquisition consideration of US$16.47 
million represents less than 10% of the 
replacement value of Vametco and the strong 
cash flow generating ability of the underlying 
operations enabled the acquisition to be largely 
debt-funded (US$14.0million).”

• The lowest cost means targeting the lowest cost 
position on the vanadium production cost curve, 
leveraging the high in-situ and in-magnetite V

grades and the open-cast mining proposition of 
Bushveld Minerals’ deposits as well as access to 
low-cost brownfield processing infrastructure;
• The most vertically integrated primary vanadium 
platform means development of downstream 
operations beyond production of end-use 
vanadium products to also include development 
and deployment of vanadium applications in 
industries such as the energy storage market, 
where Bushveld intends to manufacture 
vanadium electrolyte and to build large-scale 
vanadium based VRFBs.
THE VAMETCO TRANSACTION
An important part of realising this vision was the 
Company’s 45% participation with Yellow Dragon 
Holdings Limited (55%) in the acquisition, from the 
Evraz Group S.A. of a 78.8% shareholding in Strategic 
Minerals Corporation, the parent company for the 
primary vanadium mining and processing plant  
of Vametco Alloys (Proprietary) Limited.
The transaction, completed on 6 April 2017,  
was completed less than four years since the 
company announced, in November 2013, its focus 
on developing the vanadium platform. Since this 
announcement, we have made significant strides, 
including completing a Scoping Study on the 
Mokopane Vanadium Project in April 2014, followed 
by a Prefeasibility Study delivered in February 2016.
The Vametco vanadium mine is a high-quality, 
low-cost producer with a trademark vanadium 
product and a global vanadium customer base. 
Vametco is one of the cheapest primary producers 
of vanadium in the world. It currently has an 
approximate 3.5% share of global supply capacity 
and provides a solid platform for growing this 
production base. It is intended to leverage its 
processing capacity and broaden its product base  
to include vanadium chemicals, such as VRFB 
electrolyte. Our participation in the acquisition of 
Vametco as described in this report is therefore 
aligned with the Company’s aspirations in the global 
energy storage market by providing capacity for 
potential electrolyte manufacturing.
The Vametco transaction gives impetus to the 
Company’s vision to develop the largest, lowest-cost 
vertically integrated primary vanadium platform in 
the world. The transaction could not have been 
completed at a better time, with vanadium prices 
having staged a strong recovery. Vametco has an 
ungeared financial position and a healthy cash 
generation ability which enabled BVL to fund the 
acquisition largely through debt. US$14 million of 
the US$16.5 million acquisition consideration was 
fully repaid within three months of the completion  
of the transaction.
I am pleased that BVL was able to transfer customer 
contracts from Evraz Group seamlessly within a 
month of completion of the transaction, thanks  
in a large part to our partnership with Wogen 
Resources Limited, which brings decades of 
experience in metals trading, with a global footprint 
and established relationships with several of the 
Vametco customers.
Meanwhile Vametco has been delivering solid 
operational and financial performance. Production 
volumes in 2016 were a solid 2 804MTV, a 16% 
increase on 2015 volumes of 2 419MTV. The volume 
increase and weakening South African exchange rate 
(from ZAR12.75:US$1 in 2015 to ZAR$14.71:US$1) in 
addition to improved operational performance saw 
Vametco improve its already low production costs 
from US$17.23/kgV to US$14.50/kgV. Consequently 
EBITDA performance improved between the two 
years from ZAR15.7 million (US$1.2 million) to 
ZAR47.5 million (US$3.2 million). This performance 
improvement has continued into 2017 supported  
in part by the significant rises in vanadium prices.  
At ZAR85.5 million (US$6.5 million) EBITDA for the 
first half of 2017 is already 80% higher than that of 
the entire 2015. 
Going forward, BVL will leverage the solid Vametco 
platform, its experienced management team and 
the South African base to grow production volumes, 
drive down costs and add new vanadium products 
to its portfolio.
FOUR KEY PRIORITIES
To give effect to this vision we identified four key 
priorities that guide the Company’s action 
programme. I am pleased with the progress the 
Company has made on all of them:
a) Advance Mokopane Vanadium Project
Notwithstanding the growing focus on the Vametco 
mine and processing plant, the Mokopane Vanadium 
Project is an important part of Bushveld’s future 
plans. With a resource of 298Mt, a completed 
Pre-Feasibility Study and a Mining Right under 
application, this project is an important part of our 
vanadium portfolio. The project Pre-feasibility Study, 
completed in February 2016, reported a pre-tax NPV 
and IRR of US$418m and 24% respectively against  
a capital expenditure of US$298 million for a project 
producing 9,525 mtv of 99.8% V
2
O
5
. The 
attractiveness of the project is under-scored by the 
conservative long term average price of US$7.50/lb 
V
2
O
5
 which is conservative relative to vanadium 
prices at the date of this report (US$9.40 mid Metal 
Bulletin, 4 August 2017).
Significant progress was made during the year in our 
efforts to secure a new order mining right, including 
securing environmental authorisation for the 
project. We look forward to finalising the mining 
right and developing the project going forward. 
Efforts to find partnerships for the project are 
continuing. Furthermore, the Company will explore 
opportunities for supplying unprocessed ore or 
concentrate to vanadium-processing facilities 
around the world that are starved of 
vanadium feedstock.
b) Identify and secure quality brownfield 
processing infrastructure
Bushveld’s vanadium deposits are located in  
a mining region with established logistics 
infrastructure and a deep history of beneficiation. 
The Company investigated several opportunities 
and, as mentioned earlier, in 2016 negotiated and 
agreed, in partnership with Yellow Dragon Holdings, 
the purchase of a 78.8% in SMC in April 2017.
Our participation in the acquisition of an operating, 
profitable low-cost producer of vanadium at less 
than 10% of its replacement value is testament to 
the value in this approach. 
The Company continues to explore further 
brownfield opportunities that are in close proximity 
to and are complementary with the Company’s 
vanadium assets. This we will do by leveraging the 
strong technical skills within Bushveld Minerals and 
Vametco. Combining over 100 years of vanadium 
industry experience, the Vametco team has in-depth 
knowledge of vanadium mining, processing 
and marketing. 
c) Support vanadium role in energy storage
The success of VRFBs in the burgeoning global 
energy market is important for the vanadium market 
– growing and diversifying the demand profile of  
a commodity that today is dominated by the steel 
industry with about 90% of vanadium consumption. 
In addition, the energy storage market itself offers  
a compelling commercial proposition for Bushveld 
Minerals. Yet the success of VRFBs must overcome 
two key hurdles: (a) security of supply and (b) 
security of cost of the VRFBs, both of which are 
accentuated by the significant reduction of supply  
in the past 18 months, with no significant new 
capacity in the horizon, as well as the more than 
150% increase in vanadium prices to an 8 year high 
in the past 18 months.
We believe that the answer to these hurdles lies  
in a vertically integrated business model involving 
low-cost vanadium production assets. Bushveld is 
more than ever ideally placed, through its energy 
storage dedicated company Bushveld Energy 
Limited, to play a catalytic role in driving VRFB 
adoption in the global market by effectively 
addressing these two hurdles. This vertically 
integrated model is pursued through smart  
strategic partnerships along the value chain. 
I am pleased that in the review period Bushveld 
added to its strategic relationship with technology 
partner UniEnergy Technologies, a leading US-based 
manufacturer of large-scale VRFBs, by signing a 
Cooperation Agreement with the Industrial 
Development Corporation of South Africa. Bushveld  08

Business Review
Energy could not have found a better partner in the 
IDC. I am pleased with the positive outcome of the 
two completed studies in respect of VRFBs; these 
now pave the way for pursuing the VRFB 
opportunity further. 
In addition, Bushveld Energy is developing optimal 
sites for large-scale VRFB demonstration systems of 
multiple megawatt hours in South Africa in parallel 
with building up a short-to-medium-term energy 
storage project development backlog across Africa 
to tap into the multi-gigawatt-hour opportunity for 
large-scale energy storage.
I am pleased to note that the benefits of VRFBs are 
increasingly recognised – long life cycle, low levelised 
cost of energy, etc. Bushveld Energy has and 
continues to play a key role in this respect, including 
being an important part of the Vanitec Energy 
Storage Committee, through which the vanadium 
industry cooperates to support the VRFB industry.
d) Consolidate primary vanadium resources
Bushveld Minerals believes the future of vanadium 
supply lies with high-grade primary vanadium 
suppliers. This is underscored by the structural 
challenges faced by vanadium-slag-producing steel 
plants, which account for as much as 64% of 
vanadium feedstock supply and yet whose viability  
is structurally challenged on account of their high 
magnetite iron input costs, high processing costs  
and general lack of influence on the low steel prices 
afflicting their profitability. Nowhere are the 
consequences of these constraints clearer than the 
shutdown of Highveld Steel and Vanadium 
during 2015. 
The Company’s efforts in this regard were focussed 
on completing the acquisition of the Brits Vanadium 
Project, which comprises prospecting rights on 
several farms adjacent to the producing Vametco 
plant. The Company was, as at the reporting date,  
in the process of securing regulatory approval in 
terms of section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum 
Resources Development Act for change of control  
in respect of the acquired Sable Metals & Mining 
Limited’s subsidiaries. Following approval, Bushveld 
Minerals will commence with activities to delineate 
the project’s extensive shallow resource.
UNLOCKING VALUE FROM THE  
OTHER PLATFORMS
While our focus has been on the vanadium platform, 
we will continue to execute a strategy for the other 
two platforms – Greenhills Resources (tin) and 
Lemur (coal and power generation) – aimed at 
crystallising and realising value for our shareholders, 
as outlined in this report. 
• For Greenhills Resources Limited that strategy 
entails consolidating a critical mass of tin 
resource inventory, implementing a pilot 
production programme and exploring options 
for a potential listing of Greenhills Resources.
• For Lemur this entails securing a power purchase 
agreement for a 60MW thermal coal power 
project as well as tying up partnerships with 
financial and EPC (Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction) partners ahead of a potential 
spin-off of Lemur.
Greenhills Resources Limited
Subsequent to the year in review saw Greenhills 
Resources complete the acquisition of a 49% interest 
in Dawnmin, which owns an 85% interest in the Uis  
Tin Project in Namibia. 
With valid mining licences in place and an old 
processing plant (albeit in need of refurbishing), 
Greenhills Resources intends to accelerate this 
project into production. Greenhills Resources’ 
approach to bringing this mine into full-scale 
production includes:
• Mapping out the higher-grade greisened zones 
that are the target for early stage mining;
• Completing the mineralogical and metallurgical 
studies to fine-tune the pilot plant for a 
consistent production phase based on which 
techno-economic parameters for the scaled up 
larger plant can be confirmed;
• Completing the refurbishment of the old pilot 
plant and running it on a consistent basis for 
several months; and
• Confirm the existing Uis Project resources in 
accordance with the JORC standards.
Having achieved a critical mass of tin resource 
inventory, and with a valid mining licence for the Uis 
Tin Project, Greenhills Resources is well positioned 
for life as a stand-alone platform through an IPO on 
AIM in the near term, efforts for which are now 
already underway. This will allow Greenhills 
Resources to attract the dedicated resources 
(financial and human capital) to be successful as an 
African focused tin and associated metals champion. 
Lemur Resources Limited
The past year has seen significant progress in the 
development of Lemur’s Imaloto coal project in 
Madagascar. The Company’s strategy for the 
development of the project involves securing an 
Independent Power Producer licence and a Power 
Purchase Agreement for a thermal coal fired power 
station next to the coal mine, thereby providing a 
captive market for the Imaloto project run-of-mine 
coal. Negotiations with the Madagascar authorities 
regarding the PPA have progressed well during the 
year under review. 
In addition, I am pleased that Lemur signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with Sinohydro, a 
subsidiary of PowerChina, for the development of a 
60MW thermal coal power plant in Madagascar. The 
MoU provides a sound framework for cooperation 
between Lemur and Sinohydro, which has extensive 
experience investing in and developing large-scale 
power projects in Africa. It further provides for 
Sinohydro funding the bankable feasibility for  
the power project, which will provide a ready and 
captive market for the Imaloto coal project. Since 
the signing of this MoU, Lemur has led a delegation 
to Madagascar intended, among other things, to  
help identify the optimal site for the power plant. 
Meanwhile, Lemur has also engaged the services  
of Advisian Advisory as the Owner’s Engineer to

represent Lemur in our engagement with Sinohydro, 
Jirama (the Madagascar national power utility) and 
external funders for the project, undertake several 
studies that form a part of the bankable feasibility 
study for power project and ensure that all 
environmental studies are done to internationally 
accepted standards. 
The development of the Imaloto project, including 
the mine and the power plant, will see the region 
receiving new infrastructure and stable energy 
access. Thousands of new jobs will be created, over 
US$1 billion in new government revenue will be 
generated and approximately US$300 million in new 
investment in the country will be achieved. The 
design and location of the project are such that it will 
immediately increase the country’s power supply by 
15% and be able to scale up to supply more power to 
new electricity users in the region in the longer term. 
GENERAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
The economic environment for mining and South 
Africa in particular remains a challenging one. 
Uncertainty relating to the new Mining Charter 
presents risks to Bushveld’s South African operations, 
as does the overall political uncertainty prevailing in 
South Africa. We note, however, that political 
uncertainty is as much a global phenomenon as it is 
South African. Our assets are of a high quality and 
their export proposition, coupled with a local cost 
base, present a natural hedge against any adverse 
developments in the local economy.
A proactive strategy in dealing with various 
stakeholders is essential. Bushveld and its operating 
subsidiaries are well positioned to address issues 
with respect to stakeholder engagement at all major 
levels of government, communities and employees. 
Bushveld’s transaction in support of a new Black 
Economic Empowerment partner for Vametco, 
Jaxson 640 (Proprietary) Limited (“Jaxson”), in terms 
of which Bushveld provided loan financing of 
approximately US$1 million for Jaxson to buy out  
the previous BEE shareholders in Vametco Holdings 
is an example of this proactive approach. As a 
consequence of this transaction, the local 
landowners and affected communities’ shareholding 
in Vametco increased from 3.75% to about 12%.
Bushveld Minerals continues to make strides in 
developing its projects across all its three platforms 
in spite of the constrained operating environment. 
FINANCIAL REPORT
As mentioned elsewhere in this report, the most 
significant transaction during the current financial 
year was the Company’s participation in the 
Vametco acquisition by Bushveld Vametco Limited, 
which was completed post year end. The strong cash 
flow generating ability of the underlying operations 
enabled the acquisition to be largely debt-funded 
(US$14.0 million). BVL’s equity component of 
US$2.47 million was settled in two parts, US$1.65 
million during the current financial year, with a 
further US$0.82 million settled post year-end upon 
completion of the acquisition in April 2017 . 
Total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of 
the financial year amounted to £478,619. During the 
current financial year Bushveld raised approximately 
£3.4 million from three separate capital raisings,  
as well as various warrant-for-share conversions by 
shareholders. The cash raised from these capital 
raises were largely used to pursue the Company’s 
participation in the Vametco acquisition, plus 
associated due diligence and other expenditures,  
as well as settling all of our obligations (principal  
and interest) to Darwin Strategic. The Directors 
maintained tight discipline over cash operating 
expenses, which decreased by 10% from the 
previous financial year to approximately £1.4 million.
 
During the current financial year the Company’s cash 
resources have materially been applied as shown in

THE YEAR AHEAD
In the year ahead Bushveld will continue to execute 
on its stated strategy, focusing on:
• Working with Yellow Dragon Holdings to grow 
Vametco’s production volumes and exploring 
further brownfield opportunities complementary 
to the Company’s vanadium assets. 
• In addition, Bushveld Energy will work with its 
VRFB technology partners to unlock the 
potential for vanadium electrolyte production 
within the global energy storage market; 
• Unlocking value in its Madagascar coal project 
through securing an IPP licence and continuing 
the feasibility studies on a 60MW thermal coal 
power project; 
• Completing the listing of Greenhills Resources 
and thus establishing an AIM-listed dedicated 
African tin champion well placed to consolidate 
quality tin assets in Africa; and
• Growing our human capital base to meet the 
growing demands of a growing company. I look 
forward to building on our existing team and 
introducing more senior-level leadership in the 
areas of operations, investor relations and 
project development. At the same time, the 
Company will look to further strengthen the 
board of directors to ensure it is well suited to 
provide the kind of oversight and support 
required by management.
CONCLUSION
The year under review has been an eventful and 
transformational one underscored by BVL’s 
acquisition of the Vametco primary vanadium mine 
and processing plant. This has reflected in a 641% 
surge in the Company’s share price from 1.53p to 
9.80p between 1 August 2016 and 31 July 2017.  
The re-rate to a market capitalisation of more than 
£78 million at the beginning of August 2017 reflects 
our on-going transformation into a portfolio that 
includes a mining operation with access to cash 
flows and a potential for further returns to our 
shareholders. Notably during the same period, 
Bushveld shareholders suffered only a modest 
dilution as a consequence of the Company’s capital 
raising, increasing its issued shares from 591.6 million 
to 806.6 million. We believe there is significant 
growth yet to be realised as we execute on 
our strategy. 
The BVL acquisition was not without its challenges; 
not least initially looking to raise financing that, at 
the time of the agreement execution, was more than 
Bushveld’s market capitalisation and during a 
challenging capital raising environment for junior 
mining companies. Bushveld Minerals and its 
strategic partner in BVL, Yellow Dragon Holdings, are 
grateful to Wogen Resources Limited and the Barak 
Fund, who believed in our proposition and provided 
the needed financing to complete the transaction. 
I am thankful for the support of the entire Bushveld 
Minerals team for continuing to show incredible 
commitment to the Company. I am also thankful for 
the support of the Board and most importantly of 
our shareholders. I believe Bushveld Minerals is at  
a critical transformational point in its story and look 
forward to the next chapter in its development.
We are excited about what the future holds as we 
continue on our journey to build the world’s largest, 
lowest cost and most vertically integrated 
vanadium platform.
