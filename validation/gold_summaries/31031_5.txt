Alternative  
Performance Measures
In these results we refer to ‘underlying’ 
and ‘statutory’ results, as well as other 
non-GAAP Alternative Performance 
Measures. 
Alternative Performance Measures 
(‘APMs’) used by the Group are:
• constant currency like-for-like 
revenue growth;
• underlying operating profit;
• underlying operating margin;
• underlying profit before tax;
• underlying effective rate of tax;
• underlying fully dilutive EPS; and
• underlying operating cash 
flow conversion.
Underlying results are not intended to 
replace statutory results but are 
presented by removing the impact of 
highlighted items in order to provide a 
better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business. The 
above APMs are consistent with how 
business performance is measured 
internally by the Group. 
Underlying profit is not recognised 
under IFRS and may not be 
comparable with underlying profit 
measures used by other companies. 
Highlighted items comprise non-cash 
charges and non-recurring items which 
are highlighted in the consolidated 
income statement as separate 
disclosure is considered by the 
Directors to be relevant in 
understanding the underlying 
performance of the business. The 
non-cash charges include share option 
charges and amortisation of 
purchased intangibles. 
The non-recurring items include the 
costs associated with potential 
acquisitions (where formal discussion 
is undertaken), completed acquisitions 
and their subsequent integration into 
the Group, adjustments to the 
estimates of contingent consideration 
on acquired entities, asset impairment 
charges, management restructuring 
and other significant one-off items. 
Costs associated with ongoing market 
landscaping, acquisition identification 
and early stage discussions with 
acquisition targets are reported in 
underlying administrative expenses.
Further detail of highlighted items 
are set out below as well as within 
the consolidated income 
statement and notes 1 and 3 
of the financial statements. 
Disposal of  
Advertising Intelligence  
and Reputation businesses 
On 13 February 2018, the Company 
announced the disposal of its 
Advertising Intelligence business to 
Nielsen Media Research Limited for 
consideration of £26 million plus 
customary adjustments for working 
capital. The disposal is subject to certain 
conditions, including approval from the 
Competition and Markets Authority. 
The Directors consider that as at 
31 December 2017 the sale of the 
Advertising Intelligence business did 
not meet the definition of being highly 
probable, and therefore the division is 
not reported as a business held for sale 
in the financial statements.
Performance outside of the US  
in line with expectations
Highlights
• 4.6% revenue growth, 6.7% revenue growth  
excluding the Market Intelligence segment
• Underlying operating profit margin of 13.8%
• Underlying diluted EPS of 9.4p
• 10% increase in proposed dividend to 0.71p per share
• Underlying cash conversion of 93%
30 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 The Advertising Intelligence business 
represents in excess of 90% of the 
revenue and operating profit of the MI 
segment. On a pro-forma basis, the 
impact of the disposal on the 2017 
results would be to reduce revenue by 
£21.9 million with a reduction of 
operating profit of £4.4 million reflecting 
the contribution to profit from the 
business before allocated overheads. 
On 19 March 2018, the Company 
entered into an agreement to sell 
the trade and assets of its Reputation 
business to Echo Research Holdings 
Limited. Completion will take place on 
31 March 2018. The consideration 
payable is dependent upon the revenue 
performance of the business during 
the 12 months following completion. 
During 2017 the business contributed 
£1.2 million of revenue and generated 
a £0.2 million operating loss.
Acquisitions
On 1 September 2017, the Group 
completed the acquisition of Digital 
Balance Pty (‘Digital Balance’), 
an independent digital analytics 
consultancy located in Perth, Australia. 
The acquisition of Digital Balance 
further extends the MPO segment in 
Asia Pacific, bringing capabilities in 
Tech and Analytics.
Digital Balance was acquired for an 
initial cash consideration of AU$475,000 
in cash. The maximum total 
consideration is AU$5 million payable 
in cash depending on the performance 
of the acquired business up to 
31 December 2020. Digital Balance 
contributed revenue of £424,000 and 
operating profit £123,000 in the period 
since acquisition.
P&L overview
Commentary on segmental 
revenues are set out within the 
Chief Executive Officer’s report.
Revenues grew to £87.4 million which 
represents 4.6% revenue growth over 
£83.6 million recorded over the 
12 months ended 31 December 2016 
(‘2016’). Revenue grew by 1.2% on a 
constant currency basis and, removing 
the impact of acquisitions, by 0.8% on 
a constant currency like-for-like basis. 
Underlying operating profit was 
£12.0 million compared with 
£13.0 million in 2016 reflecting a 
decrease in underlying operating profit 
margin from 15.5% to 13.8%. 
Operating profit margin declined in 
both the MPO and MI segments. 
Lower margins in the MPO segment 
reflect investment in the expansion of 
our Marketing Effectiveness services 
– as set out in the Growth Acceleration 
Plan – together with weaker revenue 
performance from our US analytics 
business. The MI segment operating 
profit margin decline reflects both a 
revenue decline from our project-based 
Reputation business and investment in 
our Portfolio platform within our 
Advertising Intelligence business.
Statutory operating profit decreased 
by £2.3 million from £7.8 million in 2016 
to £5.5 million in 2017, reflecting a 
£1.0 million reduction in underlying 
operating profit and a £1.3 million 
increase in highlighted items. 
Highlighted items increased in 2017 
reflecting costs associated with the 
sale of the Advertising Intelligence 
business together with severance costs 
and reorganisation changes. 
Highlighted items are set out in more 
detail below.
Net finance costs were £1.0 million 
in the year to December 2017 
(2016: £1.1 million), the reduction 
reflects lower average gross debt 
in 2017 compared with 2016.
Underlying profit before tax was 
£11.0 million in the year to 
December 2017 (2016: £11.8 million). 
Reported profit before was £4.5 million 
in the year to December 2017 
(2016: £6.6 million), due to lower 
underlying operating profit and an 
increase in highlighted items compared 
with 2016.
Highlighted items
Highlighted items total £6.5 million 
in the year to December 2017, 
(2016: £5.2 million). Highlighted items 
comprised the following:
• £2.0 million related to purchased 
intangible asset amortisation 
(2016: £1.9 million);
• £0.7 million share-based payment 
expenses (2016: £0.6 million);
• £2.4 million of severance and 
reorganisation costs including 
the cost of post-earnout 
management change in China, 
leadership change in France and 
severance costs across a number 
of markets in Europe; and
• £1.4 million in relation to acquisition 
and strategic costs including 
£1.0 million of costs in relation to 
the disposal of the Advertising 
Intelligence business, £0.2 million 
in respect of adjustments to 
contingent deferred consideration, 
and £0.1 million associated to the 
acquisition of Digital Balance.

Taxation
The total tax charge for the year ended December 2017 is £2.0 million (FY2016: £2.2 million) representing a current tax charge 
of £1.6 million (FY2016: £1.8 million) and a deferred tax charge of £20,000 (FY2016: £0.5 million).
The effective rate of tax on underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 26.4% (FY2016: 21.7%). The 
effective rate of tax is increased by a deferred tax liability booked in 2017 of £0.4 million arising from differences between IFRS 
and German GAAP. Excluding the impact of the above deferred tax liability, the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 
31 December 2017 is 22.6% which is broadly in line with the prior year.
Earnings per share
Underlying diluted earnings per share was 9.4p in the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: 11.3p), reflecting a decrease in underlying 
profit before tax combined with an increase in the effective tax rate to 26.4% (2016: 21.7%). Statutory diluted earnings per 
share was 2.6p in the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: 5.2p).

Dividend
It is the Board’s intention to pay a dividend of 0.71p per share for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017, (FY2016: 0.65p per 
share). This would represent an increase in dividend per share of 10% and would also represent the continuation of a 
progressive dividend policy which commenced with our maiden dividend paid in October 2015. The dividend will be 
recommended as a final dividend at the Company’s AGM on 9 May 2018. If shareholders approve this payment, the dividend 
will be paid on 15 May 2018 to all shareholders who were on the Register of Members at close of business on 12 April 2018.
Equity
During the 12 months to December 2017, 397,710 shares were issued upon the exercise of employee share options and a further 
600,000 were issued as deferred consideration for the acquisition of Stratigent LLC. As a result our share capital increased to 
78,197,461 ordinary shares (31 December 2016: 77,199,751).

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Underlying cash from operations represents the cash flows from operations excluding the impact of highlighted items. 
The underlying net cash inflow from operations was £11.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2017 (FY2016: £11.3 million). 
After highlighted items are considered, reported net cash inflow from operations for 2017 was £8.0 million (FY2016: £10.8 million).
Underlying cash conversion has improved over 2016 by 6 percentage points. We continue to improve policies and processes to 
further improve the management of working capital. This will become particularly important following the disposal of the 
subscription based Advertising Intelligence business.

1. Bank debt in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2017 is shown net of £0.2 million (31 December 2016: £0.1 million) of loan 
arrangement fees that have been paid and which are amortised over the life of the facility. The bank debt stated above excludes these costs. 
All bank borrowings are held jointly with Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland (‘RBS’). The committed facility, totalling 
£45,000,000, comprises a term loan of £10,000,000 (of which £1,250,000 remains outstanding at 31 December 2017 
(31 December 2016: £3,750,000)), and a revolving credit facility of £35,000,000 (of which £32,000,000 was drawn down at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £29,000,000)).
During the year the Group extended the revolving credit facility through to 30 June 2019, and increased the facility to 
£35,000,000. The term loan remains repayable by 30 June 2018. 
During the period, the Group continued to trade within each of its banking facilities and associated covenants. Net debt to 
EBITDA ratio was 2.10x at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 1.94x).
Statement of financial position and net assets
A summary of the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is set out below:
         31 December 31 December 
         2017 2016 
         £’000 £’000
Goodwill and intangible assets       72,440 72,079
Other non-current assets       3,331 3,776
Net working capital        12,443 10,607
Other current liabilities        (2,014) (1,855)
Other non-current liabilities       (2,288) (2,522)
Deferred consideration        (2,094) (2,015)
Net debt         (28,926) (28,015)
Net assets         52,982 52,055
Net assets as at 31 December 2017 increased by £0.9 million to £53.0 million (2016: £52.1 million) due to an increase in goodwill 
and intangible assets of £0.4 million following the acquisition of Digital Balance and an increase in net working capital of 
£1.8 million resulting from an increase in net trade receivables of £1.7 million. These increases in asset values were offset by an 
increase in net debt of £0.9 million.
Outlook
The actions that have been taken in 2017, has positioned the business for faster revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. With an 
expectation of a turnaround in performance in the US in 2018, together with continued revenue growth outside of the US, 
we remain confident of delivering against the financial goals we set out in the Growth Acceleration Plan.
