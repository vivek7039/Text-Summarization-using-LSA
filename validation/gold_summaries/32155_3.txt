 Good early progress against Burberry’s ambitious plans.
Sir John Peace
Chairman
As Carol Fairweather and John Smith had signalled  
their intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer  
and Chief Operating Officer respectively, focus was  
also on the succession of these roles, with the decision  
to combine them to align with the change programme.
The Board unanimously supported the appointment of 
Marco Gobbetti as Chief Executive Officer who will join  
the Board on 5 July 2017 (with Christopher transitioning  
to his new role at that time), and Julie Brown who joined  
the Board as Chief Operating and Financial Officer on  
18 January 2017. The Board believes that the combination  
of Christopher’s creative talent and vision for Burberry  
and Marco’s extensive skills in luxury and retail, as  
well as Julie’s financial and commercial track record,  
will provide strong leadership for the next phase of 
Burberry’s evolution. 
The Board would like to thank Carol Fairweather for her 
immense contribution to Burberry over the past ten years, 
and John Smith for his contribution to Burberry over the 
past seven years, first as a non-executive director and 
latterly as Chief Operating Officer. We wish them all the 
best for the future.
Financial performance and shareholder returns
As a whole, the luxury sector has continued to remain 
challenging during the year, with some signs of 
improvement during the second half. We have made 
strategic long-term choices to strengthen the brand  
and reposition Burberry for growth over time, and good 
progress with the implementation of our programme 
including the establishment of our five key pillars to 
underpin our growth and productivity agenda. More  
detail on our progress is set out in Christopher’s letter  
and in this Report.
Burberry has delivered 2016/17 revenues of £2.8bn  
(down 2% underlying), and adjusted profit before tax of 
£462m (up £42m and down 21% underlying). This was in 
part impacted by a decrease in licensing profit due to the 
planned expiry of our Japanese licences and other actions 
we have taken to build and reinforce our brand positioning. 
We also delivered the planned £20m of cost savings in  
FY 2017. This is expected to build to c. £50m in FY 2018 
and is on track to deliver the target of at least £100m 
annualised in FY 2019.
Last year I highlighted the fundamental changes taking 
place in the luxury sector and in consumer behaviour. 
These were influenced by a challenging global environment, 
which had impacted the performance of the sector as a 
whole, as demand slowed sharply in many of Burberry’s 
key markets. To stay ahead of these changes and to  
create future value for shareholders, we announced an 
acceleration of our productivity and efficiency agenda, 
particularly looking at our ways of working. We identified 
significant future organic revenue growth opportunities  
and a programme of actions to deliver at least £100m of 
annualised cost savings by FY 2019. 
The Board also considered with Christopher Bailey, the 
shape of the leadership team required to maximise our 
growth opportunities and to successfully implement these 
plans. It was concluded that there was a need for a new 
chief executive with strong luxury retail experience to lead 
on the commercial, operational and financial elements of 
the business, who could partner closely with Christopher, 
who would continue his leadership of the brand and design 
elements of the business as President and Chief Creative 
Officer. Since taking on the combined role of Chief Creative 
and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher has made 
significant progress against a backdrop of challenging 
market conditions. The Board is appreciative of his efforts 
in working with the Board to identify a new chief executive  
to partner with him on the execution of our growth plans.

Strategic Report – Introduction
Chairman’s 
Letter The Group ended the year with a strong cash balance  
of £809m, up £149m year-on-year after £97m of share 
buyback and £164m of dividends. Consequently, the  
Board has recommended a 5% increase in the full year 
dividend to 38.9p, in line with our progressive dividend 
policy resulting in a 50% pay-out ratio based on adjusted 
earnings per share. This reflects the Board’s confidence  
in the future growth of the business.
Our approach to capital allocation is based on a framework 
which defines our priorities for uses of cash, underpinned 
by our principle to maintain a strong balance sheet with 
solid investment grade credit metrics. This underlines our 
commitment to increasing shareholder returns over time, 
which remains a key priority for the Board.
Over the past five years, Burberry has returned around  
£700m to shareholders through dividends, and in April 2017 
completed £100m of a £150m announced share buyback.  
A further share buyback of £300m will be completed  
in FY 2018, in addition to the £50m already announced.  
This is inclusive of the distribution of the Coty upfront sum. 
Other Board developments
The composition of the Board has evolved significantly  
over the past few years with the appointment of four new 
non-executive directors and one longer-serving Board 
member stepping down. Further changes are planned  
over the coming year. The aim is to continue to refresh the 
Board while ensuring stability and continuity, particularly  
in the context of significant management change. 
Following a previous review of the Board Committees, 
changes were implemented during the year. This  
included the appointment of Jeremy Darroch as Chair  
of the Audit Committee and Fabiola Arredondo as Chair  
of the Remuneration Committee, as well as changes to  
the composition of those Committees. 
People and pay
Our new Remuneration Policy will be presented to 
shareholders for their vote at our upcoming Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), and so our Remuneration Committee Chair 
Fabiola Arredondo has been meeting with our shareholders 
and consulting with them on the proposed Policy. You can 
read more about the Policy in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 87 to 111. 
Governance and diversity
The Board seeks to operate to the highest standards  
of corporate governance. The work of the Board and its 
Committees during the year, along with the assessment  
of its performance, is set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 70 to 86. Burberry continues to support 
diversity in all its forms across the organisation including 
the Board. While all Board appointments are made on 
merit, the Board continues to believe in the importance of  
a diverse Board and has always had strong gender diversity 
amongst its membership, including at executive level. The 
Board will continue to monitor diversity, including across 
the business, and to take such steps as it considers 
appropriate to maintain its position as a meritocratic  
and diverse business.
Looking ahead
To conclude, this has been an important year of change  
for Burberry, not only due to macro trends but also the  
way that Burberry operates as a business. Looking ahead 
to 2017/18, we will continue to focus on our brand, our 
products and the execution of our key strategies. Although 
there is still much to be done as Burberry continues its 
multi-year programme, the Board firmly believes that  
the new leadership team coupled with the actions we  
are taking, will significantly enhance our ability to deliver  
long-term sustainable growth. 
Finally, I would like to thank all of our people for their hard 
work and dedication, particularly during this time of change 
for Burberry. I would also like to thank the Board for its hard 
work and commitment to Burberry, and to thank you, our 
shareholders, for your support over the past 12 months.
