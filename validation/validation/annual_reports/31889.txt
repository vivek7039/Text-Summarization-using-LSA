STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Drug development pipeline
Sareum’s pipeline is built on the drug discovery expertise of 
its founders, particularly in the field of cancer. The Company 
operates a collaborative and outsourced business model. 
All our laboratory-based research is carried out in the facilities 
of collaborators or third-party providers. This enables us 
to access drug discovery expertise throughout the world 
with a very flexible cost base.
Sareum focuses on developing new therapies against 
biochemical targets where existing preclinical or early clinical 
data are available. This data can give a strong indication that 
a therapy will disrupt a targeted biochemical process and 
improve patient outcomes without significant side effects. 
Sareum’s approach is lower risk than developing therapies 
against entirely novel targets.
Chk1 kinase – targeting genetically defined solid cancers
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally 
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of 
important cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the DNA 
Damage Response (DDR) network. SRA737 was licensed to Sierra 
Oncology in September 2016 and is in two innovative Phase 1 
clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and tumours with 
genetic mutations that predict sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. 
Tumour cells can have many genetic mutations and several of these 
may result in a strong reliance on Chk1 function for tumour survival. 
By blocking Chk1 function in these cases, the tumour cells die; this 
exemplifies the concept of “synthetic lethality.” 
The clinical studies aim to take advantage of this fundamental 
role of Chk1 in cancer and will enhance patient selection in order 
to maximise responses of SRA737 in: 
• 
 a monotherapy study in genetically defined patients with five 
solid tumour types.
• 
 a combination study with low-dose chemotherapy (gemcitabine) 
in genetically defined patients with two solid tumour types where 
gemcitabine is a standard care.
In addition, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 with preclinical 
studies in combination with targeted cancer therapeutics where 
there is a strong rationale for synergy with Chk1 inhibition. These 
include immuno-oncology approaches (anti-PD-1 and PD-L1) 
and other DDR inhibitors (e.g. PARP inhibitors).

TYK2 kinase – targeting autoimmune diseases 
and cancer
TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family with roles in 
pro-inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases and tumour 
cell proliferation in certain cancers. Members of the JAK family are 
the targets of several marketed and clinical-stage drugs, although 
there are currently no marketed products specifically targeting TYK2.
Sareum has an ongoing co-development agreement with SRI 
International to develop TYK2 inhibitors in autoimmune diseases 
and retains commercialisation rights for these and other TYK2 
inhibitors for oncology and immuno-oncology applications.
Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders
Sareum has shown with several TYK2 inhibitors promising and 
potentially superior therapeutic profiles in disease models of psoriasis, 
RA and ulcerative colitis. Advanced lead molecules have also shown 
promising initial efficacy in lupus models. Candidate selections are 
expected in H1 2018.
Cancers
Several of Sareum’s TYK2 inhibitors have demonstrated good efficacy 
and safety in disease models of T -ALL, both as a single agent and in 
combination with chemotherapy. They also demonstrate good oral 
bioavailability, good biodistribution and tumour reduction of up to 80%.
The Company is investigating its TYK2 inhibitors in several solid 
tumours and blood cancers at leading academic centres worldwide. 
Sareum is also investigating the potential of its TYK2 inhibitors 
to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and is 
evaluating combination opportunities.
Candidate selection for further development in oncology is 
targeted for H1 2018.

Aurora+FLT3 kinases - targeting AML 
and other blood cancers
Sareum has identified candidate molecules with potential to be 
single-agent therapies for AML and other blood cancers. A lead 
candidate is in preclinical development funded by Sareum’s Chinese 
partner, Hebei Medical University Biomedical Engineering Center, and 
these studies suggest good tolerability at the predicted therapeutic 
dose. Preclinical studies are expected to complete in H2 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Sareum made important progress during the year ended 
30 June 2017 across its key development programmes. 
The highlight of the year was the signing of a licence agreement 
for the Chk1 programme with Sierra Oncology, Inc (NASDAQ: 
SRRA). This agreement has brought a highly committed and 
well-funded partner, with proven experience in oncology drug 
development, to realise the value of this exciting programme. 
Already, the impact of Sierra Oncology’s commitment is being 
seen with the implementation of highly innovative clinical trial 
designs. Additionally, clinical opportunities to explore the 
potential of SRA737 with other new classes of targeted cancer 
therapy are expected in 2018.
The agreement with Sierra Oncology represents a significant 
validation of Sareum’s business model, which is based on its 
expertise in small molecule drug design and its strategy to 
develop programmes to late preclinical or early clinical stages. 
Sareum aims to take advantage of the substantial values 
associated with out-licensing programmes at these stages.
The transfer of development costs to Sierra Oncology, alongside 
income from the Chk1 agreement, is enabling Sareum to allocate 
more resources to its other programmes. In particular, the TYK2 
programme has made encouraging progress during the period 
and candidate selection studies for both autoimmune and cancer 
indications are expected to commence in the first half of 2018, 
while the Aurora+FL T3 programme is advancing through preclinical 
development despite some delays.
Financial review
From a financial perspective, continued efficient capital use 
and the receipt of licensing income has resulted in the Company 
achieving a maiden profit of £400k on ordinary activities (after 
taxation) for the year ended 30 June 201 7 (2016: loss of £1.05 million).
The Company ended the year with net assets of £2.34 million 
(2016: £1.86 million), of which £2.31 million comprised cash at 
bank (2016: £1.25 million). The Company received £1.50 million 
from Sierra Oncology as its share of the US$7 million upfront 
payment from the out-licensing agreement for SRA737 and a 
milestone payment of £450k received (share of US$2 million 
payment) following the successful transfer of the two ongoing 
Phase 1 clinical trials of SRA737. 
Chairman’s Statement
Sareum also received £229k in unspent funds previously invested 
in the co-investment partnership with the CRT Pioneer Fund for the 
clinical development of the Chk1 programme during the second 
half of the period. 
Outlook
Overall, the Directors are delighted with the progress 
made across the Company’s programmes during the period. 
Sareum’s business model and its expertise in the design and 
early development of novel drug candidates that offer attractive 
commercialisation opportunities has been strongly validated 
by the licence agreement with Sierra Oncology. 
From a financial perspective, this progress has culminated in 
a maiden profit for the Company. 
More importantly, however, Sareum has gained an experienced, 
highly committed and well-funded development partner for SRA737 
in Sierra Oncology. The next update from the innovative clinical 
development programme with SRA737 that Sierra Oncology is 
driving is expected in February 2018.
The income received to date and the future milestone payments 
possible (pending their achievement) from this programme are 
providing Sareum with increased resources to accelerate its internal 
activities. This includes the selection of clinical candidates in its 
TYK2 programmes in both autoimmune diseases and cancer 
indications, expected in 2018, and further preclinical progress 
anticipated in the Aurora+FLT3 programme. 
The Company continues to engage with potential partners 
with a view to securing commercial licences for its products and 
programmes, while exploring new research programmes from its 
in-house drug discovery platform, as well as external early stage 
opportunities that can be potentially in-licensed and progressed 
into the clinic.
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support and look forward to providing further updates on progress 
in 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 Important clinical progress with 
SRA737, a novel Chk1 kinase inhibitor
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally 
bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of 
important cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the 
DNA Damage Response (DDR) network.
Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 in two 
innovative Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with 
advanced cancer and tumours identified to have 
genetic aberrations (mutations) that are thought 
to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. Sierra 
Oncology amended protocols for both trials to 
take advantage of this fundamental role of Chk1 
in cancer, with the objective of enhancing patient 
selection and maximising potential responses. 
The first trial is intended to evaluate SRA737 
as a monotherapy in patients whose cancer 
has the defined genetic profile described above. 
In June 2017, Sierra Oncology reported that the 
dose escalation phase of the monotherapy trial 
had advanced successfully and that the cohort 
expansion phase, now running at eight UK hospitals, 
is enrolling patients with five cancer types that are 
predicted to be highly sensitive to Chk1 inhibition: 
colorectal, head and neck, non-small-cell lung, 
ovarian and prostate.
The trial aims to identify a dose for Phase 2 studies 
along with preliminary efficacy to determine 
potential patient selection strategies for further 
clinical development.
The combination study is exploring 
the potentiating effects of low-dose 
gemcitabine (a chemotherapy that 
causes replication stress and DNA 
damage) in combination with 
SRA737, also in patients with 
genetically profiled cancers.
The study aims to establish the 
safety profile and identify a dose for 
further development of SRA737 in 
combination with low-dose gemcitabine. 
Once determined, the study will evaluate the 
preliminary efficacy of the SRA737/gemcitabine 
combination in genetically defined subjects with 
bladder or pancreatic cancer.
Sierra Oncology intends to provide an update 
on the SRA737 programme in late February 2018 
and expects to present data at a medical conference 
in H2 2018.
In addition, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 , 
with potential clinical opportunities in 2018, in 
combination with targeted cancer therapeutics 
where there is a strong biological rationale for 
synergy with Chk1 inhibition. These include 
anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies and other 
DDR inhibitors such as PARP inhibitors.

Spotlight on SRA737
SRA737 was discovered as the result of a research collaboration between 
Sareum, the Institute of Cancer Research and Cancer Research 
Technology (CRT). Preclinical and initial clinical development was 
carried out in a co-investment collaboration between Sareum and the 
CRT Pioneer Fund. The programme was licensed for further clinical 
development and commercialisation to Nasdaq-listed Sierra Oncology 
in September 2016 in a deal worth a potential US$328.5 million plus 
royalties, of which Sareum is eligible to receive 27 .5% of the economics.

SRA737 – Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)
Targeting solid tumours, licensed to Sierra Oncology
SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, 
orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key 
regulator of important cell cycle checkpoints and central 
mediator of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. 
SRA737 was discovered as the result of a research collaboration 
between Sareum, the ICR, and CRT. Preclinical and initial 
clinical development was carried out in a co-investment 
collaboration between Sareum and the CRT Pioneer Fund. The 
programme was licensed for further clinical development 
and commercialisation to Sierra Oncology in September 2016.
Sierra Oncology is advancing next-generation DDR therapeutics 
for the treatment of patients with cancer, and SRA737 is its lead 
candidate. This Company has a strong management team with 
a proven track record in oncology drug development and is well 
financed with US$116 million cash as at the end of June 2017. 
Under the terms of the co-investment agreement with the 
CRT Pioneer Fund, Sareum is eligible to receive 27.5% of up to 
US$328.5 million in upfront, development and commercialisation 
milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales. An upfront payment 
of US$7 million and a first milestone payment of US$2 million have 
already been paid by Sierra Oncology (September 2016 and 
January 2017 respectively), with Sareum receiving a total 
of nearly £2 million as its share of this licence income.
By blocking Chk1 function in these cases, the tumour cells die; 
this is an example of the concept known as “synthetic lethality”. 
Sierra Oncology submitted amended protocols for both trials, 
approved in May 201 7 , that aim to take advantage of this fundamental 
role of Chk1 in cancer, with the objective of enhancing patient 
selection and maximising potential responses. These innovative 
trial designs were also presented at the ASCO annual meeting in 
June 2017.
SRA737 is being evaluated by Sierra Oncology in two innovative 
Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and tumours 
identified to have genetic aberrations (mutations) that are thought 
to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. Tumour cells can have 
many genetic mutations and several of these may result in a 
strong reliance on Chk1 function for survival of the tumour.
The first trial is intended to evaluate the potential of SRA737 as 
a monotherapy in patients whose cancer has the defined genetic 
profile described above. In June 201 7 , Sierra Oncology reported that 
the dose escalation phase of the monotherapy trial had advanced 
successfully to beyond 600mg/day dosing (c. 4x the estimated 
minimum efficacious dose of 160mg/day) with a well-tolerated safety 
profile. The cohort expansion phase of this trial, now running at 
eight UK hospitals, is enrolling patients with five cancer types that 
are predicted to be highly sensitive to Chk1 inhibition: colorectal, 
head and neck, non-small-cell lung, ovarian and prostate. The trial 
will assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SRA737 and 
recommend a dose for further (Phase 2) clinical studies. T o determine 
potential patient selection strategies for further clinical development, 
the response of the patients’ cancers to treatment will also be 
measured to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737. 
The second trial is designed to explore the potentiating effects 
of low-dose gemcitabine (a chemotherapy that causes replication 
stress and DNA damage) in combination with SRA737 , also in patients 
with genetically profiled cancers. The chemotherapy combination 
study is initially enrolling patients with the aim to establish the safety 
profile, to determine the MTD and to propose a recommended 
dose for further development of SRA737 in combination with 
low-dose gemcitabine. Once an MTD and dosing schedule have 
been determined, the study will evaluate the preliminary efficacy 
of SRA737 in combination with low-dose gemcitabine in genetically 
defined subjects with bladder or pancreatic cancer.
Sierra Oncology has announced that it will provide an update 
on the SRA737 development programme in late February 2018. 
Sierra Oncology also expects to present data from its studies at 
a medical conference in the second half of 2018.
“ Sierra Oncology is advancing  
next-generation DDR therapeutics for 
the treatment of patients with cancer, 
and SRA737 is its lead candidate.“
We are very pleased with the progress made across our pipeline during the period. The licensing 
of SRA737 is an important milestone for several reasons: it places the clinical development and future 
marketing of this exciting oncology candidate in the hands of a highly experienced and well-funded 
team; the agreement has the potential to provide substantial funds to Sareum, enabling us to 
advance and broaden our own pipeline programmes; and overall it provides important validation 
of our business model and expertise for the design and early development of novel drug candidates 
that offer attractive licensing opportunities for potential partners.
STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6 In addition, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737, with potential 
clinical opportunities in 2018, in combination with targeted cancer 
therapeutics where there is a strong biological rationale for 
synergy with Chk1 inhibition. These include anti-PD- 1 and PD-L1 
therapies, which are fast becoming established as key therapeutic 
options for a range of cancers, and other DDR inhibitors such as 
PARP inhibitors. 
Sierra Oncology reported, in May 2017, the grant of US and EU 
patents, extending the protection of SRA737 in these important 
markets to 2033.
Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)
With Sierra Oncology now funding the development 
of SRA737, Sareum has increased the resources allocated 
to developing its TYK2 programmes in autoimmune diseases 
and cancer.
TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of kinases with 
roles in pro-inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases and 
tumour cell proliferation in certain cancers. Members of the JAK 
family are the targets of several marketed and clinical-stage drugs 
for cancer and autoimmune diseases, although there are currently 
no marketed products specifically targeting TYK2. 
Sareum is developing potent and selective, orally available TYK2 
inhibitors with potential best-in-class profiles that have shown 
initial proof of concept in in vivo models of:
• 
Psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis; and
• 
T -cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (T -ALL). 
Sareum has an ongoing co-development agreement with SRI 
International (Menlo Park, CA, USA) to develop TYK2 inhibitors 
in autoimmune diseases and retains commercialisation rights 
for these and other TYK2 inhibitors with profiles optimised for 
oncology and immuno-oncology applications.
Targeting autoimmune and inflammatory disorders
Sareum has conducted preclinical studies with several of its TYK2 
inhibitors, which have demonstrated promising and potentially 
superior therapeutic profiles in disease models of psoriasis, 
rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, compared with a 
marketed JAK family kinase inhibitor in the latter two cases.
These data have led the Company’s partner, SRI International, to 
investigate advanced lead molecules in disease models of lupus, 
and promising initial efficacy has been observed. These studies 
are supported by a US government research grant (US 
Department of Defense) of US$360k. 
New analogues, with improved selectivity and ADMET  
(ADME- Tox, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) 
properties, continue to progress through internal screening 
cascades. Disease model studies with these compounds are 
planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 . If these disease model 
studies are successful, the Company expects to move into the 
candidate selection phase in the first half of 2018.
Targeting cancers
Initial studies, assisted by funding from the Innovate UK Biomedical 
Catalyst Fund, to investigate the potential of Sareum’s lead TYK2 
inhibitors to treat T -ALL have concluded successfully. The study 
demonstrated good efficacy of several Sareum TYK2 inhibitors in 
disease models of T -ALL, both as a single agent and in combination 
with standard-of-care chemotherapy. In disease models, Sareum’s 
compounds demonstrate good oral bioavailability, were well 
tolerated, presented good exposure to plasma and tumour tissue, 
and showed a dose-dependent effect on a biomarker of TYK2 
inhibition and tumour reduction of up to 80%.
These data were presented by Sareum in November 2016 at 
the American Association for Cancer Research – National Cancer 
Institute – European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (AACR-NCI-EORTC) international conference and 
updated results were presented by the Company at the International 
Cancer Cluster Showcase in June 2017.
The Company is also investigating the potential of its TYK2 inhibitors 
in solid tumours and blood cancers where there is strong evidence 
in the literature that TYK2 inhibition could be effective, both as a 
single agent and in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. 
Several of these studies are being carried out in leading academic 
centres worldwide under material transfer agreements. 
Furthermore, Sareum is investigating the potential of its TYK2 
inhibitors to overcome tumour resistance to new immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapies. Initial results are promising, and additional 
experiments are in progress seeking to identify which tumour 
types and immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations might be 
expected to benefit most from TYK2 inhibition.
The Company expects to select a candidate for further development 
in the oncology field in the first half of 2018, pending the success 
of ongoing studies in any one of these cancer applications.
Aurora+FL T3 kinases
Targeting AML and other blood cancers
Sareum’s third programme is focused on small molecule 
inhibitors of Aurora and FLT3 kinases that it has identified 
as having potential to be single agent therapies for acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) and other leukaemias. A lead 
candidate is in preclinical development, funded by Sareum’s 
Chinese partner, HMUBEC.
Previous studies have confirmed the potential of this candidate 
in AML, and particularly FLT3-mutant AML. Toxicology studies are 
underway, with initial results suggesting that the candidate is well 
tolerated at the predicted therapeutic dose. Further formulation 
work, which is causing additional delays, is ongoing to complete 
the toxicology studies, with Sareum funding some studies in the 
UK to accelerate the resolution of these formulation issues.
The Company is now targeting completion of the preclinical 
studies in the second half of 2018.
Separately during the period, the Company’s intellectual property 
around its Aurora+FLT3 kinase programme was strengthened by 
notifications of patents granted in China, Hong Kong, Singapore 
and Japan. Sareum now has patent protection in all the major 
territories for this programme.
Overall, we are delighted with the progress made across our 
business and pipeline and look forward to further important 
newsflow in the coming year.

Co-development collaborations
Sareum’s co-development 
collaborations with world-class 
research institutes provide access 
to expertise and the ability to progress 
several programmes simultaneously 
whilst reducing research costs. 
Typically, Sareum offsets a share 
of future licence income and ongoing 
royalties in exchange for research 
funding, use of facilities and access 
to expertise.
Outsourced research model 
Sareum operates an outsourced 
research model. Its laboratory-based 
research is undertaken via a worldwide 
network of collaborators and research 
providers. This reduces the high capital 
cost of running in-house laboratories, 
minimises ongoing development risks 
and provides access to best-in-class 
expertise for its programmes.
Drug development expertise
Sareum generates value by 
developing a strong pipeline 
of candidate drugs. To date this 
has been done through its drug 
discovery platform, SKIL
®
 (Sareum 
Kinase Inhibitor Library), where new 
compounds targeting cancer and 
autoimmune diseases are identified.
Preclinical 
development
Safety toxicology, 
formulation and quality 
control studies are 
performed in the 
laboratories of CROs. 
The data arising, 
coupled with patent 
filings protecting our 
intellectual property, 
form the basis of the 
information package 
provided to potential 
licensees. This work 
could be performed as 
part of a co-development 
agreement with a 
collaboration partner.
Early clinical 
development
Our research builds 
value by progressing 
our drug candidates 
through early clinical 
development with the 
intention of licensing 
to companies expert 
in late-stage clinical 
development, registration 
and marketing of drugs. 
Again, this work could 
be performed as part 
of a co-development 
agreement with a 
collaboration partner.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8 Sareum’s strategy is to develop programmes to late preclinical 
or early clinical stages to take advantage of the higher asset 
values associated with licensing programmes at these stages.
Our Strategy
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Directors use the following KPIs as a measure of the Group’s performance:
Research and development
Sareum undertakes research 
and development on its cancer 
and autoimmune disease programmes. 
The investment in R&D in 2017 showed 
a modest increase over the prior year, 
in line with management expectations.
£1.0 million 2017
£0.93 million 2016
£1.0 million
The Company’s management aims to 
minimise Group overheads through a 
low cost base and a lean operating model. 
This year, the Group reported a maiden 
profit following successful licensing of the 
Chk1 project to Sierra Oncology by our 
co-development partner, the CRT 
Pioneer Fund.
Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities
2017
£0.40 million
Cash at bank
Sareum requires cash for working capital 
purposes and to advance its development 
programmes. The Company’s low cost 
base ensures that funds are used in the 
most efficient way possible. The increase 
in cash is primarily the result of the upfront 
and first milestone payments received and 
the return of unspent co-investment funds 
following licensing of the Chk1 programme.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 9 Risk Description Mitigation Risk change
Financial
The principal financial risks are 
the ability to raise sufficient funds 
to support the Company through to 
profitability and failure to secure 
licensing agreements.
The Company’s low cost base ensures 
that funds are used in the most efficient 
way. Sareum has historically raised the 
majority of its funds from investors via 
licensed brokers and this continues to 
be an option. The Chk1 licence deal 
demonstrates the ability for licence 
deals to be achieved.
Decreased risk
Research and 
development
There are a number of risks in developing 
drug candidates due to a long and complex 
development process. Any programme 
must undergo extensive research to get 
to preclinical or clinical stage. This process 
takes several years and is very costly. 
R&D programmes can fail at any point.
We undertake extensive early research and 
create a dossier of information that enables 
us and our advisers to evaluate the potential 
of a candidate before we seek to progress 
to preclinical or clinical phases.
We also seek collaboration partners whose 
own due diligence reaffirms our assessment 
of a candidate’s potential.
No change
Intellectual 
property
Our ability to stop others exploiting 
our intellectual property, without first 
obtaining a licence, is critical to our long 
term success. Therefore, we file patent 
applications in the patent offices of the 
major commercial territories. To obtain 
patent protection, our inventions must 
be considered novel, inventive and useful. 
However, some, or all, of the patent 
offices may reject or seek to modify 
our patent applications.
Intellectual property protection 
is fundamental to our strategy of 
developing novel drug candidates 
and underpins our R&D programmes 
and we invest appropriately in this area. 
We are exploiting our SKIL platform, 
which already has a strong patent position 
through a number of granted and pending 
applications. IP considerations form a 
crucial part of due diligence when we are 
assessing in-licensing opportunities.
Decreased risk
Collaboration
Working with third parties carries a risk 
of loss of control on progress and can lead 
to research delays. This can increase 
Sareum’s own financial commitment as 
a result of continued spend on fixed costs 
during a delay and potential additional 
financial contributions required in order 
to progress a programme.
We work closely with our partners 
to anticipate and plan around any likely 
delays. Collaboration contracts clearly 
outline responsibilities and key milestones 
as well as cost, licensing and revenue sharing.
No change
Competition
There always remains the possibility 
that a similar drug is being developed 
by a competitor that demonstrates 
greater efficacy or a better safety profile. 
Alternatively, a similar drug in development 
may conclude a licensing deal or reach 
a later stage of development before we 
are able to, thus reducing the likelihood of 
Sareum securing a licensing agreement.
The management and advisory boards 
gather as much information as possible 
on competitive products and programmes. 
Progress and key milestones are monitored 
to understand how these may affect our own 
programmes. Sareum also pursues more 
than one development programme in order 
to mitigate the overall risk to the Company.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12
The Directors present the Strategic report of the Company 
and the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Company in the year under review 
were those of a holding company. The principal activity of the Group 
is the discovery and development of new therapeutic drugs by a 
combination of skills in biology, computational chemistry and 
medicinal chemistry.
Review of business
The profit for the year was £400,343 and at 30 June 2017 cash 
and cash equivalents amounted to £2,305,509.
Throughout the period under review, the Group continued 
to develop its drug discovery programmes using outsourced 
biology and chemistry resources as well as exploring commercial 
opportunities with potential partners. In the future, the Group 
will continue to build value from its in-house research and 
development by seeking to advance and commercialise its 
drug discovery programmes.
On 27 September 2016 the Group announced that its co-investment 
partner, the CRT Pioneer Fund, had licensed the rights to the Chk1 
project to Sierra Oncology, Inc.(previously named ProNAi 
Therapeutics, Inc.) Under the terms of the agreement, an immediate 
upfront payment of US$7 .0 million was received by the co-investment 
partner and an additional fee of US$2.0 million was received 
following the successful transfer of the two ongoing Phase 1 clinical 
trials to Sierra. Additional payments of up to US$319.5 million may 
become payable upon achievement of certain milestones and 
Sierra will pay royalties on the net sales of any product successfully 
developed. Sareum is entitled to receive 27 .5% of these payments 
and has also received a refund amounting to £228,976 in respect 
of unspent investment funds.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks facing the Group are the following:
• 
 the drug discovery programmes undertaken may fail due 
to fundamental scientific uncertainty;
• 
 the Group may not complete sufficient commercial 
partnerships to create a sustainable business; and
• 
 it may not be possible to raise sufficient funding to support 
the Company through to sustained profitability.
The Directors acknowledge that there is uncertainty concerning 
the outcome of the UK’s negotiations to exit the EU but do not 
currently consider that this represents a significant risk to the 
Group’s prospects.
The Directors address these uncertainties by reviewing reports 
on scientific progress, business development and financial status 
at the monthly Board meetings and implementing alternative 
plans to reduce the risks if these are considered necessary.
Key performance indicators
The Directors consider cash and spending on research and 
development to be the Group’s key performance indicators. 
A budget is approved by the Board at the beginning of each 
financial year and performance is regularly monitored against 
budget with significant variances investigated.
Future outlook
The Group will continue to develop its oncology programmes 
and, in particular, the Aurora+FLT3 project will be advanced 
through preclinical development into Phase 1 clinical trials. 
The TYK2 inhibitor, targeting autoimmune diseases, will also 
be progressed in conjunction with SRI International and the use 
of the Company’s TYK2 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics will be 
developed. Commercially, significant licensing deals will be sought 
to realise the high value inherent in the Company’s technology.

Financial instruments
Details regarding the Group’s use of financial instruments and 
their associated risks are given in note 16 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Group Strategic 
report, the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
• 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• 
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
• 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and 
the Group’s transactions, disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Financial statements are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
(as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware, and each Director has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Group’s auditor is aware of that information.

Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14
Introduction
Sareum Holdings plc was listed on AIM on 11 October 2004. 
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply 
with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code), 
the Company fully supports the principles set out in the Code 
and will attempt to comply wherever possible, given the resources 
available to the Company. Details are provided below of how the 
Company applies the Code.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises two Executive Directors 
and one independent Non-executive Director, the Chairman.
The Board generally meets monthly and receives reports covering 
finance, compliance, business development, safety, operations and 
science together with any other material deemed necessary for 
the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility to 
review and approve the Group’s strategy, budgets, staff recruitment, 
major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
Under the Articles of Association, all Directors must offer 
themselves for re-election at least once every three years. 
One third of the Directors retire by rotation at every AGM 
and are eligible for re-appointment.
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee with written terms of delegated responsibilities. The terms 
of reference are as close to the model terms of the Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators as is possible for a Board 
with one independent Non-executive Director. The terms of 
reference of the Committees are published on the Company’s 
website: www.sareum.com.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises Dr Stephen Parker, 
Non-executive Chairman, and Dr Tim Mitchell, CEO. It is scheduled 
to meet twice a year. It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide 
formal and transparent arrangements covering the financial 
reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst 
maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent 
auditor of the Group.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises Dr Stephen Parker , 
Non-executive Chairman. It meets at least once a year. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent 
policy on executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages 
for individual Directors. The Committee also ensures that 
recommendations made by the Executive Directors on staff 
remuneration are appropriate and fair from a shareholder’s 
perspective. Further information on the work of the Committee 
can be found on page 15.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts 
as appropriate and uses the AGM to encourage communication with 
shareholders. In addition, the Company issues the Annual Report 
and Accounts, Interim Statement and press releases as well as 
using its website (www.sareum.com) to provide further information 
to shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the systems of internal control and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. The internal controls are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate risk and provide reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems 
annually. This it does primarily by discussions with the external 
auditor and by considering the risks potentially affecting the Group.
The Group does not have an internal audit function since the 
administrative function is very small. Instead there is a detailed 
Director review and authorisation of transactions. The annual 
audit by the Group’s auditor, which tests a sample of transactions, 
did not highlight any significant system improvements in order 
to reduce risks.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year 
and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, 
compared with the budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly 
basis and discussed in detail.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect 
of actions taken against the Executive Directors because of their 
roles, as well as against material loss or claims against the Group. 
The insured values and types of cover are comprehensively 
reviewed on a periodic basis.
Corporate social responsibility
Sareum is a small, motivated team of professional people, which 
operates to high standards. These standards include a commitment 
to best practice in meeting the Company’s social responsibilities.
Health and safety
The Company is proactive in considering the safety of staff, visitors 
and the public. It had no notifiable safety incidents during the year 
and no working days were lost due to accidents.
Employees
Sareum is committed to a policy of equal opportunities in the 
recruitment, engagement and treatment of its staff.
Environment
Sareum disposes of its waste products using reputable agents. 
The Company’s landlord provides these agents to enable it to 
recycle its waste as appropriate.
Corporate Governance Report Sareum Holdings plc

GOVERNANCE
Introduction
The Company recognises the value of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance issued by the London Stock Exchange. 
It seeks to comply with the Combined Code so far as is practicable 
and appropriate for a public company of its size and nature. The 
Company also seeks to follow the Guidance for Smaller Quoted 
Companies on the Combined Code issued by the Quoted Companies 
Alliance in August 2004. Companies trading on AIM are not required 
to provide a formal remuneration report. However, in line with current 
best practice, this report provides information to enable a greater 
level of understanding as to how remuneration is determined by 
the Board.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for 
considering staff and Directors’ remuneration packages and makes 
its recommendations to the Board. The Committee currently 
comprises Dr Stephen Parker, Non-executive Chairman. It meets 
at least once a year to review salaries and share option schemes 
for the Directors.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to 
reward above average performance. At present, Executive Directors 
receive salary, death-in-service benefit, critical illness and medical 
cover and a pension contribution.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
The two full-time Executive Directors have executive service 
agreements with the Company dated 7 July 2004. The service 
agreements are subject to termination upon six months’ notice 
being given by either party and are subject to standard terms 
in the event of termination.
For the year from 1 July 2016 a Directors’ bonus scheme was, 
in effect, to reward the Directors based on performance targets 
that build shareholder value.
Pensions
The Group does not have a pension scheme but makes contributions 
to Executive Directors’ personal pension schemes amounting 
to 6.375% of annual salary. In addition, the Executive Directors 
contribute to their pension schemes via salary sacrifice, and the 
National Insurance savings made by the Group as a result of this 
arrangement are added to the Group’s contributions.
Share option schemes
In setting up share option schemes for staff, the Committee took 
into account the recommendations of shareholder bodies, such 
as those of the insurance companies, on the number of options 
to issue and the criteria for vesting. It approved the following 
share incentive arrangements for staff:
• 
 an Inland Revenue approved (EMI) share option scheme 
(approved scheme); and 
• 
 an unapproved share option scheme (unapproved scheme), 
identical to the approved scheme but for part-time staff who 
do not fulfil the EMI employment criteria.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Chairman entered into a letter of engagement 
dated 13 May 2016. Members may request copies of the letter by 
sending a stamped addressed envelope to the Company Secretary. 
The appointment can be terminated by either party giving 
six months’ notice.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Report of the Independent Auditor
to the Members of Sareum Holdings plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Sareum Holdings plc 
(the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) for the year 
ended 30 June 2017, which comprise the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated and Company Balance 
Sheets, Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity, 
Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements and related notes 
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent 
Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in a Report of the Auditor and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
In our opinion:
 •
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 •
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 •
 the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
 •
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. 
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: 
 •
 the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 •
 the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements 
any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial statements are authorised 
for issue. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Management override of controls
Journals can be posted that significantly alter 
the financial statements.
We examined journals posted around the year end, 
specifically focusing on areas which are more easily 
manipulated such as accruals, prepayments, bank 
reconciliations and tax.
Going concern
There is a risk that the Company may hold insufficient cash 
to allow it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, 
thus giving rise to a going concern risk.
Existing cash reserves have been evidenced and future cash 
flow forecasts have been reviewed to ensure sufficient 
cash headroom exists for a period extending beyond one year 
from the date of approving these financial statements.
Fraud in revenue recognition
There is a risk that revenue is materially understated  
due to fraud.
Income was tested in full from third-party sources 
and we concluded that no evidence of fraud or other 
understatement was identified.
Accounting estimates
Potential risk of inappropriate accounting estimates 
giving rise to misstatement in the accounts.
Accruals were agreed to expected costs and supporting 
documentation, and other areas were examined to identify 
any potential accounting estimates.
Risk of material misstatement within related party transactions
There is the risk that related party transactions are
potentially incomplete or materially misstated.
Correspondence, including Board minutes and accounting 
records were reviewed for evidence of material related party 
transactions and it is considered that all relevant items have 
been disclosed. Sareum Holdings plc

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Disclosures
There is a risk of incorrect or incomplete
disclosures in the financial statements.
The financial statements have been reviewed and checks have 
been undertaken to ensure all material disclosure requirements 
have been met.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed 
in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, 
and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. 
Our opinion on the Financial Statements is not modified with 
respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express 
an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning and in the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determine materiality for the Group to be £45,372 and this 
financial benchmark, which has been used throughout the audit, 
was determined by way of a standard formula being applied to key 
financial results and balances presented in the Financial Statements. 
Where considered relevant, the materiality is adjusted to suit the 
specific area risk profile of the Group.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information in the Group Strategic Report 
and the Report of the Directors, but does not include the financial 
statements and our Report of the Auditor thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on 
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 
that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 •
 the information given in the Group Strategic Report 
and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
 •
 the Group Strategic Report and the Report of the 
Directors have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the 
Group Strategic Report or the Report of the Directors.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
 •
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 •
 the Parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 •
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
 •
 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 13, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
a Report of the Auditor that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our Report of the Auditor.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the Year Ended 30 June 2017
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Sareum Holdings plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted for use in the European Union, with IFRIC interpretations and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention.
IFRS comprise standards and interpretations approved by the IASB. IFRS as adopted by the European Union differ in certain respects 
from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, consolidated financial statements for the financial years presented would be no different 
had IFRS as issued by the IASB been applied. References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union.
Going concern
The Directors estimate that the cash held by the Group will be sufficient to support the current level of activities for the foreseeable 
future. Therefore the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of another entity or business, so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The consolidated financial statements present the 
results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. Inter-company transactions and balances 
between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
2. Statutory information
Sareum Holdings plc is a public limited company, registered in England and Wales. The Company’s registered number and registered 
office address can be found on the Directors and Company Information page. 
3. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied are set out below.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life: 
Motor vehicles  – straight line over three years
Fixtures and computers –  straight line over three or four years 
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial 
assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of change in value.
Taxation
Current taxes are based on the results shown in the financial statements and are calculated according to local tax rules, using tax rates 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more 
tax, with the following exception:
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred. 
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged 
against profits on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Pension contributions
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the benefit of its employees but instead makes contributions to their personal 
pension policies. The contributions due for the period are charged to the profit and loss account. Sareum Holdings plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 25
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3. Accounting policies continued
Employee share scheme
The Group has in place a share option scheme for employees, which allows them to acquire shares in the Company. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an expense 
spread over the estimated vesting period of the options granted. Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT 
and other sales-related taxes and is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction 
will flow to the Company. Grant income is recognised as earned based on contractual conditions, generally as expenses are incurred.
Investment in Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Investments in associates are accounted 
for using the equity method, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change 
in the associate’s net assets with recognition in the profit and loss of the share of the associate’s profit or loss.
Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgement
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates 
and assumptions that have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial information 
are considered to be research and development costs and equity-settled share-based payments.
Accounting standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations relevant to the Group that have 
not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
Standard
Effective for 
accounting periods
starting on or after
IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses–Amendments to IAS 12 1 January 2017
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2017
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future years will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group.
No standards or interpretations adopted in the year had any material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

8. Loss of parent company
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the statement of comprehensive income of the parent company is not 
presented as part of these financial statements. The parent company’s loss for the financial year was £81,736 (2016: £1,048,491). 
The loss represents costs of £148,365 (2016: £128,244) associated with the Company’s obligations to maintain its AIM listing and the 
share-based compensation adjustment of £81,736 (2016: £5,195) offset by a reduction in provision of £148,365 (2016: increased provision 
£915,052) for impairment of amounts owed by Group undertakings.
9. Earnings/(loss) per share
The calculation of profit/(loss) per share is based on the following data:
Basic profit/(loss) per share:
2017 2016
Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities after tax £400,343 £(1,048,118)
Weighted average number of shares 2,645,223,988 2,524,944,713
Basic profit/(loss) per share 0.015p (0.04)p
Diluted profit per share:
2017
Profit on ordinary activities after tax £400,345
Weighted average number of shares and share options 2,741,309,965
Basic profit per share 0.015p
As the Group generated a loss for the year to 30 June 2016, there was no dilutive effect in respect of share options.

16. Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments are trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and cash. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to finance the Group’s ongoing operational requirements. The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments.
The major financial risks faced by the Group, which remained unchanged throughout the year, are interest rate risk, foreign exchange 
risk and liquidity risk.
Policies for the management of these risks are shown below and have been consistently applied.
Market risks
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as cash balances in excess of immediate needs are placed on short term deposit. The Group 
seeks to optimise the interest rates received by continuously monitoring those available.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
The Group’s activities expose it to fluctuations in the exchange rate for the Euro and the US dollar.
Funds are maintained in Sterling and foreign currency is acquired on the basis of committed expenditure.
The value of the Group’s financial instruments is not considered to be materially sensitive to the above risks and therefore no sensitivity 
analysis has been provided.
Non-market risks
LIQUIDITY RISK
The Board has responsibility for reducing exposure to liquidity risk and ensures that adequate funds are available to meet anticipated 
requirements from existing operations by a process of continual monitoring. Sareum Holdings plc

The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group and its subsidiary company will be able to continue as going concerns.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity, comprising issued share capital and reserves as disclosed in notes 17 and 18, and 
cash and cash equivalents.
27. Deferred tax
No provision has been made in the Group’s accounts and the amounts not provided for at the end of the year are as follows:

Tax losses available (1,106,170) (1,273,099)

A potential deferred tax asset of £1,107,624 has not been recognised, as there remains a significant degree of uncertainty that the 
Group will make sufficient profits in the foreseeable future to justify recognition. The deferred tax asset would be recognised should 
sufficient profits be generated in the future against which it may be recovered.  Sareum Holdings plc
